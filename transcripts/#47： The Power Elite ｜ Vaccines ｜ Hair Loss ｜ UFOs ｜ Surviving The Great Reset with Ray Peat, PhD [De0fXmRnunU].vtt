 Ray Peat, Georgie Dinkov, how are you guys? Ray, how are you?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 First of all.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 And Georgie Dinkov?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Not bad, you know, surrounded by more National Guards than I've ever seen in my life, but things are still, I guess, under control.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 No civil war yet.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Yeah, what are there, 25,000 troops in DC right now? Is that, it's more than that, right?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 That's just the National Guard. There's like, I mean, the place is teeming with like, I would say civilian and undercover cops or like all kinds of, you know, state police.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I don't even know what agency they belong to, but it's pretty obvious there's some kind of a law enforcement because they have guns and, you know, the first sign of commotion because the protests are continuing even after Biden got installed.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 But you can see these people are police because they have guns and, you know, as soon as something happens, they pull out their badges.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So there's more, there's more law enforcement on the street than there's people at this point.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 I'm sure we'll get into that more, but Ray, you know, we haven't chatted in about a month or so.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Where is the most important place to start, do you think? What's the most critical information to chat about?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 That nothing new has indicated that there's a pandemic or epidemic at all.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 I was going to say, have you seen the news of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines? How many people started suddenly dying in Norway and in Israel?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And basically the effectiveness that they claim is there now, apparently it's not. Twelve thousand people in Israel immediately got infected after getting vaccinated.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And in one county of New York, which had been free of the so-called virus for a whole month, I think it was on the 22nd of December, vaccination started in one nursing home.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 They vaccinated 198 old people and in, I think it was only about two weeks, 23 or 24 of those had died.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 That is a huge statistical indication that the nursing home people said, well, they had a local epidemic of the virus that happened to kill only the vaccinated people.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Do you think they're dying from the lipid adjuvant or they're dying from the actual mRNA operating system?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 I think it's the adjuvant and no one is talking about that. I think they falsely labeled it as a carrier for the RNA when those same things have been sold for years as adjuvants.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 So the RNA aspect of the vaccine is less dangerous than the polyethylene glycol lipid adjuvant?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 I would guess so.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 That's pretty wild.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 But for a long range possibility of having the RNA for making the spike protein, which creates inflammation, if we become permanent factories for inflammation proteins, that isn't a good thing.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Did you see the news about the Australian vaccine? I mean, it's already been terminated, but it contains a portion of the HIV virus.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And as soon as they started giving it to people, people started testing HIV positive.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 So they freaked out. They shut down the vaccine. They said, don't worry, it's not causing HIV infection.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 But I thought maybe they're concerned that, okay, so you have only two choices. Either the vaccine causes HIV infection or the tests that are detecting HIV positive people are useless.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Because what about all these other people that were detected HIV positive that didn't get the vaccine? So which one should we pick?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 Yeah, it's nice that there are frauds being put to the test.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And now Lynn Wood, this lawyer here in the United States is saying that apparently some of his friends that got vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, which shouldn't contain any HIV particles, are also testing HIV positive.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Do you think that maybe because of the mRNA somehow activating our internal retroviral, and that's what's causing the positive tests?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And remember, what's his name, the French Nobel Prize winner?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Paul Montagnier.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Yeah. He claimed that he identified some HIV in the stretch of RNA that's used.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 So basically, any mRNA vaccine that includes mRNA from the coronavirus, at least this one, it has a chance of triggering an HIV positive test or even worse, basically a chronic HIV infection.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Yeah. I agree with Peter Duisburg, though, that there has never been any evidence that such a virus causes the AIDS condition.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Right. But in any case, it's probably not a positive sign that the retroviral is activated by this vaccine.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Yeah. What will activate a positive test might only take a stretch of two or three nucleotides to be indicating a similarity to the HIV virus.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 For the PCR test, if its sensitivity is cranked up all the way to the max, I think right now they're using 40 cycles or something like that for the coronavirus.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 If you crank it up even more, can you come up with basically positive tests for pretty much any virus?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Because they're so similar. I mean, there's probably an overlap of at least 10% across all viruses, isn't there?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Yeah. I think they ordered people to test all across the country using that many turns of the cycle because they knew it would create supposed evidence of a big epidemic.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 But I'm sure that if they can get a large number of people vaccinated, then they're going to change the instruction, go back to actually measuring something rather than producing false positives for it.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 And then use that to claim that the virus eliminated the epidemic.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Probably one of the darkest things I've read, I don't know if we've talked about it on the show before, but the idea that if you deny a vaccine, you don't want to be a guinea pig for an eight-month experimental new technology vaccine, you'll be labeled as a public health threat or a domestic terrorist.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 You're a contagion. And there's news trickling out. I'm sure you saw it, Ray. There's some paper in New York about being held against your will in a COVID camp.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 So pretty depressing, but you think that will be part of this whole thing is taking people and gathering them together that refuse to get vaccinated?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 They're already doing something like that, having the communication websites censor, prevent those people from posting.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Oh, people in the camps can't post?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 No, I mean, the general public is being designated effectively a domestic terrorist if they want to post dissenting information. And that was one of Biden's proposals to have a new category of domestic terrorism.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 So the government could enforce all of the internet to identify these domestic terrorists and keep them from posting anywhere.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 We don't have to dwell on it too much, but what is your rundown of the Trump situation of Biden? I'm sure you're aware of QAnon and them being some kind of, I don't know, people suspect it was a psychological operation, possibly from Israel or something.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 But what is your, do you think at this point, the Capitol stuff, was Trump in on it? Was he not who he said he was? Or was he just opposing a power elite that was in complete control?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Yeah, he had the good points, but sometimes he got carried away. And I think QAnon might need a psychological operation himself.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 When you first got whiff of that, did you smell fraud?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Yeah, or lack of a sense of reality, basic cultism and lack of critical thinking.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 There's some guy named Ward, I forget his name, people are swallowing the strange things that he says. Two or three days later, they haven't happened. And he comes up with a new explanation.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 And they keep swallowing it time after time as if their memory lasts only two days.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 On YouTube, I followed several channels that really detailed Zionist activities and they were being obliterated off YouTube. And those QAnon channels were getting hundreds of thousands of views and they weren't being censored at all.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 And so of course now that has changed a little bit, but it definitely seemed like they wanted people to get into that.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 So some people were speculating, was that whole ruse to fulfill the prophecy of white, nationalist, Christian, domestic terrorists now?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Because there's Whitney Webb and other people have been getting sound clips, I forgot the woman's name, but basically saying that this whole phase of whatever is happening right now is going to be turned on domestic terrorists, similar to what we did to Al-Qaeda or whatever.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Yeah, and promoting the crazies on the other side is going to give more backing to the dissenters.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 The crazy supporters of authoritarianism are being supported by the official government side, where the dissenters are the ones who will be susceptible to incarceration for their belief.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 Yeah, and Whitney also pointed out that they're trying to group Jeffrey Epstein, people that are interested in that with QAnon and Sandy Hook and 9/11.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 So they're trying to group all these things together. And so to an average person, they hear any of these words and they immediately dismiss it because they've had such a bad taste in their mouth from the constant press of QAnon, which has been so popularized over the mainstream news channels.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 George, do you have any questions? I was going to try to go as back as far as possible, and we can talk about this and everything else, and then we can get into user questions, right?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 But my main question was, does this go back to the 200 years ago Battle of Waterloo and how the Rothschilds formed their fortune and then the industrialists, the Rockefellers, and things like that? Is that an effective way of understanding how we arrived here?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 I think so. One strand of culture is coming out in insane ways. In the last several years of getting emails on the internet, I've had only maybe half a dozen really insane-sounding people.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 But just in the last week, I've had more letters like that than all 20 years that I've used the internet.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 I've had people saying that numerology, blaming numerology on the Jesuits, even though it originated in the Old Testament with "In the beginning there was the Word, and the Word was with God."

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 But the Jewish Kabbalah in particular promoted and amplified this essentialist idea that God spoke Hebrew,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 and that every letter and word of Hebrew is a coded message from God.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 People like Noam Chomsky studied the Kabbalah as a kid, and that says that you can assert anything that numerology confirms, and you don't need any real-world evidence,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 because at least the Hebrew word is with God and defines reality.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Chomsky used it to bypass the people who wanted to explain language as a matter of the brain dealing with the world.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 He said, "No, you don't need any evidence at all."

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 The way you get that scientific view of language is to treat the person and the brain as an absolute black box.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Don't try to look for any information coming from the people who use language and experience it constantly,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 because the only thing that counts is this word-derived reality.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 So if you don't have words, you can't think. For example, he was saying that his dogs, and I think he called them canines,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 don't understand what I'm saying because they have no words. They can't understand anything.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 But then he explained that he used the word canine because if he spoke the word dog,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 they would make the wrong conclusion that one wanted to do something with them.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 So he demonstrated that they are thinking and would draw a mistaken conclusion if he suddenly started using the word dog.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 But then he denied that thought is possible without words and that since thought defines mental being,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 basically humans are the only ones that count because if they work at it, they can identify the numbers that define the essences of reality.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 So there is a deep scientific heresy cutting out empiricism.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 This is the greatest danger happening now. Everyone is being discouraged from looking for evidence.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 That forces you to rely on the experts and whoever is running the cult of the time.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Wasn't there a campaign of mass sterilizations in the US for people who were deaf and couldn't speak?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 So the assumption was that these people were mentally retarded and that's why they sterilized them so they couldn't reproduce?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Yes. I had a professor who said you don't have to worry about anesthesia when you're operating on an animal that's screaming.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 It isn't words. It can't say stop cutting and murdering me. So nothing is happening.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 So maybe they should try plugging that professor's mouth and operate on him and if he can't say stop, then he's not feeling pain either.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 I was a psychology major for a year.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 One of my professors, a young and progressive one, said that babies' brains aren't mature until they're about a year and a half old.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 So they can't speak or feel pain, therefore you don't need anesthesia if you circumcise them.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Far beyond that, circumcision has been practiced without anesthetic.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Were you saying that the Rothschilds were motivated by the Kabbalah? I'm kind of an intro to all of this stuff.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 So the Talmud and the Kabbalah, those are two different books and they're both intertwined with their mindset?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Yeah.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 But the Kabbalah is more of an esoteric type of thing or no?

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 It has penetrated far beyond the extreme rabbinic tradition.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 I think the Talmud actually contains these stories that indicate that the extremely religious Orthodox Jews are actually polytheistic.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 If you're a known Jewish person, you're not supposed to know about this and if you ask, they're allowed to lie.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 At least that's what I've heard.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 I've read some commentary on the Talmud and it seems to indicate that it's a description of a polytheistic religion, which of course Zionist people don't want to talk about because officially at least, Judaism is a monotheistic religion, worshipping Yahweh.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Something I didn't realize is that Rothschild wealth is like two centuries older than the Rockefellers. So in that case, were the Rockefellers more of agents of the Rothschilds or did they work together and they wanted to do something similar of taking over the world?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 I don't know how much of a mental overlap there was at the time that they got in cahoots,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 but I think the Jewish influence tends to permeate other organizations.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Yeah, I think basically they're accurate representations of intentions.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 This is on Wikipedia so it doesn't really mean anything, but Ford seemed to be not into the Rothschild thing.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 So these 1900s industrialists, like robber barons, was there some distaste for the Zionist approach or no?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Yeah, I think essentialism is what they all develop in context and then reinforce each other's tendency in that direction.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 And what is essentialism?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 It's the idea that you don't need empirical evidence to develop true knowledge of the world, exactly what Chomsky did with the brain, treating it as a black box.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 They, for example, treat the history of an atom as not existing.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 This essence of what an atom is applies for all time, everywhere in the universe.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 So you don't want to look for the effect of time on individual atoms.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 And so they reject that in favor of the knowledge already existing in these ancient books?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 Yeah, and the reductionism is generally making that claim that we already know what chemical reactions are and what atoms are.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And so if the organism is nothing but atoms, and atoms aren't to be investigated temporarily, then we have essential knowledge of what an atom is and what chemical reactions are.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And so ultimately, if we reduce the organism to atoms and reactions, we already know everything we need to know about the organism.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 It's all there if you practice reductionism.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 In a little bit of a change of subject, Bill Gates talked about wanting to put vaccines in foods, putting vaccines in mosquitoes, blocking out the sun, etc.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Since he's trying to toxify the planet in every way imaginable, it got me thinking, do the elites even live here?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 I mean, this is actual conspiracy, but do they have something like underground or something? It's wild to think that he's, again, doing all these things and that he's...

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Like, couldn't he be bit by one of his vaccine mosquitoes at some point and be killed?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 No, I think he's just a true believer in complete essentialism that he doesn't see the meaning for himself.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And then who do you think... and he's obviously kind of in... or a true believer and he's very rich, but is he an errand boy in some way of working for somebody bigger?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Yeah. Whoever has more money...

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Maybe Jacob Rothschild?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Yeah, in effect, the way it works is that money rules, and so who has the most money is the one you should look to.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 But the money... like, the elites, they don't really care about money. It's just paying people to do evil stuff to fulfill their vision.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Yeah, except I think it's the humanistic, rationalistic, proper way to make a good world.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 The multiplication of human beings could fairly quickly kill the earth, but they don't take the rational approach,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 which is that as soon as a population is secure in their livelihood, the population of that area stops increasing and begins decreasing.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 So all they have to do to control population growth is to enrich the poorest areas first.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Wasn't that Julian Simon's argument?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Yeah, the first person. When was he making the argument?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Maybe the 70s, at the same time Paul Ehrlich was?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Yeah, the one that demonstrated statistically that raising the standard of living would reduce the population was the physiologist in Denver.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 He did some of the first free radical studies on cells. I can't think of his name right now.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 He was a Renaissance man, though. Many different disciplines.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Yeah, and intelligent in all of them. He just made it absolutely clear that every time it has happened that the population has risen above the starvation level,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 where increased children would increase their likelihood of surviving in old age, as soon as you don't need big family, they stop producing them.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Unless Georgi has another question, move on.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 I have a question on economics a little bit, and I know we're going to catch a lot of hate.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 It's related to Marx and his theory of why capitalism seems to, or at least not capitalist, but like this, the modern state that we've been enjoying over the last 200 years,

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 why it seems to ultimately always lead to wars and destruction. He calls it the tendency of the profit rate to decline.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Are you familiar with that idea, Ray?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 No.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Basically, Marx says that over time in a capitalist production mode society, the means of production of wealth becomes more and more capital intensive.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 It tends to decrease the ratio of labor that goes as an input to producing the wealth.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 If you're decreasing the rate of labor as part of the production process, ultimately the profit rate will decline because according to Marxist theory, value is only produced by labor, by intelligent labor.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Ultimately, as the capitalists are chasing more and more profit and making the modes of production more and more capital intensive and shunning labor out, the profit rate for these capitalists, for the bourgeois, starts to decline.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Basically, ultimately that leads to conflict between them at the state level and ultimately between states at the world level.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 According to Marx, it's just the way the state is structured to produce wealth in a capitalist society ultimately is bound to lead to some sort of a violent conflict because all this money that's in circulation usually has to be paid back with interest.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 If the profit rate starts to drop below that interest, eventually you'll get into a situation that cannot be sustained and it leads to war.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Are you familiar with his thought on that?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Not in detail, but he thought that process would lead automatically to socialism.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Lenin's insight was that as long as you can keep developing colonies, including the whole world in the process, every time capitalism is failing, you have to open up new populations.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 New colonies, new markets.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Lenin thought that imperialism was periodically, every time capitalism would have died, they expand and organize new markets.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 Anti-imperialism becomes an essential opposition to capitalism.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 If there are no more colonies, because we live in a fairly developed world already, then ultimately that would have to lead to a conflict because if capitalism fails in some country, there are no more colonies to exploit.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 Then the only option that Marx said is to start the destruction of the wealth that was already produced inside of that country and of course guess whose wealth they're going to destroy.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Not the wealth of the rich, but whatever wealth remains in the middle and lower classes so that they can usurp it at pennies on the dollar and basically generate yet another year of profit through desperate means.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 I think Stalin's innovation was to try to placate the outside world by declaring socialism against world revolution, socialism in one country.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 The problem was that the idea of world revolution was supported by the big imperialists of the US, Germany, and Japan.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 All were secretly supporting Trotsky, and so the idea of world revolution is where the extreme anti-Stalin falsifications had to begin.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Okay.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 I have questions about World War I and World War II, but I think I'll save them maybe for next time.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Ray, surviving the Great Reset, I think the cards are stacked against everybody, but we're talking about how grim things are and things like that.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 Is there anything you can think of?

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 You've mentioned having a chicken or having a goat or having a cow and being able to produce your own food and that being the wealth currency of the future.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Is there anything else maybe you're doing to protect yourself or that you would recommend to other people to maybe get through the next few years because things are rapidly changing?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Yeah. In the short term, having storable food is logical, but because electricity is essential for ordinary living,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 they realize that you can't store perishable food in the freezer because they just have to turn off the electricity for a week at a time and everything is spoiled.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 I have a list here. Maybe you could add to it. UHT milk, honey, white sugar, canned oysters, canning salt, frozen meat, not frozen liver, Mexican Coke, coffee, powdered gelatin, powdered milk, applesauce with no additives, canned fruit without citric acid, baking soda.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Is there anything else you can think of that would be good to obtain at the grocery store and stock up?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Ordinary granulated white sugar and ghee and coconut oil are intense calorie sources that are good for medium term shutdown.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 And that UHT milk, it says on the, at least the one I have, it says about six months. Can you go even longer on that or does it?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 Oh yeah, that's just basically so they can keep selling powdered milk.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 So it doesn't expire?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 The taste gradually deteriorates if it's exposed to oxygen, but if it's well sealed, I've had some five year old powdered milk.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Is that the same thing as like UHT in that Tetra Pak type of milk? Am I confusing the two?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 I don't know what is in it.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Is it like powdered milk, the actual powder versus the type of milk that's in the cardboard, but it's next to the soy milk, like in the grocery store shelves?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 Yeah, I've never looked at that in detail. The ultra pasteurized milk, I've eaten it far beyond the expiration date and didn't notice that taste was any worse than when it's freshly made.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Did you see the recent changes by the FDA in the food safety regulations?

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 They explained that they had to do it because of the pandemic, but now they're allowing vendors that are selling any kind of prepackaged food to basically replace most of the ingredients as the vendor sees fit without changing the label.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 In other words, some of the examples are you can be looking at mayonnaise made with coconut oil, and those are pretty rare, but I'm just giving it as an example.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 It says the ingredients are eggs, coconut oil, vinegar, etc.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Apparently, the vendors are now allowed to replace the coconut oil with any other oil, which of course means they're going to put either cottonseed or canola oil, whatever's cheapest, and the eggs can be replaced with something of the same color as long as it basically meets the definition of having a consistency of an egg.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 How can we even trust the labels at this point in the store as far as the pandemic is concerned?

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 I'm sure that there are other issues with the labels, but right now it seems that pretty much anything goes when you're going to buy these things in the store.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 I've already noticed a few products deteriorate drastically in quality.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Even five years ago, the Department of Agriculture was allowing horrible things to get bypassed labeling requirements as processing agents, for example.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 I actually got some of the organic milk brands in Whole Foods that were giving me digestive issues, and I sent some samples to a lab that we work with, and they came back saying that these milks contained silica and gums, even though neither one of these was listed on the label.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Have you written anything about that?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 I haven't written anything about that, but I called the vendor, and two of them refused to answer my question.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 They didn't pick up the phone, and the third vendor said, "Whatever ingredient is in there, as long as it's under a limit for each one of these ingredients," he said that they're not required to report it on the label.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Basically, if it's less than one gram per serving, I think is what he said.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 I think it's important to get that information out.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Okay, understood.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 I'll see how I can do it without getting sued.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 I'll just say that it's the three or four major brands that are sold at the local Whole Foods, and there are only five or six, so that should be enough for people.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 Okay, let's take our first question. Let me minimize the browser here.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 Okay, this one's from Anon about vaccines.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Hey, Danny, Georgie, and Dr. Pete. I love the show. I've been listening to it for about two weeks.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Are you guys getting it all choppy and stuff?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Yes.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 You can't hear that, right?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 I couldn't understand a word of it.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Okay, either could I. I wonder if it's just that question. Let's try another one.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 Hey, Danny. Hey, Ray. Hey, Georgie. I have a question about the aging process.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 I want to know what would it take to stop aging and reverse the aging process and keep people in a perpetually youthful state?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Like, what kind of therapies or medicine or technologies do we need to be able to achieve something like that? Thank you.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 I think the basic process is epigenetic, and it involves small adaptations constantly to an improper environment for our type of organism.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 If we can cause all of our adaptations to be directed by our central intention, what we feel ourselves to be and the need,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 aging could basically be stopped. Every little adjustment to stress leaves an epigenetic residue in the tissues,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 slowing metabolism, leaving the production of energy by oxygen consumption lower while increasing glycolytic energy production.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 The consequences of that are to gradually increase flowing proteins like heat shock protein, collagen content of the connective tissues,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 and progressive lowering of the mitochondrial processes of each cell. The organism gets drier and drier,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 but the individual cells inside this dehydrating framework, the individual cells become more and more inflamed.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 I think of running downhill as an extreme example of adjusting in the wrong direction.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 If you stretch a muscle under tension, that leaves damage behind and very quickly lowers the oxidative ability of the cell.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 Some Canadian exercise physiologists have old people do exclusively concentric exercise in which you don't have any adjustment to the forced extension of muscles.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 Our culture is forcing our organism to go ways that it really doesn't want to go.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 That's like when you run downhill, the muscle under the force of gravity is being forced to shift to protect against that tearing effect on the muscle.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 The muscle enlarges under those conditions, but it's more or less permanently changed.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 According to those two exercise physiologists, that can be reversed by a special kind of contraction.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 What we need is a general culture that emphasizes what's best for each person.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 Your word is surviving in this current situation, it's pretty much impossible to thrive, right?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 Yeah, no effort is being made to make things better for everyone.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 If an organism is depleted of PUFA, wouldn't the maladaptive process be much slower in terms of intensity?

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 Yeah, all kinds of experiments have demonstrated that PUFA's accelerate all of the bad processes.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 A study just came out today, or at least I saw it today on my newsfeed, and they found out that simply blocking the prostaglandin E2 receptor basically fully reverses any signs of brain aging or any kind of neurodegenerative disease.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 I thought, "Oh wow, what a nice and politically convenient way to not implicate PUFA.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 Not only does it block the receptor of the prostaglandin, but immediately to the people knowledgeable of the situation, it means that without PUFA there can be no brain aging.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 Does that apply to every tissue and organ?

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 Yeah. The prostaglandin system is sort of the final amplifier of the stress-intensifying, amplifying function.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 In terms of controlling the stress reaction, it starts at the hypothalamus, right?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that releases things like CRH, the corticotropin hormone, and the TRH, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone?

00:51:47.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 Yeah. The organism does its best to preserve itself in these bad circumstances.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 Several studies have shown that these peptides that the hypothalamus releases, like CRH and TRH, are highly inflammatory.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 Now several companies are trying to come up with drugs to block either the release of them or block their receptors at the pituitary level or other tissues.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 Do you think there's any benefit in suppressing the reaction of the hypothalamus to stress, external stress?

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 Good conditions will do it.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 Thyroid supplements are one of the important things for keeping down the stress produced by TSH.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 There's now a gradually increasing awareness that TSH is what causes the circulatory damage of hypothyroidism.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 As the TSH goes up, the deterioration, atherosclerosis, everything contributing to hypertension is created by the TSH itself.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 What about something like shining red light on the thyroid or the skull?

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 I think the whole body exposure to all of the good light is much better than just on the thyroid.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 I'm asking just because a lot of people are under lockdown right now and if they can't afford to go outside, would this be like a closed substitute until they're free to go outside?

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 I doubt that it really helps very much. Getting a thyroid supplement is the surest to work.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Great stuff. Okay, let's take... Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Ray.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 Say again?

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 Oh, I was just going to go to another question.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 Oh, okay.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 Okay, let me hide this. Let's try that one that skipped a little bit to see if it was... Oh, no. Okay, it's still bad. Okay, sorry, Anon. I'll do your question next time.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 That last question was from Abraham. Thank you very much, Abraham. This one's from Oren.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 Hello, Ray, Danny, Georgie. I was wondering if you could speak on your views of the history of philosophy.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 As a jumping off point, I think that the Hegelian idea that there's progress in history, that history always moves forward, and the post-Enlightenment rationalist project really lead us to where we are now with our current situation with technology and our current conception of man

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 and how that all ties in with the neo-Darwinist views on the human. I was wondering if you could speak about this as well as how to correctly conceptualize the human organism, as I think that's vital for the health of any age.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 I think the idea of intentionality is what governs the organism. In philosophy, there is this big jump in which Edmund Pusherl and Mainong, I forget his first name,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 were proposing that you should concentrate on the intentional processes in the brain, but around the same time, the idea of intention as the formative principle of the organism.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 If you look at early 20th century embryology, for example, by splitting an early embryo into two or more parts, you would get two or more complete organisms,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 showing that it's not just a mechanical process, but there's an intention to become a certain sort of thing. Even considerably changing the conditions of development, those fractions still contain the intention to become something.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Every undesirable experience that the developing organism has is going to divert from its best intentions. That whole process dates from about the beginning of the 20th century.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Mainong and Pusherl were strong influences on Bertrand Russell, who gradually worked it out and moved towards a more empirical understanding.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 He brought back a lot of the rationalist and hidden essentialism. His idea of logical atoms sort of semi-consciously incorporated the ideas of strict reductionist Darwinism,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 and the implications of racism and imperialism. But Bertrand Russell at least was able to conceptualize that that was an impossible system.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 At that point he gave up philosophy and decided he wasn't up to the job because it always leads to the dead end of this anti-empiricism.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 When I was reading about the Rockefellers and Rothschilds, Immanuel Kant came up a few times. Is that one of the undesirable philosophies for running the show?

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 Yes. About 40 or 50 years ago, I wrote a little article that I haven't been able to find on the impact of Kantianism or neo-Kantianism on our culture.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 It started in about 1900 and was one of the most evil but widespread influences. I told several people when I was in graduate school about my experience of criticizing neo-Kantianism and

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:54.000
 tending to get a B or C on the paper. But every time I found something good in neo-Kantianism, I always got an A on the paper. A couple of people tried that.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 A couple of people who had been going along supporting neo-Kantianism got such reactions when they found something wrong with it that they were really annoyed with me.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:25.000
 I'm not an expert on it, but isn't it the idea of collectivism over the individual? So that's kind of like an exact example of what the philosophy states? Like you're getting rejected because you're being kind of an individual?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 I don't think so.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 What is Kantianism?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
 Sort of the ultimate denial of empiricism.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:49.000
 Didn't even Kant, toward the end of his life, say that pure rational, idealistic knowledge is impossible? We can never develop it and it always has to be modified?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:58.000
 Yeah, but in practice, we always find a way to remain essentialist and rationalist.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 I have a question about potential and intentionality. Would you say that the physiological, the physical basis of intentionality in the human organism is a potential difference between the organism and the environment? So basically the environment always kind of draws us forward because of across that gradient?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:46.000
 Yeah. I think the degree of success that the organism finds in keeping its basic purpose despite the slight deviations, that's what leads to delayed aging, among other things.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:02:03.000
 So the system that basically prevents the intentional, intelligent action from humans by enslaving them in all these possible ways, that's one of the worst things you can do for the health of the organism or for its future because you block the realization of its potential?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:11.000
 Yeah, leading to depression and cancer and heart disease.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
 Okay, we'll take another question. Let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Austin.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:46.000
 Hello, Danny and Ray. Thank you for doing this podcast. I always learn a lot. I have a question about the biological processes surrounding vellus hairs turning to terminal hairs. If you look at a baby, like a newborn, you can notice that they basically look like old men where they have very thin, fine hairs on top of their head.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:03:12.000
 And then at some point, something kicks in, some process happens, and all of those hairs turn to very thick terminal hairs. So my question is, is it possible to do the same thing for people that are undergoing the reverse process of terminal hairs turning to vellus hairs, namely androgenic alopecia or so-called androgenic alopecia?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:35.000
 I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and obviously I'd love to apply anything you have to offer because I'm dealing with alopecia, as you can see. But I notice I still do have lots of hair. It's just very small and thin, and so if there's some way I could turn those to terminal, that would be awesome. So I'd love to hear what you have to say. Thanks.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 I've experimented several times with using DHEA in oil on the sides of my eyebrows that have gradually gone through aging and disappearance.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 It took about six months to create new, dark, normal hairs. We were changing the color of topical copper solution.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:37.000
 The very next day, I could see the colored hair beginning at the base. In the case of lost hairs, it was a very slow process.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 Speaking of the neonate, what exactly is going on in the hair growth process? People have pointed out that the neonate has the normal horseshoe shape of baldness. What is your take on that?

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:22.000
 I don't know. I've never thought about that particular developmental process. I think the androgenic steroids such as DHEA are involved in sickening maturation of the normal hair.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 I think there's a difference between the hair type that the baby has and a balding person has. The baby has very low levels of androgens and very high levels of pregnenolone, at least based on the studies that I've seen, while the balding people tend to have high levels of estrogen and prolactin in the scalp.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:08.000
 Both of these hormones, prolactin and estrogen, are known to thin and destroy the follicle and thin the hair. They can actually make a very thick head of hair turn into a very thin mop of hair like that of a very old person.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:27.000
 Just because they look similar, the hormonal underpinnings of both types of hair are very different. At least that's what I've seen in the studies. I think the reason the babies don't have all that thick black hair is, relatively speaking, the low levels of the androgens.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:35.000
 But the thinning of the hair in balding adults, from what I've seen, is mostly driven by prolactin and estrogen and cortisol.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:57.000
 There have been some interesting studies on dogs. Certain dogs became completely bald when their owners started supplementing estrogen on their skin.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:15.000
 Some, in which it happened spontaneously, without an estrogenized owner, the dog was found to have extremely high estrogen levels, which would involve high prolactin too.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:31.000
 Isn't a good indication that estrogen and prolactin are involved in hair loss the fact that most menopausal women start having serious problems with hair falling out, thinning, and in general weakness of the scalp and the follicles?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 Yes. The whole menopause supposed estrogen failure is a total fraud created by the industry to sell a product for which it didn't work.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:09.000
 First, they prescribed it to prevent miscarriage, even after it had been demonstrated for several years to predictably cause miscarriage.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:28.000
 Doctors at Harvard promoted the idea for the estrogen companies that supplementing estrogen would prevent premature delivery or miscarriage.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:42.000
 What they were doing was increasing the risk of miscarriage and profoundly damaging the mother and baby.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 The first missed period involved the failure to form a corpus luteum, and estrogen stays at the same level.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:17.000
 So at the transition, you're experiencing a sharp drop, almost absolute disappearance of progesterone and the maintenance of estrogen.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:32.000
 In rat studies, they actually bothered to measure what happens to the blood estrogen level when the ovaries are removed.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:56.000
 The few people who bothered testing it found that within a week, the body, which is normal recovery from surgery period, found that the rats were right back to their normal estrogen level but without progesterone.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:17.000
 My dissertation was basically based on the fact that sterility in the middle of the lifespan is caused by an unopposed estrogen.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:33.000
 But the sales system of the drug companies has kept this misguide that there's a lack of estrogen at the menopause.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:48.000
 My recent newsletter, I think it was, temperature falls when progesterone isn't being produced adequately.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 All of the symptoms of menopause can be produced by too much estrogen or too little progesterone.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:17.000
 Do you think there's a reason why all the studies with animals, and especially with humans, they always focus on this one type of estrogen, estradiol, as if it's the only type of estrogen that the body produces?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.000
 I mean, there are other types, especially things like estrone and its sulfated form.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:39.000
 There have been several studies lately which have called for endocrinology to evaluate its position on menopause because those studies said, "Look, you guys only keep measuring estradiol, and we know it's going to be low because when the ovaries fail, most of the estradiol in the blood comes from the ovaries."

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000
 But have you bothered measuring estrone sulfate, which can be easily converted into all of the other estrogens as needed?

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
 If you measure it in menopausal women, it is very, very high.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:12:16.000
 But the big failure, that's part of it, of failing to recognize that stress, lack of progesterone, shifts the enzyme in the direction that every cell becomes able to convert by reduction.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 So, we have to convert estriol or estrone into the 10 times more active estradiol.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:51.000
 The most important measurement that any of the estrogen researchers have made was that they were measuring the estrogen output of the ovary,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:01.000
 and they wanted to control measuring the amount that appeared coming out of the ovary.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000
 They wanted to see how that compared with the circulating serum.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:31.000
 So, they took the vein coming out of the artery and compared the estrogen content to the vein coming out of one arm and found that the arm was producing just as much estrogen as the ovary.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:52.000
 The reason that removing the ovary from rats within a week, the estrogen was back to normal,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 the reason is that the whole body is always producing estrogen, and it's the whole body's stress-induced estrogen that has to be controlled for better health.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
 Last question, then we can move on.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 I saw maybe a back and forth with you and somebody about frontal fibrosing alopecia, and that's more common after menopause.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 Is that like maybe 50 or 70 years ago, a man would gradually bald over a long period of time?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:37.000
 Is the frontal fibrosing alopecia like an extreme inflammatory type of baldness, like very quickly, like after menopause, and that's what's happening in the scalp there?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 Yeah, and one of the things I included in my dissertation was the effect on the whole body collagen system, that estrogen is a major factor in shifting the balance of collagen production.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:14.000
 And you specifically identified PTH in calcium and vitamin D as factors to protect against that, and of course, obviously, keeping the estrogen low.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:34.000
 Yeah, keeping the energy production up, parathyroid hormone, albastrone, lead very strongly both to energy failure and to increased fibrosis of all the tissues.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:46.000
 Awesome. Okay, let me hide this browser real fast. Thank you so much, Ray. Sincerely appreciate it. Guys, give this episode a like, subscribe on BitChute, subscribe on Telegram, and I'll upload this episode immediately after we're done.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
 I'll do the timestamps and everything. Sincere appreciation to Ray and Georgie for joining me tonight.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000
 These episodes are always really special, and Ray, just an extreme amount of appreciation for you taking the time out of your day to join us.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.000
 So let me go ahead and hide this, and this one's from Daniel.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:17.000
 Hey Danny, hey Ray, thanks for having me on today. I just had a question about flare up for Crohn's disease. Do you have any other recommendations besides glycine and collagen? Thanks so much for your time, I look forward to your answer.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
 You catch that, Ray?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
 What was the question?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
 It was about Crohn's disease.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
 Flare up of Crohn's disease.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
 Flare up of Crohn's, yeah.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000
 Say it again.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
 Like a flare up of Crohn's disease?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:17:01.000
 Oh, undoubtedly estrogen is going to be involved. I've for about 45 years been recommending both thyroid and progesterone, and everyone that has tried it, as far as I recall, has improved their blood sugar.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
 Improved their symptoms.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:11.000
 What's happening there, is the estrogen like shifting the redox balance of the sensitive intestine and that's causing inflammation?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:22.000
 Yeah. Increased reduction is the same as failed oxidation.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:36.000
 I've seen a few other studies demonstrating that since estrogen is known to compromise the gut barrier, it allows bacteria to start invading the wall of the colon and the small intestine.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:54.000
 Older studies demonstrated that you can actually put inflammatory bowel disease in remission by gonadectomizing the animals, and they thought this was because the androgens or the progesterone was removed depending on whether the animal was male or female.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:12.000
 But subsequently they administered androgens to the gonadectomized males or progesterone to the gonadectomized females, and they discovered that they stay in remission, which I think proves irrefutably that estrogen is the direct cause.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:32.000
 One thing I wanted to mention also about vitamin D, apparently there were studies in the '80s, not many, that treated Crohn's disease with a synthetic form of vitamin D, which was used only because it was profitable, but it still had the same effects as the regular vitamin D3 that we know about.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:42.000
 They were able to put Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in remission by administering 100,000 units weekly.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:56.000
 I've had a few people comment saying that they tried putting 50,000 units weekly in their navel if it was dissolved in oil, and apparently it helped resolve a lot of their symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
 Do you think vitamin D is also involved, Ray?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:08.000
 Yes, I think it is for sure effective taken orally.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:29.000
 The things that reduce inflammation, cure all sorts of chronic diseases, and the symptoms of the pandemic, so-called virus,

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 are quickly reduced or eliminated with all of these anti-inflammatory substances, which could be a dose of 50,000 or 100,000 orally of vitamin D.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:12.000
 Just a single dose to get started is good. And progesterone and aspirin, everything that is a safe anti-inflammatory agent has been used against all of these diseases.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
 Ray, didn't you know vitamin D was toxic?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
 Yeah, I've heard that a thousand times.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:28.000
 Have you seen any direct evidence of vitamin D's anti-estrogenic effects?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 I mean, there are some studies that talk about receptors, but I know you're not a fan of just the receptor effect, it's the whole cell that needs to be taken into account.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
 Do you know of any studies that compare it?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 The receptor is a good sign of deficiency of vitamin D. As you become deficient in the 25-hydroxycholecylciferol,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 you begin to produce both the receptor and the so-called active vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecylciferol.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:38.000
 Part of the toxicity, people get very confused and fail to work out the ramifications of the so-called active vitamin D and receptor

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:54.000
 as being associated with a lot of toxic harmful effects that are reduced by adequate calcium and the not active form of vitamin D.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000
 It's actually active, but it isn't what they call active.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:15.000
 I was reading a few days ago about calcitriol or 1,25-dihydroxy being associated with prolactin and growth hormone, so it certainly seems like the people advocating for that approach aren't considering these other things that you have plugged into your whole beautiful picture of physiology.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
 Okay, so let me hide this one. We were just talking about digestion, so let me play this one from Will.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 One other question. What about the interaction of vitamin D3, cholecylciferol, with estrogen? They seem to oppose each other. Have you seen any studies or any experiments done that demonstrate this more directly?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:57.000
 Yeah, I can't think of the references right now, but I've seen good evidence of opposition of good vitamin D and calcium to the effects of estrogen.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:05.000
 Does intracellular calcium turn on aromatase?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:21.000
 Yeah, excitation of the cell generally turns it on stress, tendency to be on the test pathway.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:43.000
 That is part of the aging process, and it gradually increases the amount of estrogen coming out of your arms and legs and fat and other parts.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:50.000
 But a deficiency of dietary calcium also increases aromatase because it increases PTH, right?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:24:19.000
 Right. Like a deficiency of good vitamin D, calcium deficiency increases stress and activates the whole system, and endotoxin, aldosterone, parathyroid hormone, and estrogen.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:27.000
 Great stuff. Thank you, Georgie. Thank you, Ray. Okay, let me hide this. And this one is from Will.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:56.000
 Hi, Ray. Hi, Danny. I was wondering, for someone who has utilized the carrot salad, white button mushrooms, antibiotics, and other strategies, yet still has chronic endotoxin symptoms and low total cholesterol, what would be some good strategies to both lower those endotoxin symptoms as well as increase the total cholesterol?

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:17.000
 Great care with what you eat is part of it. Anything that irritates your bowel is a risk.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:36.000
 Finding the diet balance, sometimes you have to be fairly extreme to start improving the whole situation.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:26:04.000
 Sometimes going to a strange, different form of fiber in your diet can help. Each one might not be right for a certain person, but usually by trying out different ones, you can find a dietary fiber that reduces inflammation.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 What about a bacteriophage, erythromycin, penicillin, or tetracycline?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:15.000
 All of those sometimes help.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:39.000
 I have a question. I know you've spoken favorably of charcoal, but you've also cautioned against many products that are on the market because you think they may absorb into the bloodstream and cause an allergic reaction. Wouldn't combining the charcoal with the carrot salad reduce those risks while still allowing the charcoal to do its magic in the gut?

01:26:39.000 --> 01:27:08.000
 It does seem logical, but it's something I would prefer to leave to rat experiments because of the fact that any kind of unmetabolizable particle, if it gets preserved, basically kills off part of your whole system.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 Have you used charcoal yourself in the past, or have you found any brand that used to work in the past, even if not now?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:37.000
 I think I tried it once, but after thinking more about it and about presorption, I decided it was something I didn't want to keep trying on myself.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.000
 Wouldn't overcooked mushrooms, if they're overgrilled, contain a bit of charcoal?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 Probably a small amount.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000
 Great. Do you still have confidence in fluorescents or the bacteriophage?

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:13.000
 I've used it several times, and some of the products I saw slight improvement, but nothing spectacular. So I haven't kept trying it.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000
 And where would you place that against something like Biosporin?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:45.000
 Biosporin can be very powerful because it's producing a broad spectrum antibiotic. The bacteria in it are producers of antibiotics.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:58.000
 And then there's an over-the-counter product called Megasporbiotic. It's kind of expensive, but it does contain the B. subtilis and the B. licheniformis that Biosporin has. Do you have any confidence in that?

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:08.000
 I tried it once, and it didn't seem to work the same as Biosporin for me.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.000
 The only bad part about Biosporin is it's very difficult to obtain, especially right now.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:23.000
 Yeah, and I think it contains a preservative from the smell of it.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:50.000
 When I used it, I would let it sit in a glass of milk at room temperature, wait until there was a delicate coagulation of the whole glass, and then I would put that in the refrigerator and use only a spoonful of it per day.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 So the extreme dilution of the preservative wouldn't be a factor. That was how I always used it.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:16.000
 How long does it take for a colon or for a gut that has been sterilized by any means to get recolonized by bacteria?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:27.000
 It sometimes happens in a week, but sometimes people don't manage to get it.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:39.000
 I'm asking because I've had a few people email me asking about replacing antibiotics with things like coconut oil.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:56.000
 I know you've said it can be irritating to the GI tract, which they seem to confirm, but those people reported that after eating a few tablespoons daily, they got loose stools, but after that they felt blissfully for more than a week.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
 Do you think that's due to the antibiotic effect of coconut oil?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:12.000
 Yeah, it's effective against both fungus and bacteria, but you have to make sure that you are allergic to it.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
 Hey Ray, I don't know if there's anything you can do about it, but your volume goes from real low to really high, so I don't know if it's just the phone placement.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.000
 Anyways, let's skip on here. Let me hide this and we'll go to another question.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
 Thank you so much, Ray. Thank you, Georgie, for making this possible. Sincerely appreciate it.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:35.000
 Instead of waiting until the end of the show, Ray, why don't you let everybody know how they can subscribe to your newsletter?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:48.000
 The site for ordering it is raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
 And that's $28 for 12 issues over 2 years?

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
 Right.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
 And then they can order your books by contacting that same email, correct?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
 At the same address, yeah.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
 Awesome. And what are you working on right now?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:17.000
 Aging of the cell. Following up things that were left out of last month on the effect of temperature.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:35.000
 I concentrated on cold the last time, and this one's going to concentrate on the energy deficit effect,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:49.000
 which can be produced by heat stress or reductive stress or any kind of stress that goes with energy deprivation.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:59.000
 I was listening to your last interview with Patrick Timpone and you were saying the likely cause of many deaths is just the temperature getting too low. Is that right?

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
 Yeah.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:07.000
 And it's totally not scientific to label a cause of death as COVID-19.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:21.000
 Yeah, and a lot of people don't bother checking the temperature of your mouth, eardrum, and extremities.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:38.000
 Old people in particular, their brain might be at a good temperature, oral 98.6, eardrum 99.5, for example,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:55.000
 but they're producing less energy and that shows up as an extreme gradient from the extremities to the brain area.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:09.000
 Keeping that in mind, paying attention to the outside temperature, that can have a profound effect.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:25.000
 The indoor temperature might be 70 degrees and seem perfectly safe, but even through ordinary insulated walls,

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:42.000
 the outside temperature can profoundly drain your body's energy-producing ability and create that gradient effect.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:35:01.000
 That means that your system is experiencing stress everywhere, even though the brain is maintaining its own temperature.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:10.000
 It's also perceiving that the bulk of your body is being de-energized.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:21.000
 That's because such a large percentage of our biological energy goes out as radiation.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:33.000
 Something like three-quarters of the energy we produce goes out as microwaves and infrared.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:44.000
 If it isn't reciprocated by returning radiation from something approaching body temperature,

01:35:44.000 --> 01:36:00.000
 having an outside temperature of 45 degrees, for example, your body is draining vastly more energy than it would be in the summer with 80-degree weather.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:07.000
 That's why aspirin and a snack before bed and maybe progesterone and thyroid are so important right before you go to sleep.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
 Yeah.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
 I have a question about the cell aging.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:19.000
 What do you think, Ray, is the main factor responsible for the hardening of that liquid crystal, which is what the cell is?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
 Is it mostly lipophosphine or are there other factors involved as well?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:33.000
 Yeah, everything you can think of is involved.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:57.000
 Parathyroid hormone, for example, is very powerful along with aldosterone, for example, and nitric oxide, collagen, everything is shifting in a harmful way.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
 So it's an accumulation of some pathological proteins too, right?

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
 It's not just the fats in the iron, but the proteins and collagen and things like that.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:24.000
 Intercellularly, you have things like the heat shock protein or the stress chaperone proteins.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:41.000
 Those are protective in some situations and become part of the epigenetic damaging influence as they accumulate in the stressed cell itself.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:52.000
 Would, in general, reductive stress, even in a younger cell, also lead to a hardening in an electronic fashion just because there are excessive electrons that are not there?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:02.000
 Yeah, but also by activating other changes such as the heat shock protein.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:09.000
 Great stuff. Okay, just a few more questions, Ray, and we'll let you go. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Sincerely appreciate it.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
 Let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Brandon.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:26.000
 Hey Danny, hey everyone. So I have a question for Ray regarding koshodama or sacred sound mantra practices and how this top-down approach modulates stress hormones by toning the vagus nerve.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:36.000
 And how adopting practices like this are a really good complement to all the biological understandings that I think Ray and all you guys bring forward.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:53.000
 And just curious if he has a perspective on that and/or really any of you guys and what other potential top-down approach might be suggested like that, like meditation, breath work, mantra practices, things of these nature.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
 I don't know why I look over here all the time. It's the damn things over here.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:07.000
 Yeah, sleep deprived. Anyway, love you guys' work and just want you all to know all this free content you give makes a huge impact.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:15.000
 My health is way better. My client's health is way better all because of this amazing content that you guys continue to produce.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:24.000
 So I am greatly appreciative of everything. So I wish you all a groovy one and I'll tune in for more shows as always.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
 What do you think, Ray?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:36.000
 Shock is the extreme degree of most of these things we've been talking about.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:51.000
 Estrogen, Hans-Jelly was the first one to propose the idea that estrogen imitates a shock reaction.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:18.000
 And I think that applies to many of the stimulating techniques of the vagus nerve. You have to be very watchful for estrogenic influences when you specifically stimulate the vagus.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:26.000
 Okay, we'll jump to another one. Thank you, Brandon. Thank you, Ray. Let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Jake.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:42.000
 Hey, I had a quick question for Ray. So Ray, I know you had mentioned on a previous podcast that there's a possibility in the future of the earth releasing a large amount of carbon dioxide,

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:52.000
 which could lead to a planetary-wide shift in consciousness or thinking for the population.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:19.000
 And I'm wondering, I have two questions. So the first question is, with this kind of a sudden increase in carbon dioxide, do you think that there's a possibility that there's an intelligence of the earth that could sense kind of a crisis situation on the planet and initiate this rise in carbon dioxide globally?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:45.000
 And my second question is, as a follow-up, what kind of indications, either biological or cultural indications, would suggest that this kind of event of increase in carbon dioxide is likely to happen at a certain point? Thanks. Bye.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:42:05.000
 I didn't catch the last part of it, but the first part, I think the earth is basically doing the best things it can.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:28.000
 Melting tundra ice is releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide. And if the earth is expanding, as some of the measurements over the last half century have suggested,

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:43.000
 an expanding earth would be diluting the atmosphere, resembling high altitude even at lower altitudes.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:43:01.000
 So an expanding earth could improve our atmosphere as well as releasing more actual CO2 into the air. But what was the last part of the question?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:10.000
 I think it was something about carbon dioxide and what would that do culturally? Like a higher amount of... I might be misremembering.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
 Would it lead to a higher consciousness?

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:29.000
 Yeah. That happens at high altitude when you see both acceleration and reduction of the stress hormones.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:55.000
 When T3 increases, cortisol doesn't increase at high altitude. And the brain metabolism, oxidative metabolism, increases with higher CO2.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:15.000
 And that greater consumption of electrons, I think, is tending to keep the brain in a positive, productive, more conscious condition.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:31.000
 I have a kind of a goofy question, but it's been a long-standing interest of mine. Ray, we seem to have been inundated with recent UFO news and disclosure and "no longer in the shadows, Pentagon's UFO unit will make some findings public."

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:43.000
 Without me coloring the issue at all, what is your take on the general UFO agenda?

01:44:43.000 --> 01:45:12.000
 I think it's a risk. I think there is a risk in a time of crisis.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:30.000
 And a lot of us will be declared domestic terrorists for doubting Fauci. It will be a welcome distraction. Get people's minds off the critics.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:45.000
 You mentioned David Sheehan a few times. Wasn't he kind of a UFO guy? What is your take? Clearly, the news loves talking about UFOs, but they don't want to talk about 9/11 or bankers or other CIA or other actual problems.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:46:01.000
 Is it purely an agenda for control? Like, there was that CIA project, Project Blue Beam, I think in the 90s. Is it some kind of tool in the oligarch toolbox of control?

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:21.000
 It functions that way, but it's hard to tell whether it's just the silliness of the broadcasters and newspapers who know what they shouldn't write about. It's on the safe list, at least.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:29.000
 Could any of these events or crafts be really from extraterrestrial beings?

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:50.000
 It's a possibility, but I would give priority to all kinds of government fraud over actual evidence of aliens.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:59.000
 The fact that it's being released specifically now makes it that much more suspect.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:28.000
 At times, it was clear that they were doing something that they created a very silly excuse for why people were seeing certain things, such as experimental luminous releases in the stratosphere.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:57.000
 They had to disguise it as saying it was slump gas or some natural phenomenon to avoid having to explain that it was some very interesting,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000
 but secret military process.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:12.000
 Great stuff. Okay, thanks for that, Ray. It's a burning question of mine since I was a young lad. Okay, let me hide this. Okay, this one's from Nick.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:32.000
 Hey guys, big fan of the show. My question for Ray is if the mechanism of MDMA is a big release of serotonin, flooding the brain with serotonin, and serotonin is a stress chemical, then why do people feel so happy and loving when they're on MDMA?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:44.000
 I've read about it online and it sounds like there's a little bit of dopamine and norepinephrine release, which maybe that would be what accounts for that, but it seems like, at least according to the mainstream view...

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
 Sorry, go ahead, Ray.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
 What kind of DNA?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
 He's talking about MDMA, the drug, like the party drug that...

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
 Ecstasy.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
 Ecstasy, yeah.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:28.000
 Obviously, it's releasing a lot of processes in the brain and the fact that it damages the brain. I think the damage comes from the excess serotonin, but I would guess that the things that go along, in general, over-excitation of the brain, I think that's...

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
 Where the good feeling comes in.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:37.000
 Is this kind of like a cultural cliché to say that, "Oh, this drug makes me happy, therefore it's increasing my serotonin"?

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000
 Yeah, it is strictly a cliché.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:50:05.000
 I think it's a dose-dependent effect. Currently, MDMA is in clinical trials for post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers and they found out that, really, at very low doses, where you almost don't even get the psychotropic effect, it has a powerful antidepressant and antitrauma effect.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:15.000
 The animal studies that were accompanying the human ones showed that this is tied to a large release of dopamine and a drop of cortisol.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:22.000
 So, my opinion is that MDMA is serotonergic, just like LSD, only if you abuse it in very high doses.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:34.000
 Ray, was this question difficult for you to hear on the phone? There's another part of it, but I can summarize it for you if you couldn't hear it.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
 No, I couldn't hear it exactly.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:47.000
 Actually, I don't know if I can summarize it. Maybe George can listen to it and summarize it for you. Let me fast forward.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:56.000
 Like hostile and things like that, why does MDMA seem to have the opposite effect?

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:05.000
 My second question, if you're willing to do two, is has Ray ever looked into Chinese medicine very much? The philosophy seems really similar.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:16.000
 Okay, I'll just stop right there. But it was about Chinese medicine being very similar to the Otto Warburg, Albrecht St. George, your idea of energy and structure.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:36.000
 Yeah, I was very impressed by Joseph Needham's books on Chinese science and technology. He was such a good biochemist in England.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:54.000
 He did a very objective survey and summary of Chinese philosophy and other sources.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:16.000
 I found it very interesting how acupuncture can work. I don't agree with any of the Western theories of what acupuncture is doing.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:33.000
 I think the Korean theory activates the movement of exosomes to restore tissues is so far the best theory.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:41.000
 Okay, we'll do one more and then we'll call it a day. Again, Ray, thank you so much for taking two hours out of your day to chat with us.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
 Sincerely appreciate it. Okay, let me hide this browser. And this one's from Tim.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:52.000
 Hey, Daniel Ray, the bit that you just realized this is probably really hard to understand, but you'll just go through it.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:02.000
 The little part where you were talking about physiology and you talked about if you're not in the euphoric state, then there's something wrong with you. I'd love to know more about that. That's fascinating.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
 Did you catch that, Ray?

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
 Not at all.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:17.000
 He's actually referencing one of our older podcasts where you said if you're not in the euphoric state, that means you're degenerating. Tim was asking if you could expand on that.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:35.000
 Oh, yeah. Things like carbon dioxide, adequate oxidation of glucose, these things should give you a 24-hour-a-day euphoria.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:56.000
 And anything that interferes with this highly efficient energy production is amplifying damage, leading to permanent damage from inflammation.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:01.000
 So, you aren't metabolizing, right?

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
 And just to define euphoria for everyone?

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
 That life feels good.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
 And maybe with... Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:39.000
 Feeling your breathing, feeling your heartbeat, and feeling the blood circulate through your tissues, all of that is background. All of it feels good. And so it gives a general tone to everything you're thinking and doing. It makes them feel good, too.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:54.000
 I identify with that. There are times I'm excited to get to work and answer an email and things. Is it possible to maintain that feeling in the current situation? You've been aware of things and how they've been progressing for much longer than I have.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:06.000
 But how do you maintain frame and euphoria when you know that, especially this last year and this year, are going pretty miserably?

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:21.000
 Yeah. And the common condition... You know, doctors have been thinking of euphoria as something dangerous.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:30.000
 If thyroid leads to euphoria, they'll tell you to stop taking it.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:42.000
 Because they think of those good feelings as not quite compatible with life.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:56:01.000
 And the whole business of living is this background of feeling your blood circulate and energy being produced.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:14.000
 If you ask a person to pay attention to their heart beating, they often get nervous.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:32.000
 And the first reaction when a person takes an exactly right dose of thyroid, one typical response was, "Thyroid is love."

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:54.000
 A feeling that radiates out of the chest, all of the good feeling nuclei throughout the body, all of these are intensified by thyroid.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:02.000
 Your heart is one of the major emotion sensors.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:18.000
 If you're low in thyroid, then those same areas of your body that should be sensing the pleasure of living are reporting anxiety.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:43.000
 People feel anxiety around their heart and chest, but the right response to it, getting the right dose, the experience of love, is probably the best description to what the euphoria of metabolism is doing.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
 That's awesome. I'll let you go.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
 I have a question about carbon dioxide and euphoria.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:58:06.000
 Since carbon dioxide improves metabolism and really leads to higher states of consciousness, shouldn't carbon dioxide produce similar effects to the psychedelic drugs like LSD or ayahuasca or whatever the shamanic people are using if inhaled in higher amounts?

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000
 Are you aware of any studies that compare them in that way?

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
 No.

 Just to follow up, one last question. You mentioned you had a tank of carbon dioxide next to you last time we talked, and I got a dozen emails about how specifically you were using it. Do you want to share that info?

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:49.000
 When the weather is so cold, I sometimes sit at the computer with my legs in a big plastic bag plumped up with carbon dioxide. It helps to increase warmness.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:56.000
 I need to try that. Thank you for that, Ray. Parting words, Georgi Dinkov.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:12.000
 As you should, stay safe and stay healthy, I guess, because if things are getting more authoritarian, I think it will be harder for people to spend enough time watching their health, but it becomes that much more important.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
