00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.760
 Well, a very pleasant good morning to you and we're back here, if you were with us,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.720
 with Dr. Massey with a very popular guest.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840
 His name is Ray Peat.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840
 Raypeat.com.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.960
 Dr. Peat is a PhD in biology, University of Oregon.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.000
 He specializes in physiology and he taught at the University of Oregon, Irvine College,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.560
 Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.760
 Talked down in Mexico, worked in Mexico, had some nixtamalized corn.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.240
 He talked, told us about nixtamalization of the corn tortillas in Mexico and he's a good

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.240
 one.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.400
 He has a newsletter we'll tell you about and he visits on the third Monday of every

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 month.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.720
 Dr. Ray Peat, good morning, sir.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.000
 Dr. Peat Good morning.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.040
 Dr. David J. Massey How is your life up there in the Northwest?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 Dr. Peat Oh, it tends to get a little boring, but that's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.680
 better than other possibilities.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.120
 Dr. David J. Massey Are you still painting?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.120
 You're still painting?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 Dr. Peat Oh, yeah.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.720
 Dr. David J. Massey Uh-huh.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 That keeps you busy, huh?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.200
 Dr. Peat Yeah.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.360
 When I get tired of reading and writing, I've got something to paint on.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.360
 Dr. David J. Massey Yeah.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.680
 Have you been working on anything special these days?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 Any ideas special?

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 Dr. Peat Yeah.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 I've just started working on this month's newsletter, which will be something related

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.560
 to unsuspected, generally unrealized effects of estrogen on metabolism and things that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 it does to promote aging and that I haven't talked very much about in the past.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.240
 Dr. David J. Massey So when we get too much estrogen, the body

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.200
 doesn't like it and we age?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.320
 Dr. Peat Yeah.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:28.080
 One of my early observations was that the doctrine of age-related decline in estrogen

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:38.680
 was a simple mistake based on measuring only the estrogen that's found in the blood itself.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.880
 Because with progesterone, the way they measure progesterone is to separate the liquid part

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.440
 of the blood from the fat and the red cells.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.400
 It turns out that most of the progesterone is in the fat part of the blood and the red

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.240
 cells twice as much inside the red cells as in the serum.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.800
 So what they're doing is throwing away most of the progesterone and then measuring what's

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.560
 in the fluid part of the blood.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.120
 And it's even worse with measuring estrogen because when you're low in progesterone, a

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.920
 whole group of enzymes shift their activity.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.700
 Progesterone pushes them in a direction that neutralizes and eliminates estrogen.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.960
 So if you're deficient in progesterone, this whole group of enzymes increase the activity

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:52.080
 of estrogen, but inside cells, the function of progesterone is to get estrogen out of

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.680
 the body and so it will appear in the blood as it heads for the kidneys to be excreted.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:10.400
 But without progesterone, estrogen accumulates and is synthesized de novo inside cells, muscle

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:22.840
 cells, fat, brain, liver, breast, uterus, every tissue you can identify concentrates

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.800
 estrogen more and more with aging.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:38.120
 So by looking at the blood, if it is staying inside cells at a higher rate and not appearing

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.240
 in the blood, you get exactly the opposite impression of what estrogen is doing during

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.800
 stress and aging.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.760
 So the basic way sometimes now it's being measured with bioidentical hormones and the

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.240
 things that ladies are doing could be not correct, not accurate.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:12.320
 Yeah, already in 1970, I was grinding up uterine tissue that was under the influence of estrogen

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.440
 and extracting it in a solvent and then measuring that.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:28.600
 And a person working in the same lab, Terry Parkinning, went on to work in the University

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:38.560
 of Texas where he had much better equipment and confirmed the same thing that estrogen

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.640
 increases wherever he measured it.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.280
 It was increasing with age, same thing I found.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.800
 But you have to go about measuring it in the right way.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.640
 And what's the right way?

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.320
 To extract what's in the tissues.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320
 Does anybody do that?

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.040
 Only three or four people in the world as far as I know.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.000
 So that's why over the years I've had so many emails with ladies that work with these

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.960
 bioidentical hormones and some have okay and some just don't have a good experience with

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960
 it at all.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.920
 They're just constantly adjusting it, constantly back and forth.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:32.200
 I've never seen anyone who was actually demonstrably deficient in estrogen.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:44.640
 Old men, for example, or a man who has been in an accident or had a heart attack, even

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.760
 their blood level will then show a very high level of estrogen.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:58.080
 But to really know what a person is subject to, you have to take a bit of cellular material

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.160
 and actually test it.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.480
 So how do those ladies, especially the ladies but even guys sitting here in the cheap seats

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.320
 in the bleachers, how do we utilize this information with progesterone and estrogen to help us

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.320
 to feel better and live longer?

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:27.680
 If you supplement progesterone, it will then release estrogen from the tissues so it can

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.320
 be measured in the blood.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:41.600
 Otherwise you just have to be very cautious and realize that the effects you get when

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:52.000
 you supplement very large amounts of estrogen, starting often before menopause but very often

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.240
 after menopause, they'll give women super doses of estrogen.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.840
 It acts on the brain very much in the way cocaine does.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:10.720
 It turns on excitatory pathways.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:18.880
 Going back to the '30s, it was recognized that in the phase of the menstrual cycle when

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:28.200
 estrogen is highest, at ovulation and around menstruation, the ratio between estrogen and

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.600
 progesterone is highest.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:38.320
 Those are the times when women have epileptic seizures and that's been known now for at

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:51.920
 least 80 years and it's because of the excitatory effect of estrogen on the nerves.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:09:00.600
 So that's why you've been often just recommending men and women take a little bit of progesterone

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.120
 every day even if we're not too sure.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.360
 It can't hurt, right?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.880
 And both men and women always are making progesterone.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:22.520
 In the brain, the concentration is usually 10 times higher than in the bloodstream.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:32.360
 So you might not seem particularly deficient if you measure only the liquid part of the

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:42.560
 blood but a little dose can go right to the brain and have tremendous beneficial effects.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.840
 And how many milligrams are we talking about a little dose?

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.600
 Oh, sometimes five milligrams is enough to produce.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.600
 Just five?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 Yeah.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:57.680
 There are people out there thinking you've got to have 50 for something to happen but

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.680
 seems like a lot.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:10.880
 Yeah, 50 is in the range of a therapeutic dose for someone with arthritis or seizures

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.080
 or migraines, something like that.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:25.820
 And for cancer, people have used hundreds of milligrams and in the usual way of administering

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:33.560
 progesterone because it's very insoluble in water.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:43.240
 The industry has since the 1940s claimed that you can't take progesterone orally because

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.640
 they said that stomach acids destroy it.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:53.920
 That was just to sell their injection products.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:59.640
 So is there a downside to doing too much progesterone if you don't need it?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:08.200
 Yeah, it can make you drunk or unconscious if you take hundreds of milligrams.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:16.080
 How does progesterone-estrogen balance men and women play into, say first breast cancer

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.040
 for gals and then overall sleep issues for men and women?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:33.080
 I was just looking at a recent article by well-known researchers that reviewed the history

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:39.440
 of estrogen therapies.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:49.620
 It was that there's sort of a dogma in medicine that they have the true history of what the

00:11:49.620 --> 00:12:00.920
 understanding has been of estrogen, but really all along since 1940, the pharmaceutical industry

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:08.440
 has been training the government regulatory agencies and the universities and the journals

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:15.480
 to sell their products, not to pay attention to the actual science.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:27.480
 But starting in the 1930s, the carcinogenic effects and the pain-inducing effects and

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:36.800
 the pro-inflammatory effects of estrogens have been identified very clearly.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:44.720
 The abortifacient effects, everything that was known about estrogen scientifically before

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:54.560
 1940, showed its extreme biological riskiness.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:02.560
 One researcher did thorough tests over a period of 10 years and showed that every tissue in

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:12.400
 the body, if you give a small, continuous dose of estrogen, it's carcinogenic in sequence

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:19.880
 according to sensitivity to all of the tissues of the body, starting with the uterus, then

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:29.000
 the breast, then the pituitary and lungs, then the kidney and liver and eyeballs, brain.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.400
 Everything has its sensitivity to being cancerized by an uninterrupted dose of a small amount

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.120
 of estrogen.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:48.640
 That was thoroughly established by 1950, but the current medical understanding is that

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:59.120
 there was no fear of estrogen being carcinogenic until in the 1970s.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.680
 It was unavoidable seeing that it was causing uterine cancer, and they thought or claimed

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:13.640
 they took care of that by giving synthetic progestin along with the estrogen to prevent

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.560
 uterine cancer.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:26.880
 It turns out many years later with the Women's Health Initiative in 2001 and 2002 that the

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:38.680
 synthetic progestin, if anything, exacerbates the effects of estrogen, not only causing

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:45.400
 increased breast cancer as well as uterine cancer, but increasing heart attacks, strokes,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.640
 dementia, Alzheimer's disease.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.040
 What do we do before we ask about sleep, Dr. Ray Peet?

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.400
 By the way, we're Dr. Ray Peet, and we are live here.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.720
 It is July 19, 2021.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.800
 If you care to be on the show, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:08.720
 We're on the 800 number, so we can't use that.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.440
 I should have called him on the other line.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.840
 Just use the email, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:19.640
 Dr. Ray Peet, what do we do day in and day out or just in our life of living on planet

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:29.200
 earth to exacerbate the problem of having too much estrogen regardless of our age?

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.600
 Do we eat, diet, or lifestyle?

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.840
 Do we do things?

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.840
 Yes.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:47.760
 The things that already in the 1930s and '40s, the polyunsaturated fats were known to intensify

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.800
 the effects of estrogen.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:16:01.920
 The Schutt family, starting in the 1930s, Wilfred Schutt was one of the later, the son

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:14.680
 of the original Dr. Schutt, identifying first estrogen as a pro-clotting factor exacerbated

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:26.160
 by the breakdown of the polyunsaturated fatty acids and the role of vitamin E supplements

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:34.320
 as first an anti-estrogenic factor, a fertility factor against the sterility-inducing effects

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.440
 of estrogen.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:46.080
 Then vitamin E, under the influence of various industries, vitamin E was relegated to the

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:53.920
 status of an antioxidant only against the polyunsaturated fats.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:04.680
 To interpret vitamin E correctly, you have to see that the anti-estrogen effect was equivalent

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:17.160
 to the anti-liquid peroxidation effect of the unsaturated fatty acids.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:24.720
 Great mythology was created under the influence of the pharmaceutical industry promoting their

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:35.560
 new wonder drug, estrogen, to prevent aging.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:44.360
 A couple of doctors at Harvard promoted the idea that being feminine is what makes you

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:52.880
 able to have babies, and if estrogen is the female hormone, then supplementing it makes

00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:01.960
 you more feminine in the sense of being more able, more fertile, less likely to have miscarriages.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:09.320
 They promoted the whole horrible DES catastrophe.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:15.400
 So then estrogen plays a role, if too much, for guys especially, then the testosterone

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400
 levels go down.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:26.040
 When a man is under stress, every sort of stress, but accumulating polyunsaturated fatty

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:32.680
 acids is a chronic, age-related source of pro-estrogenic stress.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:41.640
 The more stress a man is under, the more his various tissues start activating aromatase

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:50.600
 that turns testosterone into estrogen, and what he has to do protectively besides getting

00:18:50.600 --> 00:19:02.080
 the polyunsaturated fats out of his tissue is to shift the balance away from stress to

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.760
 things that inhibit aromatase rather than activating it.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:17.360
 Polyunsaturated fats through the prostaglandins activate aromatase, so aspirin blocking prostaglandins

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:26.640
 blocks aromatase and will raise testosterone when you're in a stress state.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:35.920
 Progesterone is another direct action against the activation of aromatase.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:45.400
 Aromatase-induced cortisol activates not only the prostaglandins, but direct action on increasing

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.400
 aromatase function.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:57.000
 So then that would tie into maybe the sleep idea, if we have too much cortisol.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:06.400
 So, because we've had some emails this morning about insomnia, what can you tell us there

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:12.040
 regarding progesterone, estrogen, maybe aspirin as far as people having a hard time with too

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.520
 much cortisol at night going into sleep?

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:26.920
 If your liver is under-functioning, it can't store enough glycogen to provide glucose to

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.000
 keep your brain working during the night.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.200
 When your glucose falls, adrenaline, histamine, and cortisol in sequence arise, each with

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:45.240
 an excitatory effect on your brain.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:52.200
 This thyroid hormone is essential for using and storing glucose.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.000
 If you're low in thyroid, your liver isn't going to have enough stored glucose to get

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.080
 you through the night, so your histamine, adrenaline, cortisol, and serotonin, all of

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:12.000
 the stress inflammation factors will increase.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.920
 Your body temperature falls protectively when your glucose is low, and progesterone and

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:31.960
 thyroid are able in many ways to keep your body temperature up, your liver storing glucose,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:42.800
 and directly shifting the balance away from cortisol, histamine, serotonin, and adrenaline.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:48.520
 That ties back to the thyroid again.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:58.240
 Low thyroid people have been studied with brainwave sleep analysis and found that if

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:07.800
 you divide the type of sleep into four phases, hypothyroid people never get below the superficial

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.040
 second phase of sleep.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:17.480
 So they wake up unrested, achy, and fatigued.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:26.560
 It takes thyroid and progesterone as very central factors for achieving deep, restful

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.760
 four phases of sleep.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.120
 Fascinating.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.640
 Back to the thyroid again.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.600
 Here's an email, and let's jump on this one before we do a first break, because as long

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.520
 as we're talking about it, I think you'll be able to help this person.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:55.760
 Let's see, "I bought some progesterone cream, 5% 50 mg per pump to try before I eat my meals.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.720
 My question is, my insulin levels are low already.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.640
 I am at 2.2 right now.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.760
 So if I start taking this progesterone to block some adrenaline because I have all the

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.960
 other symptoms, will it have an adverse effect on my already low insulin levels, or is it

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.920
 just that my insulin is already under control?"

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:27.600
 Yes, a healthy person is able to oxidize their glucose without producing a very large amount

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:35.040
 of insulin, so you have to know what the conditions are when the insulin is measured.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:46.120
 It could be very good to have low insulin if you're still able to oxidize your glucose.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:55.520
 One thing with the creams is that a lot of them simply have micronized progesterone suspended

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.800
 in an emulsion of a cream.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:08.360
 So what they're doing is spreading a very fine powder on their skin with only part of

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:14.760
 it being functionally dissolved in oil so that it can get into the bloodstream.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.440
 Wow, so how do you know?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.040
 You'd have to really explore whatever cream you're using to make sure it's the good

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.040
 stuff, huh?

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.040
 Yeah.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:36.280
 I found working in the lab that if I accidentally got my whole hand and arm covered with micronized

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:45.120
 progesterone, I could quickly taste it in my nose and mouth.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:56.080
 There was a sensation, but that was using maybe a thousand milligrams of progesterone

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.200
 spread all over a part of my arm.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:07.360
 But if you're only putting on 50 milligrams and most of it is still in the crystalline

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:18.480
 micro-pulverized form, then you're only going to absorb maybe 2 or 3 percent of what

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.680
 you put on.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:27.200
 So that's why you have developed a product called Progest-Ease, right?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:38.520
 Yeah, when you eat oily foods and vitamin E, the vitamin E travels with the fats in

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:51.840
 your food and is quickly and efficiently entered into the chylomicrons, a particle of emulsion

00:25:51.840 --> 00:26:02.040
 that is taken up through the wall of the intestine into your lymphatic system, flowing directly

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:09.400
 into your main blood supply and circulating through the body before it reaches the liver.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:18.800
 But if it's in the powdered micronized form, it isn't delivered into the chylomicron system,

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:29.560
 but slowly some of it sticks to the lining of the intestine and superficially releases

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:37.720
 molecules into the portal circulation carried to the liver, where the liver attaches either

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:45.240
 sulfuric acid or sugar to the progesterone, making it water-soluble.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:53.800
 So taken in the powdered form, most of the progesterone circulating in the body will

00:26:53.800 --> 00:27:02.840
 be in a water-soluble form, ready for excretion, and very different in function from the oil-soluble

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:14.040
 form, which is how your various ovaries, for example, are preparing it so that it circulates

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:19.280
 with the fats and blood cells.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:26.920
 In a way, the chylomicrons, just as much as the red blood cells, are able to pass repeatedly

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:35.800
 through the liver without the progesterone being exposed to the inactivating enzymes.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:45.360
 So chylomicron-carried progesterone imitates the body's way of distributing it through

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360
 the body.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:51.740
 And the creams then, how do they relate?

00:27:51.740 --> 00:28:00.720
 Some of it gets exposed to the bloodstream, where it meets the red blood cells and lipids,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:23.320
 which are the red blood cells that are the most likely to be exposed to the red blood

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.320
 cells.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:31.520
 And that means that if you put a little bit of olive oil on your skin or vitamin E on

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:40.680
 your skin with the cream, you're going to dissolve more of it and let more of it get

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.160
 through into your bloodstream.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160
 Interesting.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.960
 So, is it a good idea in general for the oral listeners to take a little vitamin E every

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.000
 day, do you think?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.960
 It doesn't hurt to take 10 to 50 milligrams a day.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.040
 And it would be the mixed tocopherol things?

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:11.200
 Yeah, those are the safest and least likely to have a lot of extraneous additives like

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.960
 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:19.400
 And so, but the product that you helped create, this progestease, it's got the vitamin E

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.720
 and the oil in there, right?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.760
 Yeah, vitamin E and coconut oil.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.760
 Coconut oil.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.920
 And what's the dosage on that?

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.320
 Because I've got some, but how do you know how much to take of that?

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:40.360
 You can tell just putting some on your finger and rubbing it on your tongue or gums and

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.600
 lips.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:50.360
 You can usually feel a sense of well-being within five or ten minutes of taking it.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:55.320
 And how many, like if you're taking like a quarter of a, would you take as much as a

00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:00.680
 quarter of a teaspoon of the progestease or how many milligrams are you getting?

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:07.680
 Some people feel like they're semi-anesthetized with as little as a fourth of a teaspoon,

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.080
 which is 100 milligrams of progesterone.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:16.680
 So in the progestease, let me write that down, a quarter tea is 100 milligrams.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680
 Yeah.

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.680
 Okay.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.680
 Yeah.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.960
 Well, tricky biz, huh?

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:37.480
 Yeah, that's very often a therapeutic dose for a migraine or a mild seizure or for arthritis.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:43.800
 Curious, how is it affecting arthritis?

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.800
 What's going on there, the progesterone?

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:59.320
 I don't really know all of the things involved, but studies of knee joints, for example, with

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:10.520
 rheumatoid arthritis, an Italian named Cutolo, that's his last name, has done detailed studies

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:20.360
 and found that estrogen is being produced in the arthritic joint and there's very high

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.880
 concentration there.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:31.400
 And I think what's happening is most likely that the progesterone is inactivating the

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:41.960
 aromatase intrinsic to the inflamed joint when you anoint the joint with progesterone,

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:49.440
 vitamin E and olive oil or the whole leg around the joint.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:58.760
 Sometimes the inflammation and redness and pain will be gone within an hour or two after

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.040
 anointing the whole leg with the progesterone solution.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:13.400
 And I think the only way it can explain such a rapid and complete effect is that it's knocking

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.720
 out the aromatase, which is the center of the problem.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:26.760
 A friend of mine used, I think it was 500 milligrams applied to his whole leg.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:38.280
 He had a huge red inflamed joint that disabled him every afternoon for several weeks at that

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.280
 time.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:46.120
 That afternoon, the joint cleared up before bedtime.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.040
 Next day, he didn't have any soreness in his knee.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:56.320
 And I knew him 40 years after that, he had never had a return of arthritis.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:04.080
 Ha, could the progesterone be used for sleep if the thyroid is not happy or would you just

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.000
 be wasting your time there?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.560
 Yeah, pretty much it's a waste.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.600
 You get a temporary relief.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.320
 It increases your temperature and deepens your sleep.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:24.760
 But the basic thing is to correct the thyroid which is required for keeping your glucose

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:34.720
 up, producing carbon dioxide, reducing lactic acid and histamine and the whole cause.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.440
 The whole cascade thing.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:43.480
 And again, so to recap on your thyroid, you're still a big, you focus just on the THS.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.480
 What is it?

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.480
 THS.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.640
 T3 of the thyroid?

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.640
 No I mean the main number.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.080
 I don't even know what that number is.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.800
 In the thyroid test, what is it?

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.800
 Oh, the TSH.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800
 TSH, sorry.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.560
 I just escaped my consciousness there.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.240
 So you really like to focus on that, the TSH, right?

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:13.000
 Yeah, that should be, for example, when they have studied a population of generally healthy

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:20.960
 people, no symptoms, no thyroid cancer or other thyroid disease, they found that they

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:29.880
 had below 0.4 on the TSH test.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.880
 Below 0.4?

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880
 Yeah.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.880
 Wow.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.320
 That's pretty low.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:42.480
 Many doctors won't prescribe thyroid even if you have a 3.0 on the TSH.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:51.640
 But I've never seen anyone that I would consider healthier that was free of symptoms if their

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:57.160
 TSH was even 2.0.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.640
 They always have some problem.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:06.120
 So is there any way, if you had like a TSH of 2 or 3 or something, to work with that

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:13.640
 other than taking, just go ahead and take the thyroid meds, just take it, take thyroid?

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:21.600
 Yeah, I think it's good to read Brodebarn's books on the thyroid using the traditional

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.840
 glandular thyroid.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:34.720
 He was very cautious, starting with generally a half a grain, 30 milligrams of the standardized

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:43.400
 powdered thyroid gland, gradually over a period of two or three months, working up to whatever

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:50.800
 the patient needs to function perfectly.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:57.440
 On average, that was two grains, 120 milligrams of desiccated thyroid.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.560
 And why work up to it?

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.440
 Why not just go for it?

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.040
 It just doesn't work well like that?

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.040
 Yeah.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:18.360
 I've only seen it happen two or three times, but even a half a grain over a few days accumulates

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:26.000
 and the powder that you take is about a three or four to one ratio of thyroxine to the active

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:40.560
 hormone and sometimes the inactive hormone can start interfering with the active T3 hormone.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:50.440
 That's somewhat rare, but in middle-aged women, you can more often see the effect of T4 rising

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.760
 along with symptoms of hypothyroidism.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:02.840
 You have to give the liver time to be able to activate, convert the thyroxine into the

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.120
 active hormone.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:11.880
 Another thing that happens is that if you're hypothyroid, your cells aren't able to retain

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.640
 magnesium efficiently.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:27.040
 Magnesium is held inside cells bound mostly to ATP, so if you're not producing ATP very

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:34.480
 fast, your cells don't retain magnesium very efficiently.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:43.960
 And in the absence of adequate magnesium, your ATP is destabilized and so it becomes

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.720
 a vicious circle.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:54.280
 You have to give your body time to assimilate from your regular diet.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:03.200
 As you increase your availability of thyroid hormone, your cells are able to retain more

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.360
 of the magnesium that you're feeding them.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:16.480
 So they become more efficient and stable, then you can handle more and more thyroid

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480
 activity.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.480
 Interesting.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.760
 Have you ever made any connection, Dr. Ray Peet, from the spiritual, mental, emotional

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:34.880
 side of our being and thyroid and why there are so many people mostly low thyroid?

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:45.400
 The low mental energy makes you more susceptible to any kind of stress, emotional or physical

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.400
 stress.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:55.720
 And a lot of people compensate with increased adrenaline, up to 30 or 40 times the daily

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:05.320
 adrenaline production to compensate for the inefficiency that the thyroid magnesium problem

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:09.320
 creates.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:18.080
 They can be very speedy and alert by keeping up this gigantic adrenaline production as

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:21.520
 if they're living on speed.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:29.520
 Other people compensate with high cortisol and that has its effects on your mentality

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.120
 and way of thinking.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:40.120
 Other people don't compensate and they just become sluggish and depressed.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:52.480
 So the low thyroid person is susceptible to various kinds of stress-related problems.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:40:06.040
 When your thyroid is normal, if you experience either grief or any physical trauma, it can

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:16.160
 be enough to turn on the stress mechanism and suppress your metabolism as if your body

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:26.480
 can't confront the magnitude of the injury you're experiencing and tries to retreat

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:35.560
 and go into a sort of hibernation state involving blocking your thyroid function.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:44.120
 In those cases, I've seen a few people taking a small amount of thyroid as well as eating

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:53.240
 well for just a few days who could pop right out of the stress and bring their own thyroid

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.240
 up to full functioning.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.080
 Wow, interesting, amazing.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.080
 Stay right there, Doc.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.400
 Okay, can we take a break here?

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.720
 Dr. Ray Peet, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:16.680
 As you know, I've been hanging around doing talk shows about health.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:22.480
 We began in the late 70s and I've come across a lot of different technologies.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:28.320
 You can imagine all the powders and potions and pills and gadgets that people have wanted

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.200
 me to promote.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.480
 I have over the years some of them.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:40.080
 Most of the things are kind of silly and they never did much, especially the gadgets.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:45.160
 But this technology that we've been working with for a couple of years has been probably

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:50.720
 one of the most beneficial, powerful technologies that I've come across.

00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:57.000
 I've been breathing the hydrogen browns gas for two years now and you drink the water.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:05.680
 George Wiseman created this Aquakir machine and it's really something and it works and

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.480
 it's powerful and you can go to many places.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:16.280
 But I think Tyler LeBaron and Molecular Hydrogen Institute, he's got more peer-reviewed studies

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.440
 on the benefits of breathing browns gas, hydrogen.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.640
 Browns gas is what our machine does, which is a little bit, a little leveraged hydrogen

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:32.360
 a bit, but most of the research has been just on the pure hydrogen.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.200
 So our machine delivers a little bit more.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.440
 It's got more of the idea of the water and the fourth phase of water, the Gerald Pollack

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.440
 work.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.160
 But you can breathe it and drink the water and there's a lifetime warranty on this baby.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.920
 But here's George talking a bit about it.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:54.920
 Did you know the Aquakir browns gas machine reduces oxidative stress?

00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:00.160
 Hydrogen is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.280
 First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.840
 vitamin C, things like that.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.720
 So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.960
 body and go right into the very DNA and repair it.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:21.640
 First of all, you're repairing oxidative damage, but you're also reducing or eliminating free

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.640
 radicals.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.640
 And there are only the bad free radicals, which is another reason why hydrogen is good

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:30.560
 because you actually have free radicals in your body that you want to keep.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.760
 Example nitrous oxide.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:38.800
 The oxidative stress, is that the main thing that damages the DNA and causes the regeneration

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:43.160
 to stop, you know, euthane or getting older, immune organs?

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:48.040
 Is that at the base, George Weissman, of most of the issues?

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040
 It's one of the pieces.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040
 Just one of them.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.760
 And this comes back to that regeneration thing that I was talking about.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.120
 The cells won't regenerate.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:59.360
 You won't have stem cells and that sort of thing if you haven't got enough hydrogen.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:04.640
 And if our body is not generating enough hydrogen, we get dehydrated.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.640
 Dehydrated.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.120
 Lack of hydrogen.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.160
 The AquaCure machine, 10% off, promo code 1RADIO.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:17.320
 Use the promo code 1RADIO, 10% off in our store, 1radionetwork.com.

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.320
 Indeed.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.040
 And believe it or not, I mean, in a month or so, we're going to be thinking about fall.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040
 Can you imagine?

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.040
 Phew, man.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.360
 And when the weather starts to cool off, that's when we really start selling more and more

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:37.960
 saunas because it's just kind of a, you're just more motivated to do a sauna when it's

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.880
 cold outside, obviously.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:45.660
 But we don't like to talk about motivation here because here on 1Radio Network, we encourage

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:50.480
 you and teach and teach ourselves and learn ourselves not to worry about being motivated

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.520
 about doing something.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.520
 Just do it.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:58.440
 Because if we waited until we were motivated to write the great novel or paint or write

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.840
 my screenplay, if I was waiting to be totally motivated, it would never get done.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.200
 So you just got to sit there and do it.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.200
 You know, just do it.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.000
 And before you know it, you're motivated.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.080
 That's the way we deal with it.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.700
 But I don't know how I got off on that.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:17.680
 But it is a time when you'll be more inclined to think about doing saunas.

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680
 So get one now.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.200
 Beat the rush.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.640
 These are great units.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.840
 I'm in mine all the time for what that's worth.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.640
 And I think it's very valuable to sweat with the far infrared rays.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:35.360
 We have a unit called the Relax Sit Up Far Infrared Sauna.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:41.600
 And it's a great price that we're allowed to give only orally.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:44.120
 Don't even put it in print.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.760
 And that's $1,195.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:51.640
 And that's delivered to you in the lower 48.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.440
 And anywhere else, you just let me know where you live.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.440
 Alaska, Hawaii.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:57.920
 And we ship them all over the world.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.600
 And we can ship them to you no matter where you live.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.320
 And it's not as expensive as you think.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.360
 We did one I think to the Netherlands.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:10.000
 I think it was a total of $200 and more.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.440
 So $1,195 to I think $1,395 total to the Netherlands.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.440
 And of course comes with the proper plug for the Netherlands.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.720
 So these are great units.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.040
 I think you'll like it.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.860
 You'll enjoy sitting in them.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.000
 They have different controls.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.920
 So you control how hot it gets.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:32.120
 You can put on one or two of the different burners.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:37.160
 And you could probably sweat every day for the rest of your life and be better off for

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.160
 it.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.160
 Just my theory.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.360
 I have no science behind that.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:45.080
 But you know, it's a wonderful way to detoxify ongoing.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:50.600
 As long as you're drinking plenty of water and get your little electrolytes there, you'll

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.600
 be fine.

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.200
 The RelaxFar Infrared Sauna.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.200
 Just let me know.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:59.760
 The only way to get it is to email me, Patrick@1radionetwork.com.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:05.280
 The RelaxFar Infrared Sauna and we'll hook you up with just the right price, the best

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.440
 price ever.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.640
 And then have some fun.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.600
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is oneradionetwork.com.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:21.680
 We're talking with Dr. Ray Peet who's here on the third Monday of the month.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.800
 And Dr. Peet, we thank you so much for taking the time to visit with us every month.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.360
 We really appreciate it.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.360
 You're welcome.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:33.160
 We really do.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.200
 Here's a question from David in Australia.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:41.400
 And he says, you know, there's a lot of people out there that's kind of demonizing

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:47.720
 the being metabolically acidic, meaning the more acidic, then the more cancer, poor functioning

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.720
 of kidneys.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:58.280
 What does Dr. Ray Peet think about this idea of being more alkaline for health?

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:08.320
 In the limited sense of having a pH of 7.4, our blood should be mildly alkaline.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.920
 But that doesn't mean that the cells should be mildly alkaline.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:26.720
 In fact, the healthy functioning cell is kept in a mildly acidic state, usually 6.8 or 6.9

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.360
 pH.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:40.040
 And the reason the blood is not neutral, is slightly on the alkaline side, is that the

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:53.720
 metabolizing cell is excreting sodium into the blood and the excess is eliminated by

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:59.120
 the kidneys so that the blood doesn't become too alkaline.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:12.400
 But 7.4 is a steady state, a safe level of alkalinity that corresponds to the acidity

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:22.440
 inside cells, which is preserved by exactly the excretion of the base into the bloodstream

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:27.080
 for potential elimination.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:38.200
 If you take a dose of baking soda, sodium bicarbonate, we have enzymes that if the cell

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:47.840
 is deficient in carbon dioxide, for example, because it's hypothyroid, the bicarbonate

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:59.400
 is turned into acidic CO2 by these enzymes and the acidic form of CO2 is oil soluble,

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.480
 so it's retained inside the cells.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:12.160
 And momentarily, taking the baking soda will make your blood more alkaline.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:21.240
 But since the CO2 can be retained inside cells as far as needed, then the sodium becomes

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:30.840
 excess, raises your pH, sometimes a little above 7.4, at which point the kidneys excrete

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:37.920
 it, leaving a net of CO2 retained by the cells.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:48.240
 So you can't think of taking CO2 as leaving a balance of alkalinity.

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.120
 It can leave a balance of CO2.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:51:05.880
 And normally, your nerves and various regulatory systems cause your breathing to be regulated

00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:14.200
 so that you retain enough CO2 to keep the cells acidified.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:24.760
 And if something like anxiety makes you breathe too fast, and hypothyroid people aren't producing

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:36.000
 CO2 at a very high rate, so anxiety or stress is more likely to make a hypothyroid person

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.520
 hyperventilate, throwing off the CO2 they need.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:47.000
 And that then makes your blood too alkaline.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.200
 It's called respiratory alkalosis.

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.040
 And that leads to things like panic attacks.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.520
 Arrhythmia, I know, those kind of things.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:08.700
 So if we just did those little pieces of paper, Doc, and did our urine, is that a test of

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.000
 anything that matters?

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:19.280
 It's good to keep your urine just slightly on the acidic side.

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.800
 Like six or seven, maybe?

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.400
 Six point seven is a good number.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:33.520
 The more protein you eat, the more acidic your urine is likely to be because of the

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:40.560
 sulfate and phosphate in the meat and other proteins.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:46.680
 They make the blood sometimes all the way down to pH 5.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:54.520
 Just being slightly on the acidic side of the urine is compatible with keeping your

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.600
 blood at about 7.4.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.600
 What do you think?

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:03.360
 Do you know anything about the alkalinity of the water or the acidity of the water and

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.840
 how it would affect the body?

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.880
 Yeah.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:16.760
 A lot of minerals in the water will generally make it slightly basic.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:23.160
 If they're good minerals like magnesium and calcium, that's good.

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:32.040
 One of the effects of the mineralized water is that although it can deposit a stony material

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:43.080
 inside your plumbing, at least it's not drawing out zinc and copper and iron and lead or whatever

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.640
 might be in the solder of your plumbing.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:55.240
 It protects you from plumbing poisoning to have hard water.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:54:03.160
 Very soft water can dissolve enough toxic heavy metals to be a problem just coming through

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.160
 your plumbing.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:10.240
 So if your water is too soft, how can that be a problem because isn't that getting rid

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.120
 of?

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:27.520
 It retains enough carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, that the way water dripping into a cave

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:36.200
 will leave calcium stalactites by evaporating.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:47.640
 Having dissolved calcium from the stone, it will deposit them and if the water is naturally

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:54.000
 absorbing a little bit of CO2, it's able to dissolve minerals.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:01.640
 In the case of a cave, it's usually mostly calcium but coming through your plumbing,

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.840
 it will be whatever the plumbing is made of.

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:05.840
 Interesting.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:11.840
 Dr. Ray Peet, here's one, so I don't even know how to say this word, polycosanols.

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.840
 How do you say them?

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.840
 Polycosanols.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.520
 Jason would like to ask you to discuss their benefits.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:30.800
 They are like long chain saturated fatty acid.

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:37.480
 They're usually longer than stearic acid by sometimes twice as long except they have an

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:43.680
 alcohol on the end, less oxidized than the fatty acids.

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:55.520
 So they're less water soluble than the highly saturated long chain fatty acids.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:06.600
 They originally were found in association with vitamin E and when vitamin E was found

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:14.480
 to greatly increase endurance, it turned out that it was that the vitamin E was carrying

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:23.240
 into the body some of the polycosanols, highly saturated waxy material.

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:33.320
 Vitamin E is a good carrier for it and the original ways of making vitamin E by extraction

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:44.360
 from leaves for example, you get lots of the waxy material from the leafy material.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:49.560
 Here's a question for you, Robert in California.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:57.800
 Why does a dozen fructose from juice or fruit cause fatty liver since it can only exclusively

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.280
 be metabolized in the liver?

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:10.480
 Jason Fung and others seem concerned about damage from fructose.

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:20.280
 If you look at some of the, well all of the high fructose liver damage studies I've seen

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:32.000
 contained 5% corn oil, an excessive amount of polyunsaturated fats and then a total caloric

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.840
 excess meaning that you're going to store a high proportion of the excess of fatty acids

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.320
 in the diet.

00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:50.560
 So the setup is biased to create fatty acid poisoning of your liver essentially from an

00:57:50.560 --> 00:58:09.160
 excess of calories and where they're using it to, supposedly to incriminate the sugar

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:12.760
 is having a toxic effect on the liver.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:24.120
 But even worse than that, some of these studies used a particular stock animal food diet that

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:36.040
 was deficient in magnesium for doing their studies with fructose.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:42.560
 I haven't seen the explanation how they explained it away but it was formulated with less magnesium

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:50.240
 than normal making it an especially liver toxic, proofer rich diet.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:59:04.920
 So basically I think it's a setup to sell fatty acids and incriminate the use of sugar

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.280
 in causing heart disease and liver disease and so on.

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:14.840
 This is an email from Thornson, he's in San Juan Capistrano, beautiful place.

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:19.720
 He says, "Dear Dr. Pete, what can I do about severe and capitals depression?

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:29.480
 It's pretty bad and I don't think it has any relation to this COVID but what can I do?"

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:43.600
 Take active thyroid T3 and a good supportive diet of vitamin D and adequate calcium.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:53.360
 Those three work together to lower stress, get your stress hormones down and your brain

00:59:53.360 --> 01:00:05.120
 energy up and sometimes just adding one of those like a large vitamin D supplement will

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.960
 sometimes bring a person out of a major depression.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:19.360
 But the whole group, good diet, lots of calcium, adequate vitamin D and active thyroid together.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.120
 It gets you going.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:30.120
 So you like calcium rather would be milk, right?

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:33.480
 Yeah, low fat milk in particular.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.560
 Why low fat?

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:51.040
 It's more active, the sugar component works with the high calcium more quickly to activate

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.960
 your metabolism.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:02.080
 Your body temperature tends to increase, oxygen consumption increases and if you used whole

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:10.060
 milk for example, the amount of fat would not only be fattening but it would slow your

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.360
 metabolism slightly.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360
 Actually slows it.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.040
 Here's an email from Rose, she's having a hard time.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:24.160
 Well her daughter is 38 and back in October 2020 decided to have a tubal ligation and

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.160
 now she's experiencing great hormonal changes, PMS symptoms, anxiety, anger issues, night

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.680
 sweats.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:35.760
 What can she do to counter these symptoms from having this ligation?

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:44.760
 I also did the same thing and I wanted her but not having any more children outweighs

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.360
 the risk in her mind anyway.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.760
 Thank you very much for any service.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:02:01.520
 In the 70s, I was studying the effects of the IUD on animals and how it works.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:10.920
 In effect, it increased their uterine estrogen exposure causing miscarriage.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:19.240
 But then around 1980, two different studies independently found that men who had had a

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:29.080
 vasectomy, what pushed vasectomy impotence and other sexual symptoms, they found were

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:35.440
 associated scanning all of the relevant hormones.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:43.080
 The only deficiency they saw was in progesterone and supplementing the progesterone corrected

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:54.640
 the impotency by getting the ratio proper between progesterone and the stress hormones.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:04.920
 Almost simultaneously, I think it was 1980, a similar study in women found that having

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:12.120
 the tubal ligation, a lot of them went into depression right after it.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:20.480
 In surveying their relevant hormones, they found that progesterone was the only deficient

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:31.440
 hormone and supplementing that, if their ovaries were okay, the supplement could get their

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:38.600
 ovaries back to producing a normal amount of progesterone and correct the high ratio

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.000
 of estrogen to progesterone.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.520
 Dr. Ray Peete, we're live here, July 9.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.980
 Here's a good one for you.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:52.880
 What is the highest dose of vitamin D3 in international units and one can supplement

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.320
 daily over long term, maybe all his life?

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.240
 And what would be the benefits to taking higher doses of D3 daily over the long term?

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.400
 I notice that I feel significantly better every time I increase the dose and in recent

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.640
 podcasts you mentioned that higher doses of D3 can be a buffer for stress.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:20.160
 Yeah, I think 5,000 units a day is the most I would want to take year round, year after

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.160
 year.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.360
 5,000 a day?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.520
 Yeah.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:32.240
 I've known people who for two weeks or so would take 10,000 a day to get out of, for

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.400
 example, rheumatoid arthritis and depression.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:39.280
 And I wonder how much, I guess we get our share in the sun, right?

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.080
 But I guess you'd have to get pretty geeky to figure out exactly how many units you're

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.080
 getting.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.480
 Yeah, if you're exposed to good sunlight with a lot of skin exposure.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.080
 On your skin, right.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:59.000
 Yeah, you can make something like 10,000 units in a day.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
 Here's one for you.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.760
 Are caffeine pills a good alternative to coffee if they are used with plenty of sugar or milk?

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:12.720
 They're much cheaper, a way to reap the powerful benefits of caffeine.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.640
 An alternative, did you say?

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.160
 I think this person is wanting to know if the caffeine pills would be an alternative

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.160
 to coffee.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:25.000
 Do you want to pick up a little whatever caffeine does?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:33.240
 Except that there are lots of good things in coffee, anti-inflammatory things and nutrients

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.680
 that you wouldn't be getting with caffeine.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.880
 So generally coffee's a pretty okay food for people?

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.000
 Very good.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:52.520
 Many studies have found that the more coffee a person drinks, they usually say five cups

01:05:52.520 --> 01:06:00.080
 or more, that lower the liver disease, that lower the dementia and so on.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:01.360
 That's interesting.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:11.480
 Progressive increase from zero to one or two cups with the best benefits from five or more.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:20.400
 And to a great extent, it's supporting your thyroid function, lowering nitric oxide for

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.040
 example which blocks your mitochondrial respiration.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:32.600
 And so the combination of coffee and thyroid are protecting your mitochondria which protect

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.800
 your liver and brain.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:41.800
 Here's a person who's had plenty of benefits they say from vitamin K2 supplement, maybe

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800
 one milligram.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:49.800
 But many have said that over long term, K2 supplementation can cause the jawbone to increase

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800
 in size.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.800
 I prefer not to have that.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.480
 What is your opinion?

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.000
 I haven't heard that.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:10.080
 The jawbone is, the facial bones in general do tend to have the capacity to increase with

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.800
 age but under stress, they atrophy with age.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:23.200
 And so especially the lower jawbone very often shrinks to the point that the teeth are lost.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:33.920
 But with the right balance, the face can get thicker bones with aging.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:41.320
 And vitamin K does protect the bones and since the facial bones are especially, the skull

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:49.760
 and face are susceptible to stress-induced changes.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:57.600
 You might see strengthening of the jawbone in particular with regular supplementation

01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:58.600
 of vitamin K.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:06.200
 What it's doing is keeping calcium out of your soft tissues, especially your arteries

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:11.760
 and brain and keeping it in the bones where it should be.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.480
 Which is where we want to run.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:17.120
 Ben writes in to Dr. Pete, "Prayer, your last show with Patrick.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.720
 I've tried adding some orange juice to treat type 2 diabetes but it has raised my blood

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.840
 sugar.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:30.520
 What is your OJ protocol to use that will begin lowering it?"

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.720
 It has to go with generally good nutrition.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:44.960
 Knowing that your calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid and sodium intake are all good.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:55.600
 The potassium alone component of orange juice works to some extent exactly like insulin

01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.080
 to help cells take up glucose and oxidize it.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:12.920
 And the flavonoids, the colorful components of orange juice, give it a bitter taste when

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.560
 they're excessive.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:20.320
 Those flavonoids have a pro-oxidative effect.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:29.960
 So orange juice is one of the protective things along with caffeine and milk that help your

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.640
 cells to improve their oxidation.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.240
 Excellent.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:54.480
 The white pith of the citrus in moderation as in anything regarding health is it detoxes

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.280
 lymph plus scar tissue.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.400
 I worked for a massage for 25 years so I learned these things as part of my work for the OJ

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:08.960
 workers and I benefit them to ingest white pith from the organic as much as the orange

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.400
 juice.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:19.120
 Actually the orange peel that you use in making marmalade has the highest concentration of

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.000
 the protective flavonoids.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.120
 Yeah, marmalade.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:30.720
 Yeah, marmalade is a therapeutic food.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:36.840
 Has Dr. Pete learned anything since the last time you spoke about what's going on?

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:39.720
 Maybe even say it from these injections.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720
 What have you seen?

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:47.040
 Have you been doing any more than when we last talked about with the potential dangers

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.840
 of these injections for this COVID whatever this thing is?

01:10:50.840 --> 01:11:05.240
 I keep hearing people having the usual heart pains, stroke symptoms, inflammatory problems

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.040
 following their vaccination.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:19.960
 Nothing provable in many of the cases but often they didn't even suspect there might

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:28.960
 be a connection but without any other reason for having sudden heart symptoms and blood

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:40.640
 clotting and vascular inflammatory problems, I think the vaccines are likely contributing

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.640
 factor.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.960
 Yeah, we're going to have Dr. Andrew Kaufman on Wednesday and we'll be talking more about

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:46.960
 it.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.760
 What about human shedding?

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:54.720
 Anything that you have seen that scientifically can prove that there could potentially be

01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.680
 some kind of transference of something in the people that have been vaxxed?

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:08.840
 The evidence goes back before the vaccine that we are always shedding proteins and nucleic

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.800
 acids and even into the breath.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:23.600
 If you put a cold object under your nose and breathe on it, fluid condenses.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:31.040
 It isn't just distilled water but it has hundreds and hundreds of different more or less volatile

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:39.720
 substances that got carried out of your lungs and condense onto a cold surface.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.540
 The same is happening when you sweat.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:50.400
 It isn't just your lungs and urine but your sweat is constantly pumping out proteins,

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:56.480
 nucleic acids and hundreds of other substances.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:04.760
 For years, the FBI has counted on the fact that your fingerprints, the little bit of

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:12.320
 sweat in the fingerprint has excreted your nucleic acids.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:21.040
 Even if the shape of the fingerprint is blurred, they can analyze it and find your DNA when

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.480
 you've handled a document, for example.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.560
 There's just no telling what we're sharing with each other.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:31.240
 These exosomes that Zach Bush and others have talked about, we must be sharing a lot of

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.600
 stuff with everybody all the time, aren't we?

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.600
 Breathing out, breathing in.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.600
 Yeah, yeah.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.960
 With other organisms, other people.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:44.280
 And our food contains all of these things.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:53.440
 And so our body can to some extent choose what it finds might be useful and integrate

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:59.640
 it into our genetic equipment.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.120
 Integrated into our genetic equipment.

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.480
 I like that.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.800
 Yeah, that's nice.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:13.520
 A German lab has for years been studying food nucleic acids and showing that some of it

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.840
 is incorporated into the genome.

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:22.200
 You sent me a video with David Martin and then I sent you one back with Fulmer, this

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.200
 German guy.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.520
 And boy, it's really interesting, isn't it, what's going on?

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:34.400
 And Martin, he's got it down and he's looked at all the evidence that this corona thing,

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:38.000
 whatever they say it is, was not a novel virus at all.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.880
 It was patented, what, 20 years ago by the CDC?

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:54.320
 Yeah, and by people working, the germ warfare lab was working on these things for many years.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:02.440
 Ralph Beric's lab has been working at the University of North Carolina, but in close

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.440
 collaboration with the germ warfare people over the years.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:17.480
 And more than 10 years ago, he described how he was making viruses more toxic, more infectable,

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.440
 more dangerous in line with the germ warfare idea.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:26.600
 This germ gain-of-function thing that they're talking about?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.600
 Yeah.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:37.080
 So taking parts from one virus, like the spike protein, and adding it to a virus that's easily

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:44.600
 infectable, making it more toxic by adding the spike protein to it.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:52.320
 So the technology was there years and years before they started talking about using it

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.320
 in a vaccine publicly.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.320
 Right.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:16:02.200
 And therapeutically, they were talking about using it to kill foreigners, or to make, not

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:12.280
 necessarily to kill them, but to incapacitate them, make them unfunctional for a few weeks,

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:18.320
 preferably not to kill them, so that they're more of a burden on the economy.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:24.600
 Now, some are conjecturing, like Lanka, Cowan, Kaufman, and all the rest of them, that even

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:30.400
 if you make something in a lab and you release it, maybe in the air or something, that the

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.800
 chances of it still living and alive, this protein, and goes into you, and then I see

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.080
 you and then I share it with you through the air, is a stretch.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080
 Do you agree?

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.080
 Oh, no.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.680
 Lab, to say Patrick to Ray Peet.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:17:02.040
 Yeah, the Pfizer manual distributed in December of 2019, or no, of 2020, how to handle the

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:12.600
 vaccination, they warned against a vaccinated person being near or touching or breathing

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:18.440
 on a pregnant woman, because they recognize the shedding phenomenon.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.000
 Yes, but that's being injected, but what about just some kind of germ thing they make in

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.800
 the lab, Dr. Peet, they put it out in the air and they want to kill people, and Patrick

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.480
 breathes it in and then sharing with you without injection.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.080
 Is that model even work?

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:43.080
 Well, we're breathing out those things, and so just breathing on someone or rubbing, touching

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:52.240
 their skin, you're putting whatever nucleic acids you're secreting into their environment

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.240
 and they can take it up.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.800
 So they can spread it that way.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:02.080
 Can I breathe something in that's in the air that was made in a lab and damage me?

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.800
 Oh, sure.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:16.240
 The lab work starts with a real organism, so-called, or a real exosome, whichever way

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.320
 you look at it.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:27.800
 I think all viruses originate as exosomes, particles secreted by healthy organisms or

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:35.600
 sick organisms and circulating through other organisms where they can either be healthy

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.400
 or harmful.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:50.000
 But the lab work mixes these in ways that can do certain things, can be used to carry

01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:04.200
 an antigen to make a protein-based vaccine, which is a more traditional thing that probably

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.040
 is less risky.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:14.360
 The use of the nucleic acid itself that was modified in the laboratory is where you get

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:21.960
 that unknown, unpredictable, and potentially catastrophic biological effects.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.960
 Okay.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.280
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280
 Here's one from James.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.280
 He's in Houston, Texas.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.280
 Hi, James.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.280
 My wife got the mRNA vaccine.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.200
 I'm not vaccinated, no plan on getting it, but back in May, and experienced a period

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:38.960
 of a month and a half of not getting her period.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.960
 Wow.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:45.800
 She finally got it and said it was extremely painful and said it is a genetic thing, not

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.040
 because she got the jab.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:54.680
 She's also anemic and she should be focused on giving her progesterone and supplementing

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:57.920
 thyroid to help.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:04.600
 All of the anti-inflammatory things help.

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:14.000
 The traditional vaccines, the antigen, the germ itself that you want to become immune

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:23.920
 against, if they use that by itself, it wouldn't always produce the desired immune reaction.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:34.360
 They create a deliberately systemic inflammatory condition combined with the specific antigen.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:42.040
 You want a general, strong inflammatory reaction to rouse your immune system so that it does

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:49.880
 recognize whatever the protein is that they're wanting immunity to.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:58.280
 Even an ordinary vaccine containing aluminum hydroxide, for example, as the adjuvant is

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:04.400
 intended to create systemic inflammation, and that systemic inflammation creates enough

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.880
 stress that it can disturb your menstrual cycle.

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:21.440
 It isn't necessarily the very novel threat from the RNA, but simply the antigen effect

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:32.040
 that they add to the so-called vaccine to produce a reaction that can knock out your

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:35.400
 hormones and disturb your reproductive cycle.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:43.440
 Dr. Sutart Bakhti and others are talking about the idea that many people can make it through

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:50.400
 one of these injections, but if you get the second one, is they're really trying to do

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:54.800
 something to promote that it's really very much more dangerous.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.040
 Do you have any thoughts on that?

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:06.160
 Yes, since the spike protein is part of the problem, the adjuvant effect is a basic thing.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:13.800
 This material shares with the old vaccines, but the spike protein is something that a

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:24.120
 very healthy person can dispose of quickly so that between the ages of one and 50, a

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:31.640
 person can contract the COVID virus and hardly notice they have it.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:43.000
 It's a sick person or an older person with weaker general health who is likely to suffer

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.800
 the effects of a COVID infection.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:54.360
 Those are the same people likely to suffer the effects of combining an antigen with the

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:56.840
 spike protein.

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:05.920
 The spike protein simply makes the adjuvant have a deeper, longer-lasting kind of damaging

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:06.920
 effect.

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:11.520
 So, what about all these variants, Dr. Ray Peet?

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.180
 Is this all made up stuff?

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:25.480
 One website has published thousands of sequences showing variations in the genetic makeup of

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:29.120
 coronaviruses.

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:37.680
 You could pick out any one of those and say you don't have enough Greek alphabet letters

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.440
 to name the possible variants.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:52.760
 With any virus infection, it takes a lot of collected data to know whether a particular

01:23:52.760 --> 01:24:03.040
 virus is causing a particular disease and to know whether a new variant is really causing

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.920
 the disease.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:11.960
 It's something that's going to take a long time, maybe two or three years.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.360
 You'd have to really look at it.

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.280
 You'd have to do the whole Cox Postulate thing to prove it and all that, right?

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.240
 Yeah, really.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:26.520
 Just recently I read that some government official was claiming that there really were

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:35.120
 a lot more COVID-related or caused deaths than the figures show.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:43.760
 His point was that someone who had died with a diagnosis of pneumonia caused by influenza,

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:50.240
 the body was dug up and they gave it a PCR test and found a coronavirus.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:58.800
 So they said, "See, there's someone who died from COVID," but there was no evidence at

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:05.840
 all that either influenza or coronavirus was the cause of death.

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.840
 Yes, I understand.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:16.400
 There are so many causes of pneumonia and you can be infected with a dozen or a hundred

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:25.200
 things that might actually contribute to the death, but to prove it, to actually diagnose

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:32.280
 that as the cause of death, no one is even trying that sort of thing.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:40.600
 And I guess you've seen it where they're blaming this Delta variant eruption on all of us unvaccinated

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.600
 people.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.600
 We're the problem.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:49.520
 Yeah, you're unvaccinated people are a threat to society, they say.

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.920
 God love us all.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:59.520
 But the whole, traditionally people recognize that it's irrational to start vaccinating

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:04.480
 people in the middle of an epidemic.

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:13.680
 If anything, it's going to increase the variation and risk of creating new viruses.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.400
 So the whole idea is...

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.480
 Just not right.

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.240
 Here's an email, interesting.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:28.800
 Dr. Rainwater writes an email, "are slightly acidic from picking up CO2 on the way down?"

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:36.520
 Yeah, generally clean water absorbs CO2 from the air and becomes slightly acidic.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:42.720
 Yeah, I think I've done my pH on my Rainwater, Dr. Peet, and I think it's like 5.7, something

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.720
 like that.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:49.200
 Yeah, it's very weak acid, but the pH can be very low.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:52.400
 But that's just from the CO2, so that's not terrible, right?

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.400
 There's nothing that's okay?

01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:03.560
 Yeah, CO2, the acid behavior of CO2 is what keeps us alive.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:13.520
 Even primitive single-celled organisms have been found to need CO2, even though they might

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:23.400
 be an oxygen-independent organism, CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere is part of what's keeping

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.400
 them alive.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:36.240
 So CO2 is really, along with water and proteins, it's the essence of keeping life going.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.240
 This is interesting.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:44.520
 "Please ask Dr. Peet, I get intrusive thoughts and excited mind within an hour or two every

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:50.880
 time I eat any food that has a small amount of fiber, like raw carrots, sugar, apples,

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.440
 sapotes, mangoes, but I do very well on lactose-free milk, white rice.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:59.440
 What can I do to be able to tolerate these foods?"

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:03.240
 Wow, can you explain why he's experiencing that?

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:14.560
 Yeah, very oversensitive intestine, just the action of peristalsis can bring on symptoms,

01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:25.560
 increased serotonin, histamine reactions, just the pressure of increasing peristalsis

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:32.040
 can even cause a headache or such things as he mentioned.

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:41.040
 Getting the sensitivity down, the three main things again, reducing abnormal sensitivity

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:51.200
 and inflammation are the right calcium to phosphate ratio, adequate vitamin D, and enough

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.000
 active thyroid.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
 So the thyroid, calcium, so how do we play with that calcium-phosphate ratio if we don't

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.520
 know what we're doing?

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:15.360
 The main sources of high unbalanced phosphate are nuts, seeds, meat, fish.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:21.160
 Oh, so too much fish can get the phosphate thing out of whack.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:31.080
 Yeah, those meat has extremely low calcium content, very high phosphate, and so if you're

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:39.080
 eating meat or fish and lots of nuts and grains and seeds, then you're likely very low in

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.080
 calcium.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:46.960
 And greens, well-cooked greens, milk and cheese are the...

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:47.960
 Will balance you out there.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.920
 Yeah, yeah, the high calcium foods.

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:55.200
 So if you like fish and you do good with fish and you just like it because it's fun or whatever,

01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:01.200
 you just want to make sure you're getting plenty of greens or maybe some milk, low-fat

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.640
 milk and what else?

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640
 Some cheese.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640
 Some cheese.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:11.680
 Cheese or... and that'll help to balance out the...

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:14.600
 So you think fish is generally pretty good?

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.600
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:19.280
 Kind of fun, really.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:26.680
 I usually put melted cheddar cheese on my cod or scallops or...

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.480
 Just put it right over the top there, yeah.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:31.720
 Yeah, melt it over.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:35.640
 Trent wants to know what your opinion is on the drug metformin.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:42.920
 Life Extension recommends metformin for diabetes as well as extending the lifespan.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:53.960
 I'm very reluctant to recommend it because it works by interfering with the mitochondria

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:58.800
 and I think there are better, safer ways to get the same effect.

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:06.080
 Okay, here's a final one for you, then we'll let you go to work.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:11.560
 Many people recommend that we really want to have two or three bowel movements a day

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:18.640
 according to Melody and what does Dr. Pete recommend for the safest way to help this

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:25.400
 happen without becoming dependent on something?

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:34.200
 Those anti-inflammatory things that I mentioned, good calcium to phosphate ratio is anti-inflammatory

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:39.680
 and makes your intestine happier.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:50.080
 Very mild, well-cooked fibers like mushrooms and bamboo shoots, for example, help to clean

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:59.920
 out the toxins that your liver detoxifies and secretes into your bowel to get rid of.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:06.000
 If you don't have enough stuff moving through your intestine, especially the fibers, the

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:13.040
 fibers will bind and carry out of your body the toxins that your liver has tried to take

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:14.880
 care of.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.960
 And so that keeps your intestine clean and happy and uninflamed.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:29.240
 What about this fiber product, psyllium, is that cool, good?

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.240
 What was the name of it?

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.680
 Psyllium, the psyllium husk?

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:41.600
 Oh yeah, a person with a very inflamed bowel can have side effects, can dehydrate that

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:51.560
 so much that it can be concentrating, but for most people, psyllium is a good fiber.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:58.960
 There used to be a product called AIDS that disappeared with the AIDS epidemic, but it

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:06.360
 was basically a pure cellulose product that was sold for weight loss, but you can still

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:17.240
 get relatively pure cellulose products that help as a non-nutritive fiber that can clean

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.240
 out your intestine.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:24.480
 Here's one that just slipped in here, let's go ahead and grab it if you don't mind.

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.480
 Two questions from this person, good questions, are spike proteins observable on camera?

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:36.760
 And Dr. Pete, has he seen anything on this idea of graphene oxide being in the vaccines

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:39.440
 and the PCR swabs?

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.720
 What was the first, absorbed how?

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.440
 Are spike proteins observable on camera?

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:50.840
 On camera, spike proteins.

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.840
 Observable, I didn't get the last word.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.600
 Observable on camera, in other words, can they take a picture of these electron microscopes

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.600
 and see them?

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.600
 Oh, sure.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:12.400
 That's why they call it the coronavirus, because there's this fuzzy halo around the lump, which

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:23.480
 is how the virus attaches to cells, and that's the spike, this halo that forms a crown, or

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.480
 a corona.

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.400
 That's where the term came from, huh?

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:31.280
 Yeah, so it's based on the electron microscope picture.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.120
 And what about graphene oxide?

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:39.000
 There was this university, as you know, I think in South America that came out with

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.200
 the video and viral, like a million views.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.920
 Do you think there's anything to that?

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.200
 And they said it was on the PCR swabs too, Doc.

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.680
 They say they have the evidence.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:49.680
 I saw the video.

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.800
 What do you think?

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.400
 I think if they had the evidence, they would be publishing it.

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.640
 But they seem to be coy about presenting their evidence.

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:07.840
 So this could have been a black hole that people went down?

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:15.760
 They have evidence that there's interest in using it as a vaccine, but they just haven't

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:21.880
 published what they claim to see as evidence.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:30.000
 They have some undefined electron microscope pictures, but you need more than that to show

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.240
 that it's the graphene molecule or sheets.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:41.320
 Yeah, well I guess when we go through these kind of things for what, a couple of years,

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:44.200
 we grasp at things just because we want some answers, right?

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.200
 What's really going on?

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:57.000
 Yeah, and they're right in putting nothing, no crime beyond the monopolies and powers

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.840
 that are controlling things.

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:08.680
 You can't assume that they have basically goodwill and public health at heart.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:13.200
 Yeah, you know that they don't have our best interest at heart.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.920
 Well sir, it's an honor to have you here.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:15.920
 Thanks for being here.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.680
 We'll see you, I guess, in August.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.560
 And it's rayPeate.com.

01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:26.320
 And he also has a great newsletter, which is, and all you have to do is go to Ray Peete's

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:33.760
 newsletter, and it's plural, rayPeate'snewsletter@gmail.com and you can sign up for that and that comes

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:36.360
 out for every couple of months, right?

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.360
 Yeah.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:42.160
 So if you want to learn more about progesterone and these kind of things, your next newsletter

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.360
 is going to be all about that, right?

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.960
 Yeah, and especially estrogen.

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:47.960
 Estrogen.

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:48.960
 Estrogen.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.200
 All right sir, well you have a nice day up there in Oregon.

01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:52.200
 You stay safe now.

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:53.200
 Okay, thank you.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.200
 Thank you sir.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.200
 It's an honor.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.200
 Thank you so much.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.200
 Thank you.

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.200
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com with Dr. Ray Peete.

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:05.760
 Oh boy, what fun, huh?

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:16.160
 Well, here we are, planet Earth.

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:22.120
 We are doing everything we can, dear heart, to be very careful and selective in the people

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:28.360
 that we talk to because there's just a lot of stuff out there that, even like the graphene

01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:37.160
 thing that you just don't know, and the shedding thing, and you don't know who to believe,

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.160
 right?

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:45.800
 So we try to kind of close in on whatever truth is the best we can here, and so thanks

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:46.800
 for coming by.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.800
 We'll see you tomorrow.

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.400
 You're going to have a good time with Tom Luongo, and I do appreciate your support for

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:57.960
 this website and our show, and there's ways you can do that.

01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:58.960
 Look at our website.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:07.640
 We have all these great things like the sauna and the hydrogen, sulfur, shin blossoms, Thrival,

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:13.360
 Dr. Cowan's powders, and all the different things that we promote.

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:18.160
 This air filter thing is pretty cool, very cool.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:24.200
 And so if you need something and you have a few bucks and you want to spend it with

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:30.000
 us, if you will, it's just oneradionetwork.com and we get a commission when you buy something.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.160
 That's the only way we support ourselves.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:35.120
 And if you don't need anything and you've got a few extra bucks and you'd like to support

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:43.480
 us by sending us 20 bucks a month or 10 or 15 or 30 or whatever, you can do that.

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:49.480
 Just go on the donation page and you can do a one-time donation or you can also set it

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:54.920
 up for a month, every month, 10 or 20 bucks, whatever, and it's good.

01:38:54.920 --> 01:39:04.640
 It really helps us because there has been some, you know, whatever, just thanks.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.520
 I will see you tomorrow.

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.120
 I love you all very much.
