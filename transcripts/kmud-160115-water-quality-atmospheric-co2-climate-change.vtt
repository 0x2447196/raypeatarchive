00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Well, welcome to Ask Your Arab Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 For those of you perhaps who have never listened to the shows before,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7pm till 8pm,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 with a Master's Degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Okay, so I'm going to start the intro a little bit differently this month.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Thank you so much for joining us.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 As always, we'll run the lines, the call-in lines live from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 I'll be very keen to have people asking questions about the relevant subjects

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 that we're going to bring out this evening, but if you do have any other questions, feel free.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 So, let me see here. Let's just get straight into introducing Dr. Peat,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 and we'll go from there.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 I'll explain what we're going to be talking about after we've introduced Dr. Peat this evening.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 So, Dr. Peat, you with us?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Yes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Okay, thanks so much for joining us.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 As always, very happy, very pleased, very honoured to have you on the show,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 giving your time freely, the way you have done countless times,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 not just for us but for other radio shows I know across America.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 For those people who perhaps have never heard of you before,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 I think they're gradually decreasing in numbers as the Internet gets more and more coverage,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 and people spread the truth.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Let's not say the new but the truth about what it is you've been exposing for the last 40 years

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 in terms of mainstream medicine and the ideology and dogma that has pervaded most of mainstream media and ideology.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Would you just let people know where your educational academic background is from

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 and the kind of subjects that you've been specialising in before we open up tonight's topics?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 From 1968 to '72, I studied at the University of Oregon, biology, specialising in physiology,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 especially reproductive, ageing physiology.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Before that, it was linguistics and literature mostly.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Since then, I've been studying the implications of the research I did for my PhD.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I know that your specialty, you say, is thyroid and hormones, reproductive hormones.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 I know we've covered some of the contents of what we're going to bring out tonight.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Tonight's topics, I wanted to carry on with the kind of loosely termed nitrosamines formed.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 I know we've talked about it in food, but also as a component of water.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 So I wanted to get into water quality.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 I've got a few articles to cover and a couple of fairly recent mandates by the EPA

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 and how that ties into the policies that are being formed in America in allegiance with the United Nations

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 and how the United Nations mandates in America are becoming more influential

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 and how that relates constitutionally to how things are actually enacted here in America,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 having a constitution like we do.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 So I wanted to mention a gentleman called Richard Radcliffe,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 and he's a chemist and a water resource engineer, and he's studied water for 15 years or so.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And he states that there's hundreds if not thousands of disinfection byproducts

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 that form when chlorine is added to water to disinfect it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And the scary thing he says that he's studied it for 15 years

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 and that they can only identify about 50% of them and that most are likely to be carcinogenic.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 He said that he simply don't know all the byproducts they're creating by disinfecting water with chlorine.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Now for us, this is a side note, but for us obviously we manufacture medicinal herbs.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 We use spring water. We're very fortunate that we don't live in the city.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 We don't use municipal water.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 If I did, I would be using bottled water or spring water or water from some other non-municipal source anyway

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 because the very idea of having chlorine in the water and creating some kind of medicine from this is abhorrent.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 But what's your view of chlorine in the water and how it interacts with the organic components

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 that are still present even though to some extent it's filtered and micro-filtered

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 and their byproducts and how that relates to human health?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Some city water departments have discovered that it's doable to use ultraviolet light or peroxide,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 hydrogen peroxide or ozone, various oxidizing methods that don't leave any residue.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 In fact, they tend to oxidize and detoxify any of the chemical contaminants that are in the water.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 I did hear from the Redway Water Department that they are thinking, or the Garboville-Redway area,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 our local area here, that they're thinking of using ultraviolet light to start disinfecting the water.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 And Michael, did you have something to say?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 I can comment. I'm actually on the Redway board.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 We do have a spring that's coming on, which is very, very clean water to begin with,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 and we're planning on using an ultraviolet light to disinfect that.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 But the state still makes us chlorinate it after that.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 There's a bunch of different things.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 I think the ultraviolet light does not kill some sort of like jardi or something.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 It's a tough technology to work, and I personally am very, very interested in it

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 because as much as our health is impacted, it's also what comes out the sewage waste is treated.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 And, you know, any chromium, for instance, you have in that,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 instead of being divalent chromium becomes hexavalent chromium, and there's lots of problems.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 We use UV after it as a post-treatment, so everything gets filtered first.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Yeah, I mean, filtration helps a lot, but for city water, the state really makes you chlorinate stuff.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And any of the "spring water" that you're buying, any commercial water you bought,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 has been treated with chlorine and hyper-filtered,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 so it's much more cost-efficient to buy the very best filter you can and use that on the municipal water

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 because they're using municipal water at the water spring.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Even in our local South Fork Mountain water?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Maybe not that, but you'd have to check.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 They're certainly chlorinating it before they're reverse osmosing it.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 I'm not 100% sure, but really check your source,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 and any of the mainstream waters are owned by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo and whatnot.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Oh, yeah, I know, I know. You know that. Smart water.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 Dr. Peat, getting back to you, Dr. Peat, and your take on the chlorination issue.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Well, if you have to use city water, I think it's good to at least let it stand in an open container for 12 hours or so

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 or heat it to drive off as much of the chlorine and organic chlorides as possible.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Do you have any experience either in research or just in the scientific literature

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 about the effects of chlorine reacting with organic compounds to form toxic byproducts?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Not no particular research, but chlorine, it's a very powerful oxidizer,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 and so it reacts with anything, any carbon compound that happens to be dissolved in the water.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 Okay, because the next thing that I found when I was looking at this

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 is that chlorine seems to be somewhat going out of fashion.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 I know that when they pump water through municipal pipework,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 that because the network is getting so extensive now,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 that because chlorine is so volatile, some of the effectiveness of the chlorine has been reduced.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 And so now they're using chloramines, and it's a kind of compound ammonia and chlorine together.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 It's a lot more persistent. You can't just let it evaporate in a container or anything like that.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 And it's extremely hard to filter out, believe it or not.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 I think you have to have a very good quality carbon wrap filter in order to bind those compounds to it.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 But I think probably what was more interesting was that the toxic byproducts from chloramination are far more,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 it was stated as a thousand times more toxic. Have you heard of chloramination?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 Just vaguely, but it's relating to the research that started around 1970 on the nitrosamines.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 The chloramine largely breaks down to form the nitrosamines, the NDMA, nitrosodimethylamine.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 And I think there is pressure from the food and agricultural industry to propagandize that the nitrosamines aren't carcinogenic,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 which they were established to be 40 some years ago,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 because it's profitable to fertilize heavily with nitrogen fertilizer

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 and also to preserve foods with nitrates and nitrites.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 And so there's a lot of propagandistic science publication going on saying that rather than being toxic,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 the nitrites and nitrates and even the nitrosamines, they're not only supposed to be non-carcinogenic,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 but they're now saying that they're even beneficial to the health, reducing heart disease and reducing cancer and helping to build muscle and so on.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Because these are the very things they've been saying are carcinogenic about nitrates in meats that's kept, you're treated with nitrates.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Yeah, that was a big thing around 1970 when they saw that babies that were fed pureed spinach, for example,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 sometimes turned blue because of the interference of the hemoglobin.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Yeah, with making the hemoglobin unable to carry oxygen.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Because it binds to hemoglobin, doesn't it?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Yeah. And the nitrates do that even when we make them internally from proteins under stress.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 But because of the food industry concern about selling their products,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 there has been this reaction saying that it was only a few farms that had nitrate contaminated water that really were causing the baby problems.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Right. And this would have been from a kind of chemical runoff, fertilizer or manure runoff.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 Yeah. And they tried to reduce it to nothing but the blue baby phenomenon and to distract attention from the really universally recognized tumor promoting potential of all of the nitrates and nitrites and nitrosamines.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 I also understand that this compound chloramine is extremely toxic to kidney dialysis patients.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 They can't use water for dialyzing if it's been treated with chloramine and is extremely toxic to fish.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Yeah. Did you hear that Dr. Peat?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Yeah.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Sorry. Okay.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 All right. Ms. Sarah.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 Michael, our engineer has something to tell us about the chloramines.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Oh, well, just that they are super, super toxic in the triclosan hand sanitizers.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 They're all that same chemistry.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 And actually, I first inquired at my water district long before I was on the board about whether we used chlorine or chloramine because I grew up in the Bay Area where they use chloramine.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And apparently our chemical, we asked, the office asked, and our chemical supplier said, I wouldn't even sell that poison.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 So that's someone who sells chlorine for a living.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 He claims he wouldn't even sell that, quote, poison of the chloramine.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 So the Redway Garboville water is treated with chlorine.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 The Redway water, Garboville, I believe is too, but we're separate.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Oh, okay. Sorry.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Yeah. Almost everyone is using chlorine these days, but obviously some people are still using chloramine.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Yeah. Thank you, Michael.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Okay. You're listening to Ask Europe. Dr. Ron Kamey, DeGarboville, 91.1 FM from 730 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this subject of water quality.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 We're going to be getting into global warming and a couple of other controversial subjects.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Let's just leave it at that until we get to the point here.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Okay. So, Dr. Peat, getting on to the potential toxins, if you like, from the byproducts of breakdown reacting with chlorine and chloramines.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Surely, and again, it's a kind of a difficult question just to say what do you do?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Because it really is a consequence of just modern living where we're all living in, well, we don't fortunately.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 But, you know, modern living in cities, having the government take care of your water supply rather than you taking care of it.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 And then the government coming up with these kind of policies like chlorine and chloramine without and having this kind of the lesser of two evils rationale for it.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 That there's far few people hurt from the toxic byproducts and there is that would die from dysentery or some other related, you know, fecal contamination or, you know, that kind of thing.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 How do you feel about city? I mean, you live in Eugene, don't you?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Yes.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 Yeah. Okay. So, do you do anything particularly to your water?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 Oh, yeah. We always filter it. We never drink it straight out of the faucet.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Even though it comes from the Mackenzie River, which is one of the least polluted rivers.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 But just because of the chlorine issue, we never drink plain water.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 And if you make coffee with city water, that's one of the practical ways of filtering it.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Heavy metals are very efficiently bound to the coffee grounds.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 If you make the drip method coffee.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 To the coffee grounds.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Yeah. So that you put in dirty water and you get clean coffee.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 Okay. Interesting. Okay. So, I don't know that Michael said that there was somebody who was on the air.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 I don't know if there is. Yeah. If they're there, let's take them and see.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Okay. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Hey, I'm from Whale Gulch.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Okay. Go ahead. What's your question?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 I want to ask the doctor what his opinion is of medical marijuana and the possibility of its use to everybody.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 For its use for what?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 He said everybody.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 Oh. Oh.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 The community, to the world.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 You know, medical marijuana is a wonderful thing.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 It can ease a lot of difficult situations.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 When I was about nine years old, a doctor prescribed marijuana and gave me a big paper bag,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 about a half a cubic foot of marijuana leaves to make a tea.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 And I took it every day until the bag was used up.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 But I wasn't especially impressed by it.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 My problem was just migraines occasionally.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 But I know it is very good for...

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 You have to be very careful.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 It's a very powerful herb, you know,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 and you want to just take the minute quantities of it in order to get the maximum gentle feeling of the drug.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Okay. Thanks for your call, Carla.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 Okay.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Okay. And also, I don't know if anybody is listening, if they do want to call in,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 please don't have your radio on.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 It really interferes with the dynamics here in the show.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Okay. So, Dr. Peat, I also saw, whilst I was looking at the whole chloramination issue,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 that there was a nationwide study on water treatment contaminants done by the EPA,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 and it reported that chloraminated drinking water had the highest levels of an unregulated chemical family known as the iodoacids.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Have you heard of it? I've never even heard of these things.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 No. No, I don't know.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 So, they carried on to say that some researchers considered the iodoacids to be potentially the most toxic group of water treatment contaminants found to date,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 but they did also say that there's still relatively little research on them.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 So, okay, so that's the water.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 I know that, as I said, kind of municipal entities want to keep themselves covered,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 and that when the EPA allow these things, they're certainly not going to stop using them.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Michael, what did you have?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Oh, that means another caller.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Oh, okay. I wasn't sure if you wanted to say something. Let's take this next caller, then.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Hi, caller. You're on the air. Where are you from?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Hi. I'm in Crescent City.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Crescent City. What's your question?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 I wanted to – I was doing other things when I heard you talk something about chlorine in the water,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 and I've noticed when I take a water bottle of water on a hike with me recently, and I open it up, I get a blast of chlorine, of gas coming out.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 And so what I've started doing is – I have cups of water around the house so I can drink water.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And so what I do now is I fill a cup of water, and then I just leave it sitting around, and it'll out gas.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 And, you know, because chlorine's a gas.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 So there's two products, basically, I guess you would be concerned about.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 One is the gas, which is real easy to get rid of. You don't need a filter.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 You just fill a bottle or a pot and let it sit around for a couple hours or days. I'm not sure how long.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 And then the other thing is the chlorine that's already reacted with biological or organic matters in your water.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 That you might, I suppose, get with a filter, although I don't know how much that is.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Some of that evaporates, too.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 So there's two things. There's the chlorine gas, and then there's molecules or organic matter that's already reacted with the chlorine

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 that's probably not going to out gas, which you might want to filter if you think there's a lot of that.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 But I have a hunch that most of it is the gas.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 And if you just simply let it sit out in the air for hours or days, I'm not sure how long, it'll...

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 And you know how you could tell?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Just try letting it sit out different amounts of time and then put it into a bottle and let it sit in the bottle for a long time.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 And then open the bottle, and you can just smell it.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 I mean, you can smell down to, I don't know, about one part per billion or something like that.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 I think the whole point is the chlorine is actually the main culprit that's actually reacting with other organic compounds to form.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Yeah.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Toxic byproducts.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 And yes, you're right when you say you can cap the product and take the top off, and then the chlorine gas is released into the atmosphere.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 But it's more what we're getting at here, and I'm not saying that we shouldn't do this.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 I'm just opening it up for discussion as part of what we're covering tonight is that the product itself, chlorine,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 produces a lot of toxic byproducts from the organic matter in the water.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Yeah.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 Even at small levels of which some of it is extremely toxic, and the chloramine is even more potent at doing that, so it's even worse.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Yeah.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So anyway, so that's an experiment somebody could do about letting the water sit out different periods of time,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 then putting it into a bottle and letting it sit around for at least a day or two,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 and then open the bottle and see if you can smell the chlorine and see how long it needs to sit around

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 for the amount that you can detect with your nose.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 All right.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 I appreciate your call.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Now, Dr. Peat, you were going to -- I didn't want to cut you off if you wanted to add something to that

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 because there is another caller on the line.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Oh, well, chloroform and other chlorinated hydrocarbons are volatile too, so they will gas out.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Okay.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 All right.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 So we have another caller here on the line.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Hello.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Hi, caller.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Fort Bragg.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Fort Bragg.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Hey, what's your question?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Yeah, just wondered if -- I mean, a doctor might have some information on this, might not.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 I just wanted to add regarding that, and that's what I was wondering about is the best, you know,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 filtration system for everyone, you know, could use right now.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Yeah.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And years ago I was in marketing of water filters.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 At that time we had a very high-quality pressed carbon block filter,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 and that was supposed to be very good for taking out not just chlorine

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 but some of the organic trihalomethane that are produced by having chlorine in the water.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 Absolutely.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 We haven't mentioned those, but you're very right.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 And some other pretty rough stuff, geotriolambic cyst, it would take that out.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 Yeah.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 Well, I've got an answer for you, but I will let Dr. Peat go first because I'm -- I'd be curious.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 One other thing I wanted to add is for someone who doesn't -- you know,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 really can't filter all the different locations in the home,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 probably the best location is the shower because the body is the largest organ.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 That's right.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And you can always take drinking water, you know, out of a shower

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 and put it in the kitchen in a glass container of some sort.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Yeah.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 But anyway, just a couple of thoughts.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Okay.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Good, good.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Dr. Peat.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Carbon does absorb and even destroy some of the compounds,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 but it isn't a complete safety method.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Okay.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Well, I wanted to add to this that we use,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 and I have used this ever since we first started producing extracts,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 probably because I'm British and I knew about it,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 but Royal Dalton is the China manufacturer in England

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 that's produced the fine bone china for over 100 years.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 And they developed and patented a process by which they produce ceramic filters,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 which go down to about two angstroms, I think,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 extremely fine, a submicron filter.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 That's just the outside of it.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 They do a five-stage filter where the outside of the shell is a micro-crystalline ceramic,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 and then they have a silver, like a colloidal silver membrane.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 They have an activated carbon block core with an ion exchange resin part of the filter too.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 So it takes out virtually everything.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 It leaves some minerals in.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 It leaves the taste of the water unchanged.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 It's the only filter that I know of that is actually actively endorsed by the World Health Organization,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 not that I'm endorsing the World Health Organization as an entity,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 because I'll actually be getting a touch on a little bit of that a little bit later,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 but I don't want to get too political with it.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 So the World Health Organization actually endorsed this filter for use,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 especially in third world countries where you can literally take pond water,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 pump it through this filter, which does take at least 30 psi to get a reasonable flow from it.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 It's not something you're probably going to do with a whole house,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 but for a drinking water faucet, it's a very good way of producing excellent quality water

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 that's completely free of giardia, all sorts of cysts.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 It takes out viruses.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 It binds ionically to any of those known positively charged

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 or even negatively charged cations and anions in the water.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 It'll take out all of the metal contaminations, things like, you know, manganese,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 not all of that, but it will take out some of those more toxic ones,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 so mercury and other parts.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 I think it takes out silver and that kind of thing too.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Pardon me.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 They do have a whole house system too.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 They do, but I don't think you're going to get enough flow to get your shower turned.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Another gentleman mentioned showers, and I know there's quite a few different places

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 that have shower heads that are filters with reported water rates, flow rates,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 and reported reduction, especially of things like chlorine, that are available.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 I actually have one on my shower because I used to get such a strong chlorine smell,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 and you get a much, much less chlorine smell after using just--it cost like 20 bucks.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 I got it at the health food store, and it screws in between my nozzle and the pipe.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 Is it just a little carbon block that's--

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Yes, and then it starts--I think it only lasts for a year or so,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 probably depending on how long your showers are.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 Excellent.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 Okay, so you're listening to AskUF Doctor on KMU DeGallagher, 91.1 FM,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 and from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 with either questions related to this month's subject of water quality,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 global warming, amongst other things, and general government control,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 if you like, of what's going on in the health care.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 So the number here if you live in the area is 923-3911.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 If you're outside the area, there's a toll-free number, 1-800-KMUD-RAD,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 or 1-800-568-3723.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 So Dr. Peat, I did want to--and I don't want to get too political,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 but it's an interesting subject because, again, we're an alternative radio show.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 This is an alternative radio station, for crying out loud.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 I think the subject's definitely worth airing.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 At the end of the day, I have seen so much convincing scientific evidence

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 to refute global warming that I think this is a subject that I would like to try

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 and open up a little bit to get to some of the financial background

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 behind some of the mandates that both the EPA and the government are putting into place

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 to basically counter the supposed carbon dioxide threat to global warming.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Because I know--and I wanted to bring this out, Dr. Peat,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 because I know that you're passionately an advocate of carbon dioxide in living systems.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 And the people that I would point the radio listeners to,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 to go on the web and listen to this very, very well-educated

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 and eloquent, scientifically backed up by so many scientists around the world,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 people that have worked with NOAA in America, the North American--North Atlantic--

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 No, NOAA is the--N-O-A-A dot gov.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 It's a North--no, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Sorry. Okay.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 So I wanted to talk a little bit about that because it ties so many different parts

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 of what I know you have got a lot of information on.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 It ties in the financial corruption that there is in the world

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 which kind of makes medicine go in skewed directions, really,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 sometimes not following the science but following the money.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 And I think it's a very interesting subject that needs to be opened up

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 so that we can really hear the full debate about this.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 I think a lot of people, unfortunately, go along with it

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 because it maybe just sounds that we are such an evil species

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 producing such a lot of evil carbon dioxide that we need to be controlled

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 when I know that this particular person, Lord Christopher Monckton,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 who is an English lord, he has actually taken this upon himself

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 as a fairly lifetime commitment to exposing the lies about global warming.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 And if people want to go to YouTube, his name is Christopher Monckton,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 M-O-N-C-T-O-N, and if you typed into a YouTube search

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 "Christopher Monckton, climate change,"

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 you will see quite a number of interviews with Christopher Monckton.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Now, he presented himself at the Paris climate talks.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 He's been to the ICPP, and he delivered a speech to Congress in 2013

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 purely because Al Gore's program, a documentary that he got a Nobel Prize for,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 actually turned out to be so false,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 and there were about 40 different statements in there

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 that were proved to be false,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 that the English government had to take it out of the curriculum in the schools.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 So anyway, it's interesting that there's always more than one side to any argument.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 And whilst I won't just promote any one side,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 the truth is always out there, and I think science is always able to back it up.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 So that's why I really appreciate what you bring to the table, Dr. Peate,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 because you're a scientist, and, you know, people can say what they want,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 but if they don't have the evidence to back it up, it's not really worth too much.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 So the whole global warming thing, your opinion on CO2,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 I mean, do you think we could do with less CO2 in the Earth than we have now?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Do you have much of a voice about the previous levels of CO2

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 and what it meant for plants and humans?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Yeah, there was the Carboniferous Age,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 when there was just tremendous luxury and growth of vegetation

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 because of high atmospheric carbon dioxide.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 One of the things that got me interested in the issue,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 I think it was 1969 that I saw the study,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 correlating the ratio of babies' head size and chest circumference

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 And this was showing evidence that brains were getting bigger as carbon dioxide increased.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And there are several reasons why that would happen.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere helps the body to retain its proper amount of CO2,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 and that inhibits wasteful lactic acid metabolism

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 and stabilizes the nerves so that they can rest more efficiently and so on.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 But I think the general trend of the warming currently,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 the last hundred years or so, is being driven by the sun's normal cycle.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 As far as it can be determined, there are not only the 11-year cycles,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 but probably much larger cycles.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Several astronomers have been showing evidence that the solar constant

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 has been increasing in recent decades enough to fully account for the planetary warming

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 as far as that's been established.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 I saw from the presentation, I think it might have been part of Al Gore's presentation,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 when he got the Nobel Prize for this,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 that there were three main warming periods in the period 1905 to 1913 or 1914.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Two of them did not coincide with CO2, necessarily.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 The third one, which was one of the most recent,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 can be scientifically explained from satellite observations of decreased cloud cover.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 This decreased cloud cover, particularly over the tropics,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 allows solar radiation to enter and strike the Earth and therefore re-radiate.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 This was actually a physical warming attribute.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Actually, throughout the history of known data,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 there is actually very little evidence to support actual global warming,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 but in fact, actual cooling in the last 17 years, the Earth has actually cooled.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 I know they've mentioned 2010, I think, as one of the warmest years on record.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 And more evidence for global warming.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 But I've also seen evidence for Antarctic ice sheets increasing.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 I've seen polar bear species increasing in number, not decreasing.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And what really worries me is the kind of mandate that the EPA would have on carbon

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 and how carbon taxes, folks, carbon taxes are politically boundary-free.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 It doesn't matter how you vote or how you think politically,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 everyone is going to pay carbon taxes.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 And I would put out to you that this global warming would definitely conspire

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 to increase worldwide revenue from global carbon taxation

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 and it would further worsen the plight of third world countries.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Now, it's the third world countries that need energy production,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 whether it's from coal-fired stations or other carbon sources.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 And third world countries are going to be very much disadvantaged by this taxation.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 The first world, the industrialized nations, have already gone through their industrial growth

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 from the benefit of coal, as an example.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 And I think this mandate is yet another mandate to keep the poor poor

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 and to maintain the elitist position that I think people that are in big government

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 and big corporations actually have an exercise.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 So I'd encourage everyone to look at YouTube and to look at Lord Monckton's compelling evidence.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 He speaks before several government entities.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 He's not just out there on his own talking to the people in the church or the street corner.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 So I would encourage people to take a look at the evidence that he has

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 because there's a large number of recognized scientists

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 and they come from places like NOAA and other government agencies even

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 that are saying the evidence is actually not there.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 So I think there is another caller on the line here.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 So let's get this next caller before we carry on with this topic.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Hi, caller. You're on the air?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Hello. I have two things I wanted to ask about, then I want to get off the phone.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Sure. Where are you from, caller, before I--

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 First one is about carbon sequestration.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 My understanding that what they do is if they're not going to cut their tree,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 that tree holds so much carbon and it can--

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 One of these companies that are polluting can buy that carbon and continue to pollute

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 and say, "Oh, but I'm paying for this carbon to be held in this tree."

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 And then my other thing that I wanted to talk about was airline travel.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Everybody just went here or there or somewhere else.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 They got in an airplane and they circled around and they caused all this pollution,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 you know, all over the place.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 How many times did an airplane circle before it lands?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 And then do you remember when the--

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 The very people that attended the Paris Climate Conference talks came in private aircraft.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 And it's well known.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 There's plenty of published evidence here to show these big private commercial jets

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 that were brought in carrying various dignitaries and leaders, et cetera,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 had landed on a private airfield in France,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 and that the whole thing there was an extremely extravagant and costly affair.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 And the people that want to tell you that you should be paying carbon taxes

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 are the very people that are going to be collecting carbon taxes from you.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 So, again, think of alternatives, people.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Don't just go along with the mainstream ideology

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 because if you don't have an alternative, there will be no change.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 So in terms of carbon sequestration and paying to have carbon offset, follow the money.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 That's all you've got to do is follow the money.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 So I don't know. Is there another caller on the air?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 Let's take this next caller and see where it's going.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 I'm here, Southern Humboldt, I guess you'll say.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 Anyhow, I was wondering if you knew anything about the MultiPure filter that's sold around here.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Pardon, can you say that again?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 The MultiPure?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 Oh, the MultiPure water filter?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Yes.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Dr. Peate, do you have any knowledge of the MultiPure water filter?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 No.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Yeah, I think it's a fairly basic--

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 I think it's a carbon block filter.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 Yeah, I think it's--

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 It's supposed to be pretty good and colors a lot of everything.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 Yeah, I think it's rudimentary.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 The other thing is, on global warming, I don't know if it's the carbon or the planets just moving closer to the sun,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 but it does--I don't see how you can say that because the glaciers are withdrawing,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 the ice is melting, and that the overall temperature hasn't been going up.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 I mean, I've heard some of this debate or discussion start back in the 1950s.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 And so I don't know.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 I've been paying a little attention to it.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 And it seems that the overall is getting warmer, which is actually beneficial for the people on the planet.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Now, we have had a lot to do with it.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Every war, every bomb dropped, all the fireplaces, all the electromagnetics in the air,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 it's all involved.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 Let me go on to say--

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Yeah, well, the planet being more inhabitable for people.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 But let me go on to say this, that the EPA now has mandated a ban for 80% of wood burning stoves and boilers in seven U.S. states.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 So--

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 Yeah, Dr. Peat, are you aware of someone being told they couldn't burn wood in Eugene?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 We heard that on the news.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 It's in Oregon, yeah.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Or I don't know, was it Eugene or was it somewhere else in Oregon?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 No, I heard it was in Eugene.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Yeah, Eugene has it.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 But for about 40 years, Eugene every summer was polluted to the point that the death rate from asthma patients peaked during the weeks that they were burning their grass fields.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 And--

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Are they still doing that?

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 It took really about 40 years.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 And what finally stopped that was a gigantic freeway pileup that killed some people who then started suing.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 And finally, the politicians gradually--

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 Well, the wood burning part of it, it's slightly different to me.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 And when you're talking about the carbon tax, it involves the oil and the coal--

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, you're aware of what's going on there in Oregon.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Yeah, almost everyone has stopped burning wood where it used to be very smoky.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 The mills would burn all of their trimmings and sawdust so that the timber industry was really the main source of wood burning pollution.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 But since they cut the forests down, there just isn't that much wood available for heating.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 So I don't think that's as much of an issue as the absence of the forests because forests are a major climate stabilizing factor by absorbing and releasing water and reflecting the infrared and so on.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 I thought it was quite strange that the two most controversial or the two most demonized compounds that the EPA wanted to regulate heavily were CO2 and water vapor.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 And both of those are exhaled by everybody.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 I don't know. I won't say it's a conspiracy, but I'll say it sounds like a conspiracy.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 I think there's a caller calling in here. Let's just see where this next one's going.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, while we're waiting, I remember you telling me about a rain forest.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 I don't know if it was in the south of Mexico or somewhere else in South America, but you said that it had been cut down and then the weather changed and then it became a desert.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 Yeah, just in the last few decades, I saw some of that happening.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 I used to travel on the train and first I would go through a countryside that had just been a few years before deforested and it was rolling green hills.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 Two or three years later, I would go through there and it was, there were canyons cut through the soil erosion 30 or 40 feet deep just in a few years.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 After much of southern Mexico, Oaxaca was deforested. The climate changed so much that they were no longer able to grow corn at every season.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 They could only get one corn crop per year rather than two or three.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 And so the trees were actually bringing in the moisture?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 And stabilizing the temperature.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 In the summer, the area is cooled by the evaporation.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 If you don't have the forest, the temperature of the land increases very sharply in the summer, causing updrafts that create intense rainfall, thunderstorms, rather than a cool, steady, even temperature all year round from the slow evaporation from the trees.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Good point.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Okay, I just wanted to mention also that it's, and we talked a little bit about the United Nations.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 America is part of the founding group of countries that form the United Nations.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 So it's now a United Nation policy and now in the US, the United Nations is dictating policy.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 I don't know how that can be constitutional.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 And now the cap and trade tax proposal, which is in President Obama, his EPA policy shot 40% of coal-fired power stations directly increasing energy costs to Americans.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 An example of skewed data sets providing the necessary means to implement this taxation, which will be unavoidable and have no effect on the target objective.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 But which has a political advantage of decreasing funding from the majority, now Republican donors, which are largely energy corporations and they support coal.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 So is there a political agenda?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 I just want to put that out there.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Again, it's an alternative show and the whole subject of global warming and the cap and trade and the taxation being mandated for every man, woman and child is kind of scary.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 So people really need to think about what it is they're voting on and what they believe in and then look at the facts and the science to make the objective decision.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 OK, there's two callers on the air. So let's get these next caller.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 Hi, caller, where are you from?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 Hello.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 I'm from Madison, Wisconsin.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 Madison, Wisconsin. What's your question?

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 My main question was, my girlfriend has really low cholesterol and she has Hashimoto's.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 And I was curious if gelatin might raise the cholesterol and what the mechanism is for dysbiosis and dyslipidemia.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 OK, Dr. Peake, did you catch all that?

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 I didn't get all of it, but Hashimoto's usually just means low thyroid function, which is more common in women because estrogen inhibits the thyroid and low thyroid then lets estrogen rise.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 And was the rest of the question about the blood count red cells?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 He said that his girlfriend had low cholesterol.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 And Hashimoto's.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 And Hashimoto's.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Yeah, it's 138.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 Right.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 138, yeah, and it's with a fasting, well, it's best to do actually a non-fasting cholesterol.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 But for a non-fasting cholesterol, a good place for it to be at is around 175.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 Sometimes intestinal irritation can affect the liver so much that it doesn't make enough cholesterol.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 Oh, yeah, that was his next question, as he said.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 And how is that influenced by dysbiosis?

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 The endotoxin poisons the liver and lets estrogen and other toxic metabolites increase, but the liver needs available glucose to produce adequate cholesterol.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 And eating fruits, especially orange juice, will often bring a person's cholesterol up to normal.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 And if she replaces her starchy carbohydrates with the orange juice and has about a cup of grated raw carrot at night before she goes to bed, that should help with the dysbiosis by eliminating the starches and doing the carrot salad.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Yes, I think that's the right approach.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 Okay, there's two more callers.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Thank you for your call, caller.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 I was going to ask, like, she's kind of a picky eater.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 She doesn't get very hungry. Would gelatin help her with that?

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 With her appetite?

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 Well, gelatin's...

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 The cholesterol, like, if it would help her gut, then would it then help her cholesterol?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 Well, gelatin will be anti-inflammatory for the intestine, and in that way, it could help her liver be less irritated and thereby make more cholesterol.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 So, yeah, it's probably a good thing for everybody to take.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Dr. Peat, do you have a direct answer for the gentleman in relation to gelatin consumption to increase cholesterol?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 Exactly what Sarah said.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 There you go. Okay, good. We've got two more callers on the air. Thanks for your call, caller.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Let's take this next caller, and where are you from?

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 That's me. I'm from Briceland.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 Briceland. Okay, what's the question?

00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 Doesn't it seem it would be better in the developing nations to encourage more, as the United States should have also, converted to several alternative powers, geothermal, solar, you know, those kind of ideas, rather than just give more money to some corrupted corporations?

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 No, I totally agree with you in California, and the latitudes that get sun exposure, solar energy is fantastic, and that should be a lot more available to people.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 I think geothermal and water is also an option where there's plenty of resource for it.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 But it doesn't make the power companies enough money.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 What I would say is I think the whole EPA mandate is definitely avoidable with good up-to-date filtration.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 You know, the means exist to produce these coal-fired power stations that have zero emissions, and I think the objective analysis is that nuclear is unfortunately the only other option, and that's where we're going with what we've got going right now.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Well, you could also just burn the trash if you have a clean burning scrubber, or anything like you're talking about, for the coal plants.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Of course, of course.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 I think it might as well just even burn trash.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 You could.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 And then come go into our landfills and mine them.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 Yeah, you could.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 Come and separate the metals and everything out.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 I mean, Philadelphia had a pretty good suggestion by their science officer, Dr. Levy, who showed the whole process of how the separation, even of the materials, the metals would go out one way, the glass would go out another level.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 You know, a trash pylexus system would work pretty good, too, if you're going to have clean scrubbers.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Okay, well, thanks.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 You're welcome.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 Composting is really a viable source of heat, methane production, but just heat directly from the compost.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Because I have read a couple of large municipal landfills are starting to do this with methane as a viable byproduct of composting all of the household refuse.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 And Straus Creamery makes electricity from the methane from their cows.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 There you go.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 All right, we have another caller on.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 Let's take this next call.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 Where are you from?

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 My name is Andy Caffrey.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 I'm in Garberville.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 In Garberville.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 What's your call, caller?

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 Well, you know, organisms only evolve tolerances to circumstances that their species evolve through.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 And when I was in high school, I studied intertidal marine biology, and we would measure the temperature, salinity, and pH in tide pools every hour and then go out in the ocean and measure the same thing.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 And what we found is that there's very little change in the course of a day and as the tide withdraws out in the open ocean.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 But there's much more of a change in those things in the tide pools.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 So the creatures that evolve in the tide pools are ureothermal and urehaline, which means wide tolerance.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 And the creatures that evolve in the ocean are stenohaline or stenothermal.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 So we now know that for the last 2.1 million years, the range of CO2 has been between 170 and 290 parts per million, and we're at 400.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 So I hear you making a generalized case about CO2 in plants, but you have to literally look at every species and every ecosystem, and you have to answer the question,

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 how can all these ecosystems that evolved in that range tolerate 400 parts per million?

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 And also you have to look at what's happening with West Antarctica, where its collapse is now unstoppable, and that's probably because it has gotten up to 400 parts per million,

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 and now we're going to face 20 feet of sea level increase this century, and that's unstoppable.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 How can anybody say global warming is good?

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 It's not going to happen.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 What you need to do is you need to look at the alternative validated science from Lord Moulton.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 You go ahead and do that, and I think you'll find some more objective answers that unfortunately I can't give you because I'm not a scientist on that subject,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 but I can point you to that person who totally is.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 Okay, we have another caller on the air.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 What's your question and where are you from?

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 I am from Calgary, Alberta, and I'm wondering why people following the McDougall program, who eat tons of starch and vegetables, are able to reverse heart disease, lose weight, that kind of thing.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Okay, how do you know this? What's the evidence for it?

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 Oh, well, I guess it was on the doctor's website. His name is Dr. John McDougall.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 And he's in California, right?

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 I'm not sure where he is, actually.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 I think I've had a client who had seen McDougall.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 What's your objective analysis of a starchy carbohydrate-rich diet curing heart disease?

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 I've talked to some of his patients, and I'm sure they aren't getting enough protein.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 Okay, that would be a very subjective analysis.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 Okay, so if we don't have too much more to add to that, I'm afraid we'll probably have to stop right there.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 That's okay. Thank you so much.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Okay, well, thank you for listening, and thank you for your call.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 Okay, yeah, so we've got here.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 Okay.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 Okay, so I think we probably should leave that for tonight.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 It's 5 to 8, and I want to make sure that people get the directions necessary to find your website, Dr. Peat.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 So thanks so much for joining us.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 Okay, so for those people who have listened to tonight's show, I know sometimes the subjects are controversial.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 I'm glad they're controversial, I guess people think.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 And those people that really care about any of it can always find an objective analysis from scientific research.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 So I'd always encourage people to look at the science.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 Now, like I said about global warming, there are 40 points of Al Gore's book that have been refuted in England,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 and they're not allowed now to be published in the curricula that was proposed for education of children concerning this part of geography.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 Now, Lord Monckton, again, not just because he's a lord and he speaks with a posh English accent, that doesn't make him…

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 Any better than those people out on the corners.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 Any better than people out on the corners.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 Street corners.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 But he has spent his life studying this, and he has drawn together eminent scientists that are not lords, they're just science people.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 They're just scientists, that's all they do is science work.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 And they're very objective in science.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 There's no political agenda, there's no financial agenda.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 That's why science for itself is a fairly pure and altruistic subject.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 So Lord Monckton is someone who you can look at on YouTube and…

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 How do you spell Monckton?

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 Say again?

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 How do you spell his name?

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 It's M-O-N-C-K-T-O-N.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 He's the Viscount of Brentley in England.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 But anyway, he's very well educated, and his arguments for it are equally and oppositely, just like a positive and negative…

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 Two positive electrons repel each other, or two magnet ends repel each other.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 He provides the same evidence to push the argument the other way.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 So that was the first thing.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 And then, for those of you who have called in, thanks so much for taking the time to listen and contribute.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 We will be doing the same show the third Friday of next month.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 I just want to let people know that the website that we've had, which has been woefully outdated,

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 I did it in 2001 with Adobe Page Mill on an old computer, and it hasn't changed up until tomorrow.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 So tomorrow, the new website, westernbotanicalmedicine.com, has all of these interviews on it.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 There's 57 radio interviews that have been edited and will be available free to download for anybody who wants to take the time to look at it.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 I would encourage you to go and do that, not because I need hits on the website,

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 because we come up first time anyway when you type in "Western Botanical Medicine," not looking for that.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 Just want to make sure that people know all these interviews with Dr. Peat have been recorded and are freely available.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 So thanks so much for joining us, and we'll be here same time next month, third Friday of the month.

 And for those of you who want to look at Dr. Ray Peat's website, it's www.raypeat.com, and that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 And he has a whole range of fully referenced scientific journals that are not selling anything.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 And time and time again, what he's said has been borne out slowly but surely in the mainstream,

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 as the culture recognizes this change that's inevitable.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 So thanks so much for listening. Until next month, good night.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 Good night.
