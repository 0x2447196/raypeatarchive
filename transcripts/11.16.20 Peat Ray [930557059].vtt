00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 We are listener supported One Radio Network.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.520
 - Turn my microphone on, that would help.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.440
 A very pleasant good morning to you.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.520
 It is November 16, 2020.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.160
 As we are live here on oneradionetwork.com,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.360
 you're watching on YouTube,

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.520
 you can put up your questions there.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.480
 Sharon monitors that for us.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 Or simply email patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.440
 Sorry, the 800 thing is not working this morning.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.840
 Tried to, I don't know, it's just not.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.960
 So just the email is where we're gonna go.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.080
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.720
 We're gonna talk about the Constitution

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.000
 and what could be going on constitutionally

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.440
 with an expert on the Constitution, Richard Proctor,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.120
 a former member, or still is, the Constitutional Party.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.280
 He knows his stuff.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.120
 And we'll be speaking to him on a couple ideas

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.720
 of the election and all that,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.720
 but also the constitutionality of different governors

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.040
 and mayors telling you to do this or that,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.840
 and also the constitutionality about potential vaccines

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.600
 and forcing people to take stuff

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.640
 or forcing you to take a test, you know, stuff like that.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.640
 So I think you'll find the show interesting.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.120
 Have a couple of the people

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.200
 that are gonna be on this week too,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.920
 that have yet to totally confirm,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 but kind of a poetry in motion for this week.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.240
 So stay tuned.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.720
 Let us know how we can help.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.480
 My email is always here, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 The email reaches me, and then we'll talk with you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.200
 and take care of you the best we can do.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 On the third Monday of the month, which is today,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.840
 Dr. Ray Peat joins us around this time.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 We're a little bit late, as we said.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.600
 Generally, we try to start about 10,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.200
 well, you know, it doesn't matter.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.700
 We're here now.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.840
 Dr. Ray Peat, interesting fellow,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.720
 very well-respected PhD researcher

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.580
 in the field of health and nutrition.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.120
 I got his PhD up in the University of Oregon

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.760
 where he still lives today, specializing in physiology.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.960
 He started his work with hormones in 1968.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.400
 His website is rayPeat.com,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.560
 and you can sign up for a newsletter

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 by Ray Peat's Newsletters,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.040
 Ray Peat's Newsletter at gmail.com.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.200
 Dr. Peat, did I have that right?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.760
 Is it Ray Peat's Newsletter, is that it?

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.240
 - With an S, Ray Peat's, but no apostrophe.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 - Yeah, just rayPeatsnewsletter, right, at gmail.com.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.320
 How are you doing, sir, up there in Oregon?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.600
 How are things?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 - Oh, it's very dim and rainy and cloudy

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.080
 and alternating cold,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.720
 but that's a normal winter in Oregon.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.960
 - You do well with the, you've lived up there a long time.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.080
 Obviously, your body must do well with the weather there.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.320
 - Yeah, the humidity is generally moderate.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.440
 I lived for a while in the mountains of Montana,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 and indoors, the humidity goes to just about absolute zero.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:38.640
 From here down to central Mexico,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.360
 there's a comfortable amount of humidity,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 which I like, but I would like more sun and warmth.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.640
 - Yeah, we've often heard over the years

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.720
 that it's good to have some humidity.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.360
 It helps to, elimination in the colon and all of that.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.000
 Do people that live in the desert

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.240
 have issues with that and get too dry?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.760
 - Yeah, in the high desert,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.680
 I lived in New Mexico for a while,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.680
 and the people there at about 6,000 feet altitude

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.600
 and lots of sun, almost no rain or snow there,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.480
 but the constant high altitude sun

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.600
 and fair amount of dryness,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.080
 their skin tends to get prematurely aged.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.200
 - Do people with more sun near the equator,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.880
 do they generally have better health markers

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.840
 and longevity, do we know?

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.000
 Any research on that?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 - Oh yeah, and altitude is even more important

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.400
 than the steady sunlight, but degenerative diseases,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.960
 multiple sclerosis was one of the first things

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.240
 they noticed, very little of it towards the equator,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.720
 and farther north, you get the deficiency

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.280
 of ultraviolet and vitamin D,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.800
 ends up with all of the inflammatory degenerative diseases,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.600
 rheumatoid arthritis and nerve disease.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.440
 - What do you suppose the altitude, Dr. Peat,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.320
 what does that do, what's going on?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.480
 - That really is one of the most neglected areas

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.480
 of health research, but the insurance companies

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.640
 were wise to it 120 years ago or more,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.640
 that the degenerative diseases, cancer and heart disease,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.360
 are about 10% lower chronically

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.840
 in all of the high cities of the world.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.920
 In 1959, in his book, Linus Pauling saw those figures

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.640
 and he was concentrating on radiation mutations

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.760
 causing cancer, and he saw those old figures

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.760
 showing that cancer mortality decreases steadily

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.880
 as you go up in altitude, he couldn't believe it,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.240
 he said, "Something must be wrong with those figures."

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.240
 But it turns out someone reading his book in Texas

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.800
 compared the amount, they figured that melanoma

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.800
 would be the most responsive to the high infrared,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.240
 high ultraviolet light at high altitude.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.600
 So this person made a map of the state

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.600
 and comparing the altitude and the mortality from melanoma

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:03.520
 and found that even within the moderate altitude range

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.040
 of Texas, there is much less melanoma at higher altitudes,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.080
 much more at lower altitudes.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.080
 So it definitely isn't just ultraviolet radiation

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.640
 causing mutations, the increased vitamin D at altitude

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.280
 is one of the anti-cancer, anti-aging factors.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.280
 But apart from the vitamin D at altitude,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.060
 many other things change.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:45.960
 Within, I think it was Bolivia, two cities were compared,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:52.800
 one at around 13,500 feet altitude,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.820
 one around 4,000 feet, not low altitude,

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.820
 but even within that 9,000 foot difference,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:09.480
 there were eight times as many 100-year-old people

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.400
 in a city of the same population at high altitude,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.900
 just a vast difference in extreme longevity

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.080
 for the high altitude.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.080
 And within New Mexico, every 1,000 feet higher you go,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.420
 you see lower death rate from heart disease.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:38.420
 And the best understood factor that changes with altitude

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.420
 when you're adapted is that your carbon dioxide rises

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:50.580
 with altitude and the higher the carbon dioxide is,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:56.500
 the less lactic acid your cells produce.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.740
 And lactic acid metabolism is characteristic of stress,

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.940
 typical of cancer metabolism, but also heart disease

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.460
 and other inflammatory conditions.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.060
 - Interesting, so it's that idea with breathing properly,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.220
 like not over-breathing, which you've heard

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.060
 of the Buteyko method kind of talks about,

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.340
 that we retain more carbon dioxide

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.100
 and we can hold our breath essentially longer.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.140
 That's reducing lactic acid, right?

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.500
 - Right, breathing in a paper bag,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.300
 I've seen people lower their blood pressure in a day

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.820
 just by every half hour or so,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.460
 breathing for about a minute in a paper bag.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.100
 - In a paper bag.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.540
 - And the blood pressure comes down

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.100
 because of the carbon dioxide

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.020
 displacing inflammatory lactic acid.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.420
 - Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.420
 We have lots of questions already for you,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.780
 so we're gonna dig right in so we don't get behind here.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.460
 And this is a great place to start

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.980
 because I was gonna kind of ask you this anyway,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.980
 so we'll use Mark's email, Dr. Peat, to get into this.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.500
 Dr. Peat, I'm beginning to believe

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.700
 that this whole China virus idea is not true.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.700
 Now we are hearing more and more talk

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.100
 about mandatory vaccines and more lockdowns.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.980
 He has two questions.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.420
 What do you think, after all this time,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.300
 this COVID virus is about, if you would?

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.180
 And secondly, God forbid, if it would come to it,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.380
 mandatory vaccines,

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.140
 could we take anything to limit the damage?

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.500
 So that's a good place to start.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.100
 I mean, we've been looking at this, Dr. Peat, for what?

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.380
 Gosh, close to a year, well, nine months or so.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.500
 And I'm sure you've done plenty of your own research

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.940
 and your knowledge about viruses,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.020
 the germ theory or not, exosomes.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.500
 What is your take on what we are experiencing, your opinion?

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:08.820
 - In the fall and winter of 2019,

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.940
 the Chinese identified the coronavirus

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.020
 that was associated with pneumonia.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:22.940
 But very quickly, they found that there were five variations

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.740
 of that virus, indicating that it had been around

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.260
 and mutating for a while.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.260
 And then once they had the PCR test to identify it,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:42.100
 people around the world started checking storage samples

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.100
 and a batch of sewage, I think it was in Portugal,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.980
 from January of 2019,

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:57.220
 about a year before the Chinese virus,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.740
 the coronavirus was identified

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.260
 in Portuguese sewage a year earlier.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.420
 So it definitely didn't just originate

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.780
 by the time it got to China.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.340
 There were already at least five varieties.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.340
 And that rate of mutation indicates that by now,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.220
 almost a year later, we would expect to have

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.220
 about 25 variants of the virus.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.060
 - 25?

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.900
 - And that's the reason, after about 70 years of trying,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.740
 I guess 80 years of trying to make a vaccine

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.740
 against the common cold, they found it was impossible

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.940
 because the coronavirus mutates so fast.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.940
 So the reason we don't have vaccines for common cold

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.980
 would suggest that there'll never be a vaccine

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.980
 that is actually effective for the coronavirus.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.260
 But if you look at what happened with the polio vaccine,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:16.500
 the polio was identified as certain kinds of paralysis.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:24.260
 And so every time, for 50 years,

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:30.020
 there was accumulating evidence that polio-like paralysis

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.400
 coincided with the use of the hypodermic needle

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.400
 for intramuscular injections.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.400
 And it was confirmed in animal studies

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.560
 as well as continuing into Africa

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.240
 that the part of the body that receives

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.240
 the intramuscular vaccine is very likely to be the limb

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.600
 that is paralyzed, showing that it's the intramuscular

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.760
 injection causing the paralysis.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.760
 But despite that, they came out with a polio vaccine,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.960
 and suddenly the incidence of paralytic polio

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.000
 dropped sharply so that the vaccine was confirmed to work.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.520
 But oddly, the incidence of other types of paralysis,

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.360
 similar actual paralytic symptoms,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:47.360
 were given a new name, Dien-Barre and myelitis,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:55.560
 transverse myelitis, and several other types of paralysis

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.240
 suddenly shot up right after the introduction

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.880
 of the polio vaccine.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.000
 So by changing the definition,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.160
 you can make a vaccine seem to work very efficiently.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.520
 And in the case of COVID,

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:22.960
 since when the great peak of COVID incidence and mortality

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.320
 appeared in the second week of April of this year,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:39.800
 the incidence of influenza fell off a cliff,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:47.240
 very strongly indicated that what they had called influenza,

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.480
 suddenly the definition changed,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.080
 ending the influenza epidemic

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.480
 and creating this huge peak in COVID.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:04.440
 So we can expect once the vaccine comes into use,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.560
 there'll be an instruction,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.560
 instead of saying that a cough and a fever of 100 degrees

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.480
 are the symptoms that will have you written down

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.800
 as a COVID patient,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.320
 they'll simply change the,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:31.280
 return to a rational way of diagnosing COVID,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.400
 make it a little more restrictive,

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.080
 and suddenly the COVID cases will disappear.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.280
 - Oh, because they'll change the definition

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.080
 of what a COVID case is,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.520
 and then they'll say the vaccine worked.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.360
 - Right.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.680
 - But in your opinion, with all your research,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.280
 and you're over 80 years old now,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.760
 you can't really create a vaccine for a virus.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.640
 They've never been able to do it, correct?

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.120
 - For a very stable kind of virus like smallpox.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.960
 - Possibly.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.960
 - Yeah, it works pretty well for smallpox,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.720
 so they could eliminate the disease

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:18.720
 by surrounding the areas where it was outbreaking

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.120
 and vaccinate people in the circle.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.680
 And that is simply not in their plans.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.800
 If the vaccines worked,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.800
 they could circle an outbreak and quarantine the sick people

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.720
 and their immediate contacts

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.720
 and eliminate the virus quickly if the vaccine worked.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:53.280
 - So some viruses don't mutate like the corona,

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.440
 like the smallpox,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.080
 and that's why it's possible to actually

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:02.080
 literally isolate the smallpox and electron microscope,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.720
 and you can actually see it and then thus create a vaccine,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.680
 which is the theory behind vaccines?

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.680
 - Yeah, the smallpox virus is a DNA virus.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.800
 - A DNA.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.200
 - The corona virus is an RNA,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.680
 and they're extremely unstable.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.600
 - RNA viruses are unstable.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.920
 So these coronaviruses,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.920
 are they always running around and mutating in the world?

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.040
 Just always, and people experience colds and flus from them?

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.920
 - Yeah.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:43.040
 And if a very sick, old person catches a cold,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.040
 it's not uncommon for just a common cold

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.920
 to kill someone who is older.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.760
 - Sure, right.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.600
 - Hard to imagine.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.360
 - So then am I hearing you saying that this thing

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.640
 that went on was no more different

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.840
 than any other RNA virus that runs around?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.120
 - Yeah, I and a few other people started looking

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.000
 at the actual numbers,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 back in February and March of this year.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And we couldn't see that anything at all was happening.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.400
 - Right.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:26.840
 - It's only a few people early who were saying that,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.520
 but by now, looking back at the actual figures,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.760
 more and more people are recognizing

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.560
 that nothing is changing.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.600
 People are recognizing that nothing happened.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.280
 There was no pandemic.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.400
 - No pandemic.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.840
 So now, as you know, and our audience knows,

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:51.840
 more, especially near you in the state of Washington,

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.440
 they're having all these cases, right?

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.600
 Which are just positive tests, which we'll get to,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.960
 and they're actually canceling Thanksgiving

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.960
 up in Washington, you can't do it.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.360
 And maybe Christmas, and Dr. Fauci's talking about,

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.760
 I saw a video from a CNN clip, you know, CNN,

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.960
 and he's saying, "Well, we're probably not gonna be able

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.960
 to get back to normal till maybe the third quarter in 2021."

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.680
 So it looks like the forces, Dr. Peat, behind this,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.560
 wanna really run this baby for a long time,

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.480
 I guess, geopolitically, politically, financially,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.400
 that we won't get into.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.640
 But if they're basing the cases on a PCR test,

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.400
 somebody sent me a thing, Dr. Peat,

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.680
 that says, "Kerry Mullins invented the PCR test

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.640
 that's being used, and he said his PCR test

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.560
 was not made to detect any type of infectious disease."

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.720
 Is that true?

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.720
 - And he said that he designed it to be used

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.920
 for a maximum number of cycles.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.280
 - Cycles, yes.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.360
 - 34 cycles, I think he said.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.200
 - Yes.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.200
 - And he said, "Beyond that, it becomes meaningless,

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.000
 because it produces more and more random results."

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 But Fauci ordered them to run 40 cycles.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.120
 You're much more likely to have a false positive

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.040
 when you run it beyond its designed capacity.

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.400
 - Yes, let's talk about that.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.160
 We actually have a video that we played,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.320
 and we could play it again.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.960
 I don't know if it's necessary.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.020
 In July, Dr. Fauci's saying,

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.600
 "Anything above a 30 to 35 cycles,"

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.640
 and he said, "I like 30."

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.440
 Anything, you're just getting dead nucleotides.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.600
 - Right.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.400
 - So what is a dead nucleotide?

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.000
 So tell folks what a cycle is.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.960
 They're spinning the blood after they spinning

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.760
 the thing they get from your nose,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.520
 they spin it so many times?

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.360
 - Yeah, the virus itself is enclosed

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.360
 in a bunch of proteins like any of our exosomes.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.780
 But the unique RNA that can be identified

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.780
 is enclosed in that protein circle, sphere.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:17.140
 And if your immune system has started tearing apart

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.180
 that virus, the virus no longer is infective,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.940
 so you can call it dead.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.900
 And so you just have scraps of material.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.900
 But all the PCR needs is to have a scrap of RNA,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:38.780
 and that will identify the virus,

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.780
 even though you might have 100 scraps

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.500
 for every active virus.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.780
 - And we've read that most places are spinning

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.600
 between 40 to 45 around the country.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.060
 Do you think that's accurate?

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.100
 - I think that's true, but it's a certain way

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.580
 to create false positives.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.420
 - Of course.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.600
 - For your cases that don't exist.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.460
 - So these cases, if you're spinning at 40,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:13.460
 as Fauci said himself, above 30 is dead nucleotides.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.980
 They don't necessarily mean that somebody has

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.980
 a live, active, virulent, potentially deadly virus, right?

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.700
 - They just don't, do they?

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.700
 - Yeah, almost all of the viruses that come into existence

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.100
 just end up as random dust fragments.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:42.460
 And one of 100 different molecules

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:49.380
 can be identified as viral RNA,

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.420
 but it has no infective power at all.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.400
 - So what do you say when these viruses come into existence?

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.700
 Do they just kind of erupt as living organisms?

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.580
 Are they living, are they alive?

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:09.060
 - No, they are structurally and functionally

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.620
 very similar to our own exosomes.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.380
 - Exosomes, right.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.380
 - Our cells, under stress, emit particles

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.700
 that are intended to communicate between tissues.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.460
 For example, if you have lung inflammation,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.500
 exosomes will be put into the bloodstream

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.460
 and go to the bone marrow,

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.460
 and the bone marrow will recognize a problem in lung cells

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.660
 and make repair cells.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.660
 But the virus is similar to the virus

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.820
 similar to the RNA or DNA fragments

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.220
 that are turned into exosomes.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.220
 And so once it gets caught into a cell,

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:04.260
 the cell can multiply it in proportion

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.740
 to the stress it's experiencing.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.220
 So a healthy cell can receive a virus,

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.220
 and it's not making exosomes,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.100
 so it probably won't make virus particles either.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.820
 But once it gets into this stressed cell

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.300
 producing exosome-like particles,

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:29.100
 the virus can get spewed out into the bloodstream

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:34.100
 and lungs as a potentially infective virus.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.900
 - So when you say stress could be anything

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.940
 from fear, worry, chemical, any kind of thing,

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.100
 really bad food.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.100
 - Malnutrition.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.260
 - Malnutrition, whatever.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.700
 And the body would create these exosomes

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.260
 to communicate with parts of the body to help it to heal?

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.380
 - Yeah, to restore balance

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.860
 in the different parts of the body.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:04.820
 - Right, and these exosomes look exactly like a coronavirus.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.660
 Is that correct?

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.540
 I've seen pictures.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.340
 - Yeah, under an electron microscope,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.660
 it's essentially impossible to tell the difference.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.980
 - Possible.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.020
 So there are many people that are arguing,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.860
 not many, but a handful,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.060
 that this whole thing is just about exosomes

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.700
 and there's not any really coronavirus out there there.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.220
 But you're not one of those.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.420
 You still believe that there's still, you tell me.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.500
 - Yeah, we've had colds forever.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.540
 And this is just another variation

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.900
 of that family of viruses.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.380
 - When you say we've had colds forever,

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.500
 is the body just going through some kind of healing detox

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.580
 when we experience a cold,

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.740
 or do we catch it from out there?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:59.860
 - In all of the studies over the last 70 or 80 years,

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.980
 they have found that it's extremely hard

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.700
 to deliberately pass a cold.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.540
 You have to--

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.980
 - It's impossible almost, isn't it?

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:10.820
 - Almost, yeah.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.660
 You have to get a person to lie down

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:17.900
 with their head slightly lower

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.340
 and then take the mucus from the nose of someone

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.860
 who is extremely infected

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.700
 and drip it right into their nose.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.340
 And then some of those people

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.300
 will come down with the virus.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.780
 But just sitting around all day, for example,

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.780
 in a small room with some infected people

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.380
 and others not infected,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:51.020
 there's almost no chance of it actually passing

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.140
 by casual contact, such as playing cards.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.140
 They have put a dye in the nose of one person playing cards

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.580
 and after playing cards for a while,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.620
 the dye from one person's nose

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.220
 is going to end up on everyone's hands and face.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:17.260
 So even though there is contact and spreading of material,

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:23.260
 it just happens that it's very seldom

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.620
 that that kind of contact is going to spread a cold.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.460
 - Or a flu.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.700
 - Similar.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.860
 - So if a person is already starting to get sick,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.780
 then they're the ones who will find a virus

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.580
 and incubate it and come down with something.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.220
 - So in general, these colds and flus

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.500
 are not really being,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.380
 we're not being assaulted from something

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.220
 other than ourselves, generally.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.820
 - Yeah, you have to be somewhat sick and stressed

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:09.100
 before you come down with any of these

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.900
 potentially infective things.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.260
 - Do we change exosomes with one another?

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.940
 - Yeah, since the 1940s,

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.700
 there's been a lot of investigation of that subject

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:28.700
 and finding that it goes across species and families

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:34.980
 and phyla, the most distant organism, like tree pollen.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:42.420
 The DNA from tree pollen can get into our bodies.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:48.340
 - So if you exchange an exosome with me

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.220
 and you've overcome something,

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.220
 would that help me to do the same thing?

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.020
 Is that the idea of sharing information?

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.740
 - Yeah, bacteria are known to do that.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.300
 You expose one batch of bacteria to penicillin

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.020
 and those that manage to survive it

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:15.020
 have constructed enzymes that break down penicillin.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.740
 It works on practically anything in the environment,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.980
 the surviving bacteria can pass in an exosome,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:32.340
 can pass this particle to not only members of their species

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:36.540
 but even very different types of bacteria.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:43.060
 And it requires a conjugation in the case of bacteria

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.740
 as far as is known.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:50.660
 They send out a little tube to the other bacteria

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.740
 and pass the genes across that tube.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.660
 - So would that be similar, this could be way off track, Doc,

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.260
 but the idea that even cockroaches can become immune

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.020
 to a chemical very quickly and their kids,

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.540
 you could spray them with the same chemical

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.380
 and it doesn't hurt them.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.340
 Are they doing similar kind of thing?

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:13.500
 - I think so.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.100
 The bacteria have been very well studied

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.780
 and there is great resistance

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.500
 because of the idea of genetic determinism

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:29.500
 and genes being eternal until they're mutated,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:35.220
 losing function, but the idea of acquiring information,

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:41.060
 that was called Lamarckism and was outlawed.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.220
 They fired high school and college teachers

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:50.220
 who talked about Lamarckism starting in 1946 and seven.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:55.940
 They weeded it out entirely from the United States.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:02.260
 The idea was sustained by three or four genetics people

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:10.740
 around the world and came back as epigenetics

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:17.260
 and the transgenerational transmission

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:20.100
 of acquired information and so on.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.100
 So the whole Lamarck thing was politically,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:31.700
 philosophically rejected, but scientifically,

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.420
 the evidence has gradually forced its way back

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:41.540
 and still professors generally get very, very,

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.860
 get very angry if you try to say

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:49.860
 that all of these new facts are confirming Lamarck.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:54.940
 They're saying that, no, it's something very different,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:59.940
 but it acts exactly the way Lamarckism predicted

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:05.020
 that they would work out.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.440
 - And Lamarckism, the basic premise is, again, to be clear?

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:14.900
 - Well, actually, Darwin himself asserted

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:21.060
 that it happened, that an acquired, adaptive trait,

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:26.500
 that's something that the organism learns to do,

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.580
 to be immune to, or resist,

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.720
 that can be passed on to the offspring.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.720
 Darwin proposed that there were gemmules created

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.580
 by every cell containing, describing its abilities,

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:50.780
 and that these gemmules formed during the life

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.700
 of an individual, traveled through the bloodstream

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.460
 to the gonads and entered the germ cells,

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.620
 passing on acquired information.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.620
 That was Darwin himself refining Lamarck's general idea

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.620
 but with neo-Darwinism, Darwin himself was censored,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:22.620
 and genes became unchangeable things.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:30.180
 For example, a very stupid series of experiments in Germany,

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.740
 the cutting off, I think it was 1,200 mouse tails,

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:46.500
 and then showing that no mice were born

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.240
 with amputated tails.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.780
 - Oh, so that's how they were gonna disprove this idea.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.620
 - Yeah, it had nothing to do with what either Darwin

00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.620
 or Lamarck had proposed, just an insane experiment,

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:05.140
 but people were still citing that in university

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:10.140
 when I was there, a really deep-ended sort of logic.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:14.260
 - So it's similar in a way to, I think,

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.900
 what has been termed, Dr. Ray Peat,

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.720
 as Sins of the Fathers, where we also pass on

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.940
 a lot of fragments of things like leprosy and herpes

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.380
 and God knows what, right, syphilis.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:31.700
 We've done quite a few shows on root canals

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.940
 and they've had peer-reviewed studies with my dentist

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.860
 who's done a peer-reviewed studies,

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.580
 and they'll find all these different crazy bacterial things

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.300
 in the root canals that are infected,

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.620
 like leprosy, as I said, and syphilis and herpes,

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.340
 and these things are just, they must just be running around

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.260
 in all of our bodies at some, are fragments,

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.180
 or what are they?

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.660
 - Oh, they do circulate harmlessly.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.500
 - Harmlessly.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.820
 - If you're in good health.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.860
 - But they're in there.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.380
 - Sometimes, not always.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.820
 - Not always, huh.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.420
 And we might pass these along to baby?

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:20.580
 - Sometimes, yeah, if the general health is very bad,

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:27.660
 the emphasis tended to be on denying

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.660
 that anything was inheritable

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:39.260
 or acquired from the environment,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.060
 and so it all had to be genetic.

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:47.060
 So all of the effects of malnutrition, poverty,

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:53.860
 all of these effects were blamed on bad genes.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:01.700
 For example, until just 20 or 30 years ago,

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:08.580
 the dogma medically was that eclampsia,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:15.460
 seizures during pregnancy, retention during pregnancy,

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.660
 premature birth of damaged babies and so on,

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.180
 all this was absolutely genetic,

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.100
 that the baby had bad genes

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.540
 that were causing the eclampsia in the mother.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.740
 So the doctor had no responsibility

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.780
 to cure their bad inheritance,

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.500
 and they were denying that nutrition

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:48.140
 could have anything to do with prematurity

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.540
 and pregnancy problems

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:55.340
 because of the absolute genetic determinism.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.340
 But starting with a few doctors like Tom Brewer,

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:06.060
 he showed that if you give women

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.740
 a reasonable amount of protein,

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.820
 a slightly more expensive diet,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:16.820
 and don't restrict their salt or anything they crave,

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.580
 you absolutely prevent eclampsia

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.020
 and tremendously reduce birth defects

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.260
 and prematurity and so on.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.900
 - So that completely wiped out, not completely,

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.420
 but it wiped out the genetic determinism idea.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.260
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.020
 - What we call epigenetics now,

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.100
 by we change it because of our lifestyle.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.300
 - Yeah, the genetic determinism

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.300
 was used to maintain class differences

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.460
 and keep people in poverty.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.740
 - So oftentimes when folks go to the doctors,

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.700
 which we don't recommend, but they do,

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.980
 they fill out all these forms

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:04.340
 and you'll fill out something like,

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.820
 did your mom or dad have diabetes or heart attack

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.180
 or stuff like that?

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.540
 Is there anything to that?

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:16.020
 - In Israel, that was scientifically put to rest.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.180
 - Was it?

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.660
 - I think because they were still believing

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:23.620
 that diabetes was inherited,

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:28.620
 but you had the immigrants from Europe into Israel

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:35.620
 brought the European diabetes incidence with them,

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:41.460
 but the North African Jews who came into the country

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.460
 had zero diabetes when they came to Israel.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:51.460
 And their children, starting to eat the European diet,

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.540
 developed a European rate of diabetes,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:00.860
 showing that it was absolutely environmental,

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:04.340
 zero determination by genes.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.820
 - So that could be why if one puts too much stock in these,

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:16.060
 what do they call them, like 23andMe and these things,

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.580
 that could lead you down black holes

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.380
 that you don't need to go?

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.500
 - Yeah, genes and viruses both have been used

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.180
 for the last 120 years as an excuse

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.780
 for why you can't make someone well.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:35.300
 The doctor says, oh, it's a virus.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.060
 We don't have an antibiotic to cure viruses,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.700
 or it's a gene, it's hopeless.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.620
 But instead of giving them a good diet,

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.860
 vitamin supplements, or whatever it takes.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.060
 - Dr. Ray Peat, stay right there, sir.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.780
 We got a little late start,

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.500
 so we'd like to keep you a little bit longer if we can,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.660
 if you're okay with it.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.300
 I have lots of emails.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.380
 We're gonna do whatever we can

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.460
 to get to as many as we can.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.500
 And so stay right there.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.100
 Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.340
 This is very interesting technology.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.700
 See what you think.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.140
 Previously with Dr. Mark Serkis, he offered this.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.940
 - The audience should know,

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.820
 both of us are into hydrogen,

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.340
 and specifically hydrogen inhalation.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.060
 Both are into the same machine.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.500
 This guy, George, at Aquacure,

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.900
 made it in New York and Canada.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.660
 So three months ago, a study that was published

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:44.660
 in Dove Press, brain metastasis completely disappear

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:50.820
 in non-small cell lung cancer

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.540
 using hydrogen gas inhalation.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.500
 - We're not saying that breathing hydrogen

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.860
 and drinking hydrogen water will cure your cancer.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:41:59.700
 Not at all.

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.500
 We're just reporting on a study.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.740
 But just imagine what breathing hydrogen

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.340
 is doing for my body and can be doing for yours,

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.180
 bringing things back into balance.

 So there's something going on with this.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.540
 Again, we're not making any kind of claims about it at all.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.380
 But if it is the antioxidant that many, many studies

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.140
 have proven it to be, there's just no telling

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.060
 what your body would be able to do

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:07.060
 once you get happy with it and working with it.

 Previously with chemist, biologist, and nutritionist

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.900
 George Altgeldt, we asked him this.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.420
 And so what do you think about Dr. Seneff's contention

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.820
 that as these glyphosates are in the soil,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.420
 they bust the sulfur cycle,

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.540
 and that's really detrimental to the body?

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:31.460
 - It's extremely detrimental.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.620
 Sulfur is such an important detoxifying agent

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.700
 for the entire body and especially for the liver.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.420
 Gotta have trace minerals so that the liver

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.340
 can build these compounds that are essential

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.060
 for getting itself cleaned.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.820
 And that lady who was talking about sulfur,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.020
 man, play that ad every chance you get

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.060
 because our foods are so deficient in sulfur.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.940
 And it is a big deal for the liver to have enough sulfur

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.660
 to make all those compounds that it uses to detoxify itself.

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.820
 Not just sulfur, they're all important,

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.820
 but sulfur is the one that we're so deficient in,

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.220
 and we need sulfur.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.300
 - Thanks, George.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.340
 I had some this morning.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.580

 We are gonna do,

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.900
 well, I'll tell you later.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:39.460
 We mentioned Stephanie Seneff.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:43.260
 She has been looking at this potential vaccine

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.700
 that's gonna be coming out.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.940
 And there's some pretty, very, very interesting,

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.540
 curious things that could be in this baby.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.340

 - We are listener supported, One Radio Network.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:20.780
 - We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.460
 He is here on the third Monday of the month,

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.940
 and his website is rayPeat.com.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.140

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:34.860
 You can do Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.860
 And I think that comes out every couple of months.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.140
 Well, Dara even, well, we better get to the emails

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.700
 'cause I could just talk to you all day long,

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:44.040
 and that's not fair.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.420
 We have so many emails here.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.860
 Here's one for you, Dr. Peat.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.660
 I thought I heard Dr. Peat once say

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.140
 that he maybe would order, say, an empanada

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.100
 if he went out to a Mexican restaurant.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.820
 I thought empanadas were made with wheat flour,

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:02.460
 and wondered if Dr. Peat might occasionally think it's okay

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.000
 to eat foods made with wheat flour from Cynthia.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.640
 - No, no, I don't.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.100
 About 50 years ago,

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:19.980
 the industry started pushing wheat

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.540
 on the Mexican population,

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:27.100
 and they started introducing it into tortillas,

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.440
 wheat tortillas, a horrible thing.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:35.820
 The unleavened wheat especially is toxic,

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:43.500
 worse than even the well-leavened bread.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.500
 If it has been processed by a sourdough method,

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.180
 that breaks down many of the toxins.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:59.180
 But a wheat empanada or a wheat tortilla

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.420
 is just a horrible thing.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.460
 - Just not a good thing.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:08.940
 You've talked about the nixtamalization of the corn,

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.100
 and you can get that now and make your tortillas and that.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:17.100
 Do you think that corn is a relatively nutritious enough food

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.540
 to even go through that effort

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.060
 to get a good nixtamalization corn?

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.620
 I mean, is it worth it?

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.720
 - Well, the plain corn,

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.100
 as was eaten throughout the southern United States,

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:38.420
 it has a toxic excess of leucine,

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:44.780
 and it contains no niacin to speak of.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.700
 And nixtamalizing it reduces the toxic amount of leucine

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:58.260
 and tremendously increases the amount of niacin.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:03.020
 And it adds a lot of calcium.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:09.500
 So that in a kilogram of tortillas,

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.380
 you've got an amount of calcium

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:17.140
 that is almost like a quart of milk.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.140
 - Wow.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:21.620
 So it doesn't matter what kind of corn.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.940
 Well, of course, we'd want it to be organic if possible,

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.460
 but the nixtamalization really ramps up

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.740
 the nutritional profile of it.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.900
 Good, cool.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.820
 Dr. Peat, this is Eve, and she's in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:37.860
 Hi, Eve.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.500
 Wants to know, could you ask Dr. Peat

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:46.500
 how menopausal women can get rid of endometrial polyps?

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:55.760
 - The ideal way would be to have a menstruation,

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:02.980
 but the anti-estrogen of tamoxifen.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.260
 - Tamoxifen, yes.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.540
 - It has enough estrogenic effects

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.740
 that it tremendously increases

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:18.140
 the risk of endometrial polyps.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:23.140
 And I think the restoration of a physiological cycle,

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:30.380
 even if it doesn't succeed in menstruation,

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:34.900
 but if you correct your thyroid, vitamin D,

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:40.380
 calcium intake, that's going to shift the balance

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.620
 favorably away from estrogen.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:48.580
 And it's the unopposed estrogen that leads to the polyps.

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.580
 - Okay, all right, back to that again.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:52.420
 Excellent.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.540
 Do you think that the vitamin D blood tests

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.540
 are accurate at all to go by

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.900
 if you're getting enough sun or vitamin D?

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:03.020
 - Yeah, they're pretty good.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.460
 A few years ago, one of the companies

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.660
 was doing horribly inaccurate tests,

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.660
 but when they were exposed, they improved their methods.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:19.700
 And so I think now the average hospital

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:25.780
 at a moderate price should be 30 to $50 per test.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:30.100
 - Is there a number on the D that you'd like to see

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.420
 or research shows that is adequate?

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:35.180
 - Yeah, 50 nanograms.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.020
 - How many?

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.100
 - Five, five, five, zero.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.020
 - Oh, 50 nanograms.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.180
 - Per milliliter.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.420
 - Which is the number they normally show, right?

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.820
 That's the number they're showing, nanograms per milliliter.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.300
 - Oh, lots of people.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.500
 The worse their symptoms are,

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.900
 the farther they are below 30.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:51:02.060
 - Is there a difference between getting it internally

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.260
 or out in the sun?

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.420
 - Yeah, quite a bit of difference.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:12.420
 The ultraviolet light does age your skin

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.020
 so you don't want to get sunburned.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:20.020
 But once your vitamin D level is up as a result of sunshine,

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:25.300
 then you're getting many other internal benefits

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.020
 from the bright sunlight.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.340
 - Good stuff, yeah.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.180
 - Because the other wavelengths, especially red light,

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:38.100
 neutralize and detoxify the aging effects

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.740
 of the ultraviolet.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:47.860
 So you get side effects other than the vitamin D

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.540
 if you get sunlight.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.340
 - On these red lights, there's all different kinds.

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.540
 You can get various wavelength of a red light,

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:59.540
 600, 700, 800, or just the chicken lamps from Home Depot.

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.900
 In general, our bodies like this red light?

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:10.540
 - Yeah, the chicken lamps are very good

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:15.580
 because they have the usable, more or less full spectrum,

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:22.940
 white-looking light and provide heat, red light,

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:28.940
 and the cheery brightness itself is very important.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:35.740
 - Here is John wants to know,

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.380
 does Dr. Peat, his opinion on inversion therapy,

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.940
 is it safe and effective?

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.460
 - Inversion?

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.580
 - Inversion, yeah, I guess flipping over on your head.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.420
 - Oh, that.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.220
 No, I don't think it's especially beneficial.

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.500
 - You don't think it's beneficial?

00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.660
 Okay, here is from Kirby.

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:04.420
 What is the best carbohydrate to protein ratio?

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:10.060
 - It depends on your age, largely.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:16.260
 The older you are, the more you have to be careful

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.420
 about excess protein.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:25.180
 High protein diet can seriously suppress

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.920
 your thyroid function.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:32.860
 And the average normal protein is high in methionine

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:39.500
 and cysteine, and too much of those greatly accelerate

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:40.940
 the aging process.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:47.100
 So after the age of 40, you have to carefully watch

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.700
 the balance between the amount of protein in your diet

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:56.700
 and the nutrients, calcium, vitamin D,

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:00.300
 and your thyroid function.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:07.500
 The carbohydrate can have a very reviving

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.740
 therapeutic effect.

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:16.180
 Currently I'm hearing reports from several people

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:21.180
 who just by introducing fruit juice

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:27.740
 or even Mexican Coca-Cola, suddenly they have recovered

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:34.460
 from various things, depression, migraines,

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:41.740
 all signs of slowing inhibited metabolism.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.260
 - Sugar.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:45.220
 - Sugar, yeah.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.300
 - Good old sugar.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.940
 Yeah, you can actually, I think you can actually

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.700
 still get Mexican Coca-Cola.

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.980
 I think there's a place in Dripping Springs

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.640
 and you can actually get it where it has sugar

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:57.420
 rather than high fructose corn syrup in it.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:01.540
 - Yeah, it's becoming so popular that supermarkets--

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.940
 - They're figuring it out, right?

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:05.140
 - Are selling it out quickly.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:08.860
 And so they're going, I think it might convince

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:13.420
 the US Coca-Cola company to return to producing

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.580
 some proper Coke.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.100
 - Yeah, but I can't imagine, I guess what the price

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:21.780
 would be to change on your cost analysis

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:24.740
 by changing from high fructose corn syrup to sugar.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.900
 That should be over billions of bottles,

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:32.900
 probably be a big expense for the Coca-Cola company

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:35.460
 to do it, I don't know.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:40.460
 - But if they see sales shifting to expensive imported Coke,

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:46.740
 they could do it more economically

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.700
 than having to import the stuff.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.900
 - Here's an email, you've talked about orange juice before,

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.500
 but what about other fruits, writes an emailer,

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.800
 like apples and peaches and berries and melons?

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:05.140
 - If they're well ripened, they can be extremely valuable.

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:11.260
 But currently, what you find in supermarkets,

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:16.660
 most of them are poorly ripened.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:20.180
 - Yeah, George wants to know, do you think there are

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.100
 some rices that are more appropriate,

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:24.740
 better than other rices?

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.140
 There's so many varieties of rices, my goodness.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:33.140
 - I think white rice is the best because the germ

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:40.500
 and the bran age and oxidize and get rancid.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:46.820
 The Chinese learned that white rice doesn't go bad

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:50.180
 in storage, doesn't get rancid.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.020
 - Is that right?

00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.460
 Well, so that would be like a jasmine

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:57.140
 or just a basmati white rice, something like that?

00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:01.780
 - Yeah, any white rice means it's been polished

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.860
 and had the bran removed.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.620
 - Sophie wants to know, Dr. Peat, does sprouting beans

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:12.620
 and grains make them safe to eat or just less evil?

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.380
 Okay, are they good for us or are they just less evil?

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:21.380
 - It at least doubles the usable protein.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:26.180
 So if you're eating beans for protein,

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:32.180
 cooked sprouts are going to give you a more survivable

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:39.260
 amount of protein where the bean, as usually cooked,

00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:43.420
 is a very, very poor source of protein

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.460
 with more toxin value.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:51.460
 But the problem with sprouts is they have to be well cooked.

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.780
 You don't want raw sprouts in your salad

00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:01.780
 because generally sprouts can release

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.860
 a lot of anti-thyroid material.

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.780
 - Ah, so as long as you cook them, you're pretty good.

00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:08.620
 You're okay.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.020
 Interesting.

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:16.700
 Another David, would a silica-based clay

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:21.700
 like Rossol, R-H-A-S-S-O-U-L, be okay to use topically?

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.860
 - Topically, yeah.

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:29.860
 - Do you ever use these clays internally or recommend them?

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.940
 - Oh, never.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.780
 - Never?

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:37.380
 - Because stomach acid will dissolve some heavy metals

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.660
 that they all contain.

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:43.340
 - The stomach acid that we have will dissolve

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:47.220
 the heavy metals which is in the clays.

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:52.220
 - Yeah, the aluminum itself is released

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:59.300
 into solution when it hits the strong stomach acid.

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:04.300
 But they often have other heavy metals besides the aluminum.

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.700
 - I see.

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:10.420
 Raymond, oh, just like you, Raymond wants to know

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:15.420
 my sister is getting chemo for lung cancer.

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:17.860
 Is there anything that I could recommend her

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.780
 to lessen the nausea?

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:23.420
 She's not able to eat much and feels pretty badly

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.980
 with the chemo.

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:29.180
 - The standard thing for the nausea

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.420
 is an antiserotonin drug.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:37.420
 I think cyproheptadine is the most pleasant way

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:43.700
 to take antiserotonin drugs

00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:48.700
 because it comes with antihistamine effects.

00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:53.740
 And those, both antiserotonin and antihistamines

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.100
 are also anti-cancer agents.

00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:02.100
 And there have been studies using cyproheptadine

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:07.060
 against various cancers showing positive effects.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:12.020
 So I think aspirin and cyproheptadine

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:17.020
 are generally protective against the toxic effects

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.900
 of chemotherapy.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.020
 - So the cyproheptadine lowers serotonin

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.820
 and lowers histamine, also has anti-cancerous effects

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:30.460
 and helps the nausea?

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.860
 - All of those, yeah.

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:33.900
 - All of those, wow.

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:40.420
 - Histamine and serotonin both are powerful things

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:44.660
 released by cancer and stimulating cancer growth.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.780
 - I see.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:47.860
 And the aspirin, you're just talking,

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:50.460
 taking some aspirin every day and that's safe.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.860
 It'll be safe for somebody with that.

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:58.940
 - Yeah, it has a very broad spectrum of anti-cancer effects.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:05.420
 - And the nausea, where's the nausea coming from?

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.420
 The stomach, the body just doesn't like these harsh drugs

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.660
 and it's just trying hard to have a hard time

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.540
 dealing with it?

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:17.980
 - Yeah, any kind of injury to the digestive system

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.420
 causes it to produce lots of serotonin

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:27.420
 and the serotonin causes the sense of nausea

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.340
 among other things.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:34.340
 And so blocking the serotonin will relieve the nausea.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.540
 - I see.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.660
 Okay.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:43.660
 Dr. Peat, what exactly is bad about eccentric exercise?

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:46.980
 ECC, ENTRIC, eccentric?

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:51.980
 - It involves extending the muscle

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:57.420
 against the attempt to contract

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:02.420
 and the effect is to cause microscopic tears.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:06.380
 Your muscle is trying to go one way

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:11.380
 and the force of gravity is forcing it to go to lengthen

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.300
 when it's trying to shorten.

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:18.860
 So it tears some of the molecules apart

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:23.860
 and that interferes with energy production

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.420
 by the mitochondria.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:31.300
 So every time you get a sore muscle from running downhill,

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.780
 you've done some damage to your muscle mitochondria.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:37.740
 - Interesting.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:41.900
 - Doing only concentric activity.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:46.340
 Old people have been tested

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:51.340
 with doing daily concentric contraction

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.740
 against some resistance

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.380
 and then their mitochondria were sampled

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:04.380
 and they had restored effectively younger mitochondria

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:08.700
 that were able to produce energy.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.700
 - Okay, so tell folks the difference now.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.620
 So if we have a barbell, say 20 pounds,

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.660
 and we pull it up, what is that?

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.700
 - That's concentric.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:20.060
 - That's concentric.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.700
 - And if you let it down carefully, that's eccentric.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.540
 - And the best is?

01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:27.380
 - Concentric.

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:28.940
 - Concentric.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.860
 - So the good thing is to lift the barbell

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.500
 then let it fall to the floor.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.500
 - Maybe that's why you see some of these weightlifters

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.340
 do that.

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.860
 I wonder if they know about that.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.620
 - Oh sure, I think so.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.820
 - So that's interesting.

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.580
 So if you can do the eccentric

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:51.580
 and then somehow release the pressure, that's the best.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:52.420
 - Yeah.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.660
 - That's cool.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.500
 That's very cool.

01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.260
 Dr. Peat, you've talked about darkness being a stressor.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.580
 So should we sleep with some kind of light on?

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:09.500
 - I've tried it and it tends to be very irritating.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:15.500
 I never succeeded in doing it for very long.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.820
 But if you have a red light apparatus

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:24.460
 and put it on some part of your body

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.380
 where it doesn't bother your eyes,

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.860
 that can have a restorative effect

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.140
 reducing through your bloodstream,

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:37.360
 reducing inflammation throughout your body.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.220
 - I was talking with a fellow

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.940
 who's really into red light stuff, Doc,

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.980
 and he suggested in the neighborhood of 600 to 700

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.780
 or something of these wavelengths of red light,

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:52.780
 even on your testicles, would increase testosterone levels.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.320
 Do you think that's possible?

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.700
 - Oh yeah, definitely possible.

01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.700
 But I would just want to be cautious

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:09.020
 because there hasn't been research showing the safety.

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:15.700
 There's a possibility that it could stimulate cancer growth

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.620
 as well as production of hormones.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.500
 - Oh, that wouldn't be good.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.300
 So we just don't know with these kind of ideas

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.340
 what they could be doing.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.980
 - Yeah, I wouldn't feel secure until I had seen--

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.220
 - Seen something.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.060
 - Good research on it.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.080
 - To all the guys that are saying

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.980
 they like to get these T levels up,

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.780
 do you have some favorite things you can offer them

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.260
 on this November 16 day of increasing testosterone levels,

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.900
 the good stuff, the stuff that we need

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.820
 to get up and go and lift and work?

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:52.460
 - All of the good anti-inflammatory nutrition

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:58.220
 principles are going to increase your protective androgens

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:04.780
 from DHEA to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:11.540
 All of those tend to rise when you do

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:16.500
 an anti-inflammatory anti-estrogen program.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:20.140
 - And folks can Google that and look at that.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.740
 I mean, you're talking anti-inflammatories like

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.980
 T-Rex and things like that?

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:25.820
 Different--

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.700
 - Oh, aspirin, for example.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.220
 - Aspirin.

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:32.900
 - The right amount of progesterone and pregnenolone,

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:38.060
 even though large amounts of progesterone

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:43.060
 antagonize testosterone, by inhibiting estrogen,

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:47.340
 the right amount of progesterone

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.900
 can actually increase your testosterone.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:55.340
 I've seen it happen in middle-aged men.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.180
 - And what do they do?

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:03.180
 - Take like five or 10 milligrams of progesterone

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:08.780
 and that lowers the aromatase activity,

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:14.140
 stops the conversion of testosterone to estrogen,

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:19.140
 and so it leaves the testosterone that you produce

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.900
 leaves it effective.

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.100
 - Oh, that's why you helped develop

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.420
 with the Progest-E product years ago?

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:28.260
 - Yeah.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:30.780
 - Yeah, uh-huh, and that's what that does, huh?

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:31.900
 - Mm-hmm.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:34.740
 - Dr. Peat, thank you for continuing to come on Patrick's show.

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:35.820
 I really enjoy it.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:38.700
 Could you ask Dr. Peat why he likes

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.580
 Morton's canning and pickling salt

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.820
 as it reads sodium chloride on the ingredients?

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.940
 I'm simply curious.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:51.140
 - Because it doesn't have the toxic additives

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.980
 that regular salt usually has.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:59.300
 - About all these different sea salts and things like that.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:05.220
 - Yeah, if you look at the ingredients carefully,

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:11.140
 there are several brands of sea salt that are just as pure,

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.900
 but they're usually three or four times as expensive

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.540
 as the canning salt.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.620
 - Yeah, you probably know Dr. Hal Huggins, right?

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.140
 The Mercury Fellow?

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:22.980
 - Mm-hmm.

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:26.980
 - We used to have him on quite a bit years ago,

01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:29.500
 a wonderful guy, and he would take

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.940
 all these different blood tests from people,

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:34.380
 and he was a real magician at it,

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.580
 and he would, thousands of 'em,

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.740
 and he claimed that people that did

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:41.900
 the pickling and canning sea salt had better,

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.740
 he called 'em blood chemistries,

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:47.940
 had better blood chemistries than people on sea salt.

01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:52.460
 - That's the effect of the sodium chloride itself.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:56.100
 Tom Brewer cited some studies,

01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:01.660
 a book by Shanklin and Hoden

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:06.460
 gave a lot of the details in which,

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.380
 without changing anything else in the diet,

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:16.380
 they gave women with serious eclampsia

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:20.540
 or pre-eclampsia symptoms, gave 'em, in one case,

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:24.860
 six grams extra sodium chloride per day,

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.620
 and in the other, I think it was 20 grams extra per day,

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:33.620
 and in both cases, that salt alone

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.740
 cured their pregnancy problems.

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:43.060
 It has wide, very general effects

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:48.180
 to avoid a sodium chloride deficiency.

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.180
 You're activating the protective oxidative metabolism,

01:09:53.180 --> 01:10:01.060
 suppressing aldosterone, and aldosterone rises

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:05.980
 in proportion to the lack of sodium chloride,

01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:09.180
 and aldosterone produces inflammation,

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:14.180
 heart disease, calcification, fibrosis.

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.820
 Everything bad produced by aldosterone

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.580
 is suppressed when you get enough sodium chloride.

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:27.820
 - Interesting, but do not these different fancier ones,

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.100
 you know, the Himalayan, and what's the other one

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.940
 from over there in Europe, Celtic sea salt,

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.420
 don't they have enough sodium chloride to be okay?

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.300
 - Very good, except they contain heavy metals.

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:42.460
 - Heavy metals, they all do.

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:47.460
 - The discoloration is usually largely from heavy metals.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:53.740
 - Oh, so the more white ones, maybe they would be better?

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.420
 - Yeah, the pure white.

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.340
 - Pure white.

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:59.220
 - That's the thing about pure sea salt

01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:01.740
 and Morton tanning salt.

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.540
 - Interesting, Dr. Peat Wayne says,

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.380
 "Dr. Warburg stated low oxygen in the cells

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:09.220
 "will result in cancer.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:13.060
 "What nutrients can I consume to increase the oxygen

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.860
 "in my cells as a prevention of cancer?"

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.860
 - Warburg's enzyme used vitamin B2 as its cofactor,

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:30.260
 and he advocated the great importance

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:33.740
 of getting enough vitamin B2 in your diet.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:40.780
 That can momentarily correct the cancer metabolism

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:45.660
 of overproducing lactic acid.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.260
 Many other things are needed to change

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:55.020
 the whole physiology, but vitamin B2 can,

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.420
 when you're overproducing lactate,

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:04.300
 the B2 can turn it off in a matter of hours,

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:09.300
 so that people with redness of the eyes,

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:15.220
 redness of the nose and cheeks, nosebleeds,

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.420
 memory problems, nightmares,

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.980
 lots of symptoms of a B2 deficiency

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:30.740
 and lactic acid excess, vasodilation

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:35.740
 and weakening of capillaries, that can be corrected.

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.900
 And according to Warburg, that will be a drastic protection

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:44.820
 against developing cancer.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:45.660
 - Fascinating.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.460
 Robert is in Australia.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:50.380
 He's got two questions.

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.460
 One, he's been, at your suggestions,

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:57.180
 trying some freshly squeezed orange juice and milk,

01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:01.340
 and he gets some headaches, strange noise in his head,

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:03.580
 and it also happens when he's eating bone broth,

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.740
 so he's been doing some research

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:08.100
 and thinking that it's probably related

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.060
 to histamine intolerance.

01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:12.980
 Can you please ask Dr. Peat

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:15.100
 what he can do to overcome this problem?

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:19.340
 - Keeping enough fiber in the diet is one thing.

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.820
 - Fiber.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:25.820
 - Yeah, when you shift to those liquid foods,

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:30.940
 you're likely not having the same amount of bulk

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.300
 in your diet, and a change in your intestine

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:40.300
 will invariably increase your serotonin and histamine.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.140
 - Ah, okay.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.700
 Can you use these?

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:45.500
 They got some pretty good, I think, organic,

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.380
 even psyllium husk, is that okay?

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:49.900
 - Yep. - Okay.

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:53.620
 - Any kind of fiber that doesn't irritate your intestine.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.540
 I've seen a couple people who got constipated

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.940
 from psyllium fiber, but usually it works.

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.940
 - It works okay.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.940
 - And oatmeal, oat bran, it usually is sold

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:11.020
 with quite a bit of starch attached to it,

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:15.420
 but the oat bran is a very effective bulk,

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:20.420
 except in the long run, it can increase your estrogen.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.900
 - Oh, right, yeah.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:28.140
 - Bamboo shoots, in excess, they have a slight

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:32.220
 anti-thyroid effect, but in moderation,

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:35.460
 they're a very safe fiber.

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:39.220
 Raw carrots are one of the safest fibers,

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:42.900
 and well-cooked mushrooms are another

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.440
 cancer-preventive fiber.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.640
 - And fiber, yeah, you're a big mushroom fan.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.560
 And of course, you talk about the raw carrot salad.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.400
 That's what it's doing, too, is the fiber,

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.320
 especially if you're gonna do more bone broths

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.040
 and milk and orange juice, you need that

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.800
 to move stuff through, huh?

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:05.840
 - Yeah, it will, over a period of several days,

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:09.360
 establish a new rhythm in the intestine,

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.560
 and that reduces estrogen, endotoxin,

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.600
 serotonin, and histamine.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.000
 - Excellent.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.560
 Robert in Australia is also taking three grains

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.600
 of thyroid, and my temperature has not risen

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.440
 to optimum levels, however, at the same time,

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.680
 my resting heart rate is about 90 to 100 per minute.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.040
 What could be going on?

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:38.480
 - That can happen with a selenium deficiency

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.480
 or a calcium deficiency or vitamin D deficiency

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.560
 or some other imbalance of nutrients.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:54.400
 So it's good to check what your ratio of calcium

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.260
 to phosphate in the diet is.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:16:01.240
 Too much meat, for example, will interfere

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.140
 with proper thyroid function.

01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:07.560
 - Too much meat.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.080
 So that's what you had mentioned last time you were on

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.080
 about even the animals getting lipomas from too much,

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:18.160
 what's the main ingredient in the meat?

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.520
 Phosphorus.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:26.520
 - Yeah, phosphorus turns out to be a pretty important toxin,

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:33.520
 not only in liver or kidney failure,

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.160
 but it generally is a promoter of cancer

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.120
 and degenerative diseases.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.400
 - So I guess on the animals, the calcium would be bones,

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:48.200
 why the people recommend giving bones to dogs, huh?

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.360
 I guess you'd get calcium there.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.360
 - Yeah, the carnivores usually eat the smaller,

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.740
 tender bones along with the meat,

01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:01.140
 so they're getting a balance more like milk and cheese.

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.320
 - Rhonda's listening, she says, "Dr. Peat, thank you

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.240
 "for being on the show with Patrick.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.200
 "Many years ago, Lita Lee,"

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.360
 oh yeah, I remember her, she used to talk

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.440
 about your work a lot, I guess she still does.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.440
 "She quoted you as saying, 'A man blew in the face

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.520
 "'from lack of oxygen, COPD, and able to walk

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.140
 "'was instructed by you to take a pinch

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:31.720
 "'of pregnenolone every day, and a couple weeks later,

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.720
 "the man was up walking around.'"

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:38.080
 Is this an accurate story?

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:43.080
 - Exactly, it was in Toluca, which is very high altitude,

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:48.800
 and I had known him for 40 years or so,

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.180
 and he didn't recognize me when I came in the room.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:59.120
 His attention was affected along with his breathing problem

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:06.360
 and purple face, but I gave his daughter

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:12.320
 a batch of pregnenolone and a thyroid powder

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:17.320
 to add to his food every day, and I went somewhere

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:21.080
 for two weeks and came back later,

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:23.560
 and he was his normal self.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:28.560
 He had his office on an upper floor downtown Toluca,

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:34.080
 and there were only ramps, and so he took me

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.440
 up to his office.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.320
 I got winded at the high altitude going up

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.960
 to the third floor, and he was doing fine.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.880
 He took me all around Toluca visiting

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:53.800
 various acquaintances and so on,

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.800
 and I was really short of oxygen,

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.480
 but he was absolutely breathing perfectly

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:09.320
 from official advanced emphysema

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.360
 to perfect lung function in two weeks.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.720
 - And what do you think happened here?

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.160
 What went on?

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:21.600
 - That caused me to look up the old literature,

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.800
 and it happened that right about that time

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.800
 I saw a woman, 35 years old,

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:35.960
 who for 15 years had had a terrible oxygenation problem.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:41.760
 It started when her father was giving her

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.520
 estrogen injections.

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.520
 He was a doctor, and thought women needed estrogen,

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.640
 but her lung oxygenation dropped to about 5% of normal,

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.320
 and stayed that way until she, 20 years later,

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.160
 took adequate thyroid.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.200
 Looking at the animal research,

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:11.200
 I saw that they had created emphysema in various species

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.800
 just with estrogen.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.600
 A shot of estrogen could decrease oxygenation

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.600
 of the lung by 95% in about an hour after the shot.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.880
 - Wow.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.280
 - Same thing that had happened to this woman.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.720
 And with age, both men and women

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:36.760
 accumulate more and more estrogen,

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.760
 unopposed by progesterone and androgens.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:48.120
 And there had also been studies of using progesterone

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:53.240
 in emphysema, curing emphysema

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:56.720
 just with a few doses of progesterone.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.840
 - Fascinating, wow, amazing.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.840
 - But those individual studies just didn't catch on

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.520
 and get spread through the culture.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:10.360
 - Dr. Ray Peat is November 16, 2020.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.880
 He's here on the third Monday of the month.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:15.080
 We'll talk about the Constitution tomorrow,

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.840
 how it could be affected with the FDA,

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.440
 any kind of vaxes or masking or social distancing,

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.720
 and also some of the election stuff.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.840
 So it'll be a fun show with Richard Proctor

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.080
 of the Constitutional Party.

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.320
 Ellie wants to know, Dr. Peat,

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:33.920
 is sesame oil okay to be used on the body?

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.360
 It's recommended for vatas in ayurvedic medicine.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:48.640
 - Internally, it has too much polyunsaturated fat

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.400
 for regular use.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.400
 And with covering a lot of your skin,

01:21:55.400 --> 01:22:00.600
 you can absorb harmful amounts of polyunsaturated fats.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:05.200
 But on a small area, it's harmless and probably beneficial.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.120
 - Dr. Peat, this is from Peter.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.600
 I use castor oil a few times a week

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.920
 to keep everything moving down below,

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.800
 if you know what I mean, we do.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.000
 Do you think there's any downsides to this?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.740
 - Since it takes itself out as it cleans your intestine,

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:30.800
 it's very unlikely to have any systemically harmful effects.

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:37.760
 Since it's a laxative, it just doesn't get

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.480
 very much absorbed.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:44.360
 - Yeah, please ask Dr. Peat how he avoids scarpenia

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.120
 and what foods keep testosterone levels up

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.520
 after age 65 from Ben.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:51.560
 - Sarcopenia?

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.520
 - Yeah, sarcopenia.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.720
 How he avoids sarcopenia, I guess, is the question.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.440
 And then raising T levels.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:04.960
 - Everything anti-inflammatory helps.

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:09.760
 - Recently, people have been noticing

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.440
 that things that lower angiotensin,

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:19.440
 the ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers,

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:26.440
 the blockers in particular help to restore muscle mass

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.600
 in old people.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:34.320
 Because it's inflammation developing

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.120
 with the accumulated hormonal changes of aging,

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:43.920
 the balance shifts towards estrogen,

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.920
 which activates nitric oxide

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:51.840
 and other pro-inflammatory mediators,

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.040
 causing inflammatory fibrosis

01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:01.040
 and loss of the functional muscle protein.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.520
 - Dr. Peat, this is from Angie.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.240
 I'm getting some of the Sinoplus from the Mexican pharmacy

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:10.080
 that you're suggesting might be worthwhile.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.680
 Can you tell me how many grains are in these tablets?

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.680
 How many grains?

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.200
 Yeah, she wants to know how they,

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.360
 I guess they compare to like nature thyroid,

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.040
 which are generally 60 grains, aren't they?

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.920
 Or I'm sorry, one grain or 60 milligrams?

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.240
 - That's a traditional definition,

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:32.240
 but the natural thyroids have varied greatly.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:37.800
 But I consider the Sinoplus to be more or less

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:42.680
 two and a third to two and a half grains equivalent.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.040
 So I recommend starting with no more than a fourth

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.360
 of a tablet for the first two or three weeks.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.240
 - Wow, so each Sinoplus is two to what?

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.840
 - Two and a half grains, roughly.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.680
 - Two and a half grains,

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:02.080
 which is, I guess, 2.5 times 60, right?

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.400
 Milligrams.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.240
 - Yeah.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.080
 - Right?

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:05.900
 - Yeah.

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:07.840
 - Wow, that's pretty hefty dose.

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:14.480
 - Yeah, yeah, no one starts on that much.

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.560
 Traditionally, people would be started on,

01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.440
 almost always on a half a grain.

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.280
 - And then work your way up?

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:29.880
 - Yeah, every two weeks,

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:35.280
 you can add a fourth to a half grain.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.280
 And people, most people ended up needing two grains.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:46.040
 So that's why the Sinoplus settled in on that dose.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.920
 That's for an established corrective dose.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.680
 - About a 2.5, they do?

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.080
 - Yeah, one pill a day.

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:58.480
 It ends up, but you shouldn't get there,

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.960
 try to get there the first week because it'll,

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:08.720
 for example, your tissue doesn't retain magnesium effectively

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.000
 when you're low thyroid.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.960
 And if you take a big dose of thyroid suddenly,

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:19.040
 there's not enough magnesium for the demand.

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:23.480
 And so it can cause vasoconstriction in your heart

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.040
 and cause pains and so on.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:27.960
 - Yeah, so, and the metrics you're using

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.440
 when you say when you have the right amount

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.240
 would be the body temperature, the pulse,

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:41.240
 and you've talked about the knee or the ankle thing

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.560
 where you're hitting the Achilles tendon as well.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:49.160
 - Yeah, it's the relaxation rate that you look for

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.920
 in that Achilles reflex test.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.920
 - Yeah, and then also the body temp and--

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:58.720
 - And pulse rate and quality of sleep.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.280
 - Quality of sleep.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.600
 - The depth of your sleep should increase very quickly

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.520
 when you correct the thyroid.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:10.880
 It's the same relaxation principle in your brain

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.880
 as in your ankle reflex. - In your ankle.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.880
 - It should relax instantly when you're not needing it.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:25.240
 So when you start trying to go to sleep,

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:30.240
 your brain should turn off as quickly as your foot relaxes.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.840
 - And if your foot doesn't relax,

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:35.880
 then you just keep taking it until the body figures it out?

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.680
 I mean, how much you need?

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.680
 - Yeah, using the Quick Acting T3,

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.760
 I've seen people whose foot took about two seconds

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.000
 to return to the relaxed position.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.840
 - Oh, yeah, that's the product from the same place, Doc.

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.760
 What's the name of that one?

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.600
 - Sinomel.

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.680
 - Sinomel, and that's just T3,

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.640
 and you've actually seen the relaxation thing

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.880
 just do quickly.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.640
 - Yeah, I think it was 10 micrograms.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:12.600
 I gave this person who had a very, very slow relaxation,

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.960
 and an hour later when we tried it,

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.400
 it was a normal, quick, floppy relaxation.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.820
 - Floppy, floppy.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.400
 - And you can get quick results

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.960
 against insomnia the same way.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:29.560
 - Just by trying with a little T3 before bed?

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.520
 - Yeah, I noticed it in myself,

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.520
 and a doctor in Nevada said he hadn't been able to sleep

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:42.320
 for three or four nights and was desperate.

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.400
 And I had some Sinomel in my pocket.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.440
 I told him to take 10 micrograms

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:55.160
 and the next day he pulled me aside

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:58.240
 and said, "That stuff's better than morphine."

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.400
 - I'll be, and how many micrograms

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.520
 in one of those Sinomels?

01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:03.400
 - 25.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.040
 - Oh, so you bought a half or so, huh?

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.240
 Wow, very interesting.

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:13.060
 So if you did that, which is interesting, a great story,

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:19.520
 is it gonna help the thyroid to be better each day

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.720
 or do you have to keep doing it?

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.680
 How does that work?

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:26.160
 - I've seen just two or three people

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.560
 who cured their hypothyroidism

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.760
 by supplementing for just a few days.

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.820
 It broke them out of a stress

01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:38.480
 that was inhibiting their thyroid.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.480
 But usually, if a person is overweight,

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:46.360
 the thyroid will help you get rid

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:50.400
 of the estrogen-producing fat

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.560
 and polyunsaturated fats in storage.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.280
 And once you've got those eliminated,

01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:00.740
 which typically takes from two to five years,

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:06.320
 then your thyroid can function normally with a good diet.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.280
 - Interesting, very good.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:10.080
 Couple more, then we'll let you go.

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:13.240
 People on YouTube are claiming Mexican Coca-Cola

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.040
 on YouTube contains high-fructose corn syrup,

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.720
 just like the American Coke.

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:21.320
 It's just Coca-Cola pandering to separate markets.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.560
 Do you think that's true?

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:29.480
 - I heard that story from someone working

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.840
 at the Pepsi-Cola company in Mexico

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:37.800
 that they were using invert sugar,

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:43.240
 but not the claim that they were using the corn syrup.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.000
 I hadn't heard that claim before.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.040
 - Yeah, I haven't either.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:52.080
 Why does Dr. Peat think that distilled water

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.040
 could be cancer-causing?

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.880
 I heard him say that a few times from Naomi.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:01.720
 - That was just a test demonstrating

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:06.720
 that any irritation will release histamine and serotonin

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:13.400
 and other inflammatory mediators

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:15.680
 and will be carcinogenic.

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:22.600
 That was involving injecting distilled water.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.060
 - Oh, I see.

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:28.080
 Is it safe to take aspirin to help

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.160
 with pain and discomfort, breastfeeding?

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.280
 Oh, C-section last week.

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.520
 Could there be anything to eat, drink, supplements

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:39.000
 to help with milk production?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.800
 So, okay, C-section last week.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.440
 Safe to take some aspirin to help

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.800
 with pain and discomfort and breastfeeding?

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:54.600
 - I think it's safe if your vitamin K level is adequate.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.400
 I would start supplementing some vitamin K

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:04.240
 and make sure your clotting system is good.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.640
 - I see.

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.600
 And to increase milk production.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:11.120
 Have you came across things over the years that'll do that?

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.480
 - Yeah, drinking orange juice and milk.

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:15.960
 - Orange juice and milk.

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:20.960
 - Yeah, I've seen non-producers

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:24.800
 get their normal milk production up

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.600
 if they drank a quart of orange juice for a day or two.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.440
 - Interesting.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.440
 Back in the hippie days, Dr. Peat,

01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.200
 we used to talk about, I don't know if it was true,

01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:35.120
 I do remember for breastfeeding moms

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.680
 to increase milk production was actually a natural,

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:42.840
 kind of a full-bodied beer.

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.000
 I wonder where that came from.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.920
 Do you think there's anything to that?

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.440
 - It's an old practice.

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:53.800
 Partly the idea was that it contains estrogen.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.640
 - Could be something to.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.320
 Okay, here's a final one for you.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.720
 Every now and then I get kind of swollen feet,

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.520
 not terrible, but it's some kind of edema.

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:07.960
 What could my body be telling me to look for

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.920
 to balance out?

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:16.920
 - Could be a salt or calcium deficiency or low thyroid.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.880
 - Either one or all three.

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.480
 - Or low protein.

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.040
 - Or low protein.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.720
 In general, before we go on this thyroid thing,

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:27.960
 whether you're doing SinoPlus

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.240
 or experiment around with Nature Throid,

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:34.920
 can we get to a point, do you think,

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.360
 where we can just help this thyroid be okay on its own

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:42.000
 or do we just mind taking some of the pig stuff

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.320
 or whatever we're gonna take for the rest of our life?

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.520
 I mean, does it matter to you?

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.360
 - By the time you're 45 or 50,

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:55.600
 there are so many accumulated problems that it's fairly--

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.000
 - You know what's the difference, right?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.720
 Take a little pig thyroid.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:04.240
 - Yeah, it's fairly rare that a person doesn't benefit

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:06.680
 from a little thyroid after the age of 50.

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.520
 - Yeah.

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:10.720
 I mean, there's no real downsides, is there?

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.560
 - No.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:16.200
 - Well, my friend, thank you for being here.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:20.200
 So you're not into the city of Portland

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:21.560
 where people are being silly,

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.000
 so you're outside there and taking care of yourself, right?

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.720
 - Yep, nothing happening here.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.560
 - Yeah.

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:30.520
 Do you see any, I know you kind of study this stuff,

01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.440
 do you think that we're gonna experiencing

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.040
 possible some food shortages?

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.880
 Have you looked at that?

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:40.880
 - Yeah, the World Economic Forum

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:46.360
 is, I think, intent on disrupting the economy

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.520
 at the point of creating food shortages

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.080
 so that they can institute their changes.

01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:00.960
 If you Google Klaus Schwab, World Economic Forum--

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.680
 - Yeah, we know him.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:06.800
 - Yeah, you'll find some really horrible plans

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.240
 they're putting out and instituting, putting into practice.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.080
 - They're not secret about it either, are they?

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.320
 It seems like they just put it out there.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.160
 - Yep, starting with the Rockefeller Foundation,

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.160
 10 years ago, they've put out the scenarios

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:25.160
 of taking over the world.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.000
 - We're hearing some pretty spooky things, excuse me,

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.840
 about this potential vaccine.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.120
 Dr. Seneff has been working on it from MIT,

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.160
 we're gonna have her on.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.120
 Have you heard anything or seen anything that disturbs you?

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.040
 - Anything that what?

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:45.600
 - Into this potential vaccine that's coming out.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.160
 - Oh, all--

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.720
 - All of the above?

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.600
 - They're proposing putting lots of horrible things in.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.520
 - Yeah.

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.840
 - Tracking devices.

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.480
 - I've heard that, wow, man.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.800
 So we just gotta figure out how not to take this guy, right?

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.400
 Even if somebody tells us to.

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:09.160
 - Yeah, and they're telling people to take a flu shot,

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:11.640
 even if they can't get the corona.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:16.640
 But several studies show that people who took a flu shot

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.600
 last season were several times more likely

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:24.800
 to develop a coronavirus infection this season,

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.040
 showing that they destroyed the immune system.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.840
 Even though they produce antibodies against influenza,

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:36.520
 they weaken the innate immunity.

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.320
 - We appear to be making some headways, though,

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.840
 in the courts, and I know you've talked about this

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:45.120
 on your website, but I know that there was a big victory

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.720
 in California where a couple attorneys took Governor Newsom

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.440
 to court and said he didn't have the authority

01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.880
 to do all this stuff he was doing, and they won.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.200
 So there's some things going on

01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:00.240
 that are positive in that regard.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.120
 - Yeah, several lawyers, people you've had on the program,

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.400
 are working through the courts,

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.640
 so I think there's hope that way.

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.280
 - Yeah, I don't know if they really get hardcore,

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.960
 Dr. Peat, with this vaccine thing.

01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:17.360
 It may be a Supreme Court one, huh?

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.200
 Could be.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:23.600
 - Yeah, and I hope the composition of the Supreme Court

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:27.720
 recognizes some kind of constitution.

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:28.920
 - Constitutional.

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:29.760
 We hope so.

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.680
 I think, theoretically, there's five to four

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.560
 more constitutionalists, but this Chief Justice fellow,

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.480
 I don't know what he's been,

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.400
 I think he needs some orange juice, Dr. Peat,

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:42.640
 because he's ruled some pretty silly rulings,

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.860
 in my opinion, in the last few months, Roberts.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:50.480
 - Yeah, there's a competition between authoritarianism

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.040
 and constitutionalism.

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:53.320
 - Yes.

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.600
 - Oh, that's the other word, yeah, authoritarianism.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.280
 Well, Dr. Peat, you take care of yourself.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:02.720
 We'll see you in a month or so, I guess before Christmas.

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.560
 - Okay.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:04.440
 - You have fun.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:05.320
 Thanks for everything.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:07.400
 We really appreciate your being here, sir.

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:08.240
 It's an honor.

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.160
 - Okay, thanks.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:14.160
 - Dr. Ray P, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.720
 Yeah, boy, I tell you, having some fun now, aren't we?

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:21.360
 We are having some fun now.

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.960
 Well, we're trying to stay on top of everything that we can

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:29.440
 as best we can, and I think you're gonna hear

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.560
 from a few people this week.

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:34.800
 We only have the, not only,

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:39.040
 but we have a constitutional fellow scheduled for tomorrow,

01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:43.040
 I think at 11 o'clock Central Time,

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:46.640
 but it doesn't matter exactly when we put it out there live.

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:47.480
 He'll be live.

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:49.120
 I think his internet is solid.

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.880
 Just tune into our website.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:53.880
 Please sign up for our newsletter,

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.960
 and Sharon sent some cool things out a few times a week.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.120
 It'll keep you up to date with all the people

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.520
 we're having on.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:01.840
 Don't forget our archives now.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.640
 We have an incredible suite of shows,

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:11.640
 probably 3,000 hours of audio shows on OneRadioNetwork.

01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:15.760
 So use our search function there at the top right.

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.840
 Use it if you wanna.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.040
 You'll find people going back, I don't know,

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.580
 what, 12, 13, 14, 15 years.

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:26.080
 Some really good stuff.

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:29.360
 Most of this, if we find people with some good information,

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:31.480
 it doesn't go out of date.

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:34.200
 So even if the show was 10 years ago,

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.480
 you're gonna be able to find some things that may help you.

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.920
 So we have a nice search function.

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.640
 You could put in people's names,

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:43.800
 put in things like low thyroid, high thyroid, whatever,

01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:46.280
 and then also go on to our YouTube channel,

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:51.280
 Patrick Timpone, and then subscribe to our channel.

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:57.080
 Click on the bell to the right of the subscribe button,

01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:02.080
 and that'll get you subscribed up and be notified

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.600
 when we put out the streams.

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.440
 We have a time out on Facebook,

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:11.080
 so I haven't been able to be there.

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:13.040
 Won't be there for a few more days.

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.080
 And we're looking at some other social media things

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.360
 that are less, whatever.

01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:23.720
 I don't even wanna, I don't need any more Zuckerberg karma,

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.360
 so I'm just being nice.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.680
 So keep in touch.

01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.320
 Let me know if I can help with anything.

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.080
 My name is Patrick Timpone.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.400
 I love you all very much.

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.920
 Thank you, and thanks for your ongoing support.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.400
 It's an honor to be here,

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:42.640
 and we will see you very soon on oneradionetwork.com.
