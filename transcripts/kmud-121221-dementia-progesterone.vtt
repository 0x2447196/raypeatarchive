00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Good evening. Welcome to this month's "Ask Your Herb Doctor." My name is Andrew Murray.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 or which we source from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 So thanks for joining. You're listening to "Ask Your Herb Doctor" on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 either related or unrelated, for this month's subject of dementia and progesterone.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So the number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911, or if you live outside the area,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 the toll-free number is 1-800-568-3723. That's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 And we can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Well, as luck would have it, today's a very special day, isn't it?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Two reasons. Number one, it's not the end of the world. At least, I don't think it's going to happen today anyway.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And secondly, but more importantly, it's actually the winter solstice.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 So the shortest day of the year, the longest night, and things can only get lighter and brighter from here on in until the next solstice.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 So that's one of the main things we look forward to.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 His latest research article is what we're going to be opening up in this month's show.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 His article is entitled "Demystifying Dementia, Protective Progesterone."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 I know he's a big fan of progesterone and the other anti-aging, anti-inflammatory-related compounds.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Okay, so I think as usual, for those people who perhaps have never listened to the show before, or maybe don't know you,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 would you please just give us a rundown of your academic professional background?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 From 1968 to '72, I studied biology at the University of Oregon for a PhD

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 and worked on aging of the reproductive system and physiology more generally.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 And one of the things I noticed during that working on my thesis relates to what we were talking about last month

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 and the relation of hormones to electromagnetic fields and dementia.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 I had been interested in radiation for a long time before I went to the University of Oregon

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 and was aware of some of the biological interactions.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And working on my thesis, I noticed that the effects of estrogen on biochemistry are in many ways exactly the same

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 as those of ionizing radiation and also paralleled the effects of too much polyunsaturated fat in the diet

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 or deficiency of vitamin E.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 That synergy between estrogen and radiation and fatty acids is behind this month's newsletter.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Yeah. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about what you've mentioned just there in terms of energy.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 I think most people hearing tonight show there's something I think we want to get across.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 There are several points and one of which is the need for metabolic energy in our bodies.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Every organism ultimately is using energy to convert chemicals into other chemicals.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Basically, all the cellular processes require a currency of some kind of energy.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Ultimately, ours is oxidatively burning glucose.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 That's the best way of doing it, isn't it?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Yeah. Under stress, we can force our physiology over to burning fat instead of glucose.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 That causes several changes.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 It produces less carbon dioxide and is likely to produce a lot of breakdown products that can cause inflammation.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 The carbon dioxide is useful again.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 I think most people listening, if they haven't perhaps heard before,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 carbon dioxide, you're very pro-carbon dioxide and actually kind of warning against getting too much oxygen.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 I think that's something we think of as being life-giving.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Ultimately, the oxygen is not particularly good for you, is it?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 No. Most people have heard about the glycated proteins that people get in diabetes or aging.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 They call them the AGE.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Advanced glycation end products?

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Yeah. Those stick to certain parts of protein molecules

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 and it happens that carbon dioxide also has a spontaneous ability to attach to those same groups.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 If carbon dioxide is abundant, you can't get glycation because carbon dioxide is protecting that.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 There you go.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 It's also the higher carbon dioxide in the blood will help you utilize your oxygen better.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 I mean, within normal levels. Obviously, if you have too high of a level, carbon dioxide will probably cause problems.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Yeah. It delivers oxygen to the cell.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 So, still stressing the importance of oxygen.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 It's just a higher carbon dioxide will allow the cells to absorb more oxygen.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Yeah. For example, in the brain, in proportion to how much glucose you're oxidizing

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 and how much carbon dioxide you're producing, it not only releases the oxygen from the hemoglobin

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 so it can get into the cell, but it relaxes the blood vessels so that more blood brings oxygen.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 That's a general feature of carbon dioxide. It tends to relax things.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 So, when our metabolism is working healthily, then we will be burning sugar for fuel and not fat.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Under stressful situations, we burn fat.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 If that fat is a polyunsaturated fatty acid from nut and seed oils, then it becomes quite a stress on the system.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Yeah. It happens that starvation or radiation or estrogen will all shift oxidation from sugar to fat.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Right. Which is why fasting, again, is not a good thing to do, is it?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 You don't advocate fasting, even though I think a lot of people or new age groups or cultures

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 will say that fasting is a fairly important part of a yearly process.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Yeah. One of the special problems of fasting, if you've been eating polyunsaturated fats in the past,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 is that it gives you a pure diet of polyunsaturated fat with a terrific amount of oxidation byproducts

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 that go into a starvation state.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Yeah. Okay. That's the whole point of it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 You're going to metabolize the fats that you have rather than the sugars during fasting.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 And all those free fatty acids that are liberated are going to be very damaging.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Yeah. They specifically spoil the ability of the enzymes to produce energy from anything, especially from sugar.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 And the failure to produce energy is almost exactly the definition of stress.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Anything that makes you lack energy is stress.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 It turns on the whole system of responses to stress.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Okay. Doesn't the body go into stress after eight hours of not eating?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 If you've got a tremendously efficient liver, some people can go much longer than that.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 But as your liver gets less efficient, many people can only go an hour or even less without suffering the symptoms of starvation.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 Some people wake up every one or two hours during the night with nightmares or a pounding heart,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 which happens when the liver runs out of its sugar supply.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Okay. So getting back to not losing the thread of the metabolic energy point behind Alzheimer's,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 would you open that up a little bit and explain why this energy failure leads or is in part responsible for Alzheimer's?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Well, the features that people consider to define Alzheimer's in the last 10 or 20 years have been the amyloid plaques

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 and the neurofibril tangles.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And it happens that the folding of these proteins that form amyloid fibrils,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 the folding is intensified by free fatty acids if they're polyunsaturated.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And those are released into the bloodstream when your liver runs out of sugar, basically, or you're starving.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Yeah. And so chronic starvation and chronic exposure to polyunsaturated free fatty acids.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 Or chronic exposure to stress.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Yeah. That's a major factor in creating the amyloid. And the amyloid has sort of a chain reaction effect,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 creating the tangles and the phosphorylation of tau protein and the whole structural change that they identify as

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 typical of the Alzheimer's brain.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Any injury to any tissue anywhere in the body happens to activate the enzyme which creates estrogen.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 It's like when you injure a tree, it causes sprouting by turning on hormones in response to the injury.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 That's how estrogen works.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Many enzymes get turned on, but especially aromatase, which is the basic former of estrogen itself.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 And so in stress or any injury, aromatase appears and begins making estrogen right inside the tissue.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And that happens in the Alzheimer's brain.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 You mentioned also that for people that are listening that are not scientific perhaps,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 the mitochondria, you've mentioned these in the past, and for people that aren't particularly scientific,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 these are the kind of factories, if you like, of energy production within the cell.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And every cell has mitochondria. And these are also damaged by estrogen.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Yeah, and not only is estrogen damaging them in at least six or eight different ways,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 it shifts from the ability to oxidize glucose.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 It impairs the very enzyme that uses oxygen several different places in the mitochondria.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 But besides poisoning the energy, it also blocks the ability to turn cholesterol into steroid hormones.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 The brain is one of our biggest steroid-forming glands in the body.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 And its concentration of steroids, progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone, especially DHEA and progesterone,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 is about ten times higher than in the bloodstream.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 It's probably the largest consumer of oxygen as well, right?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 Yeah, and the production of these neurosteroids is one of the major uses of oxygen.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 So testosterone is produced in the brain as well as absorbed from what's circulating in the blood.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And when the brain is injured, besides not making these hormones as effectively as it should

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 because of the damaged mitochondria, the aromatase enzyme begins turning testosterone into estrogen.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 And last month we talked about how the electromagnetic field exposure lowers testosterone.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Any injury does that, ionizing radiation, concussion, starvation, whatever.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 And these poofers you're saying are also another...

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Yeah, and so as the testosterone goes down, the estrogen is going up.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 And that causes other hormones.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 The brain is a source of signals to the other glands in the body.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 The gonadotropic hormones, FSH and LH, regulate the ovaries and testicles.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 So basically we can look at estrogen as just a very big player in mediating inflammation

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 and causing a lot of inflammation.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 And it basically would be lumped together with prostaglandins,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 and estrogen would be the opposite of what testosterone and progesterone does in the healthy brain.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Yeah, in many ways, probably dozens of different ways.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 I don't think people consider estrogen to be such an inflammatory mediator.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 I think we consider estrogen to just be a normal hormone like progesterone and testosterone,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 but actually they're contradicting each other constantly, male and female bodies.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Yeah, that's because the estrogen industry has done such a good advertising job for it.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 And when you're exposed to radiation, whether it be from x-rays

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 or whether it be from satellites and cell phones,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 it all increases your estrogen, which then blocks the testosterone in men and the progesterone in women

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 and causes a cascade of inflammation.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 And it's now generally and widely accepted that the Alzheimer's brain is inflamed,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 but they don't like to talk about the connection between the inflammation

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 and the high estrogen production in the brain and the loss of progesterone and testosterone.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMU DeGalbraithville, 91.1 FM.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of dementia and progesterone.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And again, we're very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat to the show,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 who's basically giving us the byproduct of his research and his latest newsletter, Dementia and Progesterone.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Okay, so to carry on with Alzheimer's, given that that is the topic of this show,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 the amyloid and the neurofibril tangles that you've mentioned are diagnostic in the brain.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 The best things in terms of energy production and/or protection, what have you found is probably the most important?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 It's hard to say what's most important because there are so many things working together,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 and each person has their own angle on the problem metabolically.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 But keeping your exposure to the polyunsaturated fats as low as possible,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 keeping the endotoxin exposure low, and avoiding excess iron retention

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 because all of the inflammatory things following from estrogen and serotonin overexposure,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 it causes the release of iron from the breakdown of the hemoglobin molecule.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 And the iron is a catalyst to the lipid peroxidation that is exaggeratedly high in demented brains.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 That brings me on to you talk about lipid peroxidation byproducts.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 You mentioned a compound, which I did take some time to look up, and maybe we'll talk about that in a little bit.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Acrolein is being 10 to 100 times more potent than some of the other lipid byproducts that you've mentioned in the past from fish oil.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 So talk a little bit about acrolein and how damaging that is.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 It's a very tiny fragment that comes mainly from the omega-3 fatty acids.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Right, and they're in fish oil.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 I think because it's so small and chemically active, it has greater effect by many times than the longer chain aldehydes and oxygens.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 It's much more potent at catalyzing the reactions, though, and apparently it lasts a lot longer.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah, and the fact that it comes from the oils that are being proposed as even cures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 fish oil supplements and other omega-3 fats are the main sources of acrolein.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Okay. All right, I think we're just trying to get rid of some buzzing here, and I think it's some part of the electrical equipment.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Anyway, that's fine. I think we're all okay with that.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 So I know you said also that testosterone opposes the effects of estrogen and cortisol.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Yeah, one of the ways testosterone works is to lower the luteinizing hormone, and people are now thinking that this gonadotropin,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 a pituitary hormone itself, has a big role in forming Alzheimer's disease. For example, they've created transgenic mice that can't produce any of the LH,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 the pituitary hormone, and they are free of Alzheimer's disease, and they're crossed with a strain that is bred to produce dementia.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 If they don't have the luteinizing hormone, LH, they don't get demented.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 And other mice, similarly, alter genetically so that they have no aromatase enzyme and can't produce estrogen,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 when they're crossed with the demented strain, they can age normally without dementia.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 And they happen to have twice as much testosterone in their brain as the normal mice that can produce aromatase.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 So the estrogen is being produced at the expense of the testosterone,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 partly because of the presence of the LH, partly just from the intrinsic injury of radiation or starvation or whatever.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Because even X-ray exposure will increase estrogen and serotonin, and then in turn those will block the effects of testosterone and progesterone.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 And any kind of radiation, electromagnetic fields from radio and television and telephones and so on,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 or X-rays, dental X-rays, medical X-rays, or still the lingering fallout from the atomic bomb tests of the '50s and early '60s,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 probably that's a factor still in the increasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 because radiation exposure usually takes at least 10 years and up to 40 years to produce cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 And you were telling us that even though they stopped the atomic bomb testing in 1962 or 1963,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 and it only peaked around 1965, all the accumulation of the radioactive isotopes that were in our environment,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 you said that there was a large increase in Alzheimer's disease in 1980.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 So it seemed to take 15 years to --

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Probably other things were happening at the same time that the increasing consumption of polyunsaturated fats has continued through this same period.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 Which are the nut and seed oils, just for our listeners, corn oil and cotton seed oil, and a lot of others.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 The consumption of milk decreased during this time, and there have been several studies that showed that milk drinkers have less Alzheimer's disease.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And so the declining milk happens to coincide with increasing polyunsaturated fats

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 and the previous exposure to large amounts of radioactive isotopes that were absorbed into the tissues,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 doing their damage when the person was younger.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Now, to bring this around again to the beginning, it's a basic energy deficit in the body,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 whether it's poisoning from PUFA or radiation or a byproduct of an increased estrogen in the body.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Or excess iron or bacterial imbalance in the intestines causing an endotoxin.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 These things have a fairly common denominator in terms of the thing that you can do.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 I know you've been a great proponent of thyroid hormone as well as progesterone.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 And the thyroid hormone, the bottom line of that is it's enabling metabolism to be corrected by producing energy more effectively,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 allowing the cells to produce energy the way they should.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 It increases the cytochrome oxidase enzyme, which is the one that is very sensitive to stress, estrogen, carbon monoxide,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 and basically all of the toxins and stresses.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 So it has a direct effect on improving and/or increasing that?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Yeah, thyroid is the main thing responsible for increasing it.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 It causes the genes to be expressed.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 It causes the copper to be absorbed that the enzyme uses as a cofactor.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Light is another major factor because with the stress of metabolism, the copper can get detached from the enzyme.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 And the exposure to ordinary visible light, the red long waves of light that will pass right into your brain,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 these happen to lift the copper atom just enough to restore its position in the cytochrome enzyme.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 So it energizes the copper ion?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 The copper is reactivated by the red light that's absorbed in the tissue.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And that research was done about 40 years ago, but just in the last year, a group in the U.S. did memory studies,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 and they showed that just shining some red light on the head improves memory.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And right now we're experiencing the lowest light of the entire year, and we'll continue to experience dark days.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Yeah, I think everyone's a little demented in the winter.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Metabolically as well as psychologically.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Well, let's hold that thought for a minute.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 I think there's a couple of callers on the line, so we're just coming up to the 730 point.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 So let's see if we've got the first caller.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 You're on the air?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Hello, you're on the air.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Oh, hi.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Is that me?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 It is.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 It's your turn.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Go ahead.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Hello, folks.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 I'm very much enjoying your talk.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Dr. Peate, I have three very tightly related questions regarding light.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 You've written about the importance to health of receiving balanced light, and now I heard you speaking about red light.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 I guess I was interested in how many hours a day you consider it healthy to expose oneself to natural daylight,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 and during what hours of the day is healthiest.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 And I guess the third question would be do you have any exceptions to that or cautionary words for those of us who still have

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 high polyunsaturated fatty acids stored in our tissues?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 I'm going to thank you in advance.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 I'll hang up and I'll listen off the air.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 The ultraviolet damages cells primarily by interacting with polyunsaturated fats.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 A couple of the Weizmann's also interact with ultraviolet light,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 but the worst damage is done by the oxidation of unsaturated fats.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 And so aspirin is very protective against sunburn.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Progesterone and other things that stop the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats will protect to a great extent against ultraviolet

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 and sunburn or against ionizing radiation.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 You don't want to count on taking aspirin and progesterone.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 It's better to avoid the radiation itself.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Don't have your dental x-ray.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Dentists can work on your teeth without x-rays.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 They can do root canals without x-rays.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Don't just say it's okay.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 You'll have progesterone and aspirin afterwards.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 The exposure to red light, if it comes within an hour of the ionizing or ultraviolet exposure,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 does something very similar to what it's doing in repairing the energy of the mitochondria and improving the memory and so on.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 It stops the electronic excitation that continues causing chain reactions of oxidation of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 They've given experimental animals killing doses of gamma rays, for example,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 but if they shine very bright red light on them in the first hour, they aren't killed.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 That's quite incredible.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 So what would you recommend as a healthy level at this dark time of the year, especially if you're on the Pacific Northwest?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 I don't think we've seen the sun in days.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 I think it's best to keep as much incandescent long-wave light on your skin,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 as much of your skin as possible for as many hours of the day as possible,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 just turning it off for eight or nine hours while you're asleep.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Avoiding the too intense light during the middle of the day in summer is important because of the circulating oxidative products of the polyunsaturated fats

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 that poison your whole body.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 It's the same effect if you x-ray your hand, your brain and ovaries and such will experience an estrogenic effect.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 It's not localized.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 It doesn't stay just where the x-ray was.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 No, they circulate.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Same with sunburn.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 You absorb the poisons all through your body if it's too intense and not counteracted by progesterone or aspirin or such.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 So depending on the time of year, before 10 or 11 a.m. and after 2 or 3 p.m.?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Yeah, and just enough to get your vitamin D requirement, which is quite a bit, but you don't want to get sunburned.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 So if you're burning, it's too much.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Up until the burn point, it's good for you.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 You've recommended in the past 250 watt heat lamps as a good source of red light.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Yeah, and even 2 or 3 of those at this time of year, right up until almost bedtime, it's good to have 300 or 500 watts shining pretty much at you.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 Yeah, well that free radical quenching effect of the mice is pretty incredible.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Okay, I think we've got two more callers, so let's work our way through these.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Next caller, you're on the air?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Is that me?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Yes, you're on the air.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 Hello?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Hello.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 Oh, hi, it's Sandy in New Jersey. How are you?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 We're doing good. Thanks for joining us.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Hi, Dr. Peat. It's Sandy Soto. I haven't communicated with you in a long time.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 I wanted to ask you about -- I've been looking into accelerated learning, and I've been reading also about smart drugs, only because I just happened to come upon that.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 And I'm trying to learn some new skills and figure out some ways of increasing my learning ability as well as my intelligence.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 And I saw that you had mentioned something about having taken vitamin B1 before a test when you were in university.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 So I just wanted to ask you about different ways of increasing intelligence and maximizing learning.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 And I can take my answer offline.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Intense effect you can get from the right combination of thyroid, T3, and a big dose of vitamin B1 if the rest of your nutrition is good.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 I've told several people to try that over the years, and no one has scored under 800 on the graduate record exam or the other standardized exams where that's considered just about a perfect score.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 But when they did it, taking about 100 milligrams at the start, it lets you have access to just about everything you've ever known or thought.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 100 milligrams of B1.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Yeah.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 There you go.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 That's incredible.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 And liver is a great source of all your B vitamins.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Yeah, you have to back up your physiology.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 Thyroid and B1 can't do it all by itself.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 All right, cool.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Okay, so I guess that answers the last person's questions.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 I wanted to bring out another interesting point that you brought up, Dr. Peat, and that was it's kind of going back to the non-RNAs and radiation that we were talking about last month, you know, the cell phones,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 but also the electromagnetic fields, and you said that there was a study done on sewing machine workers and how they had a three times risk of dementia or Alzheimer's because they were exposed to an electromagnetic field from the motor of the sewing machine.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Yeah, I think that was people who were working eight or ten hours a day for a long time, like in a sweatshop situation.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 So even something that people think is harmless like a motor can cause an imbalance in the estrogen and the progesterone levels.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Yeah, and very small fields have been used therapeutically, like an electric clock near the head has been tested on people with Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Very, very small fields can have a beneficial effect in certain circumstances.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Michael Persinger has done some very good neurological studies, and he has a video on YouTube explaining some of the energy levels involved in nerve interactions with electromagnetic fields.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 So that was Michael Persinger.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 Persinger.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Persinger, okay.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 We've got actually two more callers, Dr. Peat, so let's take the next one.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 Actually, I'm asking a question for the first one.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 He heard you mention that the liquid oils are bad, nut and seed oils.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Could you expound a tiny bit on that?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 I guess he's the first time listening.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Okay, so polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are also known as omega-3 and omega-6 oils, are found in all nuts and seeds.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Coconut oil is a very saturated fat, so it does not contain any of these polyunsaturated fats.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 So we're talking about hemp seed oil, cotton seed oil, corn oil, safflower, canola, sunflower, sesame, peanut, olive oil is not considered a PUFA, as we like to call them.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 It has about 10% PUFA.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 It only has 10% PUFA, and the other 90% is monounsaturated.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 So if you have just a normal amount in your salad dressing, it's not going to cause too much trouble.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 But all these fats, butter and meat fat, all has a tiny bit of PUFA in it.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 What percent does that have in it, Dr. Peat?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Two or three percent.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 Right, so we will all accumulate PUFAs, even if we eat a completely saturated fat diet.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 And what about the high oleic safflower and sunflower, and what is bad about those?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Because they still contain quite a large percentage of the polyunsaturated, even though they say they're higher in the mono, or the oleic acid is also the monounsaturated.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 When I was working in the hamster lab at the university, and got interested in the unsaturated fats, I bought a bottle of, I think it was corn oil, and put a rubber tube in the top of it with a rubber stopper, and put the other end in a bottle of water.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 And I was doing respiration experiments at the time on tissue with a Barberg apparatus that, as the tissue respired, would suck water up the tube.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And this bottle of corn oil was respiring about as fast as my tissues, sucking water up as it oxidized.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 That quickly, yeah.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 They're very prone to oxidation and going rancid. Even if they are not rancid before you eat them, they will go rancid inside your body.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 And it also includes fish oil.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Okay, fish oil is much more unstable oxidatively than even the ordinary corn oil.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 And it's the byproducts of that breakdown that we've mentioned, that you've mentioned, that the acrolein is another very powerful...

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 Acrolein and all the lipid proxidation, it's very harmful. Free radicals, basically it's causing a massive free radical reaction in your body that can last up to four years, because it takes four years for your body to break down a fat cell.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 I know we have another caller on the line, but the other thing I wanted to say is that the high oleic safflower oils, coconut and the hydrogenated, naturally hydrogenated palm oil make great substitutes for the frying oils.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Okay, so let's take this next caller. You're on the air?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Hello.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Is that me?

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 It is.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 Yeah, a couple of three questions actually. What about macadamia nut oil?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Okay, let's take it one at a time. Dr. Peat?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 I can hardly hear you guys.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 I think it's not so bad. It's more like olive oil. I can really hardly hear you.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 Okay, it's higher in the monounsaturated, higher in oleic acid than the other nut and seed oils. So that is the one nut I will eat occasionally, because it doesn't seem to have near as much polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Okay, now I have a question getting back to the beginning of the show, which was the radiation stuff. What happens with computer screens with people?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Well, if they're like the old cathode ray.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Pardon me? I can really hardly hear you.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 It depends. The monitors that most people use these days are flat screen monitors. They're not the cathode ray tubes. And the CRT screens were very, very strong emitters.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 We're talking about laptops here, which is kind of like, you know, they're like test screens, like they're like liquid crystals or something.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Sure, yeah. They're not as bad as the CRT screens that people used to stand in front of.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Oh, the old kind of like monitor screens?

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 Yeah, like the old TVs. They were very bad. The CRTs are flat screens, plasma screens. They don't have the same kind of properties.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 After a couple of years of my parents working on those old computer screens, they had to get glasses.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Okay, well, I know. But what do they do to, like, say, what cell phones do and what, you know, I guess, you know, put in your head, I mean, put in your brain or what?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 You know, how do computers relate to that?

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 Like, you know, like laptops.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 I don't think you should keep a laptop on your lap.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 I can't hear this guy.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 He said he doesn't think you should keep a laptop on your lap.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 No.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 That's one of the responses.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 I'm computer illiterate, but I'm also a computer widow because my wife has one and it's like weird because she's on the thing like eight hours a day.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 And it gets a little dizzy and it gets a little weird and like forgetful and whatnot.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Like, you can't think, you know, you don't really have your own brain unless it's on the computer.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Okay.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 I find that rather frustrating.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 And I'm wondering if there's actually any way, like, is there like a detox for computer users?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Don't keep it on your lap and maybe get a detachable keyboard so you're not putting a motor or a battery that's emitting electromagnetic fields on your lap or your body.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 Then you can type away because the actual liquid screens, you know, the flat screens, they're not radioactive.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 They're not emitting things like a television.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 Not like a television.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 No.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Okay.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 But is there any kind of like, you know, a deprogramming for people that use these things like too much all the time?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 A walk in nature.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 Yes.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 I know that.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 I live in a redwood forest.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 But I just, you know, I'm frustrated.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 A walk on the beach so you're next to the breaking waves.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Yeah.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 Okay.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 And I forgot my third question, but I love your show and bless your hearts.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Thank you for joining.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Hey, happy New Year.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Yeah, happy Christmas and happy New Year to you too.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 Okay.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 I think we have another caller on the air, so let's get this next caller.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 You're on the air?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Hello, you're on the air?

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 Hello, yes.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 This is David.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 Is this the right one?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Yep, you're on the air.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 Yes, you know, I was curious if Dr. Peat or either one of you have heard of earthing technology?

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 Just read an article the other day.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Where you have different maps and different devices that are plugged into the source on the plug-in.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 Yeah, I just read an article the other day about earthing and I was fairly, gosh, it pricked my interest for sure.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 What was your question?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 Well, supposedly, you know, like your last caller was asking about the electromagnetic waves from the computer,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 you know, and Dr. Peat has talked about those being harmful.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 Supposedly, this earthing technology, I actually have a map that I use when I'm using the computer.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Okay.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 And supposedly--

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 And your feet are bare, aren't they?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 --the ground frequency of the earth basically overwhelms any of the electromagnetic waves coming from these devices.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Does that make sense at all?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Yeah, Dr. Peat, have you heard of this grounding technology?

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Yeah, the particular thought that they have is that it removes an excess of electrons from the body,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 but actually the earth is also a source of electrons.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 And I'm fairly sure that there is benefit from having some kind of a more or less direct contact with the earth.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 I'm not sure the argument in that book is exactly right, but I think the point is good.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 So what do you think about these--

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 Well, I've used a meter, you know, like been next to a computer, put my hand on a laptop,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 and then actually put my hand on the grounding mat,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 and it did seem to change the frequency immediately, you know,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 back down to a normal frequency more similar to the earth.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 So I don't know if it's working or not, but it seems like it could possibly be beneficial.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 One thing it does is to prevent the buildup of fields,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 and grounding everything in the house is probably a good idea,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 but still staying away from the machine as far as possible is the best thing.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 And, you know, using like Apple TV, which is obviously, you know, a wireless frequency going through the house,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 those things are, I'm assuming, are really bad for us.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 Well, it's just adding to our load of non-ionizing radiation.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Okay.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 You know, it's just more that you might not need if you can be connected to a wire.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Yes.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 I'm not sure it isn't as convenient, though, but I guess our health is more important.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 Anyway.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Okay.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 Well, thank you.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 You're very welcome.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 Okay.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Bye.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 Thank you.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 So was that the end of the callers?

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 No.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Okay.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 I think we still have another caller.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 Let's take this next one.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Hello.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 Hi.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 You're on the air.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 Hi.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 I have a question about oils again.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 I attended the Weston A. Price Foundation Conference recently.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 I don't know if you're familiar with that program.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 And kind of the basis of it is fermented cod liver oil plus butter oil together.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 And there was also -- so I'd like your thoughts on the fermented cod liver oil.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 And there was a speaker who gave evidence about how coconut oil,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 being a medium chain fatty acid, prevents and reverses Alzheimer's.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 And the dosage was one tablespoon three times a day.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 And there was evidence given about how it reversed Alzheimer's.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 So I'd like your comments on Weston A. Price, if you're familiar with that work,

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:19.000
 and the cod liver oil and the coconut oil for Alzheimer's.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 Yeah, the butter is good.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 And I think it's better to eat the whole liver rather than just the oil,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 because there is a lot of polyunsaturated fat in the oil.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 And you'll get the same vitamins in the actual liver rather than in the oil of the liver.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 And many more vitamins besides.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 You don't get the K, vitamin K, in the liver but not in the oil.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 And the B vitamins are not in the oil either that you would get in the liver.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 So what do you think about the Weston A. Price protocol?

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Well, it's better than most things going around.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 Okay. All right. We do have another caller, so let's perhaps rather get into that.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 You're on the air?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 Hello.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 I don't know if you're covered or not, but I've recovered dementia with vegetating,

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 doing juice of cannabis vegetative leaves.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 The juice of the leaves?

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Yes, I'm doing it up here.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 Juicing cannabis leaves in the vegetative stage helps dementia victims.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 Have you covered that yet?

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 No.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 Do you know anything about that?

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 I really can't even hear you, unfortunately.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 So I guess I'll just put my question out there if you heard me.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 Yeah, we heard your question.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 We'll go ahead and answer your question.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 Earlier we were talking about avoiding the unsaturated fats,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 and the saturated fats help to protect you against even the stored unsaturated fats in your tissues.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 So that's one of the things that the coconut oil is doing.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 But since the unsaturated fats are poisoning your energy-producing system and blocking the thyroid action,

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 usually you can notice your metabolic rate speed up when you take a tablespoon of coconut oil.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 And that only lasts for an hour or so after a tablespoonful.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 So if you do it with each meal, you're getting, in effect, thyroid activation,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 which restores your energy production for a while.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 So coconut oil and sugar and thyroid are things that help to offset the polyunsaturated fats.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 Have you heard anything about what that last caller was mentioning about the juicing vegetative leaves?

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 I've heard of using the various forms of the cannabis chemicals, but not the leaves.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 Okay, all right. Well, we have another caller, so let's get this next caller.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 Hello.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 I just had a quick question for Dr. Peat, and it's a great show.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 It's about a heating pad.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 You were talking about electromagnetic fields, and my good friend lays on a heating pad.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 I wonder if you could answer that, Dr. Peat.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 Yeah, definitely that's putting out 60-cycle fields very strong and close to your body.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 So it's better to use your heating pad on the bed before you get in, or your electric blanket,

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 the same, turn it off when you get in bed.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 Fields that are closer to our own bodies are more dangerous,

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 and 60 cycles like we were talking last month is what normal electricity is,

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 and our body is like 7 to 10, so it's getting pretty close compared to a lot of these higher frequency things.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 Okay, I think you have a question.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 A caller wanted to know about green tea oil.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 Dr. Peat, green tea oil?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 I don't know anything about it.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 I don't know anything about the oil, but I know that green tea has a lot of antioxidant

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 and anti-aging compounds like a lot of other caffeinated plants and substances do.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 I've actually seen a seed oil from green tea when I was in Korea, but I don't know anything about it.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 I didn't know that tea had enough to make an oil, enough fat in it to make an oil.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 It's very expensive.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 Okay, so maybe it's like rose oil.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 I did want to bring up one more point before the end of the show tonight, if we don't have any more callers,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 and that is, Dr. Peat, you talked about endotoxin and how that can increase dementia and Alzheimer's,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 and I just wanted to bring out that Dr. Andrew Wakefield, when he was studying autistic children,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 he noticed that when their diets were cleaned up or they took antibiotics or aspirin,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 that they had a reduction in autistic symptoms.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 Dr. Peat, are you familiar with his work?

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 No, but that's consistent with everything else that endotoxin does.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 It increases your serotonin exposure.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 Serotonin works to increase estrogen, free fatty acids, and so on,

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 poisoning the mitochondria, and high serotonin is characteristic of autism,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 and so cleaning up the intestine, several approaches have done a similar thing for autism,

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 and anything that lowers the serotonin seems to help autistic.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 There are also steroid or drugs such as cyproheptadine and various antiserotonin drugs.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 Along with the toxic effects on the intestine of endotoxin,

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 I should mention that particles that are being increasingly used in our food supplements,

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 such as titanium dioxide and silica, silicon dioxide,

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 these particles have been put into animals' noses,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 and they find that they go directly to the brain and cause inflammation in the brain.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 Similarly, in the intestine, any particle that is ingested can get into the bloodstream

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 and reach the brain where it can cause inflammation.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 And I know you're a big proponent of not eating grains and starchy root vegetables

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 and instead eating fruit.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 Yeah, part of that is because the particles of starch themselves

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 can get into every compartment of the body, including the brain.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 And there's another doctor that uses this for autistic children and diet,

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 just fruit and honey for all their carbohydrates,

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 and the children are in much better shape.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 Another diet feature that helps with all of the brain problems is in fruit juice.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 Orange juice and guava, for example,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 are very high in substances that knock out the estrogen-producing enzyme.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 They're aromatase inhibitors.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 These are apigenin, naringenin, and aspiratin.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 And soybeans happen to have a substance that does exactly the opposite called genistein.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 So for Christmas, avoid soy and eat oranges instead.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 Well, listen, Dr. Peat., I want to stop you there just so I can make sure

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 that people that are listening can get more information about you.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 I think it's fairly clear, not just from tonight's callers,

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 but we just want to let you know on the air too that we get so many people writing

 and things they need to really stand up and take notice of.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 So thank you so much for giving your time, Dr. Peat.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
