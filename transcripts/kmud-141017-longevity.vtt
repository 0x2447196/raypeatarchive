00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.460
 like I said

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.140
 every third Friday of the month we have a topic that we choose to open up and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.960
 Once again, I'm very pleased to have dr. Raymond Peake to share his wisdom and his expertise

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.540
 during the show

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.880
 From seven thirty to eight o'clock at the end of the show

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.760
 Listeners are invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of longevity

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.400
 So you're listening to ask your herb doctor on KMED Galbaville

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.980
 91.1 FM and from 730 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock as I said you're invited to call in with any questions

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.760
 UD rad rad

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.280
 Now we can also be reached incidentally

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.360
 Monday through Friday on

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.080
 1888 WBM herb for consultations or further information

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.120
 So once again, we're very pleased to have dr. Raymond Pete with us dr. Pete. Yes. Hi. Thanks so much for joining us again

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.760
 I know that a lot of your background has been involved with reproductive physiology and aging and so

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.220
 As always I would ask you just to introduce yourself and your professional and academic background for people perhaps who've never listened to you

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.680
 Okay, um, I started getting interested in aging of I

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.360
 guess in childhood, but through the 1950s when I would mention it to

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.080
 people a

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.080
 Few of the very old people like a biology professor who studied

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600
 around the turn of the century

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.040
 had some interesting ideas about the actual cause of aging and

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.360
 that

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.360
 suggested possibilities for actually preventing it but

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.040
 most people in the 1950s

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.560
 Weren't at all interested in the idea of curing aging. It just was inconceivable that

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.520
 Anything could be done about it. But

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.680
 Finally when I decided to go to graduate school in biology

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.240
 1968 to 72 at the University of Oregon

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.440
 to do I

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.600
 intended to study brain

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.280
 biology, but it happened to

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.720
 There were some good people working on reproductive aging. So I did my dissertation on

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.920
 Female reproductive aging and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.640
 That helped to answer some questions that I've been accumulating for 20 years

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.720
 but it

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.520
 Really just opened up a lot of basic biological questions

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.000
 the whole nature of what an organism is and how

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.960
 It develops through time

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.320
 Growing up from an egg to an adult

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560
 the whole process is

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.200
 Something that

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.560
 used to be explained as sort of

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.200
 reading out

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.120
 from a

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.360
 pre-established blueprint in the genes

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.560
 and

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.800
 that

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.760
 Led to the idea that there must be genes

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.800
 causing aging and death and

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.560
 Rethinking that whole

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.920
 developmental scheme is necessary and

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.760
 if you see

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.120
 development as epigenetic or open to

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.720
 interaction with environment then aging obviously is another

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.360
 epigenetic

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.360
 environmentally dependent process

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.440
 Okay. Well what I'm most

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.440
 most happy with and constantly amazed is your

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.840
 interpretation of a lot of previously held scientific facts for one of the better word that

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.800
 Both I was taught when I was doing my degree and the science that we had was the same

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.640
 medical science that doctors get and still flawed with all of the same mistakes and

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.560
 What I really appreciate is you bringing out?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.760
 some very

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.960
 Some very different perspectives on it, which I think is very important and a very scientifically based perspectives and ones that are not actually hidden

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.720
 I mean they're there in the articles and the abstracts of

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:55.240
 Published medical journals, but it's very slow to reach the doctors. So in terms of tonight's show and

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.840
 Going over longevity. I think it's a subject that most people would be pretty interested in how to extend their lifespan

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.480
 And I know that there's lots of gene research and a billionaire

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.720
 Investor who's trying to do 40,000

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.000
 Sequences a year and he hopes to get up to a hundred thousand sequences a year. So hopefully trying to find the answer

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.280
 behind aging and go through people's genomes and also their biomes to find out

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.320
 what they're

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.880
 Dealing with and see if there's any link between those people that have

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.560
 degenerative disease and cancers and those people that perhaps don't but why it is that they all die and see if there's any kind of

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:43.360
 Answers that can be found. I'm sure they probably will find some answers to given long enough. So getting on to longevity then

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.360
 I wonder if it's wrong to believe that we can extend our lives beyond

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.440
 120 in this current world and be both healthy and strong and I think what I wanted to ask you first was I read a recent

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.240
 study in a fairly

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.020
 popular publication about long life and health in general

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.460
 Excuse me published by the University of Wisconsin. There's actually published in the online journal e life

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.160
 they were mentioning a

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:16.080
 Trial that was done with a strain of E. Coli and they subjected this E. Coli

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.760
 bacteria to a normally lethal dose of radiation that would normally kill a person and they took

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.440
 Whatever few surviving colonies of E. Coli that they were

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:32.500
 Reproduce them and doubled the dose and then took the survivors from them and doubled the dose until they got

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.800
 20 generations down the line a

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:43.640
 colony of E. Coli that were able to withstand a thousand times the lethal radiation dose that would kill a human and

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:51.960
 We're looking at the mechanisms behind this to see what these gene mutations had done to them to enable them to resist the effects

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:59.520
 So they were talking about the ability to repair DNA as a primary objective in facilitating longevity

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.520
 what do you what do you think about the

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.720
 protection of DNA in our body as a method of

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.640
 sustaining longer life

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:15.400
 I think there is a parallel between what the bacteria are doing and what happens to

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.320
 humans exposed to stresses like radiation, but

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.680
 the single-celled organisms are

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.020
 essentially different in how they respond to stress because

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.040
 20 generations of

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.060
 bacteria would be just a few days and so they

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.920
 couldn't possibly be

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.480
 evolving new

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.200
 DNA sequences to make new

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.800
 functional proteins in such a short time the radiation

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.240
 Degrades protein so it it tends to simply knock out

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.320
 functions

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.760
 when it's damaging the DNA and the bacteria that died had their

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.480
 DNA so damaged they lost

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.200
 function and the ones that survived

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.320
 simply didn't lose the function, but they

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:22.840
 Their defense processes were activated and so what they were getting with each generation was

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.520
 an intensification of the defense reactions that ordinary bacteria have and

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.240
 Things like bacteria yeasts and

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.760
 protozoa

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.920
 When they're under stress they can either decide to reproduce faster

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.040
 Live more intensely and and divide more quickly

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.600
 if their genes are still working or they can

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.360
 go in the direction of sort of dehydration and

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.240
 for radiation

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.680
 forming a spore and

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.040
 eliminating a lot of water right makes the

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.600
 DNA very resistant to radiation because water is part of the

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.440
 hydroxyl

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.000
 Radical is what destroys the DNA and so without any water

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.920
 Tied to the DNA. It's very resistant. That's why spores can live for so long and in the desert or yeah

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.760
 and so

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.760
 If if humans tried to do that the cells under stress would either multiply

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.120
 Very rapidly and that would be a cancer or or they would

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.760
 Go into something worse than hibernation and in which they simply dried up and

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.600
 were like a

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.720
 suspended money's like

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.880
 Existence. Okay, so it just doesn't work for humans on it. Yeah, the same idea is that

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.120
 We have

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.960
 ways of handling damaged genes or threats to the genes and

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.160
 what people do or animals is to

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.400
 kill the whole cell when

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.000
 the

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.480
 When the organism senses that the DNA has been damaged beyond the capacity to

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.680
 Repair it

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.600
 So it's happening very fast. The cells will turn over quickly, but

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.960
 to not form a cancer they have to

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.880
 Let the damaged ones

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.840
 sort of a triage

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.080
 beyond a certain

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.480
 Degree of damage they have to let the cell die and the quicker it can die

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.680
 the

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.680
 More material is available for stimulating stem cells to replace it

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.800
 so the

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.840
 I think a major

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:08.160
 factor in aging is that things interfere with that whole process of

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.960
 either repairing or

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.680
 letting the cells die quickly to be replaced and

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.040
 in old age

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.040
 the process of cell death is

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.120
 retarded

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.000
 Interestingly, yeah

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.720
 Cells become old they can't decide

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.920
 What to do and so they slow down the whole organism

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.800
 Metabolically slows down and in that slowing down process

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.120
 They have some

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.680
 Undesirable products like

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.760
 Lactic acid that cause problems for the whole organism and instead of just dying and getting it over with

00:13:52.760 --> 00:14:00.640
 So you're saying that the process of apoptosis or that cell program death is actually slowed down in normal human aging

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.880
 Yeah

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.520
 Okay, I think people are now

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.640
 looking for

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.680
 What what the factors are that retard that?

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.840
 quick replacement quick apoptosis and

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.440
 Activation of stem cells interesting. All right, we're getting getting on to energy

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.120
 I know that you're very interested in

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.760
 energy promoting substances and thyroid and progesterone

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.080
 Aspirin etc being amongst some of those

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.300
 definite energy promoting substances well

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.040
 There's a compound called

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.600
 NAD

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.280
 NAD+ and

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.280
 another form NADH

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.680
 which is very important in terms of

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.920
 intracellular

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.920
 extracellular energy

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.800
 conveyance and powering reactions, so

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.800
 the article that was

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.080
 using the E.coli forms and resisting

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:05.120
 And providing a strain of E.coli was super resistant to radiation was also mentioning that

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.080
 This compound NAD+ was another

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:16.080
 target therapy and they'd actually produced a a form a patent obviously a

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.920
 patented form of this product that they were trying to sell and

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.800
 I think that's also part of this evening show is to try and highlight some of the

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:31.120
 Some of the mistakes that we commonly are bombarded with in terms of being told it is the truth and will bring out a couple

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.120
 of these and you'll specifically

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:39.080
 identify the mistakes that the authors of the publication or the promoters of the product were

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.760
 guilty of

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.760
 perpetrating if you like but

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:51.040
 NAD+ then as a compound how and how important do you see NAD+ and therefore this company's

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.800
 new

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.880
 product

00:15:53.880 --> 00:16:00.960
 To be taken as a supplement to raise NAD+ how important that would be in our biological systems

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.440
 Our cells are

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.360
 constantly in a process of oxidizing

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.720
 and things like sugar the

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.240
 electrons go to

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.960
 the oxidizing NAD+ and

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.960
 Reduce it so that it becomes NADH and

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.800
 NADH can then pass those electrons on

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.400
 eventually to oxygen so there's a streaming through

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.920
 NAD+ and NADH to the mitochondria and oxygen and

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.320
 That's

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.320
 in the normal

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.760
 metabolism you should have

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.440
 three to five hundred times times as much NAD+ as

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.480
 NADH

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.720
 because it's in a rapidly oxidizing state and

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.840
 Stresses that interfere with

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.560
 Oxygen or that

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.440
 subtract the

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.440
 NAD+ and NADH

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:17.600
 The lower the supply of the total NAD and NADH is the more easily a stress

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.160
 Causes a

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.520
 failure

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.840
 Of the the balance so it shifts more easily

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.960
 Through a very reduced NADH dominant

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.320
 Okay, and so stress depletes NAD+

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:41.600
 Well it depletes both of them one of the things that depletes both of them is

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.960
 Damage to the DNA such as radiation

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.040
 and in repairing the

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.760
 DNA breaks

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.280
 there are enzymes that

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.080
 build up a chain of

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.480
 repetitive bases

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.320
 So it's a meaningless chain, but it

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.720
 plugs up the hole basically in the DNA and to do that to to

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.960
 repair the chain the

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.880
 ADP is

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880
 attached

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.400
 ADP comes from the supply of NAD

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:29.560
 NADH and so when you get a nick in the DNA you have this huge amount of

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:35.480
 NAD+ NADH available and you you draw it down to

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.880
 Repair the damage if you draw it down in repairing too many

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.440
 broken DNAs

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.080
 then that

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.920
 Interferes with the energy production of the cell okay, and

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.600
 If you

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:59.160
 Have ways to block those enzymes and stop the DNA repair then the cell

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.720
 Can make the decision to die and right up wasting and right?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:10.840
 It becomes raw materials for the stem cells yeah

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.080
 Is there anything that you know of that would more?

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:20.760
 Preempt that destructive apoptotic phase rather than wasting energy trying to repair

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:28.360
 Damage chromosome damage yeah, there are several drugs that will block that enzyme

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.920
 It's it's initials are PARP the AARP and so PARP inhibiting

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.760
 enzymes

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.360
 can

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.480
 save

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.480
 cells from dying unnecessarily

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.400
 It can

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.400
 Put if you inhibit that process you can give the cell a chance to rest or you can

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.880
 Inhibit it and let it go ahead and die

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:59.560
 Interesting okay pop

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:05.040
 Night now some amide it happens to be a very safe

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.320
 Way to inhibit that that enzyme

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.520
 At the same time is is the

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.800
 precursor for making nad plus nad H

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.360
 so you're

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.080
 Plugging the drain and filling up the pool at the same time when you

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:33.160
 Have a good source of niacin amide and we can normally make that from proteins the tryptophan

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.200
 Converting it to the niacin

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.080
 but if we're deficient in protein and

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:47.480
 or have something blocking like a vitamin deficiency that blocks the conversion of

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.120
 tryptophan to niacin

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.640
 Then we can't keep the nad supply

00:20:53.640 --> 00:21:00.960
 Adequate would put this deficiency be pretty easily recognized. I mean it would be a typically known condition

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:07.040
 The the chronic extreme state of was known as

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.160
 Allegra

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.160
 it occasionally turns up with a

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:15.240
 rough skin condition when a person reaches a

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.680
 great deficiency, but there are earlier signs such as mood

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.560
 disturbances and

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.720
 Various energy related and

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.520
 Many many

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.560
 variations on symptoms

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:41.440
 Okay, let me just okay, so you're listening to ask your doctor on KMED Gabavel 91.1 FM from 730 till 8 o'clock the end

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.240
 Of the show you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of longevity

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.920
 Dr. Raymond Pete is joining us live

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.720
 And so dr. Pete does carry on the subject of longevity

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.440
 It an article also bought out the compounds called sir Tuins

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.120
 sir one and sir three and

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.560
 They were also posited you know nothing is a contradiction of that the article mentioned

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:13.960
 But they're posited as another factor to improve longevity and that nad plus was a cofactor in their production

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.560
 What was your opinion of calorie restriction as a way of?

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.200
 Activating the sir Tuins, but not necessarily the surgeons are not necessarily positive are they they're more for

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.460
 hibernation or yeah in calorie restriction

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:36.280
 the organism has to do something to survive and so it starts shutting down turning off the genes and

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.240
 the initials stand for

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.880
 silent information

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.680
 regulators

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.280
 the

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.680
 silent information yes, I are and in yeast

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:57.200
 Starvation or stress will turn those on and and turn off genes and

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.800
 in

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.480
 Animal cells they do the same thing, but what how they got?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.880
 to be so

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.520
 Interesting is that a group at Harvard?

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.280
 was arguing that I

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.320
 longevity in yeast

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:24.420
 Corresponded to long life in humans, but in single-celled organisms what they were saying was

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.820
 rapid and continued cell division

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:34.640
 the equivalent would be cancer in a dry long life and from

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.760
 from the

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.080
 ability to

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.560
 stimulate

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.980
 rapid and prolonged cell division in yeast

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.440
 They argued that

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.220
 rest veritrol which is

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.920
 related chemically very closely to

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.280
 TES diethyl still best draw a simple

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.320
 synthetic estrogen

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.560
 Respiratory was a natural

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.360
 still bean

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.080
 type substance

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.080
 found in grapes

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.600
 it does have estrogenic activity and

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.600
 Yeasts are especially sensitive the yeast produce

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.840
 estradiol just like humans and

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.080
 so so yeast is being

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.320
 Given them basically an overdose of estrogen so it's more fertile

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.240
 but in in humans that same sort of overdose isn't

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.880
 desirable yeah

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.000
 In the process of turning off genes

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.400
 The when you do it in a human you are moving towards the

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.400
 Spore like or hibernating state of not producing

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.040
 proteins and

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.600
 two of the

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.160
 very important proteins that get turned off by the sirtuins

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.160
 include

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.420
 Clotho the the phosphate regulating

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:11.920
 Protein that when it's turned off you get very rapid aging

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.320
 degeneration of all of the tissues and

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.400
 another

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.400
 protein or enzyme a

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.520
 p53 protein is

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.640
 Tumor suppressor protein and so

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:37.800
 So you don't want to just shut down and turn your anti-tumor proteins

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:43.760
 Alright

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.800
 Okay, but getting getting on to

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.240
 This kind of the article again

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:56.560
 We're saying that the age-related decrease in nad+ causes defects in energy and gene related functions to accumulate and do you think age?

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:05.000
 Related mitochondria dysfunction can be reversed or merely protected for longer in the lifespan thereby gaining more time

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 down the road

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.880
 Yeah

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.840
 in several years ago the Harvard group

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.200
 Someone in that group said that we shouldn't

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.680
 supplement niacin

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.080
 niacinamide

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.600
 because

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.920
 it

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.920
 suppresses sirtuins

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.700
 And they said the sirtuins are the long life proteins

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:37.880
 niacinamide will accelerate aging but someone simply put human cells in the dish and gave them

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.680
 supplement of niacinamide and

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.080
 They lived 60% longer

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.320
 So

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.680
 there are various treatments that can do the same thing vitamin E for example and

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.720
 adjusting amino acid balance and fats and so on but

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.920
 simply

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.240
 the

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.800
 Adequate or enriched supply of niacinamide is enough to greatly

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.600
 Extend the growth ability of human cells

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.240
 Okay, well we do have a couple of callers here

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.040
 We're coming already coming in so let's take them a little bit early, but let's take the first caller caller. You're on the air

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:24.400
 Hi, hi, I'm where are you from caller? Oh? I'm calling from New Jersey, New Jersey, okay?

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.000
 Hi

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.160
 Once again, there's too many questions. I want to ask but I'll ask the question I originally called with I

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.960
 understand the importance

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.880
 you've talked about it others do talk about it of

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:46.680
 Consuming high quality proteins if we want to you know maintain our systems and renew them

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:55.360
 The it seems to be good for just about every body system, but there is one exception and that's the kidneys and

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:03.520
 You said and I'm going to stress from your jet. I'm going to quote pardon me for your gelatin stress and longevity article

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.040
 Since glycine is non-toxic if the kidneys are working

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.080
 Since any amino acid will contribute to the production of ammonia

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.680
 this kind of chemotherapy can be pleasant and

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:22.440
 I mean, but I recommend the article because the article as a whole is is wonderful

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.560
 I hope you don't mind me taking this little piece out

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.840
 But you're the first person that I've that I've you know read who has actually said you know that

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.280
 any amount of amino acid will stress the kidneys and

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.720
 so I guess what I'm wondering is is there a simple and

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:48.160
 Hopefully sort of more or less immediate way that we can judge that we are getting enough

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.000
 amino acids

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.320
 In a day to achieve nitrogen balance or you know everything that we sort of need to accomplish for our bodies

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:03.960
 But not so much that it's stressing the kidneys or some happy medium perhaps using a reliable

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.360
 urine dipstick

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 Test or is there anything like that?

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.760
 normal functioning kidneys

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:19.920
 aren't stressed by a high protein diet, but when something is impairing kidney function such as

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.880
 hypothyroidism or

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.840
 other sickness

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.120
 then

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.240
 with low kidney function and

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.440
 a lot of bacteria

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.920
 In your intestine breaking down amino acids you can get

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.400
 Accumulated ammonia and that's where

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:48.320
 RLV and NIH I think it was researcher

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.080
 proposed

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.080
 using ketone

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.200
 keto acids

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.880
 equivalent to the essential amino acids which will

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.880
 absorb

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.600
 the ammonia

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.080
 Even when a person has no functioning kidney ability to secrete ammonia

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.520
 so just by feeding keto acids

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.320
 if they're the equivalent of the

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:23.160
 Essential amino acids you create them in your body by absorbing the ammonia and then making your own protein and

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.160
 that was where I got the

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.280
 the idea that some foods

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.680
 would contain

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.000
 natural keto acid equivalent and

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.880
 we did

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:42.800
 Chromatography on potato juice and found that they are rich in the keto acids which

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.960
 Will function as amino acids

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:52.920
 Even though they contain no ammonia because they can absorb ammonia from your blood

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.920
 So

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:02.920
 The kidneys will not be as stressed

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:10.400
 That was for use in people who were having essentially no kidney function and

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.440
 it

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.440
 Avicii's research showed that

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.600
 these

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.640
 ketones or keto acids

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.880
 Are very helpful for failing kidneys

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.480
 but

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.920
 Ordinarily there are many other things you need to do when you have kidney disease

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.160
 you want to correct the

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:40.720
 all of the hormones that are involved in the regulating kidney physiology, especially

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.160
 thyroid

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.160
 progesterone estrogen cortisol

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.560
 And some of the pituitary stress related hormones

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.120
 And

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.000
 I understand that of course, this is a process and

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.640
 You know, I mean, it's not something that I can just you know, take a pill and everything's going to go come, right?

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:06.560
 And and it would be very important again to keep eating the raw carrot daily. Am I correct? I

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:11.280
 Didn't

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.800
 Sorry, I mean I understand that it's this is a process and that it would be very important to continue to eat the raw carrot

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.880
 Daily, oh my correct to keep the ammonia down. Yeah, that does help with the

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.040
 bacterial

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.040
 ammonia production

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:35.360
 Okay, and how often do you think it would be wise to I mean my kidneys I'm not on dialysis

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.360
 My kidneys are not failing to that degree

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.680
 But they are sore upon if I you know, press lightly or medium pressure

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:48.160
 I can feel them and certain practitioners have told me that my kidneys are not strong

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:54.800
 So, I mean would you recommend if you know that that I well that someone do

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.800
 potato

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.740
 This you said you use a centripetal juicer. Am I right?

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.680
 Yeah a few people who had

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.000
 Ammonia coming out of their breast every time they ate

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.660
 Just about any any food containing protein

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.280
 just a couple of meals of potato juice and

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.440
 They were they started assimilating proteins

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:26.140
 But in Beatrice research, he put him on a chronic diet of a keto acid supplement

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:34.040
 Thank you so much, thank you, thank you, I'm going to look into it further into that I appreciate it. Okay. Thanks for your call caller

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.040
 Okay, we've got a steady stream of callers building up here. So let's take the next one and

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.840
 Move through them one at a time. You're on the air caller

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.840
 Hi, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:52.920
 I'm Chris from in Colorado Springs and I have two questions for dr. Pete one's on topic. The other one's completely off topic

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.680
 First though I wanted to say that

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.440
 To you Andrew that I and a lot of the listeners do miss Sarah and hope she returned

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.200
 But I just want to say you've been doing a great job doing the show by yourself. So keep up the good work. Okay

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.880
 Dr. P in terms of longevity in reading your articles

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.580
 I mean one gets the idea of the importance of the saturated fats and the avoidance of the answer unsaturated fats

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.520
 however in terms of proper oxidative energy and the importance that

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.740
 sugars like sucrose lactose play into that

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:28.700
 How important is it to maybe keep the fats on the low side and focus more on the sugars?

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.700
 or is there still a minimum of

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.960
 Fat and saturated fat that's important in terms of longevity

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:41.240
 um a certain small amount of fat helps to stimulate the intestine and

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:48.520
 activate absorption of the oily vitamins vitamin K D a and e and

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.760
 The

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.160
 about 30 or 40 years ago, I was looking at the

00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:02.800
 association of various fats with the cancer spontaneous cancer incidence and

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.440
 I saw that coconut oil had the lowest of the natural oils, but

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.520
 someone found that

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:18.520
 Hydrogenated coconut oil containing zero polyunsaturated or essential fatty acids had the lowest

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:23.240
 incidence of spontaneous cancer of all essentially like a

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.360
 completely fat-free diet and

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.720
 so the fact that

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:38.480
 the even two or three percent of polyunsaturated fats in butter and coconut oil the fact that that

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.360
 accumulates because our muscles for example

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.560
 quickly oxidize the saturated fats and

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.840
 preferentially we store the

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:57.600
 more water-soluble polyunsaturated fats and and so over time even eating a

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.240
 moderate amount of butter and coconut oil

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.360
 Our tissues will become increasingly

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.240
 saturated with the polyunsaturated and the fat cells

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.840
 which store a little droplets of

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.520
 fat

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.520
 They for their own energy

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:23.080
 Prefer like the muscles they prefer to oxidize the safe saturated fats

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.880
 so our fat

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.680
 tissues with age become

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.800
 more and more concentrated with a

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.720
 relatively pure

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.880
 polyunsaturated

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.880
 store of fat and

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.240
 under stress

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.160
 Fat is released and especially the

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:49.280
 Polyunsaturated which is a more accessible to the stress activation

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.840
 so with age

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.360
 stress becomes a

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.520
 more harmful

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.760
 because you've stored up more of the polyunsaturated fat so

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.440
 since we can make all of the

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.200
 Saturated fats

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.640
 Palmitate

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.560
 stearate and we can

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.800
 desaturate

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.840
 stearic acid to make oleic acid and our own series of polyunsaturates

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.720
 I think it's best to

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.040
 get as much

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.000
 sugar and starch in your diet preferably

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.080
 sugars from fruit and milk and

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.200
 minimize the exposure to the unstable

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:41.640
 N-6 and N-3 fatty acids

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.160
 Okay, yeah that makes sense

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.240
 It's more of trying to displace some of the fat with more of the good sugars like you mentioned orange juice and

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.520
 And then the lactose and milk if you are going to get a little bit of fat probably focus on the saturated

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:58.000
 But it sounds like sugars are probably more important

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.600
 So you're probably more of not a really a proponent just because you like saturated fats

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:08.360
 you're probably still not a proponent of a high fat diet and say because you're more of sugars and importance of keeping the metabolism high and

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.040
 all that

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.160
 If I could ask you just a really quick question, I know Andrew

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.640
 We got other people on there so just the one that's off topic

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.920
 And I'm just really curious about my girlfriend's been dealing with this now for

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.100
 Quite a few months almost a year now, Dr. P

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.800
 I was wondering if you had any ideas on what the cause is for

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.260
 People that grind their teeth at night throughout the night without really even noticing

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.040
 She has no idea she's doing it, but then she wakes up and you know

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.520
 She has her jaw sore and the dentist told her that she's grinding down her teeth

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.680
 And I was wondering if you know what the possible cause is and maybe any quick solutions

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.960
 I mean obviously focusing on the thyroid in the long term, but just maybe something in the short term that might help

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.400
 There are several publications

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:54.240
 showing that high serotonin is probably

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.800
 the major

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.080
 thing in in tooth grinding and

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:05.200
 Probably also in restless leg syndrome where the legs churn during the night

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:14.100
 So to lower high serotonin what would be the what would be the most straightforward way of lowering serotonin in someone

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.640
 Reducing intestinal inflammation is the quickest way

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:27.580
 Low thyroid is probably a factor in high high serotonin, but

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.120
 simply

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.600
 avoiding

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.920
 slowly digested foods like

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.680
 resistant starches or

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.400
 Undercooked vegetables salads are very bad for

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:48.680
 Irritating the intestine and and producing so cascara would be pretty beneficial for improving bowel motility and

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.440
 excretion

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.280
 Yeah, and some of these so-called soluble fibers

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.280
 even pectin for example fruit

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.280
 Can greatly increase the production of serotonin and disturb the sleep?

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.400
 Okay, good. All right. Well. We do have several more quarters on the air, so let's take the next one

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.600
 Hi, you're on the air. Where are you from? Yes, my name is Graham. I'm from Los Angeles

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.440
 I

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:19.240
 My wife has chronic fatigue, and I'm wondering whether dr.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:26.200
 Pete has any insights or thoughts on how to deal with chronic fatigue and in particular mitochondrial dysfunction

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.640
 Dr. Pete oh

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.960
 Yeah, yeah

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.880
 basically the same

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.400
 stress syndrome low thyroid excess production of

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.680
 lactic acid and

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.640
 all of the

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.120
 stress

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.120
 mediators

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.120
 The

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.160
 Serotonin and histamine are usually high with prolactin

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.920
 shows up

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.480
 generally

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.120
 very closely associated with chronic fatigue

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:07.440
 And the prolactin rises generally with when your thyroid goes down and serotonin goes up

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.960
 Okay

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.960
 So what would be your

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:17.400
 You know suggestion in terms of let's say just sort of a dietary approach then

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.560
 Things that are quickly digested and

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.920
 raw carrot is

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.040
 contains anti-inflammatory

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.000
 chemicals as well as some

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.800
 antibiotics and

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.920
 They suppress

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:42.000
 Irritating bacteria as well as binding some of the toxins and so they have an anti-inflammatory

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.520
 effect that can

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.760
 Seriously adjust your hormones in a good direction just having a raw carrot every day

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.760
 Doctor

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:58.440
 My wife has been a keen listener of a lot of your programs, and she has been trying the raw carrot

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.240
 She finds that very hard to digest

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:04.080
 and

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.280
 Basically consume

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:10.600
 Good point

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:19.800
 Doctor go ahead. Yeah, the point of eating the carrot is that they can't be digested

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.240
 so they release some of the

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.000
 antiseptic chemicals

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.480
 but

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.040
 help to stimulate the intestine and carry out material because

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.960
 They they don't break down and produce

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.080
 bacterial growth

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:45.200
 The way other starchy vegetables do so you can think of the raw carrot material grated raw carrot as a kind of bottle brush

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.820
 Effectively, I think within the the loom of the gun. Yeah, and if you shred them with a fine

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.160
 Food processor so that they're almost like hair

00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:01.200
 Yeah, that's the most effective kind of fiber because you get a lot of surface right surface area

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.200
 and irritant

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.720
 Okay, and doctor one final question

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:13.680
 Metabolic syndrome. I've been having trouble with that. What would you suggest from a dietary position there? What syndrome?

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.320
 Metabolic syndrome I find it hard to remove

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.440
 fat with this diet exercise or proper dietary

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:25.640
 approaches to get the fat off my belly and

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:28.560
 the

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.480
 Polyunsaturated fats are probably what set up that

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.600
 inability to

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.320
 Oxidize sugar

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.040
 efficiently and

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.040
 it keeps the

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.720
 free fatty acids in circulation and

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.760
 free fatty acids

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.640
 block your metabolism in general

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.720
 so you can break the cycle in in various ways, but

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.400
 probably a

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.880
 active

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.880
 form of thyroid containing

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.880
 t3

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:12.160
 Is the basic way to get the metabolism going so that you can oxidize?

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.000
 glucose and

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.240
 Turn off the free fatty acids any suggestions is one on there that I could consider

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:29.280
 The important thing is to keep track of your

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:34.560
 Metabolic rate how many calories you need?

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.280
 How much water you're able to evaporate?

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.560
 both high-rate people

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:47.240
 Find that a lot of the water they they drink comes back as urine or

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.680
 You should be able to evaporate a couple of quarts of water a day that

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:58.600
 means that if you drink three quarts you get one quart of urine back per day and

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.280
 other indicators of metabolic rate are

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.600
 heart rate at rest and

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.520
 temperature cycle

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.560
 temperature should rise to

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.680
 around

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:17.760
 98.6 right after breakfast and stay there until close to sunset

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:26.960
 Thank you doctor very much appreciate it. Okay. Thank you for your call caller. Okay, so the number if you live in the area is 93

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.760
 who

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.880
 three nine one one two and if you're outside the area that

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:37.560
 800 numbers 1 800 KM ud rad so we've got dr. Raymond Pete

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.960
 Sharing his wisdom here and the subject for this evening's longevity

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:47.880
 Okay, so dr. Pete. I wanted to carry on asking you some more questions about the B vitamins. I know that

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.840
 They're intrinsically involved in energy generation and its transfer

00:45:51.840 --> 00:46:00.440
 What what would you suggest as the a good strategy to ensure adequate levels of B vitamins?

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.280
 um a

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:07.600
 Good diet that includes liver once in a while

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.320
 milk regularly and or cheese

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.480
 eggs regularly

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.360
 seafood or meat

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.040
 fairly regularly

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.440
 At least once a week for some kind of seafood is good

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:30.840
 For the trace minerals that might not get in in some of the land foods given that it's water-soluble. Do you think?

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:38.880
 How realistic do you think it is for people actually to be low in B vitamins B vitamins that may otherwise make a difference?

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.360
 Because I know you've mentioned

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:45.160
 B1 and B3 is being something that has been intrinsically important in people's memory

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:51.320
 their retention of information and how quickly it can make a difference just by supplementing with it and if they're supplementing the

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.760
 premium

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:59.200
 Previous I presume that they were low in it and so taking a supplement raised the B by that B levels

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.040
 they're one in the three and

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.960
 corrected their

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.960
 Their mental mental state I think

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:10.320
 B vitamins act very quickly so you can usually see an effect

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:16.080
 Sometimes it's like with vitamin B1 you can often feel an effect in the first hour

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.680
 with vitamin B6 you generally feel an effect in the first day and

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.400
 with vitamin B6 sometimes

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.160
 10 milligrams is all it needs and

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:34.480
 One dose will often take care of a problem that has lingered for a long time

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.160
 and

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.160
 It's it's good if you can

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.600
 use a few doses of the supplements because

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.280
 most of the supplements have impurities and

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:54.320
 Excipients that aren't good in the long run right I know you're a proponent of very modest doses, too

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.800
 So what would you because I know a lot of companies sell B vitamins in these 500 milligrams, or you know?

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.120
 ridiculous amounts especially of B6 or

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:05.880
 B3 what would you recommend?

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:12.160
 If a person has diabetes or cancer or something and has very high lactic acid production

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.560
 300 milligrams in

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.400
 divided doses

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:25.520
 can help to normalize sugar metabolism and and lactic acid but ordinarily

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:31.200
 10 or 20 milligrams plenty. Is this B3 we're talking about now?

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:35.400
 No, that was a vitamin B1 and B3

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.840
 for

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.280
 major problems including diabetes

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.560
 probably arthritis a lot of

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:52.080
 degenerative problems taking 50 or 100 milligrams several times a day of

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.960
 niacinamide

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.920
 can

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.000
 control the symptoms reduce inflammation

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.240
 Protect the nerves and

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:10.920
 Accelerate glucose oxidation and so on and I should mention that

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.680
 the

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.080
 for some reason I think doctors liked

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:23.160
 Nicotinic acid because it had such visible effects of making you turn red

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.440
 but

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.000
 people

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.400
 generally don't like the feeling of flushing and it isn't good for your health because it it releases

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.520
 serotonin histamine and

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:43.280
 toxic prostaglandins, so it's actually causing damage when it flushes you and

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.720
 In recent years

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.920
 The market has been flooded with something they call no flush

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.160
 Niacin, but if you look at the label

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.800
 You'll see that it's

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.600
 inositol

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.840
 hexa

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.040
 nicotinate

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.160
 and that means that each molecule has six nicotinic acids and

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.040
 It's a little slower to release

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:15.520
 That's why it doesn't cause the sudden intense flushing, but it's the same

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.280
 substance that's releasing

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.960
 those

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.720
 inflammatory toxic

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:26.680
 Substances so it has to be either niacin amide

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.480
 or the new

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.960
 Niacin amide or nicotinamide

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.120
 Riboside

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:41.600
 Just a variation on niacin amide and it's a lot more expensive, but

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.800
 If you have an allergic reaction to one you can try the other

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.040
 All right, I very quickly want to just ask you to

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 remind listeners

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.160
 The dose and you mentioned specifically for cancers even

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.400
 B1 of two to three hundred milligrams in divided doses

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:09.820
 Yeah, it's safe. Yeah, take as much as 300 milligrams and again. What would the benefits of that be?

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.200
 lowering

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.200
 lactic acid lowering lactic acid

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.240
 stimulating the

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:20.880
 oxidation of it and so you produce more carbon dioxide and

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.840
 less

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:27.080
 Lactic acid right that that shifts away from inflammation

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.120
 Lactic acid is keeping the cancer

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.720
 developing by creating inflammation and

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:42.800
 Disturbing the pH balance good okay? Well, we do have a couple more callers, so um we should probably take this next caller and

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.080
 See we say where it's takes us so caller. You're on the air

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.960
 Hi, you're on the air and where you from

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:57.120
 Hi, I'm from Laytonville. Hi. What's your question caller? I have two questions you mentioned the body temp

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.980
 I've always had a low body temp like

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:04.720
 97.4

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.560
 That's normal or no

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.160
 So what are some things like hot food ginger?

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:18.360
 What are some things and well no not particularly because they just cause peripheral vasodilation

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.840
 Which might give you a feeling of warmth, but might actually cool you down even but

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.920
 Dr.. Pete when he mentions

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.840
 Temperature and pulses as a measure or a good gauge for assessing thyroid function

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.400
 That you should reach

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.100
 98.6 during the daytime and preferably after breakfast in the morning

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:39.760
 And you should stay at that kind of temperature pretty much all through the day until the evening

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:44.880
 If you have consistently low body temperatures that do not seem to rise

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:51.880
 After food and that would be fairly suggestive of metabolic deficiency in particularly that you'd benefit from using thyroid hormone

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:59.680
 And a protein deficiency is a possible cause of low body temperature. I've seen

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.840
 people who

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.280
 couldn't respond to thyroid or other

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:08.440
 metabolic activators and

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:14.520
 It turned out they were eating something like 20 grams of protein a day for the requirement is

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.760
 closer to 80

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:22.920
 That makes sense. I have a blood type. I like high

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.280
 cortisol

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.760
 Active I need protein that makes them

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:36.120
 My other question is what are your thoughts on chelation like the heavy metal cleanse?

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:40.120
 Um good foods will

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.280
 safely

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.280
 activate the process of

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:49.840
 Mobilizing heavy metals from the tissues and passing them out through the kidneys

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.880
 coffee drinkers

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:59.520
 Known to have a lower load of most of the heavy metals such as cadmium and lead

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:07.200
 Do you think that foods a healthy diet would like naturally take care of

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.760
 All of the heavy metals we accumulate

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:18.000
 Yeah, one of the advantages of having orange juice milk in your diet

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.800
 Constantly is that they provide materials that help to

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.520
 inactivate the toxic effect of heavy metals while mobilizing them and

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.400
 Washing them out through the kidneys

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.640
 Yeah, thank you for your call dr. P. I've got to ask a personal question

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:46.120
 I think maybe perhaps a lot of people might like to hear your your thoughts on this because they're always very different

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:50.920
 And I'm always very very happy to hear what you say because it's always so illuminating

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:56.120
 Ebola virus is becoming a very careful watch word right now

00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:03.440
 My son, I'm not being flippant at all, but what would you do? What are your thoughts and your suggestions on?

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:10.480
 Ebola virus and how best to protect yourself from it if the effects of it are

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.160
 basically like flu and many other

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.080
 viral or or even bacterial infections that activate the

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.280
 inflammatory processes and

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:30.800
 Inactivate our immune defenses and if you look at the research

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.720
 the

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.720
 first thing that happens is the

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.680
 inhibition of

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:40.680
 interferon the antiviral

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:44.000
 one of the defenses and

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.840
 activation of nitric oxide production which

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:52.360
 opens up blood vessels makes them leaky and

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:59.200
 lowers energy production and so whether it's flu or Ebola or

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.000
 Poisoning by by chemicals

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.480
 The

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.400
 method of

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.760
 Defending yourself is pretty much the same to lower

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.040
 Anything irritating that you're doing?

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:18.280
 such as eating foods that are hard to digest and

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:22.200
 Doing anything you can to lower

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:29.240
 inflammation and nitric oxide production aspirin and aspirin and coffee and

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.120
 niacinamide are all

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.880
 defenses against

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:42.120
 nitric oxide and I think nitric oxide is central to to all of those when they they get to the point of

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.160
 causing

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.120
 Degenerative bleeding

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:53.120
 Processes what about interferon is anything that you would suggest that would be useful for raising your interferon or protecting or?

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.840
 preventing the block blockage of it or the

00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:04.040
 No, I think that'll take care of itself if you just keep your energy up and hold the inflammatory

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:10.560
 Things such as nitric oxide as low as you can okay, all right good. Well. I had to ask you

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.040
 I thought you'd have some suggestions for it and

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:18.640
 Thank you very much again. Dr.. Pete for joining us on the show and thank you callers for calling in

00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:22.720
 I know it's always very useful when people call in with lots of different questions

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.720
 even if they're not related to the subject and

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:29.760
 Just from where the callers come from the shows how wide an audience that you have dr.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.360
 Pete sir, thanks so much for your time. Okay. Thank you

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:38.600
 Okay for those people who have listened to the show you want any more information outside of the show time

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:44.600
 We can be reached on one eight eight eight WBM herb for consultations or further information

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:49.760
 So dr. Raymond Pete's website. It's got a wealth of articles

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:55.480
 Fully referenced they're not just made-up stories or unsubstantiated claims

00:57:55.480 --> 00:58:00.320
 they're actually very well written and very scientifically based and

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.280
 science is there really to point the way forward and

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.560
 Anybody who does want to hope wants to disbelieve the science perhaps would be a little bit

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:14.560
 little bit rash because science does have a good place and a very important tool for

00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:19.120
 finding out the truth behind the questions that plague us and so

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:24.920
 There's lots of lies out there and the internet unfortunately is one of the wealthiest

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.280
 wealthiest places

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:32.200
 But also has lots of answers too, so it's just sorting out the information and dr.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:34.080
 Pete's always got a very different perspective

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:39.280
 So I'm very happy that he spends the time that he does joining us on the show so his website is

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.920
 www.raypeat.com

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:47.240
 Lots of articles on his website that you can look at

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.600
 And again until the third Friday of next month. Have a good night
