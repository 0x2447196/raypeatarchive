00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
 Organic Grace is on the main street in Garboville and on the web at organicgrace.com.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.040
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.540
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.480
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show which runs every third Friday

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.180
 of the month from 7 to 8 p.m., I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.680
 graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.180
 I run a clinic in Garboville where I consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.080
 and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.880
 And like I said, every third Friday of the month we have a topic that we choose to open

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.800
 up and once again I'm very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat to share his wisdom and his

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.460
 expertise during the show.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.080
 From 7.30 to 8 o'clock at the end of the show, listeners are invited to call in with any

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.340
 questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of longevity.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.720
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.360
 the end of the show at 8 o'clock, as I said, you're invited to call in with any questions.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.840
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.560
 the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.680
 We can also be reached incidentally Monday through Friday on 1-888-WBM-HERB for consultations

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 or further information.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.720
 So once again we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 Dr. Peat?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 Yes, hi.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.880
 Thanks so much for joining us again.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.240
 I know that a lot of your background has been involved with reproductive physiology and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.280
 aging and so as always I would ask you just to introduce yourself and your professional

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.480
 and academic background for people perhaps who've never listened to you.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.480
 Okay.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.400
 I started getting interested in aging I guess in childhood but through the 1950s when I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.800
 would mention it to people, a few of the very old people like a biology professor who studied

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.440
 around the turn of the century had some interesting ideas about the actual cause of aging and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.840
 suggest possibilities for actually preventing it but most people in the 1950s weren't at

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.400
 all interested in the idea of curing aging.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.080
 It just was inconceivable that anything could be done about it but finally when I decided

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 to go to graduate school in biology in 1968 to '72 at the University of Oregon, I intended

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.800
 to study brain biology but it happened that there were some good people working on reproductive

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:34.720
 aging so I did my dissertation on female reproductive aging and helped to answer some questions that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.800
 I had been accumulating for 20 years but it really just opened up a lot of basic biological

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.520
 questions that the whole nature of what an organism is and how it develops through time

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.280
 growing up from an egg to an adult.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.200
 The whole process is something that used to be explained as sort of reading out from a

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.960
 pre-established blueprint in the genes and that led to the idea that there must be genes

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.120
 causing aging and death and rethinking that whole developmental scheme is necessary and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.240
 if you see development as epigenetic or open to interaction with the environment then aging

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.840
 obviously is another epigenetic environmentally dependent process.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.880
 Okay, well what I'm most happy with and constantly amazed is your interpretation of a lot of

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.600
 previously held scientific facts for want of a better word that both I was taught when

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.160
 I was doing my degree and the science that we had was the same medical science that doctors

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.740
 get and still flawed with all of the same mistakes and what I really appreciate is you

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.560
 bringing out some very different perspectives on it which I think is very important and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.320
 a very scientifically based perspectives and ones that are not actually hidden.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.840
 I mean they're there in the articles and the abstracts of published medical journals but

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.160
 it's very slow to reach the doctors.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.840
 So in terms of tonight's show and going over longevity I think it's a subject that most

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.400
 people would be pretty interested in how to extend their lifespan and I know that there's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.600
 lots of gene research and a billionaire investor who's trying to do 40,000 sequences a year

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.800
 and he hopes to get up to a hundred thousand sequences a year so hopefully trying to find

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.800
 the answer behind aging and go through people's genomes and also their biomes to find out

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.240
 what they're dealing with and see if there's any link between those people that have degenerative

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.120
 disease and cancers and those people that perhaps don't but why it is that they all

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.120
 die and see if there's any kind of answers that can be found.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.320
 I'm sure they probably will find some answers to given long enough.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.840
 So getting on to longevity then I wonder if it's wrong to believe that we can extend our

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.520
 lives beyond 120 in this current world and be both healthy and strong and I think what

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.240
 I wanted to ask you first was I read a recent study in a fairly popular publication about

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.480
 long life and health in general, excuse me, published by the University of Wisconsin.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.280
 It was actually published in the online journal eLife.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.400
 They were mentioning a trial that was done with a strain of E. coli and they subjected

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.880
 this E. coli bacteria to a normally lethal dose of radiation that would normally kill

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.800
 a person and they took whatever few surviving colonies of E. coli that they were, reproduced

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.820
 them and doubled the dose and then took the survivors from them and doubled the dose until

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.040
 they got 20 generations down the line a colony of E. coli that were able to withstand a thousand

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.080
 times the lethal radiation dose that would kill a human and we're looking at the mechanisms

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.000
 behind this to see what these gene mutations had done to them to enable them to resist

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 the effects.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.240
 So they were talking about the ability to repair DNA as a primary objective in facilitating

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.240
 longevity.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.600
 What do you think about the protection of DNA in our body as a method of sustaining

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600
 longer life?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.920
 I think there is a parallel between what the bacteria are doing and what happens to

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.920
 humans exposed to stresses like radiation but the single celled organisms are essentially

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:29.280
 different in how they respond to stress because 20 generations of bacteria would be just a

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:38.760
 few days and so they couldn't possibly be evolving new DNA sequences to make new functional

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.320
 proteins in such a short time.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:48.680
 The radiation degrades proteins so it tends to simply knock out functions when it's damaging

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:56.360
 the DNA and the bacteria that died had their DNA so damaged they had lost function and

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:02.640
 the ones that survived simply didn't lose the function but their defense processes were

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:09.880
 activated and so what they were getting with each generation was an intensification of

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:17.040
 the defense reactions that ordinary bacteria have and things like bacteria, yeast and protozoa

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.960
 when they're under stress they can either decide to reproduce faster, live more intensely

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:30.880
 and divide more quickly if their genes are still working or they can go in the direction

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:39.880
 of sort of dehydration and radiation forming a spore and eliminating a lot of water makes

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:48.120
 the DNA very resistant to radiation because water is part of the hydroxyl radical is what

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.000
 destroys the DNA and so without any water tied to the DNA it's very resistant.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.840
 So that's why spores can live for so long in the desert.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:05.280
 And so if humans tried to do that the cells under stress would either multiply very rapidly

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:12.040
 and that would be a cancer or they would go into something worse than hibernation in which

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:19.160
 they simply dried up and were like a suspended mummy-like existence.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.000
 So it just doesn't work for humans.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.960
 The same idea is that we have ways of handling damaged genes or threats to the genes and

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:39.400
 what people do or animals is to kill the whole cell when the organism senses that the DNA

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.560
 has been damaged beyond the capacity to repair it.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:49.920
 So if it's happening very fast the cells will turn over quickly but to not form a cancer

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:57.160
 they have to let the damaged ones sort of a triage beyond a certain degree of damage

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:04.320
 they have to let the cell die and the quicker it can die the more material is available

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.440
 for stimulating stem cells to replace it.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:17.080
 I think a major factor in aging is that things interfere with that whole process of either

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.280
 repairing or letting the cells die quickly to be replaced.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:28.080
 In old age the process of cell death is retarded.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:35.200
 Suddenly the cells become old, they can't decide what to do and so they slow down the

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.880
 whole organism metabolically slows down and in that slowing down process they have some

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:48.280
 undesirable products like lactic acid that cause problems for the whole organism instead

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.320
 of just dying and getting it over with.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.600
 So you're saying that the process of apoptosis or that cell program death is actually slowed

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.440
 down in normal human aging?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:04.680
 Yeah, I think people are now looking for what the factors are that retard that quick replacement,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.160
 quick apoptosis and activation of stem cells.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.160
 Interesting.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.440
 All right, we're getting on to energy.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.920
 I know that you're very interested in energy promoting substances and thyroid and progesterone,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.000
 aspirin etc. being amongst some of those definite energy promoting substances.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.640
 Well there's a compound called NAD, NAD+ and another form NADH which is very important

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:38.640
 in terms of intracellular, extracellular energy conveyance and powering reactions.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:45.560
 So the article that was using the E. coli forms and resisting and providing a strain

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:51.800
 of E. coli that was super resistant to radiation was also mentioning that this compound NAD+

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:58.840
 was another target therapy and they'd actually produced a form, a patent, obviously a patented

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.720
 form of this product that they were trying to sell and I think that's also part of this

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.520
 evening show is to try and highlight some of the mistakes that we commonly are bombarded

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.560
 with in terms of being told it is the truth and we'll bring out a couple of these and

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.080
 you'll specifically identify the mistakes that the authors of the publication or the

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.240
 promoters of the product were guilty of perpetrating if you like.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:29.160
 But NAD+ then as a compound, how important do you see NAD+ and therefore this company's

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.240
 new product to be taken as a supplement to raise NAD+?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.640
 How important that would be in our biological systems?

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:47.840
 Our cells are constantly in a process of oxidizing and things like sugar, the electrons go to

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:56.240
 the oxidizing NAD+ and reduce it so that it becomes NADH and NADH can then pass those

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.680
 electrons on eventually to oxygen.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:07.240
 So there's a streaming through NAD+ and NADH to the mitochondria and oxygen and that in

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:16.040
 the normal metabolism, you should have 300 to 500 times as much NAD+ as NADH because

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:24.360
 it's in a rapidly oxidizing state and stresses that interfere with oxygen or that subtract

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:33.560
 the NAD+ and NADH, the lower the supply of total NAD and NADH is, the more easily a stress

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:42.240
 causes a failure of the balance, so it shifts more easily to a very reduced NADH dominant.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.040
 So stress depletes NAD+?

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.320
 Well, it depletes both of them.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.720
 One of the things that depletes both of them is damage to the DNA such as radiation and

00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:03.240
 in repairing the DNA break, there are enzymes that build up a chain of repetitive bases

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:10.960
 so it's a meaningless chain but it plugs up the hole basically in the DNA and to do that,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.280
 to repair the chain, the ADP is attached.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:24.280
 ADP comes from the supply of NAD and NADH and so when you get a nick in the DNA, you

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:31.720
 have this huge amount of NAD+ and NADH available and you draw it down to repair the damage.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.840
 If you draw it down in repairing too many broken DNAs, then that interferes with the

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.520
 energy production of the cell.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:49.000
 And if you have ways to block those enzymes and stop the DNA repair, then the cell can

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.720
 make the decision to die and stop wasting energy and instead it becomes raw materials

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.440
 for the stem cells.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.840
 Is there anything that you know of that would more preempt that destructive apoptotic phase

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.720
 rather than wasting energy trying to repair damage, chromosome damage?

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.960
 Yeah, there are several drugs that will block that enzyme.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:22.840
 Its initials are PARP, A-R-P and so PARP inhibiting enzymes can save cells from dying unnecessarily.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.480
 If you inhibit that process, you can give the cell a chance to rest or you can inhibit

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.200
 it and let it go ahead and die.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.200
 Interesting.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200
 Okay, PARP.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:40.920
 And niacinamide happens to be a very safe way to inhibit that enzyme.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.940
 At the same time, it is the precursor for making NAD+ and NADH.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:53.320
 So you're plugging the drain and filling up the pool at the same time when you have a

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.960
 good source of niacinamide.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:02.720
 We can normally make that from proteins, the tryptophan converting it to niacin.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:08.960
 But if we're deficient in protein or have something blocking, a vitamin deficiency that

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:16.400
 blocks the conversion of tryptophan to niacin, then we can't keep the NAD supply adequate.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.360
 Would this deficiency be pretty easily recognized?

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.320
 I mean it would be a typically known condition.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.480
 The chronic extreme state was known as halagra.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:35.280
 It occasionally turns up with a rough skin condition when a person reaches a great deficiency.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:42.920
 But there are earlier signs such as mood disturbances and various energy related and many, many

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.320
 variations on symptoms.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.320
 Okay.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.280
 Let me just, okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMED Gabavel, 91.1 FM

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.040
 from 7.30 till 8 o'clock, the end of the show.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.560
 You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560
 subject of longevity.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.200
 Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us live.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.840
 And so Dr. Peat, just to carry on the subject of longevity, an article also brought out

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.680
 the compounds called Sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT3.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.080
 And they were also posited, you know, and I think it's a contradiction that the article

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.460
 mentioned but they're posited as another factor to improve longevity and that NAD+ was a cofactor

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.700
 in their production.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:26.680
 What was your opinion of calorie restriction as a way of activating the Sirtuins but not

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.160
 necessarily the Sirtuins are not necessarily positive, are they?

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.880
 They're more for hibernation or?

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:36.920
 Yeah, in calorie restriction, the organism has to do something to survive and so it starts

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:44.600
 shutting down, turning off the genes and the initial to stand for silent information regulators,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:54.420
 the SIR and in yeast, starvation or stress will turn those on and turn off genes.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:01.640
 And in animal cells, they do the same thing but how they got to be so interesting is that

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:10.500
 a group at Harvard was arguing that longevity in yeast corresponded to long life in humans.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:16.740
 In single-celled organisms, what they were saying was rapid and continued cell division,

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:23.940
 the equivalent would be cancer in a guy that is a long life and from the ability to stimulate

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:32.420
 rapid and prolonged cell division in yeast, they argued that resveratrol which is related

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:41.340
 chemically very closely to DES, diethylstilbestrol, a simple synthetic estrogen, resveratrol is

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:46.140
 a natural still being type substance found in grape.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:51.700
 It does have estrogenic activity and yeasts are especially sensitive.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:59.460
 Yeast produced at estradiol just like humans and so yeast is being given basically an overdose

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:06.660
 of estrogen so it's more fertile and in humans, that same sort of overdose isn't desirable.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:14.140
 In the process of turning off genes, when you do it in a human, you are moving towards

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:21.460
 the oral-like or hibernating state of not producing proteins and two of the very important

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:27.900
 proteins that get turned off by the sirtuins include clatho, the phosphate regulating

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:34.300
 protein that when it's turned off, you get very rapid aging, a degeneration of all of

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:43.500
 the tissues and another protein or enzyme, a p53 protein is a tumor suppressor protein

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.780
 and so you definitely don't want to just blindly turn off proteins in defense.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.940
 So you don't want to just shut down and turn your anti-tumor proteins off.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.140
 Yes and your anti-aging clatho protein.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:03.020
 Right, okay, getting on to this kind of, the article again was saying that the age-related

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:08.100
 decrease in NAD+ causes defects in energy and gene-related functions to accumulate.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.780
 Do you think age-related mitochondrial dysfunction can be reversed or merely protected for longer

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:18.620
 in the lifespan thereby gaining more time down the road?

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:25.020
 Yes, several years ago, the Harvard group, someone in that group said that we shouldn't

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:32.780
 supplement niacin or niacinamide because it suppresses sirtuins and they said that sirtuins

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:38.220
 are the long-life proteins, niacinamide will accelerate aging.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:44.020
 Someone simply put human cells in a dish and gave them a supplement of niacinamide and

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.460
 they live 60% longer.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:52.980
 So there are various treatments that can do the same thing, vitamin E for example, adjusting

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:59.220
 amino acid balance and fats and so on, but simply the adequate or enriched supply of

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.500
 niacinamide is enough to greatly extend the growth ability of human cells.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.020
 Okay, well we do have a couple of callers here already coming in, so let's take them

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.100
 a little bit early, but let's take the first caller.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.100
 Caller, you're on the air?

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.100
 Hi.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.100
 Hi, and where are you from, caller?

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.660
 Oh, I'm calling from New Jersey.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.660
 New Jersey, okay.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.420
 Hi, once again there's too many questions I want to ask, but I'll ask the question I

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.860
 originally called with.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:28.660
 I understand the importance, you've talked about it, others do talk about it, of consuming

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:36.380
 high-quality proteins if we want to maintain our systems and renew them.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.660
 It seems to be good for just about every body system, but there is one exception and that's

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.660
 the kidneys.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.940
 And you said, and I'm going to stress from your, I'm going to quote, pardon me, from

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:51.940
 your gelatin stress and longevity article, since glycine is non-toxic, if the kidneys

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.700
 are working, since any amino acid will contribute to the production of ammonia, this kind of

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.980
 chemotherapy can be pleasant.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.540
 And I mean, I recommend the article because the article as a whole is wonderful and I

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.820
 hope you don't mind me taking this little piece out.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:12.140
 But you're the first person that I've read who has actually said that any amount of amino

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.460
 acid will stress the kidneys.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:20.820
 And so I guess what I'm wondering is, is there a simple and hopefully sort of more or less

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:27.540
 immediate way that we can judge that we are getting enough amino acids in a day to achieve

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.060
 nitrogen balance or everything that we sort of need to accomplish for our bodies, but

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:38.340
 not so much that it's stressing the kidneys or some happy medium, perhaps using a reliable

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:42.940
 urine dipstick test or is there anything like that?

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:49.000
 Normal functioning kidneys aren't stressed by a high-protein diet, but when something

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.860
 is impairing kidney function such as hypothyroidism or other sickness, then with low kidney function

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:06.400
 and a lot of bacteria in your intestine breaking down amino acids, you can get accumulated

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.580
 ammonia.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:18.540
 And that's where RLV and NIH, I think it was researcher, proposed using ketone, ketoacids

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:24.940
 equivalent to the essential amino acids which will absorb the ammonia even when a person

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.180
 has no functioning kidney ability to secrete ammonia.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:36.620
 So just by feeding ketoacids, if they're the equivalent of the essential amino acids, you

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.980
 create them in your body by absorbing the ammonia and then making your own protein.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:49.220
 And that was where I got the idea that some foods would contain a natural ketoacid equivalent

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:56.820
 and we did chromatography on potato juice and found that they are rich in the ketoacids

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:03.740
 which will function as amino acids even though they contain no ammonia because they can absorb

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.740
 ammonia from your blood.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:11.500
 Absorb it from the blood, so the kidneys will not be as stressed?

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:18.220
 That was for use in people who were having essentially no kidney function and Avicha's

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:26.260
 research showed that these ketones or ketoacids are very helpful for failing kidneys.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:33.060
 But ordinarily, there are many other things you need to do when you have kidney disease.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:39.500
 You want to correctly all of the hormones that are involved in regulating kidney physiology,

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:45.660
 especially thyroid, progesterone, estrogen, cortisol, and some of the pituitary stress

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:46.660
 related hormones.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.540
 And I understand that of course this is a process and it's not something that I can

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.500
 just take a pill and everything's going to come right.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.500
 And it would be very important again to keep eating the raw carrot daily, am I correct?

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.140
 I didn't understand the whole...

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.220
 I'm sorry, I mean I understand that this is a process and that it would be very important

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.060
 to continue to eat the raw carrot daily.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.260
 Am I correct to keep the ammonia down?

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:13.620
 Yes, that does help with the bacterial ammonia production.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.620
 Okay.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.220
 And how often do you think it would be wise to...

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.420
 I mean my kidneys, I'm not on dialysis, my kidneys are not failing to that degree, but

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.900
 they are sore upon if I press lightly or medium pressure.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.180
 I can feel them and certain practitioners have told me that my kidneys are not strong.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.060
 So I mean would you recommend that I...

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:37.220
 Well, that someone do potato...

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.900
 You said you use a centrifugal juicer, am I right?

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:46.140
 Yeah, a few people who had ammonia coming out of their breast every time they ate just

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.900
 about any food containing protein.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:55.540
 Just a couple of meals of potato juice and they started assimilating proteins.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:01.060
 But in Vitra's research, he put them on a chronic diet of a keto acid supplement.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.060
 Thank you so much.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.060
 Thank you, thank you.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.060
 I'm going to look further into that.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.060
 I appreciate it.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.060
 Okay, thanks for your call, Carla.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.980
 Okay, we've got a steady stream of callers building up here.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.780
 So let's take the next one and move through them one at a time.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:12.780
 You're on the air, Carla?

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.780
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.780
 Where are you from?

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.460
 I'm Chris from Colorado Springs.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.500
 And I have two questions for Dr. Peat.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.500
 One's on topic, the other one's completely off topic.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.740
 First though, I wanted to say that to you, Andrew, that I and a lot of the listeners

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.220
 do miss Sarah and hope she'll return.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.180
 But I just want to say you've been doing a great job doing the show by yourself.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.740
 So keep up the good work.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:36.660
 Dr. Peat, in terms of longevity in reading your articles, I mean, one gets the idea of

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.500
 the importance of the saturated fats and the avoidance of the unsaturated fats.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.140
 However, in terms of proper oxidative energy and the importance that sugars like sucrose

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.780
 and lactose play into that, how important is it to maybe keep the fats on the low side

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.420
 and focus more on the sugars?

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:56.380
 Or is there still a minimum of fat and saturated fat that's important in terms of longevity?

00:25:56.380 --> 00:26:03.260
 A certain small amount of fat helps to stimulate the intestine and activate absorption of the

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:11.460
 oily vitamins, vitamin K, D, A, and E. And about 30 or 40 years ago, I was looking at

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:17.380
 the association of various fats with the cancer, spontaneous cancer incidence.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.660
 And I saw that coconut oil had the lowest of the natural oils.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:27.940
 But someone found that hydrogenated coconut oil containing zero polyunsaturated or essential

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:34.660
 fatty acids had the lowest incidence of spontaneous cancer of all, essentially like a completely

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.300
 fat-free diet.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:44.980
 And so the fact that even 2% or 3% of polyunsaturated fats in butter and coconut oil, the fact that

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:51.540
 that accumulates because our muscles, for example, quickly oxidize the saturated fats

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:57.900
 and preferentially we store the more water-soluble polyunsaturated fats.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:04.820
 And so over time, even eating a moderate amount of butter and coconut oil, our tissues will

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.140
 become increasingly saturated with the polyunsaturated.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:16.340
 And the fat cells which store little droplets of fat, they, for their own energy, prefer

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.540
 like the muscles, they prefer to oxidize the safe saturated fats.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:29.100
 So our fat tissues with age become more and more concentrated with a relatively pure polyunsaturated

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.580
 store of fat.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:37.140
 And under stress, the fat is released and especially the polyunsaturated which is more

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:40.060
 accessible to the stress activation.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:46.340
 So with age, stress becomes more harmful because you've stored up more of the polyunsaturated

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.340
 fats.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:53.780
 So since we can make all of the saturated fats, palm, palmitate, stearate, and we can

00:27:53.780 --> 00:28:01.100
 desaturate stearic acid to make oleic acid and our own series of polyunsaturates, I think

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:08.660
 it's best to get as much sugar and starch in your diet, preferably sugars from fruit

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:17.140
 and milk, and minimize the exposure to the unstable N-6 and N-3 fatty acids.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.940
 Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.780
 It's more of trying to displace some of the fat with more of the good sugars like you

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.780
 mentioned orange juice and the lactose in milk.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.660
 If you are going to get a little bit of fat, probably focus more on the saturated, but

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.620
 it sounds like sugars are probably more important.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.140
 So you're probably more of not really a proponent just because you like saturated fats, you're

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.180
 probably still not a proponent of a high fat diet and say because you're more of sugars

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.180
 and importance of keeping the metabolism high and all that.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:44.620
 If I could ask you just a really quick question, I know, Andrew, we got other people on this,

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.660
 so just the one that's off topic and I'm just really curious about.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.700
 My girlfriend's been dealing with this now for quite a few months, almost a year now,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.620
 Dr. Peat. And I was wondering if you had any ideas on what the cause is for people that

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.620
 grind their teeth at night, throughout the night without really even noticing.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.420
 She has no idea she's doing it, but then she wakes up and she has her jaw sore and the

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:06.300
 dentist told her that she's grinding down her teeth.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.980
 And I was wondering if you know what the possible cause is and maybe any quick solutions.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.780
 I mean, obviously focusing on the thyroid in the long term, but just maybe something

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.500
 in the short term that might help.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:21.740
 There are several publications showing that high serotonin is probably the major thing

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:28.060
 in tooth grinding and probably also in restless leg syndrome where the legs turn during the

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.060
 night.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:34.340
 And to lower high serotonin, what would be the most straightforward way of lowering serotonin

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.460
 in someone?

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.060
 Reducing intestinal inflammation is the quickest way.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:49.180
 Low thyroid is probably a factor in high serotonin, but simply avoiding slowly digested foods

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.300
 like resistant starches, undercooked vegetables, salads are very bad for irritating the intestine

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.300
 and producing…

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:02.500
 So, cascara would be pretty beneficial for improving bowel motility and excretion?

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:10.340
 Yeah, and some of the so-called soluble fibers, even pectin, for example, fruit, can greatly

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.980
 increase the production of serotonin and disturb the sleep.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.980
 Okay, good.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.700
 All right, well, we do have several more callers on the air, so let's take the next one.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.700
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.700
 Where are you from?

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:20.700
 Yes, my name is Graham.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.020
 I'm from Los Angeles.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:28.260
 My wife has chronic fatigue and I'm wondering whether Dr. Peat has any insights or thoughts

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.820
 on how to deal with chronic fatigue and in particular mitochondrial dysfunction?

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:33.820
 Dr. Peat?

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:41.740
 Oh, yeah, basically the same stress syndrome, low thyroid, excess production of lactic acid

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:50.260
 and all of the stress mediators, the serotonin and histamine are usually high with prolactin

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:58.020
 shows up generally very closely associated with chronic fatigue and prolactin rises generally

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.180
 when your thyroid goes down and serotonin goes up.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.700
 Okay, so what would be your suggestion in terms of let's say just sort of a dietary

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.540
 approach then?

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:14.900
 Things that are quickly digested and raw carrot contains anti-inflammatory chemicals as well

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:22.220
 as some antibiotics and they suppress irritating bacteria as well as binding some of the toxins

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:28.180
 and so they have an anti-inflammatory effect that can seriously adjust your hormones in

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.620
 a good direction just having a raw carrot every day.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.260
 Dr. Peat, my wife has been a keen listener of a lot of your programs and she has been

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:37.260
 trying the raw carrot.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:43.500
 She finds that very hard to digest and basically consume.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.500
 Is there any...

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.300
 The good point is that they are indigestible.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.340
 Dr. Peat, go ahead.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:57.140
 The point of eating the carrot is that they can't be digested and so they release some

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:04.620
 of the antiseptic chemicals but help to stimulate the intestine and carry out material because

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:10.980
 they don't break down and produce bacterial growth the way other starchy vegetables do.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.100
 You can think of the raw carrot material, grated raw carrot as a kind of bottle brush

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.060
 effectively I think within the lumen of the gut.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:24.820
 And if you shred them with a fine food processor so that they're almost like hair, that's the

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:28.260
 most effective kind of fiber because you get a lot of surface.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.260
 Right, surface area.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.260
 And find irritants.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.380
 And doctor, one final question.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.380
 Metabolic syndrome.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.660
 I've been having trouble with that.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.100
 What would you suggest from a dietary position there?

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.100
 What syndrome?

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.100
 Metabolic syndrome.

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:49.420
 I find it hard to remove fat despite exercise or dietary approaches to get the fat off my

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.420
 belly.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:33:01.420
 The polyunsaturated fats are probably what set up that inability to oxidize sugar efficiently

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:09.660
 and it keeps the pre-fatty acids in circulation and pre-fatty acids block your metabolism

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.060
 in general.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:18.540
 So you can break the cycle in various ways but probably an active form of thyroid containing

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:26.620
 T3 is the basic way to get the metabolism going so that you can oxidize glucose and

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.340
 turn off the pre-fatty acids.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.140
 Any suggestions on there that I could consider?

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:41.820
 The important thing is to keep track of your metabolic rate, how many calories you need,

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:45.180
 how much water you're able to evaporate.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:51.900
 Thyroid people find that a lot of the water they drink comes back as urine or you should

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.180
 be able to evaporate a couple of quarts of water a day.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:34:00.220
 That means that if you drink three quarts, you get one quart of urine back per day.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:07.780
 And other indicators of metabolic rate are heart rate at rest and temperature cycle.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:14.300
 Temperature should rise to around 98.6 right after breakfast and stay there until close

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.300
 to sunset.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.300
 Thank you doctor, very much appreciated.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.300
 Okay, thank you for your call caller.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:25.140
 Okay, so the number if you live in the area is 923 3911 and if you're outside the area

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.220
 the 800 number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:33.020
 So we've got Dr. Raymond Peat sharing his wisdom here and the subject for this evening's

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.020
 longevity.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:39.460
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, I wanted to carry on asking you some more questions about the B vitamins.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:44.900
 I know that they're intrinsically involved in energy generation and its transfer.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:50.740
 What would you suggest as a good strategy to ensure adequate levels of B vitamins?

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:59.180
 A good diet that includes liver once in a while, milk regularly, and/or cheese, eggs

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:05.860
 regularly, seafood or meat fairly regularly, at least once a week for some kind of seafood

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:11.180
 is good for the trace minerals that you might not get in some of the land foods.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:16.260
 Given that it's water soluble, how realistic do you think it is for people actually to

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.140
 be low in B vitamins that may otherwise make a difference?

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:24.660
 Because I know you've mentioned B1 and B3 as being something that has been intrinsically

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:29.760
 important in people's memory, their retention of information and how quickly it can make

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.460
 a difference just by supplementing with it.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:37.540
 And if they're supplementing, I presume that they were low in it and so taking a supplement,

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:44.740
 raised their B levels, their 1 and their 3, and corrected their mental state, I think.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.740
 B vitamins act very quickly.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:52.700
 So you can usually see an effect sometimes like with vitamin B1, you can often feel an

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.580
 effect in the first hour.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.660
 With vitamin B6, you generally feel an effect in the first day.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:05.660
 And with vitamin B6, sometimes 10 milligrams is all it needs and one dose will often take

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.660
 care of a problem that has lingered for a long time.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:15.860
 And it's good if you can use a few doses of the supplements because most of the supplements

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:20.340
 have impurities and excipients that aren't good in the long run.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.020
 I know you're a proponent of very modest doses too.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.940
 So what would you, because I know a lot of companies sell B vitamins and they use 500

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:33.740
 milligrams or ridiculous amounts, especially of B6 or B3.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.740
 What would you recommend?

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:41.460
 If a person has diabetes or cancer or something and has very high lactic acid production,

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:49.380
 300 milligrams in divided doses can help to normalize sugar metabolism and lactic acid.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.780
 But ordinarily, 10 or 20 milligrams, plenty.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.580
 Is this B3 we're talking about now?

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.300
 No, that was vitamin B1.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:06.980
 And B3 for major problems, including diabetes, probably arthritis, a lot of degenerative

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:15.100
 problems, taking 50 or 100 milligrams several times a day of niacinamide can control the

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:22.940
 symptoms, reduce inflammation, protect the nerves and accelerate glucose oxidation and

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.940
 so on.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:30.860
 And I should mention that for some reason, I think doctors liked nicotinic acid because

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.780
 it had such visible effects of making you turn red.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:41.980
 But people generally don't like the feeling of flushing and it isn't good for your health

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:47.140
 because it releases serotonin, histamine and toxic prostaglandins.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.900
 So it's actually causing damage when it flushes you.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:58.300
 And in recent years, the market has been flooded with something they call no-flush niacin.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:05.140
 But if you look at the label, you'll see that it's inositol hexanicotinate and that means

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:11.980
 that each molecule has six nicotinic acids and it's a little slower to release.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:16.740
 That's why it doesn't cause the sudden intense flushing, but it's the same substance that's

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:21.100
 releasing those inflammatory toxic substances.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:29.620
 So it has to be either niacinamide or the new niacinamide or nicotinamide riboside,

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.380
 which is just a variation on niacinamide.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.780
 And it's a lot more expensive, but if you have an allergic reaction to one, you can

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:38.780
 try the other.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.780
 All right.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:45.740
 I very quickly want to just ask you to remind listeners, the dose, and you mentioned specifically

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:51.020
 for cancers even, B1 of 200 to 300 milligrams in divided doses?

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:56.180
 Yeah, it's safe to take as much as 300 milligrams.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.100
 And again, what would the benefits of that be?

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:00.820
 Lowering lactic acid.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.380
 Lowering lactic acid, yeah.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:09.500
 Reducing the oxidation of it so you produce more carbon dioxide and less lactic acid.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.340
 That shift away from inflammation.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:18.340
 Lactic acid is keeping the cancer developing by creating inflammation and disturbing the

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.340
 pH balance.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.340
 Good.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.100
 Okay, well, we do have a couple more callers, so we should probably take this next caller

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.140
 and see where this takes us.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.140
 So caller, you're on the air?

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.140
 Hi, you're on the air and where are you from?

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.140
 I'm from Laytonville.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.140
 Hi, what's your question, caller?

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.140
 I have a question.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:38.500
 You mentioned the body temp, a low body temp, like 97.4 is normal or?

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.500
 No.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.860
 So what are some things like hot foods, ginger, what are some things?

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.340
 Well, no, not particularly because they just cause peripheral vasodilation which might

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.140
 give you a feeling of warmth but might actually cool you down even.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:55.460
 But Dr. Peat, when he mentions temperature and pulses as a measure or a good gauge for

00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:01.420
 assessing thyroid function that you should reach 98.6 during the daytime and preferably

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:05.180
 after breakfast in the morning and you should stay at that kind of temperature pretty much

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:07.100
 all through the day until the evening.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:12.100
 If you have consistently low body temperatures that do not seem to rise after food, then

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.060
 that would be fairly suggestive of metabolic deficiency and particularly that you'd benefit

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.700
 from using thyroid hormone.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.860
 And protein deficiency is a possible cause of low body temperature.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:30.780
 I've seen people who couldn't respond to thyroid or other metabolic activators and it turned

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:34.140
 out they were eating something like 20 grams of protein a day.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.820
 The requirement is closer to 80.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:38.820
 That makes sense.

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:45.900
 I have a blood type, I like high cortisol, I'm active, I need protein, that makes sense.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:52.820
 My other question is what are your thoughts on dilation like the heavy metal cleanse?

00:40:52.820 --> 00:41:00.500
 Good foods will safely activate the process of mobilizing heavy metals from the tissues

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.380
 and passing them out through the kidneys.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:09.780
 Coffee drinkers are known to have a lower load of most of the heavy metals such as cadmium

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:10.780
 and lead.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:17.140
 Do you think that foods, a healthy diet would like naturally take care of all of the heavy

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.740
 metals we accumulate daily?

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:27.740
 One of the advantages of having orange juice and milk in your diet constantly is that they

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:34.260
 provide materials that help to inactivate the toxic effect of heavy metals while mobilizing

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.020
 them and washing them out through the kidneys.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.020
 Thank you, gentlemen.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.020
 Thank you for your call.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.580
 Dr. Peat, I've got to ask a personal question.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.360
 I think perhaps a lot of people might like to hear your thoughts on this because they're

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.740
 always very different and I'm always very, very happy to hear what you say because it's

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.740
 always illuminating.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:56.300
 Ebola virus is becoming a very careful watch word right now.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.380
 I'm not being flippant at all but what would you do?

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:05.540
 What are your thoughts and your suggestions on Ebola virus and how best to protect yourself

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.540
 from it?

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:13.380
 The effects of it are basically like flu and many other viral or even bacterial infections

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:22.140
 that activate the inflammatory processes and inactivate our immune defenses.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:29.340
 If you look at the research, the first thing that happens is the inhibition of interferon,

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:37.300
 the antiviral, one of the defenses and activation of nitric oxide production which opens up

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:42.580
 blood vessels, makes them leaky and lowers energy production.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:51.740
 And so whether it's flu or Ebola or poisoning by chemicals, the method of defending yourself

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:58.140
 is pretty much the same to lower anything irritating that you're doing such as eating

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:05.020
 foods that are hard to digest and doing anything you can to lower inflammation and nitric oxide

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.020
 production.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.020
 Aspirin?

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:15.540
 Aspirin and coffee and niacinamide are all defenses against nitric oxide and I think

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:22.220
 nitric oxide is central to all of those when they get to the point of causing degenerative

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.820
 bleeding processes.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.820
 What about interferon?

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.060
 Is there anything that you would suggest that would be useful for raising your interferon

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.260
 or protecting or preventing the blockage of it?

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:38.020
 You know, I think that'll take care of itself if you just keep your energy up and hold the

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.460
 inflammatory things such as nitric oxide as low as you can.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.460
 Okay.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.460
 All right.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:45.460
 Good.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.460
 Well, I had to ask you.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.540
 I thought you'd have some suggestions for it and thank you very much again, Dr. Peate,

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.980
 for joining us on the show and thank you callers for calling in.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.900
 I know it's always very useful when people call in with lots of different questions even

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.980
 if they're not related to the subject and just from where the callers come from just

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.140
 shows how wide an audience that you have, Dr. Peate.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:04.140
 Thanks so much for your time.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.140
 Okay.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.140
 Thank you.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.140
 Okay.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.940
 For those people who have listened to the show, if you want any more information outside

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:16.860
 of the show time, we can be reached on 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or further information.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:22.020
 So Dr. Raymond Peate's website has got a wealth of articles fully referenced.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.940
 They're not just made up stories or unsubstantiated claims.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:31.540
 They're actually very well written and very scientifically based and science is there

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:36.860
 really to point the way forward and anybody who does want to disbelieve the science perhaps

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:42.840
 would be a little bit rash because science does have a good place and a very important

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:47.460
 tool for finding out the truth behind the questions that plague us.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:53.980
 And so there's lots of lies out there and the internet unfortunately is one of the wealthiest

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.660
 places but also has lots of answers too.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:01.180
 So it's just sorting out the information and Dr. Peate's always got a very different perspective.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:05.020
 So I'm very happy that he spends the time that he does joining us on the show.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:10.860
 So his website is www.raypeete.com.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.700
 Lots of articles on his website that you can look at.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.380
 And again, until the third Friday of next month, have a good night.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.380
 All right.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380
 Okay.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.820
 Well, thanks Jessica Baker of Jade Dragon Acupuncture for her support of Redwood Community

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.420
