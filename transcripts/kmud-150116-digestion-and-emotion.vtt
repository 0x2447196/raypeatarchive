00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 the old world pickling crocks, oh and old world pickling crocks.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Organic Grace is on the main street in Garberville and on the web, organicgrace.com.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Alright, stay tuned.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Welcome to this month and this New Year's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Happy New Year everybody.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 I'm a licensed naturopathic doctor who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 We run a clinic in Garberville where I consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU DeGarberville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of digestion and emotion.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Some of it is carrying on from last month's topic of "You are what you eat."

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 I had quite a few people writing afterwards on that subject.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 It was quite interesting to get some feedback from people who'd listened, so thank you for that.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or like so many people these days,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 if you live outside the area, there's a toll-free number which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 So that's 1-800-568-3723.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 So we'll be taking calls live from 7.30 onwards.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 But until then, let's just introduce Dr. Peat.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Dr. Peat, you with us?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Yes.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Hi. Thanks so much for joining us again.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 I, as always, want to give people the benefit of understanding your professional and academic background

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 for those who maybe have never heard of you or who've just tuned in.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 So if you'd like to just tell them your professional and academic background.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 After working several years in humanities areas,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 I decided to study biology because of wanting to get a concrete grasp of how the brain works

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 in making language, images, and so on.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So I intended to work on a PhD at the University of Oregon starting in 1968 in brain biology.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And I quickly found that that was the most dogmatic area in biology, genetics, and nerve biology.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And so immediately I looked around for less dogmatic areas.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And it turned out that the extreme other end of the organism, the reproductive system,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 happened to be the most scientific empirical.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 So I did my dissertation on oxidative changes in the female reproductive system with aging.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And that involves a lot of nutrition-related topics that were of interest to me.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 I wanted to just, I think, just let people know, at one time,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 you were actively consulting with people, weren't you, for quite a few years?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Yeah. In the '70s, I just happened to meet some women who were having hormonal problems.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 In graduate school, I had talked to some girls who immediately, when they came to the university,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 got a cheap basement apartment, started having terrible PMS.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And that 1967, '68, I got interested in the role of light in brain and hormone functions

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 and how I called it "windward sickness" from a light deficiency.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And then when I started running into women with a slightly older group, 40, 45, and 50,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 having really serious problems like multiple sclerosis and several other nerve-related conditions,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 I recognized the work I had been doing with hamsters and hormones as being directly applicable to them.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 So I started doing nutritional consulting and finally started suggesting that they use progesterone and thyroid supplements

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 because in some cases, the diet just wasn't enough to take care of acute problems.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Yeah. Okay. And also, just so people that are listening can be aware of this also,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 you produce a monthly, or is it bi-monthly now?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Bi-monthly.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Yeah. A bi-monthly newsletter.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 So anyway, we'll be giving out Dr. Peat's information at the end of the show

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 for people who'd like to either contact him or find out more about his website

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 and all the articles that he has that are freely available and referenced there.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, I wanted to carry on partly from last month's topic on "You Are What You Eat"

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 and a little bit more of a focused look at diet, digestion, and emotion

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 because I know that some of the things that you brought out in your most recent newsletter,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 as well as the prior ones, kind of peaked my interest in some other directions.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And I also have questions from people that have been garnered since the last month

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 that I want to see if we can get time to put to you.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 But going back to last week, you mentioned this gut peptide called cholecystokinin

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 was previously shown to have a crucial role in mediating the effects

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 of intragastric fatty acid solutions on brain activity.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 And they were saying that the receptors for CCK, this cholecystokinin,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 are known not only for their role in digestion but also for roles in memory function and learning

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 and in the modulation of panic and anxiety.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 So there's this link between the gut and the emotion.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So it's not just for digestion and picking up food and sending it off to the various departments

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 that store it like the fat cells, et cetera, but it also triggers emotive events in people.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 How do you interpret, from my suggestion, that CCK's role in the stimulation and secretion of bile

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 and the digestion and the absorption of nutrients, especially fats,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 supports the link between this mental function and digestion?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 I think it's good to consider at least one other digestive peptide,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 the gastric inhibitory polypeptide, GIP.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 My general picture of the organism, for example,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 analogous to the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 the day and the night sides of the nervous system,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 everywhere you look you can see this sort of a polar opposition in two kinds of function.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 One is mobilizing, the other is demobilizing and relaxing.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Okay, that's the parasympathetic is the relaxing and the mobilizing is the sympathetic.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And when the organism is young and healthy,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 that opposition works very nicely for night and day action and rest, cycling.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 And in the digestive system, when you eat fats and proteins,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 you secrete the cholecystokinin.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 When you eat sugar, you secrete the GIP, which is also called the insulinotropic hormone,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 because it calms down, stops your acid digestion because you don't need acid to handle sugar,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 but it activates the insulin so that you handle the sugar.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And when you look at the effect in the brain,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 CCK activates the corticotropic release hormone,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 which turns on anxiety and stress and the pituitary,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 ACTH, which turns on the adrenals to handle stress.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Okay.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 The gastrointestinal, gastric inhibitory peptide,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 responding to glucose has pretty much the opposite effects.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 And in the hippocampus, for example,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 which is a part of the brain that's expanded by opportunity and learning and shrunk,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 strengthened by stress, the insulinotropic hormone responding to sugar also has receptors in the hippocampus

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 that stimulates the birth of new cells.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 So learning and stimulating experience and eating sugar have the same effect.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Go hand in hand, huh?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Yeah, the same effect in your brain.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Eating fat and protein surprisingly turn on anxiety and stress.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 Even protein, huh?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Well, that tends to lower your blood sugar because it also stimulates insulin.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Got it.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 And lowering the blood sugar turns on stress.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Okay.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 And in the farther down the intestine, if you could be born without bacteria,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 they've created situations with cesarean birth of rats and dogs and pigs and such

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 and keeping them in a germ-free environment.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 They find that everything develops perfectly.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 In fact, the animals live longer and are very resistant to obesity and diabetes and degenerative diseases.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Okay.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 They have a very high metabolic rate too, don't they?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Yeah, they're very much like the…

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 The bonus is…

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Calorie-restricted animals and fat-free diets where they don't have the so-called essential fatty acids,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 those animals have an extremely high metabolic rate too.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 And so the calorie restriction and being free of germs both stimulate your ability to oxidize food,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 produce energy, and prevent obesity and be generally healthy and long-lived.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 So something is happening in the intestine that the bacteria are responsible for.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 The main thing that it turns out that the bacteria are doing is usually converting starch.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Starch is the main bacteria promoting food.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 The bacteria living on these foods that we don't digest produce endotoxin,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 and the endotoxin everywhere it reaches a human cell stimulates the production of nitric oxide.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 And nitric oxide is on the demobilizing side of the balance.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 It turns off metabolism, slows down oxidation.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 Okay.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 So it's the main reason that having too many bacteria in the intestine creates obesity and lethargy and short life.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Is it all forms of starch that will promote the endotoxin production or…?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 No, if they're very well-cooked and easy to digest and aren't complex with fibrous material,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 the difference would be a corn tortilla that had been processed in alkali to open up the starch granules,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 making them easy to digest, versus the bean carbohydrates,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 the type of polysaccharides that human enzymes can't work on or ideal for feeding bacteria.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Hence all the gas.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Yeah.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 It's not good for you folks.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 When they've experimented with rats on this type of soluble indigestible fiber,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 the ones that get the fiber that supports the bacterial growth become anxious and aggressive.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 They're fearful and so they fight too easily.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 All right.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 So there's a definite connection there.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Let me just put your information out for a moment here, Dr. Peat.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 So welcome to this month's Ask Your Rob Doctor.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Rob Doctor on KMED Galbraith 91.1 FM

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of digestion and emotion.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 We have Dr. Raymond Peat with us in the studio.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 We'll be taking calls from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 So Dr. Peat, OK, you've looked at and interpreted the link then between sort of decreased mental performance

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 and poor digestion with the endotoxin formation, especially from starch.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 I'm glad you brought up nitric oxide because, again, when I was looking at some articles this afternoon,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 I think you need to bring this out as a fairly important point because I think just like sugar

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 and just like polyunsaturates, both of which, well, sugar was demonized and polyunsaturated fats were promoted.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 So the liquid oils, the polyunsaturates are now definitely swinging the other way.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Even medical opinion is of the mindset now that maybe saturated fats are actually much better for the cells

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 and much more stable and more health-promoting than the polyunsaturates, but it's taking a long time.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And maybe I think sugar, perhaps in time, will come around again.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 But it seems at the moment that nitric oxide is a pretty prevalent supplement or rather the L-arginine

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 that nitric oxides manufactured from is becoming a fairly popular supplement, especially in the bodybuilding world.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 And I wanted to ask you, given that these things are so freely available and publications, numerous publications,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 even so-called scientific journals are coming out with studies that support nitric oxide's importance

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 and saying that it's extremely important for endothelial health.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 So the inner lining of the arteries, arterioles, et cetera, is the endothelia.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 And nitric oxide is produced within that to prevent things like stroke, angina,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 and a whole other host of cardiac events that would be considered causative without nitric oxide in terms of the kind of starvation,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 as it were, because of the vasoconstriction that would happen, because nitric oxide's a vasodilator.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 But yet there's so much evidence contrary to that, and that's what I'd like you to bring out.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Why is nitric oxide so dangerous?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Because I know it's been implicated in stroke in people that use Viagra, for example.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Yeah, I just recently heard about a doctor who treats cancer patients with intravenous arginine.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 And just before I heard about him, I had been reading way back to the 1940s,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 people discovered that arginine stimulates cancer growth,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 and that starvation or reduction of arginine stops cancer growth.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 And through the '50s and '60s, continuing, it's being picked up again just recently,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 methods to stop the conversion of arginine to nitric oxide or to reduce the availability of arginine.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 It's being investigated again as a way to cure cancer.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 So there are these two very opposite things going on.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 One, nitric oxide is being proposed to cure cancer, or suppressing nitric oxide,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 it's demonstrated to stop the growth of cancer.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 And the first things that I was hearing about nitric oxide, I happened to be interested in endogenous carbon monoxide in the early and mid '80s.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 And it can promote cancer by blocking the respiratory enzymes.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And then in the mid and late '80s, people started realizing that something was producing nitric oxide in the body.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 And I think it was '88 or '89 when the enzyme was demonstrated that we actually have the enzyme that makes this smog-like free radical in our tissues.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 And because it was already known as a major toxin in smog, immediately people were investigating what it's really doing in the body.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 And from about 1990 up until the middle '90s, there are many publications showing that very clearly nitric oxide produced in the pancreas kills insulin-producing beta cells.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 That was just massively documented up until about '96.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 And then the Viagra people, they got a patent and started promoting the idea that somehow nitric oxide is associated with virility.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 And suddenly the research by the late '90s was turning just 180 degrees, saying everything that nitric oxide does must be wonderful because it is related to male virility.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Am I right in thinking also that nitric oxide in smog is a causative agent for asthma?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Yeah, and there are people recommending arginine and breathing nitric oxide to treat asthma,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 but others demonstrating that people with asthma are producing it themselves so you can measure it in their breath.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 The worse their asthma is, the more nitric oxide comes out in their breath.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 And it's the same with hepatitis, cancer, any major systemic disease.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 You can find increased amounts of nitric oxide-related chemicals in the blood.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Interesting. I'm glad you mentioned that because I've got a question from a couple of other people that I want to ask you in a bit about that subject.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 But let me just go back because nitric oxide is – okay, here's the deal.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Nitric oxide is produced in the body and supposedly has beneficial functions.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 So what do you think about the beneficial function of nitric oxide in the body and how is that mediated to a point where it's not dangerous as it is if you're looking at being exposed to it or taking arginine to produce it in your body more than your body does?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 What's its real benefit?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 It helps cells to de-differentiate by blocking their energy production.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 If you think of the mitochondrial high-energy oxidative system as being what creates a complex organism that uses energy so efficiently, it can have many different types of tissue.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 If you want to de-differentiate, produce a stem cell, you knock out the energy production and it goes back and becomes amoeba-like or fungus-like.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 So this is like a stem cell recruitment.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Yeah, and when a tissue is injured, it secretes a great burst of nitric oxide and that calls up stem cells from the environment, but it also creates them.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 It de-differentiates joining tissues so that they can form whatever new tissue is needed.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 So de-differentiation is part of forming the organism in the first place.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 As the embryo develops, nitric oxide has a constructive role.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 And then for tissue, wound healing is essential.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 But that very same burst calls up repair cells and de-differentiates cells to make repair cells.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 If that doesn't have the ability to be turned off, it keeps de-differentiating and stimulating tissue renewal so that you get an unhealing wound.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 The least bad example of that would be a keloid, a scar tissue that just keeps growing and getting bigger without forming the right kind of tissue.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 But in the worst case, it becomes a tumor and a cancer.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Okay, so how do you see the control of nitric oxide so that it's a proportion response if and when you need it through injury and blocking it dietarily or supplementally

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 so that you're not exposed to this pretty dangerous compound at all until such a time as your body might need it for whatever reason?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Everything that we have that is involved in producing oxidative energy helps to turn it off.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 So vitamin D1, niacinamide, the anti-inflammatory things like progesterone and pregnenolone, thyroid hormone,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 all of the differentiating, mobilizing energy intensifying substances turn it off.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 And everything that interferes with those turns it on and keeps it going.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 So it's the demobilizing, for example, going into hibernation, an animal produces these demobilizing signals with nitric oxide.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And anything that makes the organism tend to give up and stop struggling, demobilizing because of stress or isolation, inescapable stress, powerfully turns on nitric oxide.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 So in the brain function, when your brain is being turned off, it experiences depression, wants to retreat.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And things like anxiety and aggression, you aggress if someone doesn't let you retreat.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Hi, I wanted to ask you about the mind-body connection because I know that when I've spoken to you previously,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 you've kind of advocating what I think a lot of kind of new age or alternative thinking people would have held as a tenant of their belief in sort of a higher power, if you like,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 through focused attention and positive thinking, your body, your physical body can definitely be improved.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 And I know I've had this conversation with you previously about what would come first, you know,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 would you use supplements that will promote, you know, everything that we've been talking about now,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 progesterone, thyroid, the B vitamins, et cetera, to turn this negative cascade off?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Or would you have a positive mental outlook?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Or do you see the two being as important together?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And do you have any kind of protocol that you would be looking at would be a good rationale for achieving both of those things?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 When you look at the example of the psychologists who create depression by torturing animals, convincing them that they can't escape,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 once they form the idea that they can't escape, they don't try to escape anymore.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 So it's an intellectual switch that happens from the bad experience.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 And if you have made an animal helpless by those experiences, just one experience of escape will cure it.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 It'll have the knowledge.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Yeah, it's resistant because of that knowledge.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 And the culture is telling people too often that they can't escape.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 They have to do what they have to do.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Put up and shut up.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Yeah, and so something as simple as taking a vacation or getting a new job can make a tremendous difference.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 A person can pop right out of a prolonged depression if they get a new kind of work, for example.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Let me just hold your train of thought there, Dr. Peart.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 We've got the first caller of the evening, so let's take this caller and see where they're going.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 And where are you from?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 I'm from Kansas City.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Kansas City.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Hi, go ahead.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Yeah, my question for Dr. Peart is do you think using low-dose aromadex as an aromatase inhibitor would be appropriate for a female

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 who is correcting her metabolic rate by a thyroid and diet but has a fair amount of fat to lose still?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 Would that be safe to use while she loses the fat safely?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Those chemicals all have some side effects, so there are much better ways to turn off estrogen production.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Just the endotoxin from bacteria is a powerful promoter of aromatase and estrogen production.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 And so taking an antibiotic or eating a kind of fiber that doesn't support bacterial growth

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 or avoiding starches and eating saturated fats, which have a germicidal effect,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 saturated fatty acids are very much like antiseptics as far as intestinal bacteria go.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 So just by making those dietary changes, you can make a tremendous impact on your balance between estrogen

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 and cortisol versus the protective progesterone and androgens and so on.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Okay, that sounds good.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 I have one more question.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Could you just explain briefly the mechanisms of histamine and good ways to correct that?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Histamine and ways to what?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 Just ways to correct someone who has histamine responses periodically.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Since I was mentioning the saturated fats, some of the shorter chain saturated fats in coconut oil

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 have an antihistamine effect.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Coffee is a very effective signal to turn off histamine production.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Anything that energizes and restores cell function tends to prevent the production of histamine.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 How about sugar?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Oh, definitely.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 A person wrote a book about histamine about 40 years ago,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 and he demonstrated that histamine is produced in every kind of cell in the organism when it's sufficiently stressed.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 And that was before nitric oxide was known, but histamine turns on nitric oxide.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 So those are the two probably universal stress injury signals.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Okay, great.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 We do have another caller that's just come in, so let's take this next caller.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Hi, caller.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 You're on the air, and where are you from?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Yes, Andrew.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 This is David in Missouri.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Oh, hey, David.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 You know, on the last show we were talking about the bacteria in the intestine,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 and you had mentioned that a lot of times tetracycline will be used and it will kill.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 I don't remember the exact wording, but it was something to the extent that the harmful bacteria are killed

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 and the beneficial survive.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 Do we know that for sure?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Or like if you're using something like tetracycline,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 does it pretty much, you know, depending on the dose, does it kill most of the bacteria?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 And how does it collectively spare the what we would call beneficial?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 And then I guess along the same lines there,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 I've always heard that there is kind of a symbiotic relationship with certain intestinal bacteria

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 that help to absorb certain nutrients.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 And so I'm assuming that would be considered a beneficial bacteria if that is true.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 I think the interactions of the intestinal bacteria are too complicated to divide them neatly

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 into beneficial and harmful.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 In the germ-free animals, they've done experiments with introducing a single species of lactobacillus,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 and even the supposedly beneficial bacteria will make the germ-free animals susceptible to injury

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 that it wasn't susceptible to before.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 So it's the context and interaction of the different bacteria.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 And generally, the healthier a person is, the more sterile their small intestine is.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Okay, interesting.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 So, you know, what do you think of the idea that certain nutrients are absorbed through the actions

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 of so-called beneficial bacteria?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Is that kind of a fallacy?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Yeah, I think there's a little effect there, but I don't think it makes a big nutritional difference.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 The totally germ-free animals have extremely efficient digestive systems.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And I've heard you say that.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 I was just curious because you still hear this being talked about all the time, like there's these beneficial bacteria.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 And, of course, I know people are selling beneficial bacteria, so that's part of the reason that's being done, I'm sure.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 The other thing I wanted to ask you is the term "free fatty acids," is that always referring to polyunsaturated fat,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 or is there instances where free fatty acids are actually saturated fat?

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 Yeah, they can be either way.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Coconut soap is the salt of the saturated free fatty acids.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 And so if you actually could eat a bite of free fatty acids, it would taste like acidic soap.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Ah, interesting.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 We do have a couple of callers also, so let's wrap this one up.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Okay, we're good.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Thanks for your call.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 So let's get this next caller on the air.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 We've got two more, so let's take this next one.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 Where are you from?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Hi, I'm Kim from Garberville.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Oh, hey.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Welcome to the show.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Thank you.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 So I just had a question.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 I was wondering what the effect of infrared, like sauna, would have on the cell's mitochondria.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 It produces nitric oxide, doesn't it?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think of infrared in terms of possible nitric oxide production from the mitochondria?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Water absorbs infrared very powerfully, and so real infrared feels warm and it helps to keep your body temperature up,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 and keeping your body temperature up is very good, essential for the mitochondria.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 And the stress of cold is enough to turn on nitric oxide,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 and that can start down the pathway of hibernation and turning off functions.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 So infrared, as it keeps your body temperature up, helps your mitochondria.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 The far-red visible light, dark red, anywhere from orange to dark red,

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 these aren't very well absorbed by water, and so they go right through your tissue.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 You can see a red light shining through your whole body if you're in the dark.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 You can see it through your hand.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Yeah.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Put a light behind your hand.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 That's because it penetrates and is only absorbed by blue copper is the main thing that absorbs it,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 enzymes that contain copper in a blue form that does absorb red,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 and those happen to be the respiratory enzymes.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 And so the far-red activates the respiratory enzymes,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 and probably a major reason for that is that it bounces the nitric oxide molecule,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 loosens it, and frees it from the respiratory enzymes where it has been blocking it.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Interesting.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 So that's beneficial.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Yeah.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Yeah.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 All right. Thank you so much.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 You're welcome.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 We've got two more callers.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Still another one called in while the first one's on hold.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 So let's take this next caller.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 You're on the air.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 And where are you from?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Hi.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 I'm calling from Sacramento.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 Okay.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Welcome to the show.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 What's your question?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 This is related to what Dr. Peat said about treating corn with alkali or lime, rather,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 to make it more digestible.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 And I was wondering, do sprouted grain tortillas, are they also considered good for digestion?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Dr. Peat, sprouted grain.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 The starch is largely consumed and used.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 And the storage proteins in the seed happen to have lots of ammonia or amino groups which

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 are used to make actual functioning proteins with the energy from the starch.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 And so when you sprout a grain, you get rid of the toxic proteins that could release too

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 much arginine and produce nitric oxide and histamine.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And you get rid of most of the starches.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 So sprouts are basically good nutrition, like leaves.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 Oh, great.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 So it doesn't matter whether it's sprouted wheat or barley or whatever.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 In general, it's a good thing.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that in the last minute?

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 No.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 The gentleman asked, it didn't matter whether it was wheat or barley, that generally sprouted

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 things were a good thing.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Did you hear what I said or was there a problem with the line at the moment?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Yeah, the line is getting a little garbled.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Okay.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 The gentleman wanted to know if all sprouted things were beneficial because of what they

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 went through.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 Yeah, all seeds, as far as I know, have some toxic effects.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 Many of them are built in by the plant to protect their offspring.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 And once the sprouting has begun, the seed detoxifies those intrinsic chemicals.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 And so, especially if it's very well cooked, then it becomes nutritious.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Okay.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 So I think to answer your question then, Cora, the activity of sprouting neutralizes the

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 defensive compounds that are in the seeds originally.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 So I think the answer would be yes.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 Most sprouted items would be beneficial and nutritional for you.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 Oh, great.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 Thank you.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 One final question, if I may.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Okay, quickly.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Progesterone for men, is it beneficial or harmful?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Men who are in good health have a fair amount of progesterone.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 It's rarely measured in men, but it prevents abnormal excess clotting.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 And it's a precursor for other hormones.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 But if you have a good amount of progesterone, it protects you against fluctuations in the

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 adrenal steroids, aldosterone and cortisol.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 So that progesterone is sort of an all-purpose defensive hormone.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 And it's very highly concentrated in the brain, men as well as women.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 So it's definitely not just a female hormone.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 But if you have too much of it, if you take a supplement, it opposes testosterone.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 And so a man doesn't want to take it regularly and stop his whiskers growing, for example.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 But for an emergency, a big supplement can be helpful for, for example, epilepsy or arthritis.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 It's very helpful for men as well as women.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 How, and just so I can interrupt you for a second, Dr. Peat, how quickly would you metabolize

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 a dose of progesterone if you did take it and it was a large dose for something that

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 was, you know, go ahead.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 I know a doctor who insisted that taking progesterone orally wouldn't show up in the blood.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 So he took, I think, a fourth of a teaspoon and then drew his blood every half hour for 12 hours, I think.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 And he showed that it peaked in around the first hour and then gradually decreased over the next day.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Okay. All right. So within 24 hours or so.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Okay, we have another caller still waiting here.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 So let's take this next caller.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Caller, you're on the air?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 I am.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 And where are you from?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Garboville.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Oh, you're in Garboville too. Okay, go ahead. What's your question?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 Well, thank you again for a wonderful show. A lot of wonderful information.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 There was one thing that an earlier caller mentioned about beneficial bacteria.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 Is it the doctor's opinion then or your opinion as well that yogurt for its supposed beneficials is not so beneficial?

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 If it has had some of the lactic acid drained off or if it has just coagulated without becoming very sour, then it's fine.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Is there a difference then between Greek yogurt and goat milk yogurt?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Yeah, I think the Greek, which isn't sour, is safe. But the very acidic ones and the related products, I discovered that by drinking a cup of kefir.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Every day I would have a cup of that for lunch. I would get a migraine for several hours afterwards.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 And so I started reading about what's happening.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 And for one thing, the type of lactic acid produced by bacteria is racemic.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 And the kind we make is mostly the one confirmation that works differently.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 And the racemic type made by bacteria is more able to produce inflammation and fibrosis if you're chronically overloaded with it.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Really, that actually dovetails nicely into my main question, I think.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 I was recently more or less diagnosed by a Western-style doctor with a particular type of skin condition that I've been suffering for 20 years or so.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 Hydrogenitis Superativa, supposedly something that deals with the adipine gland, which is a type of sweat gland that causes cysts.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 So do you have any info on that?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 And when you're talking about yogurt and the inflammation caused by certain bacterias, I've been actually trying to support my system in general with, well, kefir, you mentioned.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 I enjoy it. Maybe that's a bad idea.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 People have experimented with even killing the lactobacillus, and in itself, even when it's dead, it has a very definite anti-inflammatory effect in the intestine.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 Anti-inflammatory.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 So it would be a good thing then for a condition that causes inflammation and cysting?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Yeah, that seems to be the implication.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 It isn't the lactic acid or the metabolism of the lactic acid bacteria that is anti-inflammatory,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 but just something about the chemistry of the organism, even if it's dead.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 Since the inflammation in the intestine is quickly reflected in the physiology of the skin,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 soothing your intestine will take care of a lot of skin conditions.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 So you're saying the bacteria itself is beneficial, but not the lactic acid that is common with many sour yogurts?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 Yeah.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 Yogurt minus the lactic acid is better.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 Awesome. Well, thank you very much.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 All right. Thank you for your call.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 Okay. If anybody else is listening and wants to get a question or two in before the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 the number if you're in the area is 923-3911, or there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 That's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Okay. So, Dr. Peat, I think just if perhaps you've got the time, I'll get some of these questions that I've had put to you anyway.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 I'm glad that we've had some of these questions surrounding what you've been talking about and not something completely different.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 That's always very useful to have people newly challenged, if you like.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 So, I wanted to ask you that from a perspective of kind of Hippocratic medicine,

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 they always mention that the liver was the seat of anger.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Do you have any comment on how this might come about?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 It might be related to digestion and endotoxin and inflammation.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Jim, what do you think about that? Does that make any sense?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 The liver, to the extent that it's injured, will ruin the whole organism.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 It's the chemist for the whole organism.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 If you're starving and not getting enough protein, especially, or not enough B vitamins,

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 your liver loses the ability to detoxify and you get gross hormone imbalances.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 That can lead to progressive inflammation, fibrosis.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 As these processes get more serious, the liver becomes a larger source of nitric oxide.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 At the point that it's becoming inflamed and cirrhotic, then it starts secreting nitric oxide to the whole system.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 The lungs, with an acute injury to the liver, the lungs will become acutely inflamed.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 When they transplant a liver, if measured, the sick person's nitric oxide is very high.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 When they put in a new liver, suddenly the nitric oxide is low

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 and the lungs suddenly begin working more efficiently,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 demonstrating that the liver is poisoning the lungs so that the oxygen doesn't get through efficiently.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 With the brain, the same thing is happening.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Edema is produced in the brain by the endotoxin-nitric oxide combination.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 Ammonia produced by the liver, which is being injured,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 was the traditional explanation for why the brain has problems in proportion to the liver.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 Now it's known that ammonia is activating the nerves that are excited by the glutamic acid,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 MSG, excitatory amino acids.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 Those excitatory amino acids act largely through nitric oxide.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 So depression, anxiety, and I assume aggression is part of this mixture of gradual poisoning to different degrees.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 Do you know if there's any blood test for nitric oxide like there is for cholesterol?

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 Or any other compounds that are fairly common? Have you heard of that?

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 I don't know what labs have available.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 It's becoming very common in research to look at the whole range of things produced by nitric oxide,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 but I don't know of any local medical labs that do that.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 Okay. Well, I have another question. It's a little bit different from all of the others, but nonetheless.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 In terms of well-being, emotional well-being, being restorative,

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 and a kind of dynamic process that is going to improve the general health of an organism

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 when their mind's in that place of emotionally being satisfied, happy, having a positive outlook,

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 in a positive thinking, etc.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 Exercise, I know, and having, you know, in my younger days,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 I sound like an old person now, but in my younger days when I used to go to the gym,

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 I remember feeling really very positive about it.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 And I'm looking back at it now, it's probably because I was probably running on a lot of adrenaline

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 from working out and just charging around like a crazy person.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 But in terms of exercise, I know that you always advocate gentle weight-bearing exercise.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 You don't advocate any aerobic exercise.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 In terms of generating a healthy physique with exercise,

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 what would you suggest rather than, you know, protein shakes and amino acids and supplements,

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 what would you suggest as being some of the best food sources?

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 And perhaps maybe you have mentioned gelatin.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 I don't know if you think that gelatin is a good thing because of the amino acids,

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 and what would you suggest?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 Yeah, gelatin is at least safe.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 It doesn't stimulate muscle growth the way other proteins such as meat can do.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 But the person's history really has to be taken into account

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 when you're looking at the diet and the exercise program

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 because I've known people who ate gigantic amounts of meat

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 and were producing so much cortisol in response to the meat

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 that they had extremely high levels of amino acids in their urine

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 and their muscles were being damaged by that same high level of cortisol.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 And so ideally, like the germ-free animals, they can run on very little protein

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 and lots of carbohydrate.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 The carbohydrate gets used for energy

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 and you would assimilate essentially all of the protein that you eat

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 because your cortisol wouldn't be destroying it and excreting it.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 Interesting.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 Well, what kind of carbohydrates?

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 It wouldn't be starchy and dangerous.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Fruits.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 Yeah.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 All right.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 So that's it pretty much, then.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 You're saying that fruit would be a very good source of amino acids

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 as muscle-building compounds.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 Yeah, as long as you're getting all of the essential nutrients, for example,

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 from some seafoods and eggs.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 Then fruits and gelatin would be a very safe diet for adults.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Okay, very good.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 Well, I know we've got four minutes left.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 That's probably not too long to go too much further

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 without having trouble with the engineer and the next person on the show.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 So I do thank you for your time, Dr. Peat, once more.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 And let me give out your information to people who've listened.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 Thanks so much.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Okay, so Dr. Raymond Peat is viewable, if that's the right word, on the web,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 www.raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 He has a wealth of articles on links on the home page,

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 all of which are fully referenced, very scholarly articles.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 Some people might find them a little hard reading because they're pretty technical,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 but there's a lot of information in there that if you want to start delving into some of it,

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 I know on the web you can find out quite a bit about what he's saying

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 in terms of the descriptive terms that might be used.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 But very good articles, like I said, well referenced and well researched.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 That's his job and that's what he's spent the last 25, 30 years doing.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 So www.raypeat.com.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 For people who'd want to contact me Monday through Friday,

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 I have a toll-free number, 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 Let's see what else.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 We've got a couple of minutes here.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 I don't think I'll just close the show by thanking you for your time.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 And until February, the third Friday in February of next month,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 I wish you a happy new year again.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 Good night.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:35.000

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 [Music]

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 [Music]

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 All right, everybody.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 That was Ask the Herb Doctor, great show.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 All right.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 A couple things I'm going to throw your way here.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
