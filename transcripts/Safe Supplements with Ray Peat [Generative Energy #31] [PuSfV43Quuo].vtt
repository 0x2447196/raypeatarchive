 Hello everyone, I'm Danny Roddy of DannyRoddy.com

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.200
 and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, biologist, Raymond Peat.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.520
 In this hour-long episode, we'll talk about the benefits and risks of various commercial

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 pharmaceuticals and supplements. In addition to thanking Ray for talking with me today,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.240
 I'd like to thank my patrons for making this show and all of the content I produce possible.

 If you would like to become a patron, please go to patreon.com/dannyroutty.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.120
 As always, please do your own research and come to your own conclusions. And in the spirit of

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.600
 William Blake, the true method of knowledge is experiment. Without further ado, here's the show.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.000
 Hello.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 Ray.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.160
 Yeah, hi.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.040
 Hey, how are you?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 Good.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.600
 Is this an okay time?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880
 Yep.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.520
 Okay, perfect. Thank you so much for talking with me. I sincerely appreciate it as always.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.640
 Also, I wanted to say the conversation with Gavin was extremely enlightening. I'm not especially

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.840
 interested in politics, but I am interested in your painting of physiology. And just knowing

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.240
 some of the things that you talk about, I was kind of interested in anarcho-capitalism.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.760
 And after reading that Gavin article, I was thinking that it kind of shook me out of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.080
 that mindset and was maybe thinking that capitalism wasn't the best thing for health

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.760
 and society. Was that kind of similar to what you were saying in that article?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:09.360
 Yeah. The idea of accumulating capital so you can build machines, people wouldn't have built

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:20.880
 steam locomotives and ships and such if they hadn't accumulated capital. And so lots of good

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.960
 things come from accumulating capital and putting it in one place. But the trouble is, Marx pointed

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.840
 out that it tends to accumulate all in a few hands, and then the system stops running because

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.560
 no one can buy what is produced so efficiently in factories. And so you have business cycles.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.360
 And then Lenin said, well, they discovered that you can cure the business cycle by having

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.040
 imperialism and invading countries to make them buy your product and keep the system running.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:13.360
 So as long as you have wars, capitalism has no problem. But that's the problem. It has its

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.600
 internal contradictions and tends to cycle down to a crash every few years if you don't have some

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.200
 way to break out of that. It almost perfectly put things into perspective of

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.760
 something Bucky Fuller said. And he was talking about how he was trying to shake the notion of

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.160
 everybody having to earn a living. And I was totally confused at what he was talking about.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.560
 But he was saying that technology was getting better and better, and that would free up more

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:53.120
 people to this barbaric idea of having to earn your place on the planet. Is that what you're

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.280
 getting at? Yeah, that was Fuller.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.960
 I think critical path, he said it somewhere.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:09.440
 Yeah, I admired him. I listened to one of his lectures when he came to Oregon.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.840
 Talked, I think, six hours steady until they closed the shop.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.320
 I was reading the CIA reports on him. And somewhere they mentioned that he had an

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.480
 incredible capacity just to talk for many hours.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:39.040
 Yeah, he and Fidel were experts at putting the whole world story in one lecture.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:47.040
 Cool. Okay. That's awesome. I wasn't specifically wanting to talk to you about politics, but I

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.720
 thought that was so good. And it really shifted my thinking. Oh, you know what? One last thing,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.120
 I was reading two other papers by a guy named Paul K. Piff, and he was talking about the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.520
 social and stress consequences of capitalism, too. He has papers called "Having Less, Giving

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.720
 More" and "The Influence of Social Class on Pro-Social Behavior" and "High Social Class

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.920
 Predicts Increased Unethical Behavior." So that seemed to just really tie in to the whole

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.520
 thing you were talking about. Yeah, the culture, basically, it has functioned as a system of

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:38.320
 illusions to help keep a dysfunctional system working to make the people think that they're

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:48.720
 better off than they are. And so I think working on the culture is really where political work

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:58.160
 should be done. Propaganda analysis everywhere, including science and philosophy.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.640
 It's almost like the food pyramid and then the political system synergize to destabilize a

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.120
 person, like the undigested starches and then the capitalism. It's like a perfect storm for

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.760
 a weird culture. Yeah.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.480
 Okay, let's get on to supplements. This has been just a constant evolving area for me. I don't

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.440
 remember when I first heard you say that you preferred using the oily supplements on your

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.400
 skin. It must have been years ago, like 2011 or something. And I heard what you said and I

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.720
 kind of rejected it because it didn't really fit in with my life. And I put them on my legs and

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.000
 they were too oily and got on my pants and it just didn't really work out for me. So years later,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.440
 just like probably like six months ago, I started putting them on my legs and stopped eating them

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.120
 and just like various small kind of things resolve themselves. And then I forget who sent me

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.800
 quote of yours saying that you only thought a few supplements were safe. Before we get to a lot of

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.640
 the specifics, you could just kind of give us a background because you've been talking about

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.080
 supplements like since the seventies and just perusing through nutrition for women again,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.880
 you seem to be saying like a lot of similar things that you should take a careful approach

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.520
 to them. So, and I know you mentioned before that you were known for getting people off of

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:36.000
 their supplements. And I always thought that was a funny idea. Yeah. In the late sixties,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.560
 when I came to Eugene, I knew someone who started the local free clinic. And

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:53.520
 in Eugene in the summer, the fields all around under the north of town were growing grass for

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.560
 the seed, lawn seed industry. And at the end of the summer, they would burn their fields

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:05.200
 and all of the pesticides and things that had been put on the crops would be vaporized and blow into

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:12.960
 Eugene and people with asthma would be more likely to die during the smoky seasons. And

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:20.240
 after it caused some huge traffic accidents, they finally, after many, many years,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:31.360
 limited it at least. But during that time, allergies were a major problem. And so,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:41.760
 my friend with the free clinic was constantly sending allergy people to me. And I found that

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:51.120
 they were all taking ascorbic acid and vitamin A and the usual things that people take for allergies.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:09:00.320
 And I had just a little before that been trying out Linus Pauling's idea of big doses of vitamin C.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:10.480
 And my first bad experience with vitamin C was in the mid 1950s when it suddenly got

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:19.760
 very cheap. I had had previous good experiences with tiny 50 milligram tablets that cured my

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.840
 poison oak right away. So, when it became cheap, I tried a 500 milligram tablet,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.640
 woke up the next morning with a sore throat and cold symptoms. And over the years, I saw that

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:42.160
 repeatedly happened that a good big dose of vitamin C always gave me some kind of a cold

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:52.400
 symptom reaction. So, around 1968, when I started seeing these allergy people in great numbers,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.160
 they were all taking vitamin C and some other supplements. And so, I suggested that they try

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:10.800
 stopping it. And just almost without exception, they would come back and say that their allergies

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.240
 were gone for the first time in years, just within a week of stopping all their supplements.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:22.080
 - And you suspect it was majorly due to some kind of endotoxin or like irritation from the intestine?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:32.480
 - Yeah. One of the things the endotoxin does is to impair oxidation of the lining of the intestine

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:48.400
 and create a reduced state of too many electrons. And the sulfites and ascorbic acid are a very

00:10:49.280 --> 00:11:00.320
 powerful reductants. And I think the combination of endotoxin and a massive chemical reductant

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:09.680
 can interact and set up a big inflammation in the intestine and then reflexes from that cause the

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.440
 nose to run and eyes to water and such. - Did that just shift your thinking to be

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.640
 much more careful about the supplements after you experienced that?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:28.480
 - Yeah. I had previously found that after I had dental x-rays, it happened three different times

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:38.720
 from the age of 10 to the age of 30. For about, in the first two times, I had leukoplakia on the

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:45.680
 inside of my cheek for six months following the x-rays. And the third time it happened,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:55.360
 I've been thinking about what happens to stressed cells and membranes. And it occurred to me that

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:05.520
 the vitamin A would be destroyed by x-rays just as much as it is by sunburn. And so I took a big

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.560
 dose of vitamin A and it immediately, just overnight, cleared up the leukoplakia. And

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.160
 knowing the similarity between cervical, so-called precancerous conditions,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:29.120
 leukoplakia can occur in the cervix as well as in the lining of the cheek. I told women about it

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:38.240
 and they tried big doses of vitamin A and vitamin E and similarly got the precancerous condition to

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:49.440
 disappear. But as I continued taking the vitamin A just as a regular supplement, I started getting

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:58.080
 headaches from it. And I'm not sure if the product had changed or if I just happened to be at that

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:04.720
 stage where I was more sensitive to it, but I found that just a touch of it on my lips would

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:16.560
 give me a migraine the next morning. So I tried out a series of individual supplements and found

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:28.400
 that riboflavin, a very important vitamin B2, was almost as powerful as ascorbic acid for giving me

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:38.960
 almost immediate serious headache or asthma symptoms. One other that was very intense was

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:48.320
 rutin, whatever they were selling as a rutin concentrate, was extremely allergenic. And

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:55.680
 talking to people with allergies, pretty much they confirmed that ascorbic acid was

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:05.520
 the number one problem for most people. But vitamin B2 and rutin and sometimes vitamin A

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:11.840
 caused problems. With your biochemistry background, do you suspect why these substances,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.960
 are they made in just a cheap way and that poses some risks to the intestines? Or

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.560
 why do you suspect supplements are these kinds of irritants a lot of the time?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:34.240
 When vitamin C was first on the market up until 1953 or '54, it was sold in very small 50-milligram

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:42.240
 tablets. And that was during the time when all of the classical amazing results were published.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:51.200
 I think that was because it was free of contaminants. But the new cheap way of making

00:14:51.200 --> 00:15:00.480
 it from glucose at first involved sulfuric acid, oxidation of glucose, and the sulfuric acid was

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.440
 almost always contaminated with some lead because of the way it was manufactured.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:15.280
 Over the several decades since 1955, there have been a series of chemical innovations for making

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:24.160
 it even more cheaply. But apparently, each of them introduces some kind of chemical adulterant

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:33.600
 in trace amounts. In the Journal of Free Radical Biology, I think it's called, in the late '90s,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:45.840
 someone published a study of the reagent grade best purity ascorbic acid that they got for lab

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:57.920
 use. They dissolved a gram of it in a liter of highly distilled water and then measured it in

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:13.760
 an electron spin analyzer, ESR or EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance, shows free radicals.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:23.200
 And the person who did this experiment said that just spontaneously on dissolving purified

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:33.920
 vitamin C in purified water, the content of free radicals was as high as would have been produced

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:43.840
 by, I think he said, something like 6,000 rads of x-rays, basically a killing dose.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:51.360
 He said, "Isn't it amazing that this amount of free radicals doesn't kill her intestines?"

00:16:53.600 --> 00:17:01.680
 He said it was apparently from traces. He looked at the very tiny traces of heavy metals and said,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.720
 "Any one of those." But iron was adequate, but there were several other

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.520
 trace metals that wouldn't be enough to create free radicals.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.560
 Unbelievable. And that's just like one problem with the supplements. I imagine like the casings

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.480
 they're in and then the fillers, like those are all added variables to the allergenicity

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:30.800
 of the products. Yeah. Every additive has its own manufacturing history and every reagent used

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:39.440
 in making that thing has its own history. And you have to look, you know, it's like they used to

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:50.640
 say about HIV infections, that one encounter can amount to hundreds of historical

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.160
 encounters and opportunities for infection. But when you look at every

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:05.200
 excipient in a product, each one of those has many components, each of which has its own

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.680
 history and opportunity for contamination. You've obviously mentioned a couple core

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:15.040
 things that you talk about a lot as being safe therapeutic agents, like things like thyroid and

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:21.840
 progesterone. What is your general process for evaluating something, if it's safe or unsafe?

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.160
 Is the history of the substance extremely important? Or like unpack your process, I guess,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:39.200
 for us. My thinking, I think, got started along a certain path in 1960 when they were analyzing the

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:50.320
 amount of strontium-90 from atomic bomb fallout and collecting baby's teeth from all around

00:18:50.320 --> 00:19:01.040
 the world to measure their exposure to radioactive isotopes. But strontium-90 happens to be

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:10.960
 concentrated in the bone, and the bone marrow is turning over rapidly. And so the exposure to

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:22.480
 fallout would show up as mutated blood cells. And radiation exposure to the bone marrow is a known

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:29.840
 promoter of leukemia. And so they were looking at the connection between childhood disease and

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:41.200
 strontium-90. And because strontium-90 is similar to calcium, it associates in milk. And so the

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:48.960
 government was warning parents not to feed their children so much milk because of the

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:55.920
 radioactive strontium that the bomb tests were putting into it. But I looked at the other,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:04.160
 how did the strontium-90 get into the milk? And it falls onto the ground in the rain.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:12.240
 The plants that need the water and soil to grow absorb both calcium and strontium-90.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:23.120
 And so the concentration in the soil is relatively very high after a bomb test in the ratio of

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:33.120
 strontium to calcium. And when the cow eats the grass, the cow purifies and selects for the

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:42.640
 calcium over the strontium. If you look at the ratio in grass and cow meat and milk, the milk

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:52.640
 has the least strontium-90 in proportion to other nutritional factors, especially calcium.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:21:00.720
 So every organism is a purifying system, getting what's good and excluding as much as possible of

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:09.280
 what's bad, even to the matter of being able to select between the isotopes of potassium, for

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:17.120
 example. Radioactive potassium goes down every time it passes through an organism on the food

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:24.800
 chain. And so the safest thing is to get the purest food possible from an animal like a cow

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:32.240
 producing milk, which is multiply filtered from the environmental source. When they talk about

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:42.000
 the chemical purity, that's only a reality in the mind of the chemist, that it's maybe better than

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:49.520
 something from a crude or factory. But in relation to biological nutrients,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:22:02.160
 it's just wildly out of the ballpark in terms of contamination. So any natural food

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:11.360
 is extremely purified. Any supplement made chemically is going to be dirty, just in

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.960
 principle. So sometimes somebody, I'll get an email of somebody saying, "I'm not eating liver,

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:24.560
 but I'm taking vitamin A and the B vitamins, etc." And this is just a totally non sequitur,

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:31.840
 the food versus just a litany of different pills? Yeah. And one of the problems is that you get

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:41.520
 lots of unnamed and still unidentified nutrients in any living tissue or recently living tissue.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:51.040
 For example, in mushrooms, the content has hardly been just sketched out. There are thousands of

00:22:51.040 --> 00:23:00.800
 potentially valuable nutrients or paranutritional substances, things that influence your quality of

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.520
 life that simply haven't been identified and tested. It's interesting you bring that up. That

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.760
 was actually one of the motivators for me to talk to you because I don't know what about being here

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.920
 in Mexico made it more interesting, but the substances you were talking about in foods,

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.840
 like the apigenin, the norenginin, the various substances in mushrooms, those all became,

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.920
 I don't know why, but suddenly more interesting than the various supplements. And since they were

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.040
 so easily attainable, I was like, "Why don't I just try to fortify my diet with these things

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:44.160
 rather than focusing on these pills or whatever?" Yeah. And some of the fruits that are most

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.960
 interesting happen to have some of the most amazing still unidentified substances in them,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:24:00.720
 like the curimoya. Just like Mark Twain said, "It was the best tasting substance in the universe."

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:06.080
 So those have a lot of medicinal qualities as well?

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:12.240
 They haven't been studied, but if you eat them for a while, you can tell

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.200
 that there is something amazing about them.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.880
 That's good to know. They're in my refrigerator. And then marmalade too,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:29.040
 like something you could make that is full of norenginin and then norengin, and this is

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.400
 something you would normally throw away that could be, I'm doing air quotes, but like a supplement

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:40.000
 with something with great value. Yeah, like orange peeling, people usually

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:50.320
 throw away, but if they're good oranges and well prepared, the marmalade is like a super drug.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:56.640
 People might worry about the fact that marmalade is more sugar than orange peeling, but

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.840
 the sugar itself is part of the nutritional wonder drug.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:07.600
 When the health gets really, like in a really serious condition and supplements or drugs

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.760
 would be of value, are there certain ones you typically think of that have a proven safety

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:20.720
 record or are more physiological than other drugs? Like I guess a few that you frequently mention?

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:30.160
 A general rule about drugs is that the oldest ones are best. They've been tested for more years.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.880
 Since the pharmaceutical industry sort of took over the world and the government,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:47.120
 they have had 20-year cycles in which they talk about a new generation of the drug.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:56.320
 And the first generation is usually the safest and most effective. The second, third, and fourth

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:06.480
 generations are more weirdly dangerous, but the toxic side effects just haven't been published yet.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.600
 Because you'll typically read some negative effect of like literally any substance,

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.160
 is there any way of understanding side effect data to understand like the real risks?

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:24.800
 Yeah, 50 years, I assume that most of the middle term side effects would have been noticed.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:32.400
 If it's going to bring on cancer, you have to use it for at least 20, preferably 40 years

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:40.160
 to know whether it's safe because cancer is a developmental process that typically takes at

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:50.000
 least 20 years. And then regarding like if it causes your children or grandchildren to be born

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.880
 without heads, that's worth knowing. And they aren't going to know that for quite a few years

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.640
 for all of the drugs that have been patented in the last 20 years.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.320
 Just because it came to me, but the finasteride is probably a pretty good

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.000
 example of that. It just seems like it's ruining lives left and right.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.760
 What drug is that?

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.120
 Finasteride, Propecia.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:22.160
 Oh, yeah, I hear from a lot of people who have had trouble from that.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.360
 What kind of effects would you expect with inhibiting 5-AR? Is that

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.720
 just because I get the email, I think, all the time?

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:38.720
 Well, brain chemistry depends on it. The metabolism of progesterone

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:48.960
 as well as testosterone in your brain, if you block any of the enzymes used in making it,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.400
 you're going to have a weird brain.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:28:00.560
 There's some famous quote from the FDA saying that dihydrotestosterone apparently wasn't

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.880
 used in the organism or it had like no function or something. So that was the kind of thinking

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.600
 that apparently was going into making that drug, which is nice to know.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:19.360
 Yeah, but it works on the progesterone system too. They said progesterone is only

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:31.360
 pregnancy-related drug chemical. Neglecting that the brain absolutely depends on making it and

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:39.360
 absorbing some of it that's produced in the ovaries and adrenals and skin. But it's a major

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:47.920
 brain hormone that you're messing with when you try to stop the production of DHT.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:53.920
 So just to finish that thought, restoring the pregnenolone, DHEA, and thyroid function would

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.600
 be probably a good start to trying to resolve somebody from taking that substance?

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.040
 Yeah, and even better probably to start with increasing your cholesterol production,

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.160
 which means keeping your intestine and liver in good condition.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.680
 Switching gears a little bit, can we talk about nutrient deficiencies and maybe common ones

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.320
 that you maybe think about often, have experienced yourself or written about,

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:25.280
 and then the best ways to go about restoring the nutrients? And I imagine that's with the

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:26.400
 simple foods.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:33.840
 Yeah, I had fairly interesting experiences like the fact that 50 milligrams of vitamin C

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:44.400
 cured horrible cases of poison oak. I thought I was going to have to quit working in the woods,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:53.360
 but over the weekend, I took two doses of 50 milligram vitamin C and the poison oak was gone,

00:29:53.360 --> 00:30:04.960
 never had it again. And around that same period, I was feeling gloomy and happened to take a

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:13.200
 tablet of, I think it was maybe 20 milligrams of vitamin B1, and in minutes, I had a clear,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:23.920
 happy perspective on the world. And when I worked in the woods, I always by about mid-summer

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:29.760
 was getting acne. And people talked about how sunlight was supposed to be good for your skin,

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:37.200
 but for some reason on exposure to the sunlight, I would get pimples. And one night,

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:45.760
 I think it was in the winter in Mexico, I was lying on my bed with a bright light hanging over

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:52.560
 my head and I went to sleep, spent about eight hours lying on my back with a bright light shining

00:30:52.560 --> 00:31:01.600
 on my closed eyes. And I woke up with pimples starting. And that started the biochemical

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:10.880
 thinking going. And I realized that my retina uses a lot of vitamin A just in the process of

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:20.160
 making the visual pigment and so on. But then the eye is the main regulator of your reproductive

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:29.040
 hormones. And when birds are exposed to constant light, for example, they'll be constantly in their

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:37.040
 mating season, like with artificial light in the winter, birds will become fertile and start

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:46.880
 nesting. And it's because light is the signal that is springtime and it activates your adrenals and

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:53.680
 gonads to produce lots of steroids. And the production of steroids is a heavy consumer

00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:02.400
 of vitamin A. And so from that enlightening insight, I took a big dose of vitamin A and

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:09.040
 immediately the pimples subsided. Then around that same time, I was getting interested in the

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:19.280
 curative effects and I read Adele Davis and a friend in Mexico City was dropping by and saying

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:28.800
 that his little niece was in the hospital with uncontrollable diarrhea. And he would stop by

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:35.840
 two or three days in a row saying that the final day he said they didn't think she would live

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:43.520
 another day. But at that point, he accepted an idea from Adele Davis. And I gave him a tablet

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:50.800
 or two of vitamin B6, 10 milligrams, which he took to the hospital, gave to the little girl,

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:58.480
 and within an hour or so, her diarrhea stopped and instant recovery. About a year or two after that,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:09.680
 a neighbor of mine had a big alcoholic nose. He was a terrific consumer of gin and tequila. He

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:19.680
 bought it by the case. And his nose was red and large and shiny. And he had a terrific problem

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:29.280
 with vocabulary. He was a hobbyist short story writer. And he would struggle for a long time

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:36.000
 to get the right word he wanted. He had it in mind, but he couldn't call it up. And he had this

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:43.760
 odd habit of when he was looking for a word, he would put his hand on his forehead and nose.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:53.680
 And so it started me thinking about the memory and the circulation to his nose being a problem.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.320
 And possibly the circulation of his brain was affected by the same thing.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:11.280
 And so I quoted from Adele Davis again, and described how vitamin B2 is essential for

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:19.440
 oxidation. And the blood supply is carrying oxygen. So it has to carry extra oxygen when

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:28.800
 you're deficient in vitamin B2 to make up for the inefficient use of the oxygen. And so I kept

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:35.600
 telling him this idea to try a vitamin B2 supplement. And he couldn't remember it. So

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:42.800
 I kept giving him notes and he would forget to take the note. And I think we tied the note to

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:49.840
 his finger. And he finally got to the doctor with the note. And the doctor gave him a shot of

00:34:49.840 --> 00:35:00.720
 vitamins. And I saw him within a day or two, he was talking as fluently as anyone, no hesitation

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:10.880
 in vocabulary. And his nose was completely normal pink color. Then he got a weekly shot.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:18.080
 But on some holiday, he forgot to go to the doctor for his weekly shot. Next time I saw him,

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:24.800
 he was hesitant in his vocabulary. And his nose was red and shiny again.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:33.200
 Once you're deficient in vitamin B2, it can raise your requirement for a long time afterwards.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.560
 So basically, it's endless what could be considered deficiency, like any kind of

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.920
 abnormal behavior or... Yeah, a friend of mine had a four-year-old

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:50.080
 kid who was having every afternoon, he would have a violent tantrum and was getting dangerous,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:36:01.600
 really vicious episodes. And at night, he would wake up screaming and having a horrible nosebleed.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:10.800
 And the nosebleed brain connection reminded me of my friend with a shiny nose. And we made up

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:20.960
 some milk powder, egg, and sugar cookies with 10 milligrams of vitamin B2 powdered up in this batch

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:29.920
 of maybe, I guess, six or eight cookies, which he ate that afternoon. That night, he slept through

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:38.160
 the night without having his nightmare and nosebleed. And he never, as far as I knew in

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.840
 the next years, never again had his horrible tantrums. What are your thoughts on the versatility

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:50.000
 of the body? Does it need everything every day? Because the gentleman with the larger nose,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.200
 he needed a large proportion of the B2 versus the child that needed just one dose.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:02.080
 Is there any way to tell what you need personally? Someone did experiments on rats and found,

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:11.360
 looking at the cornea, which gets its oxygen without blood vessels, so it depends on oxygen

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:21.520
 diffusing in from the inside and out. They used the cornea to test the effects of a vitamin B2

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:34.560
 deficiency and found that the mitochondria were essentially collapsed or structurally changed

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:41.600
 so that they no longer would take up vitamin B2 when it was given to the metanormal concentration.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:51.120
 So I think that might be a unique vitamin deficiency causing more or less charitable

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:59.200
 damage to the mitochondria, which you can regenerate, create a new crop of mitochondria,

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:06.160
 but it takes support and good condition over a period of probably quite a few weeks.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.320
 So your nutritional requirements depend on your parents, your grandparents,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.600
 and every generation before that? Yeah. For example, something that makes your

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:25.040
 mother low in thyroid or high in estrogen or low in glucose, for example, during your gestation,

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:35.600
 that powerfully sets a pattern in your nerves and endocrine glands that will greatly increase your

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:43.680
 requirements. And if you intensely work on them, the earlier in life, the better, but at any age,

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.560
 if you put enough effort into it, you can overcome those pre-settings.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:54.000
 You've mentioned that meat eaters would normally get a fourth to a half a grain of thyroid in their

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.680
 food every day. Do you look at thyroid? I remember being interested that you called it like a

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.000
 supplement where a lot of people like to label it as like a drug. Do you look at thyroid like

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.840
 eating oysters and liver, except it's almost impossible to get because the FDA made it

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:18.880
 illegal? Yeah. Seeing the various ways the country people ate in Mexico and in other countries,

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:27.680
 I realized that just the meaning of a traditional diet to a large extent was that it was nutritionally

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:36.880
 very complex and included hormones, especially the thyroid gland. People always would eat the

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:46.480
 chicken necks and fish heads, and they would save all of the glands from pigs and all of the

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:53.280
 food animals, sheep and cows and such. And they would use those in sausages with the smaller

00:39:53.280 --> 00:40:00.720
 animals. The whole animal tended to be stewed and used in a very comprehensive way. But

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:08.400
 the blood, for example, carries a lot of hormones, and blood is a very frequent

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:14.640
 component of food in basic traditional diets. I forgot where you said it, but I think when

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.480
 you were talking, it might have been in relation to progesterone or thyroid, but when you used to

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.400
 consult very often when somebody had a problem, you would have them read books on it before

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:31.520
 they actually took anything. Do you think that's a good approach? Or is just doing

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:37.520
 it the way of really learning about it? What are your thoughts on that? Because sometimes

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:43.360
 it seems that there's just a lot of confusion involved in embarking on thyroid.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.440
 When you don't know the client very well, it's best to give them the information that can make them

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:57.840
 take responsibility for themselves. But sometimes when I saw someone in desperate,

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:07.680
 like a suicidal condition, I would intervene by giving them a quick-acting thyroid or

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:16.160
 dosing them with some progesterone. When you can see it happening, you know that the person is

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:24.160
 in a desperate condition and that if they're going to be converted into a well person within an hour,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:34.960
 you can take the time to oversee it yourself. But otherwise, if you are just consulting more or less

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:43.040
 random people, it's better if you make them get informed so that they can watch themselves

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.720
 undergo the changes.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:50.640
 Yeah. For what it's worth, I think in your, from PMS to menopause, you have like a Q and A format.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.360
 And when I was first learning about your work, that was, I feel like, one of the most helpful

00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:01.360
 things that I embarked on when I was reading your literature at first because it was super

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:06.880
 easy to understand. By the way, are you thinking about putting your books up anywhere anytime soon?

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:16.320
 Yeah, I've got them in electronic form, but they're so big that I can't email them. And so

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:22.320
 we've been trying to just find out how to make them easily accessible electronically.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:28.720
 Awesome. Awesome. I think I get emails every day for people asking when your books are available.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:35.840
 Okay. Nutritional requirements for a hypothyroid versus healthy person. I know you've mentioned

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.520
 that vitamin A can be kind of a double-edged sword. Is there any other nutrient that is needed

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.560
 in, well, I know vitamin A is needed in lesser amounts for the hypothyroid person. Is something

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.960
 like magnesium especially important for the hypothyroid person, anything like that you can

00:42:50.960 --> 00:43:01.040
 think of? Yeah. Thyroid is required to retain magnesium by cells. So when you're hypothyroid,

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:08.240
 the slightest stress makes the magnesium fall out of your cells and get lost in the urine.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:18.720
 And so a constant daily supply of magnesium is essential for things like preventing cramps and

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:26.080
 depression and all of the inflammatory things that come from magnesium deficiency.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:35.200
 But once your thyroid is up where it should be, then you can go for really probably two weeks or

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:43.760
 more without anywhere near the required amount of magnesium. So most nutrients you can go without

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.880
 for a couple of weeks as long as you're getting energy. That's interesting. So you don't need

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:56.720
 everything every day. There's lots of versatility in the, yeah, okay. That's good to know. And that

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:04.400
 Traskin study on vitamin A, he thought that the healthier people needed more vitamin A. Is that

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:10.800
 similar to your thinking as well? Yeah, because you're turning over your cholesterol to progesterone

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:18.000
 and testosterone chemistry constantly. And that uses lots of vitamin A. And when your thyroid

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:25.840
 is low, then you have a very low requirement for vitamin A that the FDA sees. If you had to do a

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:32.160
 general ballpark of somebody, a healthy person with high thyroid activity, how much thyroid,

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:38.480
 I'm sorry, vitamin A do you think they would need? During my twenties, I apparently needed around

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:48.880
 50,000 units per day. The researcher, dentist, Emmanuel Traskin at one of his conventions

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:58.240
 circulated a questionnaire and asked people to list their symptoms and all of the supplements

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:08.240
 that they used. And he published a chart showing a straight line of inverse relationship between

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:17.040
 the amount of vitamin A from no supplement to 100,000 units a day. And the number of symptoms

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:25.520
 went from, I forget how many, but multiple symptoms down to zero symptoms in the high metabolizers who

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:33.040
 were using a vitamin A 100,000 per day supplement. Is there any dead giveaway? Because the vitamin D

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.400
 is pretty easy because there's a test. And I guess a vast majority of the emails I receive, and then

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.960
 that causes me to go look for papers or search through your work. And it seems like the vitamin

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:50.000
 A and then vitamin K are a little more ambiguous to how much a person actually needs and whether

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.760
 it's suppressing the thyroid or helping or not. Is there any dead giveaway for a vitamin A deficiency

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:01.440
 or the need for vitamin K too, do you think? Or is it just kind of experimentation?

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:05.840
 Dr. McKeon I think experimentation is best. When a person

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:13.760
 has extremely high blood pressure, especially the difference between systolic, diastolic, if that's

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:23.600
 70 or more, I figure they should try some big doses of vitamin K because it is needed for

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:34.240
 keeping calcium out of your arteries. And as they become vitamin K deficient and calcium overloaded,

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:43.280
 they become stiff and you get a very hard kind of circulation. The pressure rises sharply on

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:50.480
 contraction and then falls drastically on relaxation because there's no elasticity in the

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:56.960
 system. And I've seen people in just a week or two bring their top and bottom numbers much closer,

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:06.720
 like a hundred point difference disappearing in just a week or two from a big vitamin K supplement

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.960
 like 40 or 50 milligrams. Dr. McKeon

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:15.440
 Speaking of vitamins D, A, and K2, these tend to have, I mean, reading from your work and then

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:21.520
 doing some reading on my own, they seem to be extremely therapeutic when given the right amount.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:25.920
 And I know we mentioned at the beginning of the conversation that they might be better off

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:31.680
 used topically. Can you maybe explain maybe your own process or what has worked for other people

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.280
 when using them topically? Dr. McKeon

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:43.120
 Oh, you have to use about, oh, sometimes 10 times the oral dose, depending on, you know,

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:49.920
 if you're going to bathe every day, you for sure need about 10 times as much on your skin because

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:58.560
 it takes some time for the vitamin D to soak in. And as your skin, the faster your skin is

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:06.560
 being replaced, the more of the vitamin D that you put on it is going to be lost with the shedding

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:15.840
 cells. So if you have some symptom like extreme weakness, that muscular weakness and the skeletal

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:25.600
 muscular symptoms will disappear in a day or two when you get, if you bring your serum vitamin D

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:35.760
 level up from say five or 10 nanograms to 30 to 50, just a tremendous difference in the brain

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:39.360
 function, muscle function, absence of bone pain and so on.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.760
 Aaron So if you wanted to use 5,000 IU of vitamin

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:48.320
 D per day, you should put 50,000 IU on your skin?

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.640
 Dr. McKeon Yeah, but you still should,

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:58.080
 after doing it for a while, you should have a blood test. Some people with very sensitive thin

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:03.200
 skin might absorb as much as 30 or 40% of what they put on.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.520
 Aaron And then A and K2 would be a little more

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.160
 ambiguous because the tests aren't so good for those?

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.200
 Dr. McKeon Yeah, you can get the vitamin A measured,

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:19.600
 but I think it's very expensive. And usually it's not worth having it done because if you just eat

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.160
 eggs and occasionally liver, you're going to have plenty.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.920
 Aaron Do you use a combination of those every

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.560
 day or is it kind of just like a once or twice a week kind of thing?

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.160
 Dr. McKeon Of the skin?

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.720
 Aaron Yeah, of the oily vitamins.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.720
 Dr. McKeon Yeah, in the winter, I try to do it every day. In the summer,

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:47.600
 the food supply is usually fresher and so I often don't use them every day in the summer.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:53.200
 Aaron Your thoughts on the probiotic strains B-liciniformis

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:58.640
 and then B-subtilis? And they're contained, I guess, in a product called Biosporin that's

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:02.480
 from Europe somewhere. Go ahead.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:08.320
 Dr. McKeon There are safe antibiotics that can work for

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:16.720
 a lot of people with a bowel dysbiosis, bad bacteria overgrowth. But I think the first thing

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:25.120
 is just to cut out the foods that are supporting the bad bacteria, which are usually polyunsaturated

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:33.760
 fatty acids and hard to digest starchy fibrous foods like grains, beans, seeds and such.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:42.640
 And then the disinfecting foods such as cooked mushrooms and raw carrots, these are natural

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:51.680
 antibiotics. But when you have a really serious, intense bacterial problem, these subtilis and

00:50:51.680 --> 00:51:01.840
 B-liciniformis, those are useful. Life Extension Magazine, I think this month, has a good article

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:09.440
 on the phage bacterial virus that kills lots of the toxic bacteria.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.360
 Aaron Would this be useful in place of antibiotics

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.520
 like penicillin and minocycline and the macrolides? Or would this be kind of a law,

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.440
 like if all those fail, then this would be something to investigate?

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.080
 Dr. McKeon Yeah. But I've seen just carrot salad

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:33.360
 everyday work just as well as penicillin for reducing the stress that's causing a hormone

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:42.320
 imbalance, for example. If you're having very high cortisol and estrogen and low

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:50.880
 testosterone and progesterone, sometimes the supplement of any of the antibiotics can do it,

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.680
 but so can just having a raw carrot salad every day.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.320
 Aaron Do you think if you're going to use

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:04.720
 aspirin consistently, do you think it should be dissolved in water? And then, two, do you mind

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.640
 talking a little bit about the relationship between aspirin and vitamin K2?

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.520
 Dr. McKeon It's not an acute thing. The aspirin,

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:22.080
 one of its effects, the famous effect, but it's a very trivial effect in the actual benefit you get

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:31.760
 from aspirin, is the knocking out of the clotting platelet function. And that effect that can cause

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:40.160
 uncontrolled bleeding from too much aspirin is by blocking or interfering with the proteins

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:46.880
 that are produced by the liver under the influence of vitamin K. So not everyone experiences this,

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:54.800
 but if you have taken antibiotics and have a deficiency of the type of bacteria that produces

00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:02.960
 vitamin K in your intestine, then you're susceptible to aspirins knocking out of this

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:10.000
 vitamin K-dependent clotting protein. So just as insurance, it's good to have a source of vitamin

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:17.280
 K in your diet. Aged cheese or well-cooked greens are ordinary foods that are good sources.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.520
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani These are the protein S and C?

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.760
 Dr. McKeon Yeah, those are made under the

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:31.600
 influence of vitamin K in the liver and they are the anticoagulant factors dependent on vitamin K.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:39.280
 So people who have excess clotting problems are sometimes told to avoid vitamin K,

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:46.320
 but if you haven't measured the proteins S and C, it might be the worst thing to do is to

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:55.200
 avoid vitamin K because vitamin K is required for the normal resolution of stimulated clotting.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:04.400
 And so you can have a tendency to strokes if you're very extremely deficient in vitamin K.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.760
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani People talk about vitamin D being an epidemic

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:10.480
 like a deficiency. Do you think vitamin K is similar?

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:15.600
 Dr. McKeon Yeah, I think it's just about as general as

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:23.440
 vitamin D. The reason people are so deficient in vitamin D is mostly in the northern latitudes

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:30.400
 working indoors, only getting maybe a couple of weeks of good sunlight when they're on vacation.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:40.240
 And in Muslim and Catholic countries, women have traditionally gone out in public, very covered up.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:47.760
 And if you're dark-skinned, it takes a very large amount of sunlight to produce as much

00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:54.480
 vitamin D as you need. So working indoors, wearing too many clothes, and having dark skin,

00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:00.800
 all make you more susceptible to a vitamin D deficiency. And the use of sunscreen makes it

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:07.840
 even worse because people go on vacation and block their vitamin D formation even when they're in the

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.320
 sun. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:16.400
 Does the inclusion of mushrooms change any of your general diet recommendations? And part two of that

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.160
 question, can you replace the carrot if you just eat mushrooms every day?

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.360
 Dr. McKeon Yeah, I've done that. I got tired of carrots

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:30.720
 after eating one a day for 20 years. Bamboo shoots are another alternative. We made more

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:34.560
 interesting recipes than raw carrots. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.600
 Would it be risky to replace eggs with mushrooms? Dr. McKeon

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:44.400
 Oh, well, mushrooms have really a good broad spectrum nutritional value.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.680
 But you just have to eat an awful lot of them. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:49.120
 How much have you been averaging, Ray? Dr. McKeon

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:59.520
 Oh, sometimes ridiculous amounts like once every week or two, we'll have a big bowl of mushroom

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:10.400
 soup, which is almost like porridge. But I think we must eat eight ounces at least each in the soup

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:19.520
 days. Other days, much less when it's just like tonight, we're having a liver with mushrooms,

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.920
 probably four ounces of each. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:28.640
 Yeah, I keep being kind of shocked on how cool mushrooms are. So I appreciate your work on that

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:34.000
 in turning me on to them. I have pretty much one last question for you. If you could take any

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.840
 substance on a desert island, what would it be? And including your just normal diet, whatever it was.

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.040
 Dr. McKeon As a supplement?

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.680
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, like just like a substance

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.120
 you think is really helpful, I guess. Dr. McKeon

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:54.000
 I think it would probably be either pregnenolone or progesterone. If you, for example, fall off a

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:02.800
 cliff or get sunburned or get bitten by a strange animal, no matter what happens to you, you want to

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:11.520
 have a lot of progesterone or pregnenolone. It's kind of a universal antidote. Like if you're in a

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:18.720
 car wreck and can move, you should squeeze a bunch of progesterone in your mouth.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.520
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.560
 Cool, Ray. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on that I glossed over too fast or we

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.280
 didn't get to? Dr. Ray

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:28.560
 No. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.800
 And what are you working on right now? Dr. Ray

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:39.600
 Oh, I've just finished my November newsletter on autoimmunity. And I'm thinking of the next one

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:46.080
 being on glucose as an anti-aging nutrient. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.960
 That'll get some attention. And then can you let people know how they can purchase your newsletter?

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.680
 Dr. Ray Yeah, the email is

00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:01.520
 raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com. No apostrophe in Ray Peat.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:01.920
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:07.360
 And that's 12 issues every two months. I'm sorry, one issue every two months. And that's for

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:15.120
 over two years. Awesome. Ray, thank you so much for talking with me. It's been a complete pleasure

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:19.440
 as always. Thank you so much. And thank you. Dr. Ray

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.480
 Okay, thank you. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.320
 I'll talk to you soon, Ray. Take care. Dr. Ray

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:24.160
 Okay, bye. Dr. Justin Marchegiani

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.240
 That's going to conclude this week's episode. I'd like to thank Ray again for talking with me today,

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:32.800
 along with my patrons for their support of the show and making all of the content I produce

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:38.080
 possible. That was a real special episode for me. I always enjoy talking to Ray and I hope you

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:43.200
 enjoyed it too. There were so many questions for this episode and I kind of dropped the ball and I

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:48.400
 didn't ask them all. So I didn't want to keep Ray past an hour, which I, that's what I said I was

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:54.640
 going to do. So I apologize if you had your question in line and didn't get to it. I myself

00:58:54.640 --> 00:59:00.800
 didn't ask a lot of questions. I was personally interested. So thank you so much for listening.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.200
