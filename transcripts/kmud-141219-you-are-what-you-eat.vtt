 [Music]

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Well welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.480
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show which runs every

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.480
 third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m. I'm a licensed medical herbalist

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.320
 who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.520
 I run a clinic in Garboville where I consult with clients about a wide range

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.280
 of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice. So you're

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.440
 listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.280
 the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.080
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject of "You Are What You Eat".

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.200
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:17.240
 area the toll-free number is 1-800-568-3723. So you are what you eat.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.840
 This phrase has come to us via quite a tortuous route

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 Anthelm Brilat Savarin wrote in Physiology du Gout ou Meditation des Gastronomies

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.000
 Transcendentes in 1826 saying "Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 you are." In an essay titled "Concerning Spiritualism and Materialism 1863 to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.360
 1864" Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach wrote "De Mensch ist was er ist" so that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.000
 translates into English "As man is what he eats". Neither Brilat Savarin or

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.520
 Feuerbach meant their quotations to be taken literally. They were stating that

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.920
 the food one eats has a bearing on one's state of mind or and/or health. The actual

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.520
 phrase didn't emerge in English until some time later. In the 1920s and 30s the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.000
 nutritionist Victor Lindler who was a strong believer in the idea that food

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 controls health developed the catabolic diet. Now that view gained some

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.080
 adherence at the time and the earliest known printed example is from an advert

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.880
 for beef in a 1923 edition of the Bridgeport Telegraph for United Meat

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.600
 Markets. In Australia as elsewhere nearly half of the population will experience a

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.480
 mental health problem at some point in their lives and this means even people

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.200
 who are not personally affected are likely to know someone who has

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.280
 experienced such an illness and research now suggests that depression and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.240
 dementia are affected by the quality of our diets across the life course. Indeed

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.020
 studies from countries as diverse as Norway, Spain, Japan, China, the United

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.120
 Kingdom, the United States and Australia show people whose diets are healthier

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.000
 are less likely to experience depression. The most recent evidence points to the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.480
 importance of the mother's diets for the mental and physical health of their

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.240
 children and I know Dr. Raymond Peat has been very keen to point out that

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.760
 mother's nutrition is extremely important setting up the child's future

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.640
 and Dr. Peat is with us in the show in a few minutes here we'll be introducing

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.480
 Dr. Peat and hearing his perspective on You Are What You Eat because I know he has

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.720
 some very unique ways and perspectives of looking at this subject. Now

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.320
 the role of nutrition on development is an obvious one but mostly ignored or

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.640
 overlooked in the perspective of health and well-being and the concept of

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.520
 homeostasis that is the constancy of the inner environment or internal

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.720
 milieu was first originally formulated by the French physiologist Claude

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.360
 Bernard who was alive from 1813 to 1878 and he was a French

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.080
 physiologist. Well Dr. Peat thanks so much for joining us.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.400
 Okay so as always people who have tuned into the show who may not have heard you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.280
 I would appreciate if you would give an outline of your academic and

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.160
 professional background before we get into tonight's subject. After I had

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.160
 studied in the humanities and taught art and English and various things I

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:37.600
 decided to go back to graduate school in biology at 1968 University of Oregon and

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:48.000
 wrote my dissertation on the age-related changes in oxidative metabolism in the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:58.120
 hamster uterus and how it affects fertility with aging and that involved

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:06.200
 hormones and nutrition among other things and how the environment affects

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:15.880
 those factors especially the efficiency of metabolism using oxygen and since

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.160
 then I've been writing and doing consultations and trying to figure

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.920
 things out still working on some of those same themes oxidative metabolism

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:39.560
 and aging the whole idea of metabolic efficiency is one of my current themes

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:48.640
 Lindar that you just mentioned his idea of the catabolic diet was to choose

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:57.880
 foods for their metabolic inefficiency because people eating to satisfy their

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:07.040
 appetite tend to get fat on the available foods and he found that he

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:14.520
 could get people to lose fat very consistently and quickly by choosing

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.040
 certain foods that increased their metabolic rate so that they could burn

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.920
 calories faster than they were eating them that was in the 1920s when he did

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:40.760
 that research and just by chance a few years later George Burr who was studying

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:51.560
 the effect of fats in the diet found if he made his rats deficient in the

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:59.240
 unsaturated fatty acids they burned calories at a terrific rate as much as

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:09.280
 50% faster than normal and he thought that was bad and he became very popular

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:18.520
 with the agricultural industry because they found that feeding those poly

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.760
 unsaturated fats to pigs and chickens and such they would gain weight quickly

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.440
 and cheaply without eating very much food just the opposite of what Lindar

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.960
 wanted to do was to find foods that would decrease the efficiency of the

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.720
 metabolism so that people would produce heat without gaining weight. Do you know

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.360
 what kind of foods Lindlar advocated? Lots of fruits and vegetables including

00:07:50.360 --> 00:08:02.400
 fruit juices. Okay. The standard nutritional education emphasizes the

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:10.560
 concept of specific dynamic action or the thermogenic effect of various foods

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:19.920
 and it's widely recognized that eating protein increases your body temperature

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:29.840
 and heat production. Okay. By quite a bit 15 or 20 percent and sugar a little less

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.320
 than that. I know you've mentioned I don't mean to interrupt but I know you've

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:41.320
 mentioned quite a lot in the past about coconut being thermogenic. Coconut oil.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:50.120
 Sorry. Yeah I think there are many reasons for that and the coconut is a

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:58.320
 very highly saturated fat and it happens that the unsaturated fats interfere with

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:07.760
 the mitochondrial use of oxygen in several ways by producing free radicals

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.840
 inflammation and by interfering in a variety of ways with thyroid hormone

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.800
 function. So all along the line the polyunsaturated fats slow down oxidative

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:29.840
 metabolism and so if your body is soaked in these conventional seed oils

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:39.560
 then when you eat coconut oil especially the shorter very mobile fatty acids

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.440
 that are only a third or half as long as the standard fats these move in the

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:52.040
 cells very quickly and oxidize without that antithyroid effect the seed oils

00:09:52.040 --> 00:10:00.200
 mostly have. Okay interesting. Okay so Victor Landler then came up with the

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:08.480
 the paper on catabolic a catabolic diet so the opposite of anabolism which is to

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.640
 build muscle and catabolism is to break it down with the production of heat.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:23.520
 Yeah in the 50s and 60s people were experimenting with what kind of diet is

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.160
 efficient for losing fat and still maintaining your health. They did

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:39.160
 experiments in which people would just have pure water for 10 days or 14 days

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.120
 and then they would analyze what happened to their bodies and they found

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:49.280
 that they lost almost pure fat a pure protein during that time very little fat

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:55.680
 right right okay and if they have eight maybe six to eight hundred calories per

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.880
 day during that same 10 to 14 days they would lose mostly fat and very little

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.120
 protein. Interesting because that's the muscle mass that a person loses when

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.640
 they fast or for example if they're using like you said that water for 10

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.040
 days that you touch the first thing is you lose as your muscle mass isn't it?

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:20.120
 Yeah and that's why so many women are dieting constantly and getting fatter

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:26.640
 because. Explain that a little will you. If they eat an extremely low calorie

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:33.920
 diet creating stress the high cortisol and other stress hormones cause them to

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:42.240
 break down their protein and their big muscles shrink so that a typical

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:50.320
 dieter will you can hardly see her calf muscles become so atrophied then the big

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:57.760
 skeletal muscles even at rest burn fat to maintain themselves. Okay. Almost a

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:05.560
 pure fat diet when they're at rest. Okay. And so the more dieting they do if they

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:11.960
 do it extremely the smaller their muscles get and the easier it is to get fat the

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.800
 next time they eat a normal diet. Right and you said with the addition of how

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.560
 much how much fat was the addition that caused the the protein to be conserved

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:32.080
 in that diet? Oh they fed them different foods like a mixed diet a little

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:39.620
 protein a little carbohydrate and not especially a low fat intake but just so

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:47.240
 that they they were able to get some of their calorie needs from the diet rather

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:55.760
 than from their tissues because when you're in the first day on a fast your

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:04.360
 body uses up the sugar that's stored as glycogen and as soon as your blood

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.760
 sugar falls because you've used up your stores then your cortisol rises first

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:19.800
 the adrenaline and the cortisol and the cortisol having no food available it

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:29.040
 starts converting your thymus gland and the big skeletal muscles mostly to free

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:36.080
 amino acids which then can be some of them are converted to glucose to feed

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:43.640
 your blood cells and brain and eyes and so on because those have an absolute

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:55.440
 requirement for glucose and so even a plain sugar diet to supply that minimal

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.840
 amount of your brain and blood cells are required that will greatly prevent the

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:11.280
 rising cortisol and loss of good tissue. Okay you listen to Ask Your Ob Doctor on

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.360
 KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM and from 730 until the end of the show you're invited

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.960
 to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.200
 topic of you are what you eat we're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat and he has a

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.120
 wealth of experience and knowledge that he's currently sharing and Dr. Peat it's

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.920
 it's well established I just want to jump onto this next subject of and

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.520
 probably spend a little bit more time on what's coming out in science about the

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.400
 what they call the microbiome of a person's body it's well established that

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.960
 your gut apparently is your second brain providing more input to your brain than

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.200
 the brain provides to it and this is why your gut health is largely related in

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.720
 your gut bacteria including your mental health and emotional well-being

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.080
 so it's been there's quite a few quite a few journal articles that have come out

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.680
 in 2013 and 2014 about the microbiome and making links as specifically to

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:17.960
 disease processes and the microbiome and I know that you advocate several several

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:25.320
 dietary factors that I think inadvertently are modulating if you

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.920
 like the microbiome and I think they the science bringing about the explanation

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.040
 of the microbiome is now justifying what you're saying about for example

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:42.280
 indigestible fibers like bamboo shoots carrots etc as being healthful in terms

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.760
 of their modulating the microbial content of the gut and along with things

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.480
 like cascara and now you talk a lot about cascara not just for bowel

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.400
 motility and improving bowel function and waste clearance but also

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.200
 because the cascara itself has a cyclic structure quite similar to

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.200
 tetracycline in terms of it being a similar antibiotic in the gut and how

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:14.520
 this affecting bacterial colonies in a positive way to remove bad bacteria

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:21.120
 naturally allows normal healthy bacteria to flourish and therefore modulate the

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:29.360
 the gut as an organism yeah and it's interesting that both imodin from

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:37.120
 cascara or a Chinese rhubarb and such and tetracycline and related minocycline

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.000
 and doxycycline these are anti-inflammatory as well as antiseptic

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:54.160
 and imodin and the tetracyclines have a surprising range of good effects

00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:01.880
 anti-inflammatory and probably mood improving minocycline is being found to

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:12.120
 prevent possibly improve dementia Alzheimer's disease and imodin has every

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.800
 year it seems like there are half a dozen new functions that are found for

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:27.280
 imodin including improving the flora of the intestine. Imodin am I right in

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:33.080
 thinking that imodin is also present in aloe vera? Yeah yeah lots of plant yeah

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:42.120
 generally they're laxative plants but the you know it isn't the typical purging

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:48.440
 kind of laxative if the imodin if the cascara isn't properly aged right it

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:56.280
 does have an irritating purging effect but aging makes it insoluble in water

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:02.880
 comparatively and it loses the irritating inflammatory property and

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.360
 becomes anti-inflammatory and sedative and it actually increases the production

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:17.240
 of energy while having a nerve calming sedative effect. And this again is that

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.640
 red compound that you've mentioned in the past that has been is

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:28.480
 energetically favorable in terms of its both electron quenching activity and its

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:37.360
 anti-inflammatory activity? Yeah as sort of a sideline to my research in graduate

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:47.000
 school on what causes oxidative metabolism to go down with aging I would

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.080
 look for all kinds of plant and animals that were colored and do extracts and

00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:00.920
 look for things that stimulated oxidative metabolism and I got the

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:08.120
 interest partly from St. Georgie's work he found that the the color of cells is

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:14.080
 closely connected to the oxidative process for example the deep maroon or

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:20.360
 purple color of the liver and certain areas of the brain are deeply pigmented

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:27.240
 he knew that it didn't have any the usual functions of pigment and he found

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:37.160
 that it was related to well he knew that semiconductors are generally black

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:43.240
 because of a peculiar electronic arrangement that causes them to absorb

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:50.120
 all the light that hits them and he figured that the life process involves

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:57.400
 semiconduction and so pigments are especially relevant to the use of energy

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:04.080
 and living things. That's right I mean in terms of transporting electrons from

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.880
 one phase to another and therefore carrying either electrical charge

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:17.560
 as a form of energy. Yeah I think last month we were talking about methylene

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:30.440
 blue an artificial electron transporter and it can like vitamin C vitamin C in

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:37.360
 this normal form isn't a pigment but it has some of the same electronic

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:45.480
 behaviors both of those can pick up electrons from nutrients such as glucose

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:53.880
 and pass them into the mitochondrion even if the first two units of the

00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:01.600
 mitochondrion are damaged methylene blue and vitamin C and probably many other

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:10.160
 natural pigments can deliver energy electrons down to the third complex of

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.560
 the mitochondrion and allow it to keep function functioning even after a

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:22.760
 serious damage and so part of that function is to stop producing free

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.280
 radicals which are mostly produced in the upper part of the electron transport

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:35.680
 chain as it's being damaged. Okay so getting on to the kind of wider topic

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.400
 of you are what you eat I think probably just to bring out some of those things

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.880
 that you mentioned for many different conditions or processes that can be

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:53.680
 corrected by various I mean you prescribe a lot of dietary advice in

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.880
 terms of modulating the way people's physiology is working and therefore

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.520
 bringing people back to good health in a very natural way with no side effects

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.480
 it's not a drug orientated approach as very nutritional and I know obviously

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.160
 you're very keen on saturated fats as opposed to the polys and the poly

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:22.040
 unsaturated being very detrimental to health obviously sugar I know you talk a

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.800
 lot about fruit juices and fructose in particular as an energy promoter in

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:34.240
 terms of you are what you eat the the gut bacteria and the bacteria within the

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:40.960
 bowel and what do you know from the studies that have been done on

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:48.960
 the mood for example and or autism in children that have have shown some

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:54.120
 definite correlation between gut bacteria and their intestinal flora and

00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:01.560
 the intestinal flora in populations that are not suffering with autism and how how

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.840
 I think in the future perhaps the the antibiotics that are very useful and I

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.680
 know you're an advocate of antibiotics and I know most people unfortunately

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.440
 have a mistaken belief that antibiotics are bad I think just from the cases

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.760
 where maybe females are getting thrush after using antibiotics it conjures up

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.040
 this kind of popular myth or popular notion that antibiotics are bad but

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.120
 actually we know that they're very positive influences on our physiology

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.160
 and especially on our gut for wiping out bad bacteria but what's your thought

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:42.280
 about altering the so-called microbiome of the body so that specific bacteria

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.560
 that are known to be detrimental to health can be eradicated and leaving the

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.080
 positive bacteria behind to actually influence the populations within the

00:23:53.080 --> 00:24:02.140
 digestive tract about 1990 I read an article from a fertility clinic in which

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:10.720
 a lot of the women were trying to conceive and the fertilized ovum just

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:18.360
 wouldn't implant and the doctors thought that might indicate that there was an

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.080
 infection in the uterus so they gave all of their patients a course of

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:32.200
 antibiotics and besides improving their fertility a lot of the patients said

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.320
 suddenly that their chronic headaches had disappeared and so they gave them

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:44.760
 hormone tests to see what was going on and causing both fertility to improve

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.600
 and headaches and other symptoms to disappear they found that the

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:56.760
 antibiotics had lowered their cortisol and estrogen production and increased

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:05.960
 progesterone their serum explaining the increased fertility but a whole range of

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:13.960
 other symptoms related to stress and following reading about that I suggested

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:22.840
 that because I knew that the estrogen which is excreted by a healthy liver in

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:31.720
 the vial is much of it is reabsorbed and stays in the circulation if you have a

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:38.360
 sluggish intestine and so I suggested that if they eat a carrot every day to

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:45.240
 stimulate the intestine the carrot will bind the vial and lower the serum

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:51.680
 estrogen level that's now generally accepted that any fiber tends to lower

00:25:51.680 --> 00:26:01.120
 your absorption of estrogen from the vial and within three or four days these

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:06.400
 people tested their estrogen cortisol and progesterone and it was doing the

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:13.920
 same thing that the synthetic antibiotics had done and knowing about

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:19.560
 carrots and they can get very tiresome if you eat one of these for years I looked

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:25.160
 around for other foods that were antiseptic yeah I'd have that same

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:32.480
 effect and bamboo shoots are something that you don't get too tired of they

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.960
 don't have much flavor so you can put them in a lot of different foods and

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.080
 cooking a bamboo shoot doesn't destroy the fiber the way it cooked carrot does

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:50.320
 so you have to eat raw carrots or cooked bamboo shoots. Do you know of any other fibers Dr. Peate that have that effect?

00:26:50.320 --> 00:27:04.040
 Mushrooms I think. Mushrooms? Yeah because they grow underground in a very decaying environment they have to have powerful

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:10.200
 antibiotics. Interesting do you not okay I suppose you surprise me when you say

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.680
 mushrooms because I wouldn't have thought that would have been naturally

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.680
 one thing that you would have said to someone would be okay to eat but you're

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:22.360
 I don't know anything about mushrooms actually but except that principle yeah

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:28.320
 they are okay antiseptic and okay they have a high value protein and the

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:33.760
 protein happens to be pretty low in methionine which is the most toxic of

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:42.520
 the amino acids. Methionine are the amino acids that most slow your metabolism and

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:50.800
 so you're getting two of the metabolic stimulants lowering the estrogen

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.080
 disinfecting your intestine. Okay hold it there Dr. Peate for a moment because we do I

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.880
 think we have one or two callers on the air so let's start let's just start with

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.920
 the first caller and see where we're going with this. Caller you're on the air

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:08.960
 and where you from? Hello is this me? Yes you're on the air where you from? Hey I'm

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.320
 from Eastern Oregon. Eastern Oregon okay welcome to the show. Well thank you thank

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:19.120
 you for having me I just have a question the last month I developed very very

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.360
 high blood pressure that spikes very high and I don't have it running my

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:30.160
 family and I never had it before I had normal and what I did is about two months

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:37.320
 ago I had increased had my t3 medicine increased a little bit and I got heart

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.600
 palpitations okay so I was titrating down off of that for over a period of

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.040
 six weeks and I still had the heart palpitations until I went to nothing and

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.640
 then I heard your show last month and I started magnesium and the heart

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.920
 palpitations went away. Yeah we Dr. Peate mentioned that didn't he for

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:01.320
 palpitations. Yeah thank you so much but my but I also in October went on a silly

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.160
 little thing where I was trying to increase my body temperature because even

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:13.640
 with the thyroid supplement it still is kind of low okay and I heard that if you

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:19.360
 eat a lot of more sugar and salt and high dense foods that you can do that so

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.960
 I increased my salto quite a bit and I wasn't worried because I always have

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.320
 low blood pressure medium low you know normal oh my and then and then over this

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.840
 last month my blood pressure has just skyrocketed and it was kind of scary and

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:40.320
 I went to the doctor now I'm on medicine but I was wondering could could coming

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:46.960
 down off of the thyroid which I went back on and and also that high salt diet

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.640
 could that have contributed to this really crazy high blood pressure. Well

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.120
 first the first thing's first let's just how much salt were you using? Quite a bit

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.680
 I just poured on everything and just throughout the day I don't I never

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:09.360
 measured it or anything quite a bit. Yeah. More than I normally did. Yeah. My guess is maybe

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.400
 three or four thousand milligrams that like almost like two days worth in one

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.800
 day I did that for a couple three weeks and I stopped. Okay.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:30.480
 Was your TSH measured as part of the thyroid exam? When I first was on I've

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.680
 been on T4 for six months and when they first started it it was like three but

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.800
 then it went down to below zero yeah it's like point zero three or something

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:50.960
 it's way low. TSH causes a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism and so a T3

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:59.400
 will cause your T4 to go down and if it goes too low your TSH might come up and

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:07.840
 TSH does a lot of things that go with hypothyroidism including high blood

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:15.400
 pressure it makes your red cells more rigid your blood and serum more viscous

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:25.560
 and it tightens up small blood vessels everything it does tends to create higher

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:37.120
 blood pressure so if your TSH is currently extremely low then you

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:44.640
 probably should have your other hormones such as adrenaline checked to see what

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:50.680
 might be causing that. Dr. Peat you always advocate a TSH as close to zero

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.040
 as possible just because it's a fairly inflammatory chaperone molecule anyway

00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:02.600
 don't you? Yeah. Yeah so it's a caller your right your question has if you if

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:08.720
 you understood the answer or? Well I'm from what I understand is that my THC

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.920
 if it gets pretty low as a T3 you'll make it lower and if you increase okay I

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.680
 think I got mixed up I'm sorry so something about the TSH that extra T3

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.920
 can cause it to start rising up again or am I incorrect? Yeah if you had lowered

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:32.960
 your TSH by taking fairly large amounts of T4 thyroxine. It was 25

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:39.720
 micrograms. Oh well that isn't very much. No but it was still low it got low under

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:49.160
 one it got it became 0.03 or 0.04 it was really low and then I and then they and

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:54.440
 then several months later I they incorporated T3 at 25 and I cut it in

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.320
 fours and spread it throughout the day and I've done really well and that went

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.000
 on for a month and then they increased it another 25 which we made it 50 and I

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.680
 split those throughout the day and in fours and then lo and behold I started

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.040
 having heart palpitations at night and all these other symptoms and so I

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.120
 titrated down and I don't know I went to the doctor because I was a little

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.040
 frightened and they said they checked my thyroid and they said it's fine but you

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:28.640
 know I know that numbers their numbers might not be optimal. Were the other

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:35.000
 things like albumin and blood sugar okay? They didn't say I don't know I don't

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.800
 know I suppose I can find out and they probably have the record so I can find

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.240
 out about the albumin. They didn't say they said all my lab was fine what they

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:54.880
 said. Do you get a fairly balanced diet like with milk and cheese and eggs? Yes I

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.440
 stopped doing that silly little thing I did for three weeks there with the extra

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.360
 with the high dense different kind of eating and prior to that and since then

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:12.080
 I I drink milk a quart and a half or so and organic fresh squeezed orange juice

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:25.640
 quart and plus and and cheese and eggs yeah and and Great Lakes gelatin. Is

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.920
 there anything that might be irritating your digestive system sometimes that

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:37.440
 can cause stress and increase pressure? No but do you think that maybe

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.720
 that they may say that my numbers are fine and maybe they may not be as

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:51.640
 optimal as they could be like the TSH and I'm sorry what numbers did you ask?

00:34:51.640 --> 00:35:03.640
 It's good to have albumin well above 40 okay and blood glucose anywhere 70 to

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:13.160
 110 should be okay yeah and potassium and sodium should be around the middle

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:19.120
 of the scale. Okay well they put me on medicines and now I'm on medicine so I'm

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.360
 a little leery about it but it was pretty scary it was up to like 200 and

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:29.800
 over a hundred and then it would kind of go down and then it would fluctuate in

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:35.200
 between that. Yeah sounds a lot like an alarm reaction a stress-related alarm

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:40.760
 reaction of adrenaline producing that kind of blood pressure because a thyroid

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.120
 what do you think about thyroid hormone Dr. Peat and blood pressure I mean it's

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.960
 actually a regulator of high blood pressure when people get high blood

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:54.560
 pressure generally they are subject to adrenaline and that other sympathetic

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.160
 you know hormones that drive blood pressure up and thyroid hormones

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.880
 specifically antagonizes that and brings blood pressure down into it.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:10.160
 Especially when it comes on quickly like that it's adrenaline or maybe

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.760
 serotonin the reason I asked about any irritating food if you don't dissolve

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:22.000
 the gelatin thoroughly sometimes that can cause gas and irritation by feeding

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.440
 bacteria in the intestine. I don't dissolve it I kind of put it in my

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:31.000
 orange juice and stir it and cold orange juice and drink it that way so I don't

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.080
 like cook it or anything. I mix it in with the orange juice but I don't

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:41.040
 like my stomach's irritated but I don't know maybe it is and I don't know it I

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.960
 don't feel like it's causing gas but I thought if I started back up on the T3

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:54.320
 like I had and I've been on it for several weeks maybe three weeks now that

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.680
 maybe eventually it would normalize the blood pressure is that a possibility?

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:06.880
 Is your pulse rate about where it was? About where it was prior to all this?

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:15.680
 Is it in the range of 70 to 90? Yeah it's always been around around that

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:25.880
 more towards the 70. Yeah it hasn't my pulse hasn't changed too much. Magnesium and

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:33.240
 calcium are two nutrients that help to lower blood pressure but potassium is

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:41.560
 probably the most powerful. Orange juice is a very good source of potassium so a

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.680
 quart of orange juice spread out through the day. Okay. Not a potassium. I'm taking extra

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.320
 magnesium since that helps with the palpitations and I drink lots of milk

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:59.040
 and orange juice. And one other nutrient that can powerfully lower blood

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:06.120
 pressure is vitamin K. For example the drops that deliver one milligram of

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:15.160
 vitamin K per drop. I know a doctor who for several months had his blood

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:25.400
 pressure had been 240 over 140 no 240 over 70 and within two or three weeks of

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:34.840
 using a lot of vitamin K his pressure came down to 140 over 70. Okay. So vitamin

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:40.400
 K in terms of a daily a daily trial of vitamin K what do you think would be a

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:47.880
 reasonable? Well that doctor who got such extreme results was taking 40 or 50

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:55.000
 milligrams per day. Right 40 or 50 drops of that. Yeah. Okay. Okay all right I wrote

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.960
 all this down thank you so much. I also too though there they put me on

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:07.320
 medicine now and I'm on lisinopril plus diuretic with it. So that might kind of

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.720
 add to the mix now somehow I'm sure probably. Yeah I'm sure I'm sure the it

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.640
 will be difficult to tell what your proper blood pressure was all the time

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.160
 you're using something like lisinopril. Yeah I just started it I just started

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.300
 that well last two weeks and now they add and it didn't help and so now they

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.720
 added it with a diuretic. I don't know I didn't know what to say. You know it

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.960
 definitely sounds something more than anything to do with your thyroid that

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.200
 you've been using because it's definitely very very short and very

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.680
 quick to come on you know it's a very rapid onset so as Dr. Peat was saying

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.800
 it's much more much more indicative of something hormone or a catecholamine

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:57.560
 based that would have a such a rapid onset. Okay yeah it's probably a little

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.040
 bit outside of the scope of this talk show just a comment on this any further

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.240
 though but I appreciate your call. Thank you so much I appreciate you you too

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.360
 thank you. You're welcome. Okay so what other callers we have the next caller

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:19.540
 you're on the air where you from? Missouri. Okay hi go ahead. Hello this is

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.920
 David from Missouri. Yeah go ahead David I didn't I think we got some

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.200
 interference between you. Yeah well you know just so you know normally you would

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.140
 be able to hear the radio show when you're waiting on the phone and it's not

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.680
 doing that so I had to listen to that. Unfortunately there's some hum here in

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.200
 the studio that I can hear and whenever the lights flashing I also hear that too

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:45.680
 so I think there's some kind of it's it's not uncommon unfortunately. That's

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.580
 what I was saying normally you can hear the radio show while you have the phone

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.640
 you know listening to the phone while you're put on hold and you can't do that

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.440
 got it some reason so they're doing something differently. I'm not sure.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.960
 Yeah you know one of the things does listening to the news cause high blood

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.800
 pressure? Quite probably if it's bad news. That was one of the things you didn't

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:13.480
 ask her so I quit listening to the news and my blood pressure went down. There you go.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:23.640
 But anyway you know I've heard for years that coconut oil is anti an antibiotic

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:30.960
 and also antifungal and number one I wanted to ask Dr. Peat if that is true

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:36.920
 and then how would that work if that were the case and then also I think

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:42.480
 along the same lines is you know I've heard him or I shouldn't say him Dr.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:49.680
 Peat I've heard you say that when you eat starch that the starch is able to

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.080
 get into the bloodstream and creates all sorts of problems in capillaries and

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:58.760
 different vessels and that the saturated fat helps to prevent that so how does

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:04.200
 saturated fat help along those lines as well is it somehow coating the bacteria

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:13.520
 and the the molecules of starch? Yeah it slows digestion enough that it keeps

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:21.720
 things in an emulsion that the enzymes have time to start breaking down the

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:32.720
 starch particles. It isn't known exactly why that happens but Gerhardt

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:41.040
 I forgot his name at the moment the man who did the presorption research showed

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.800
 that the starch without fat would immediately in 15 or 20 minutes show up

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.520
 in your bloodstream but with fat it didn't show up in the bloodstream and it

00:42:52.520 --> 00:43:00.720
 probably is because it gives it time to break down a little bit but I think

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:12.040
 the most important effect of the fat is that germicidal action suppressing the

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:19.840
 bacteria that if your digestion is really working right your whole small

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:28.640
 intestine should be sterile free of bacteria and sluggish digestion low

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:35.200
 thyroid people often get bacteria growing all the way up close to their

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:43.160
 stomach and in that case when you eat any starch it feeds the bacteria the

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:53.160
 bacteria produce endotoxin which causes your intestine to produce nitric oxide

00:43:53.160 --> 00:44:03.080
 and serotonin and histamine and the nitric oxide is a very powerful poison

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:10.320
 of oxidative metabolism so the combination of bacteria especially in

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:17.800
 the small intestine and any kind of starch that isn't quickly absorbed in

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:24.160
 your bloodstream is going to feed the bacteria increase the nitric oxide and

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:31.960
 basically poison your respiratory metabolism all through your body many

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:41.440
 years ago people experimenting with germ-free animals their whole life

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:51.760
 they're isolated from bacteria and they have a very healthy life low mortality

00:44:51.760 --> 00:45:02.640
 until extreme old age and they eat about 20 or 30 percent more calories than the

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:13.880
 ordinary germ-burying mice but they are leaner much smaller fat deposits and

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:24.200
 they don't suffer from anxiety and how to explain that it means that the

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:33.160
 bacteria are producing something that poisons your metabolism the George Burr's

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:40.000
 research with the polyunsaturated fats he demonstrated that these fats have a

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.200
 similar poisoning effect on your oxidative metabolism so that without

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:55.960
 them the animals burn 30 to 50 percent more energy without getting fat so the

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:03.040
 possibly polyunsaturated fats are contributing to the nitric oxide

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:09.960
 production but definitely the bacteria eating starch are a major source of this

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:16.800
 anti-metabolic material and you know so is the coconut oil because of the short

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:22.040
 chain and the medium chain possibly better in that action that you just

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:28.720
 described then say butter and no all of that really matter saturated fats are

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.560
 pretty good anti-fungal and antibacterials but I think the the

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:42.040
 shorter chain the athletes foot remedy that kills fungus very efficiently is an

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:52.400
 11 carbon saturated fat or a mono unsaturated and the shorter they are the

00:46:52.400 --> 00:47:02.080
 faster they diffuse and apparently they're they're more active as a toxin

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:08.280
 or antiseptic if they're a little shorter than the steric acid of butter

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:15.640
 but okay so so pop traditionally known as a good antiseptic and that's usually

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:22.960
 made with a steric acid you know dr. Peat based on several things that you've

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:28.000
 recommended I you know I grow different bamboos and so I can't wait till the

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.440
 spring because I'm going to try this soup and I'm just curious what you think

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:35.880
 about it I'm going to use a acne juicer and I'm going to get the juice from

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:44.760
 potatoes and then I was going to cook the bamboo sprouts in there and now that

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.920
 I for some reason I always thought that you didn't think that mushrooms were

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:55.360
 possibly good but I would love to have shiitake mushrooms in that soup and then

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.720
 put plenty of butter and coconut oil and that do you think that's a in some salt

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:05.360
 do you think that's a decent soup I think so but it's really good to make

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.820
 sure you don't get toxic mushrooms well you know I the only thing I grow is

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:16.800
 shiitake which is that is that possibly a good mushroom you know I have to

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.760
 interject here and tell you that the only thing that I'm allergic to is

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.960
 shiitake mushroom I came out in a widespread body rash and I couldn't

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.160
 explain it first time around I thought it was very strange and I've contracted

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.880
 something serious I was seriously worried about it took about four weeks

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:36.520
 for it to resolve and then again about four years later the same thing happened

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.960
 again and I made a connection I made a connection to shiitake mushrooms and as

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:46.160
 you know I'm a I'm a naturopathic doctor and I work with extracts and I make

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.480
 extracts of shiitake mushrooms and the third time around when I was handling

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.960
 shiitake mushroom powder the same thing happened I got a widespread rash over my

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.800
 face and my hands where I'd been not just handling the product but must have

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.800
 breathed some of it in and got it in contact with my face so I find it a very

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:08.440
 allergenic product so I would just put that out there that not just because

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.000
 people were growing them for a while and eating them but I've been trying not to

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.720
 you know consume too many but I've never seen a direct relationship to any kind

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:23.640
 of problems that you know that's the only thing I've ever been reactive to

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:30.200
 you know dr. Peat has talked about Gerald Pollack a few times and I listened

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:34.600
 to an interview recently that I thought might be interesting for everybody he

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:40.760
 was talking about grounding which I think I've mentioned before on a show

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:46.120
 about you like walking barefoot and then the electrons flowing into the body from

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.600
 the earth and one of the things that he was mentioned he said of course there's

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.760
 no scientific studies to validate this but he you know he's really into the

00:49:54.760 --> 00:50:01.040
 idea of structured water and he was saying how walking barefoot and getting

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:07.960
 natural sunlight could very possibly be helping to structure the water in the

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.080
 body I thought that was pretty interesting kind of you know puts a few

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.120
 things that you've been talking about for a while does that make sense at all

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:22.280
 to you dr. Peat well definitely the flow of electrons is the basic thing that

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:30.960
 structures water the when I talk about energy and structure I'm thinking about

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:38.040
 the primarily first of all the fine layers of water adjoining proteins and

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:46.000
 fat in the cells and that's created and maintained by the flow of electrons

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:56.040
 mostly from glucose to oxygen through the various catalysts and when that's

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:02.840
 interrupted when oxygen isn't able to keep pulling the electrons and this is

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:11.160
 this flow of electrons that generates the structure just like if you stir a

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:20.400
 pot of spaghetti all the strings line up in certain direction is what happens

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:27.640
 microscopically the the energy flow generates structure and that has all of

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.080
 the consequences of cell diffusion I didn't mention that he had talked about

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:38.640
 which totally aligns with what you said he said the red wavelengths of light or

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:44.080
 what helped to structure the water which I thought was really interesting Oh a

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:52.200
 German researcher a young guy named Andre summer has been doing extremely

00:51:52.200 --> 00:52:00.680
 interesting research showing exactly that but the red light itself organizes

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:08.440
 the structure of water interesting so I think it's important to do like Adam and

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:14.520
 even and walk naked in the garden in the sunlight okay David I appreciate you

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:22.120
 cool that's a great idea I appreciate you cool but I think we have another one

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.840
 lined up here so best okay thank you best again that's cool thank you I know

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:31.080
 dr. Peat you talk about red light a lot as a free free radical quenching

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:36.960
 substance and anti-inflammatory so yeah and it desorbs nitric oxide from the

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:44.680
 cytochrome oxidase okay somebody called in during that dialogue there and I

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:48.400
 think they've left the question with the engineer so if the question wants to be

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.920
 read out then perhaps we can go from there yeah she was just basically

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.600
 wondering now she said she's 64 years old and wondering about under eye

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.920
 puffiness a 64 year old lady sounds like low thyroid but dr. Peat what do you

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:07.520
 think yeah sometimes low thyroid or something missing in the diet can be a

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:15.680
 factor but most often it's low thyroid with for example if your thyroid is

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:21.400
 chronically low your cholesterol is likely to be chronically above average

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:29.440
 right as a compensation I rate should turn cholesterol into the steroids

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:39.480
 progesterone pregnenolone and DHEA and those should regulate the water and the

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:45.360
 inside outside the cell a balance of water okay I think we have another

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.000
 caller who's just just called in just a moment ago so let's see let's take this

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.080
 next call a caller you're on here and where you from okay let me turn my radio

00:53:53.080 --> 00:54:03.000
 off hang on a second okay I'm from the north coast here okay I had a question

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:12.480
 what do you know about sulfites in wine digestive problems yeah and our wines

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:18.280
 were companies that produce wine required to stay that sulfites are in

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.680
 wine do you know anything about sure yeah it's a labeling recommendation for

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:28.760
 sure and sulfite free wine can be labeled sulfite free other wine that

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:33.880
 isn't normally has to be labeled contains sulfites I know dr. Peat has

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:38.360
 always mentioned that sulfites are very allergenic can cause many different

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:43.880
 symptoms from headache to rash to respiratory disorders but dr. Peat what

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:50.520
 what else do you have to say about so for digestion well it's a potentially

00:54:50.520 --> 00:55:00.320
 very pro-inflammatory and it interferes with the handling of electrons I think

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:08.720
 that's why it is so dangerously allergenic for so many people and I've

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:21.240
 I've had the experience of sulfited wines that gave me a vertigo and extreme

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:27.240
 symptoms for several days which I think were from causing inflammation of the

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:37.000
 intestine okay so just yet how the general the my question refers whether

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.480
 what about messing up a digestive system and causing pain in in digestion that's

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:53.200
 why I'm wondering if it's related to that well red wines contain their own

00:55:53.200 --> 00:56:00.240
 histamine which can cause symptoms in a lot of people

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:08.440
 thanks a lot okay you're welcome okay well I'd I'd stop right there dr. Peat

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.840
 and just thank you so much for spending your time again this month with the show

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:20.200
 I just want to let people know how to find out more information about you okay

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.920
 thanks so much okay well thanks to the callers that have called in and yeah

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:31.440
 again there's certainly more scope for expanding the discussion on you are what

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:36.880
 you eat dr. Raymond Peat's website has a wealth of information where people can

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.960
 find lots of articles that are fully referenced scientific articles his

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:51.840

 solstice the darkest time of the year Christmas is coming up I hope everybody

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:29.080
 here is paying attention to what it is they're gonna eat over Christmas lots of

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:33.920
 hopefully no polyunsaturates hopefully people are cooking with butter and

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:39.480
 animal fats and making sure that what you eat is organic again like I said you

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:46.800
 know you are what you eat and the food chain is an extremely toxic product the

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.160
 whole food industry is extremely permeated with lots of different

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.560
 chemicals now that make food not what it used to be so when people say it's not

00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.800
 like my grandmother used to cook that's because she was cooking with real food

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:03.480
 and unfortunately a lot of our food now is not particularly real so yeah always

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:09.600
 eat organic source and support organic production and watch what you eat until

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:15.280
