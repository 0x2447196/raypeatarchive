00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.560
 Hello everyone, I'm Danny Rade of DannyRade.com,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.040
 and today I'm talking with painter, philosopher, biologist, Raymond Peat.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.160
 In this hour-long episode, we'll talk about the creation of the CIA

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.040
 and its primary role in shaping the U.S. culture

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.840
 through painting, music, language, literature, economics, philosophy, religion,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 social activism, and politics.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840
 In addition to thanking Ray for talking with me today,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 I'd like to thank my patrons for making this show and all of the content I produce possible.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160
 If you would like to become a patron, please go to patreon.com/dannyrade.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.280
 As always, please do your own research and come to your own conclusions,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.640
 and in the spirit of William Blake, the true method of knowledge is experiment.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.240
 Without further ado, here's the show.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:09.360
 [Music]

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.920
 I feel like I just like crammed for a test.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.600
 [Laughter]

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.120
 But I've been, I read your newsletter, I read the article, I forget his name, Paul Grain.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.440
 I've read like a few people distilling down that book because I couldn't get a hold of it.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.600
 I read the David Talbot book and I kind of reviewed through that.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.880
 And then I found like a list of CIA atrocities, which was mind-blowing.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.400
 And then you talking about the Indonesian genocide,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.520
 I had no idea that's what the act of killing and the sound of silence were about.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 And I mean, I knew it was the general idea, but I didn't put it together.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.560
 And those movies made like a huge impact on me a few years ago.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.960
 And so I was pretty shocked.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.160
 And so I guess like starting things off, I guess it might be interesting

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.880
 to get your current read on the political situation, because for me,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 that was the thing that got me interested in exploring the past.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 Like how did we end up here?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.040
 And your newsletter, specifically when you said that the CIA was,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.560
 I have like a glare on my screen here,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.440
 they were treating the world like an orchard, fertilizing some trees,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080
 pruning others and removing unwanted trees and weeds.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.240
 That was just really interesting to me.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.480
 And so I was like, okay, well, if you go back in the past,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.960
 maybe you can figure out how we got here.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.920
 And so I guess your general thoughts on like free speech, this left-right thing,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.560
 the media and like race tensions and it being more interesting coming from you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.080
 because you've lived through Vietnam, civil rights, et cetera.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.200
 - I think that the place you decided to start it is sort of arbitrary.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.640
 My consciousness started early during the Roosevelt time.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.800
 Are you aware?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.760
 - Well, I was gonna ask you, I was gonna get your general thoughts

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.440
 on the current situation and then jump right back into like Pearl Harbor.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.600
 But we can start, do you wanna go with Pearl Harbor first

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.840
 or go from the place that you wanted to go?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.160
 - Well, one perspective I have that sort of brings things up to the present.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.160
 If you look at the coup against FDR in 1933 and '34,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.800
 as described to Congress by a Schmedley Butler,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.040
 they went basically quiet for several years.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.400
 The coupists, the great corporations of the country

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.040
 that wanted to get rid of Roosevelt

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.160
 because he was committing treason to their class,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.160
 they thought, they went quiet and focused on Harry Truman in the late 1930s

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.560
 as their guy who they put in place finally in 1944.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.400
 And then as I see it, they opportunely killed Roosevelt

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.680
 just before he found out what Allen Dulles was doing with the Nazis.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.240
 And so they had Truman in place when they shifted over to the Nazi Dulles side.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.120
 And during that time, Fletcher Prouty during the Second World War

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.240
 was involved in a lot of the secret plans going on in Asia.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.720
 And he tells a little about that in his book, "The Secret Team,"

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.680
 which refers to the sort of privately operated CIA

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.680
 as related to Nixon and the Kennedy assassination.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.160
 And along this stretch of time, you have people like Ted Shackley

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.360
 and Ronald Reagan getting put in place

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.960
 with the assistance of George G. H. W. Bush and the October surprise,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.640
 you know, where he went to Paris, I think, was to make deals with the Iranians

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.280
 for them not to release the hostages until they got Jimmy Carter out of office.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.400
 On the airplane to Paris with Bush,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.960
 as high officials that everyone knew who was there,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.560
 Senator John Hines and John Tower, conservative right-wing Republicans,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.280
 were on that same flight.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.480
 And several years later, on successive days, April 4 and April 5 of '91,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.040
 they both died in airplane crashes.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.960
 And people who were in a position to know what George Sr.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.880
 and his associates were doing all came to bad ends.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.160
 Nixon and Schlesinger got put out through Watergate

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.240
 and Carter got put out by various manipulations,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.840
 such as the October surprise.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.600
 And all of these things interact.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.880
 And periodically, someone starts to string the pieces together

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.880
 and they very thoroughly get wiped out as far as anything taken seriously goes.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.880
 Like, do you know about Daniel Sheehan and the Christchurch Institute?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.360
 - No.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.640
 - He did a lot of putting together

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.320
 and sued the government for murder and assassination and such.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.440
 And even though he had the evidence together,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.040
 his organization was destroyed because the judge said it was frivolous.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:46.800
 And he had to pay all of the legal expenses and that bankrupted his organization.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800
 - Is this along the same lines?

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.120
 Is when I was looking at the JFK stuff, and I'm skipping super far ahead here,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.360
 but they said Edward J. Epstein was one of the biggest critics.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.480
 And the idea was that the CIA had enough fortitude,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.440
 I don't know the right word,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.760
 but they were saying they set up their critics,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.480
 set up opposition to the ideas so that it would be controlled, basically, afterwards.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.600
 - Yeah, I quoted, I think it was Braden, was it, who said,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.680
 he called it his mighty whirlature that could play any tune he wanted.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.440
 And their best loudspeakers were at Washington Post and New York Times.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.200
 And Washington Post was one of the most effective

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.560
 in wiping out people like Krystic Institute.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.120
 - And that's Operation Mockingbird, they call it?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.120
 - Oh, yeah, that was one of its time names.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.600
 But basically, it's just what they do.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.320
 - When I was reading David Talbott's book, he said, like, Henry Luce, the time-life guy,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.520
 was so interconnected to everybody.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.760
 And these major news outlets just had hardcore agendas,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.840
 and were all being manipulated by Dulles, basically.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.400
 - Oh, yeah, they're all the same people.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.160
 The CIA guys were recruited from among those.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.840
 It's like the scum of the ruling class.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.240
 - Okay, stepping back a little bit,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.840
 you had mentioned a few times that you thought, like,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.920
 the culture had changed in 1947.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.000
 And so I thought it was interesting that that coincided with the creation of the CIA.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.440
 And I guess if you wanted to unpack that and talk about that a little bit,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.720
 that would be awesome.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:30.960
 - Yeah, the 1944 Democrat Convention, I knew several people who were there.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:38.720
 And they stayed just furiously bitter for 50 years afterwards about what happened.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.560
 Fake tickets were printed up for people who had never been in the election,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.280
 and the real delegates were shut out.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.960
 So it was a completely funny convention that chose Truman to be the next president.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.280
 - Who do you think was behind that?

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.160
 - That same group that started the coup in '33 and '34,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.360
 just the top, Morgan and DuPont were the only names that I recall.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.760
 But it was the top powers in the corporations.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.160
 They got Truman in position,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.960
 and then Dulles had been a Nazi finance agent,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.920
 but between the banks and the corporations of Germany, Rockefeller and Farben.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.440
 So he was a buddy with all of the top Nazis.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.240
 And he was in Switzerland dealing with the Nazis,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.120
 arranging for them not to fight the Americans coming up the Italian peninsula,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.640
 so that they could go hold off the Russians

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.480
 to keep the Russians from getting all the way through Germany.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.520
 And Stalin, through his spies, found out what was going on

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.000
 in the first week or two of April of 1945.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.240
 And Roosevelt said, "Maybe Stalin is losing it

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.040
 because this couldn't be happening.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:13.760
 Stalin must be making it up that Dulles is letting the German-Italian branch of the army

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.440
 head to the Eastern Front."

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.720
 And before FDR found out that, in fact, Stalin was right, he was dead.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.960
 And if he had found out, that would have revealed

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.640
 that Dulles was leading a pro-Nazi army, basically,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.480
 dealing with the Galen Intelligence Organization and the top army people

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.360
 to unite the Americans with the Nazis against Russia,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.920
 to hold them off so that they could keep control of Western Europe.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.120
 And so the whole denazification thing in Germany was fraudulent.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.600
 They just changed their party labels.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:11:00.480
 And as many of the technical people as possible were brought into the US,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.920
 Werner von Braun for the rockets and such.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.760
 And instead of denazifying Germany, the US was nazified.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.440
 >> You were actually there.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.720
 Were there any people saying, like, "What is going on?

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.040
 How are these Nazis being brought over here?"

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.760
 Was anybody asking those questions, or was the press just not doing its job?

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:29.360
 >> Almost no one was concerned that they said they were denazified, so they're okay.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.800
 They were really the good underground Nazis.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:41.600
 And the Nazi reality never sank in, the thing of Conrad Lorenz getting the Nobel Prize.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.040
 He was the architect of genocide.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:57.840
 And even in his post-Nobel book, he kept using all of the ideas that he had presented to Hitler

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:05.680
 as the reason for exterminating Black people, gypsies, Jews, Slavs.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:14.800
 All of the people that got killed wholesale were justified by the specific things that

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.400
 Conrad Lorenz wrote, and he kept writing them.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:25.280
 But instead of saying, I forget what the German word was, but in his newer book, he said

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:33.040
 something less intense than extirpated, something like milder, like weeded out.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:39.040
 I don't remember the exact language, but it was just slightly milder than genocide.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.000
 >> It reminds me of Obama getting the Nobel Peace Prize for dropping bombs for eight years.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.920
 >> [Laughter]

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.400
 Okay, so 1947, the creation of the CIA under Truman.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:58.640
 President Truman signs the National Security Act of 1947, and that gives no rules to the CIA.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.760
 >> By that time, he knew who Alan Dulles was, if he had any brain at all.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:13.760
 That whole thing became fairly public, except it didn't get to Roosevelt in time to save his life.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.040
 >> I might have missed it, but why was it necessary to kill Roosevelt?

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:25.200
 >> Well, because Dulles and his people were all committing horrible treason and setting up the

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.440
 Cold War, setting up Europe to make war against Russia.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:36.000
 >> And if Stalin was aware of everything that was going on, was there no way for him to

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.240
 penetrate the propaganda that would be coming or was happening?

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.240
 >> No.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:49.440
 >> No, because the jukebox was being operated by Dulles and his people.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.080
 >> And that's the Congress for Cultural Freedom, or that's just one aspect of it?

00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:00.800
 >> Well, yeah, and radio stations and the great newspapers, and 95% of the newspapers

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:07.280
 followed Washington Post and New York Times. There were only three newspapers that were

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.040
 known for being independent, and they weren't very independent. It was the,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:20.960
 what were they, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Medford Mail Tribune, and the Alcohol in

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:30.720
 California Valley News. Three little newspapers that had a worldwide reputation for being

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.000
 independent out of thousands of papers in the US.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.360
 >> Francis says, whether they liked it or not, whether they knew it or not,

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.800
 there were few writers, poets, artists, historians, scientists, or critics in post-war Europe whose

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.480
 names were not in some way linked to this covert enterprise. And she was referring to

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.800
 Congress for Cultural Freedom.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.600
 >> Yeah.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.240
 >> So, like, even if you didn't know you were part of this cabal, you were actually

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.360
 part of it, basically?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:03.520
 >> Yeah, the pressures, like if all of the newspapers and radio stations and foundations

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:11.360
 in the US said it was criminal to think otherwise, if you had other opinions, you were just quiet

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.080
 because everyone around you seemed crazy.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.400
 >> Did you just keep your thoughts to yourself at that time?

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:25.280
 >> No. No, I was in the seventh grade in a social studies class. I had done things like

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:32.000
 the seventh grade boys were supposed to spend their recess time cleaning the grounds,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.720
 picking up papers and such. And I put up posters showing a reclining gopher and organized the

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:49.760
 loafer gophers instead of the eager beavers, which they called us, and got scolded for that.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:58.400
 And then in the social studies class, a kid who, he was just kind of a goofy, nice kid,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:09.840
 asked Mrs. White, the teacher, "Are they going to kill Raymond Peete for being a communist,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.520
 if that's the policy?" And she said, "I don't think so. He's a nice little boy."

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.560
 [Laughter]

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:28.480
 >> Oh my God. Okay, so Eisenhower, is he following the same line of being put in the presidency

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.320
 like Truman, or is he like the real deal?

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:41.040
 >> Basically, he was very stupid. But yeah, he was just following the ruling class,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.920
 whatever they said.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.440
 >> And Allen Dulles was CIA director in 1953 under Eisenhower.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:55.200
 >> Yeah. And Eisenhower came out by witness many years later that he had specifically given orders

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.880
 to kill Patrice Lumumba.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.440
 >> I was going to ask you about that. Sorry, go ahead.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:07.200
 >> And at the time, I was considering both Eisenhower and Kennedy, who had been elected by

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:14.240
 that time, as having been involved, Kennedy should have been, as President-elect, he should have been

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:20.800
 aware of what was happening because I was just reading the newspapers, following everything day

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:32.640
 by day. And I started right out being very negative towards Kennedy. And so just a few months, I

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.440
 think two or three months later was when Dog Hommerschuld was killed in a plane crash. I figured

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:47.200
 that Kennedy must have been responsible because it was right in his administration, under his

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:56.160
 direct authority, that the CIA was there in charge of things. And Dog Hommerschuld had been

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:03.200
 facilitating the imperialists in the Congo, the Belgian, British and American agents were there.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:10.000
 And pretty much Hommerschuld was just doing what they wanted. But after Patrice Lumumba was killed,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.800
 Hommerschuld suddenly started being even-handed. And he was going to arrange peace discussions

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.480
 between the two sides. And that was when he got killed. And so it was obviously an assassination.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.080
 - I want to get to Dog Hommerschuld and also George Day Morenschild. Do you want to set up

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:34.080
 just your thoughts on the antagonism between JFK and Dulles? Like, I'm confused how somebody like

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.520
 that even got into office, if I guess they hated him so much. So like, the idea that everything is

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.400
 totally pre-selected is false. There's some -

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:52.880
 - Well, Kennedy's point was to go after Eisenhower and Nixon for being weak on communism. And he said

00:18:52.880 --> 00:19:00.960
 he would lead a great military buildup, which he did. And so he was the militarist's candidate.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:07.120
 He said that Eisenhower had let him in on the fact that they were going to invade Cuba.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:15.440
 And part of his militarism was saying, "Eisenhower has let Castro get away with

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.960
 everything. We'll go after Castro." And so he was the right-wing extremist in that election.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.400
 And that really annoyed Nixon because Nixon had told him what they were going to do,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.480
 and Nixon couldn't say, "Wait, we're already planning that."

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.800
 So Kennedy was basically a rat for bad reasons.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:47.280
 - Okay, so that conflicts with, I guess, just my - it always sounds like, at least from David Talbot

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:52.000
 and some of the other things, like that JFK was like anti-war, or that he was like a reasonable

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.040
 kind of person, but I really have no idea.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.360
 - Another thing that annoyed me, he might really have been upset over the Hommershuld killing

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:08.320
 because of what Hommershuld had in mind for Indonesia, which was to make Sukarno a puppet

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:18.400
 of US rather than leaving it with Netherlands. Or Kennedy had his way of controlling Indonesia

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:26.160
 without the formality of colonialism. But despite whatever relative good he saw for Indonesia,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:34.720
 he was still thinking imperialism and twice he talked to his ambassador to Brazil asking if it

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:43.120
 was basically time to do a coup yet against Joao Goulart, and the ambassador said when the time

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:46.880
 was opportune, but there was nothing urgent right then.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.120
 - Paul Greene describes some plot where they discovered some mineral that they wanted and then

00:20:53.760 --> 00:21:00.000
 Dulles was friends with George Morinshult, and do you want to help me out here?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.760
 - Yeah, neither Kennedy nor Hommershuld nor just about anyone in the world knew about

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:16.000
 neither the high-quality oil or the gold and what was the other, golden copper, I guess,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:24.160
 were the two huge deposits in Indonesia. The Dulles, Morinshult people had been secretive

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:30.720
 about that, so none of the authorities knew about it because they wanted to get the Dutch out before

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:37.680
 they let it become public. The Dutch companies would have taken over, but the Rockefeller people

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.440
 bought up the properties and I think they still own it through a Phoenix-based company.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.560
 - Okay, so under the guise of anti-communism, the CIA overthrows the democratically elected

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:54.000
 Sukarno with a military coup. The CIA has been trying to eliminate Sukarno since 1957,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.200
 using everything from attempted assassination to sexual intrigue for nothing more than declaring

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:06.560
 his neutrality in the Cold War, and according to Paul Greene or an article that was about his book,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:13.280
 he said that Sukarno not siding with Dulles enraged him. And if you weren't against, like

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.880
 the Bush thing, like if you're not with us, you're against us kind of deal.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:24.480
 - Yeah, that was all it was with Joao Goulart in Brazil. Kennedy said that he's looking

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.480
 slightly neutral. We'll have to get rid of him right away or later.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.360
 - But when I read the list of atrocities through the CIA, it seemed just like bonkers,

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:45.440
 like that somebody is going to all these different areas, putting in their person, and it seemed -

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.400
 - They had the morality of Adolf Hitler with more brains.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:23:00.000
 - But I guess, do you see Dulles as the person driving all of these different things? Because

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.040
 it seems like it would take somebody like pretty, I don't know, it just seems so, I mean,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.520
 from an outsider looking in, it seems so complex how to manage all of these different

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.360
 like regime changes basically.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:22.080
 - I think you have to visualize the ruling class and how it works. It has these upper levels of

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:30.320
 academics and political lawyers for the big corporations are basically working like secretaries

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:39.040
 of state and intelligence agency heads and such. So there's a whole crop of these very well-informed

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:48.640
 people at the heart of both economic and political affairs. And so they're like a worldwide sort of

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:56.480
 course mesh, only a few hundred people on that level sitting on top of thousands of corporations,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:04.480
 maybe 3 million or so ruling class people in America and Europe. They already have the power,

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:12.960
 and so the state power is fairly trivial compared to how we think of it. They see the state officials

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.280
 as inconveniences, but not too hard to get rid of.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:24.160
 - Two things. So one, the creation of the CIA gave this, would you use the word oligarchy,

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:31.360
 right? So oligarchy gave like a tool basically through the CIA to do whatever they wanted to do.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.720
 - Yeah, yep.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:38.880
 - And then to put yourself in this type of behavioral pattern, do you see it,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.560
 and you mentioned this in your newsletter, like the Neo-Darwinian marriage with Malthusianism,

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.960
 do you see that as like a type of elite or like power elite religion for them

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.480
 kind of to justify a lot of their crazy actions?

00:24:52.480 --> 00:25:01.040
 - Yeah, the science world is very similar to the finance politics world and has its

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:09.040
 intersections, not very many, but a few of the top science people are closely connected

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:18.000
 to the political power, but it's all the same recognition of power and where they're going

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.720
 and who they want to control for what purposes.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:25.360
 - And then, okay, so we're talking about the Indonesian mass genocide which happened in 1965

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:32.400
 and 1966. Do you want to talk about the interesting connection between Obama and his mom,

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.280
 Ann Dunham, and Lolo and his stepdad, Lolo Sotoro? Am I saying that right?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.400
 - Well, what's his name, this reporter who did the-

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.680
 - Oh, May, let me get his name.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.480
 - Madsen.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.760
 - Madsen, yeah, yeah.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:56.480
 - I think his picture is basically right, that his grandmother was probably connected with the CIA

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:05.040
 as sort of a paymaster for people in the Pacific, and I don't know exactly, but a friend of mine

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:15.600
 was sort of a tool of the Nguyen Hand Bank, which was the CIA funnel from drug weapons money

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:25.440
 in Vietnam and Iran-Contra through the '60s and '70s, that opium and weapons money was handled

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:33.200
 through the Australian and Hawaii, so I assume there's been some interaction between the bank

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:40.480
 that Grandma Obama, what was her name, his maternal grandmothers-

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.000
 - I have it here somewhere.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 - Anyway, the fact is that his mother was doing-

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.680
 - Madeline and Stanley Dunham, sorry.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:01.040
 - Dunham, yeah. She was, I think, a vice president of the bank that was handling CIA money,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:10.800
 but his mother was in that anthropology study, pretty much the anthropology profession

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:20.720
 was serving the CIA, mapping out people to either exterminate or control, basically finding out

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:29.440
 how they talk, like in Mexico and Latin America, it was the Summer Linguistics Institute, which

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:37.040
 codified the native languages and gave them written materials so they could be controlled

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:45.440
 better, learning how to give them instructions, essentially, and anthropology and religious

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:55.360
 missionaries were tied into the CIA to gather information on the populations, and in Indonesia,

00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:02.000
 it happened that the anthropology people were helping make surveys of basically who was to

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.280
 be exterminated by the new government to make sure that they didn't go neutral or favor China.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.600
 - Backing up a little bit, you mentioned opium, and how much of that is involved in the power

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.680
 elite, just like, I guess, funding things? I read a book on, or not, I didn't read, I perused a book

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:28.240
 on Skull and Bones, and they were saying that that whole thing is very tied to the sale of opium,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.360
 and then I didn't read enough before talking to you, but I had read similar things about the CIA,

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.800
 just drugs being very intertwined with everything, basically.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:45.360
 - Yeah, I think it's, they use whatever has force. The religious missionaries are one way of doing

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.920
 it, drugs are another, and just force is another.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.680
 - Okay, so we talked about the Indonesian mass genocide, which, anybody listening,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.520
 The Act of Killing and the Look of Silence by Joshua Oppenheimer, right, have you seen those

00:28:59.520 --> 00:28:59.760
 films?

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.640
 - No, no.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:07.600
 - They're really good. And then in 1966, something that might be interesting, the Ramparts affair,

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:15.920
 like the medical magazine began untangling the nefarious acts of the CIA.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:24.400
 - Some people are saying that the CIA was subsidizing them and promoting them to do

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:34.000
 a partial limited hangout. The facts are so much worse that they want to make it seem that

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.840
 everything has come out, and make people stop looking at the connections. When you start

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:46.080
 putting things together, like even the conservative senators, Heinz and Tower,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:52.240
 having that connection to George Bush and information, it was inconvenient.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:30:01.520
 And then that ties into John Kerry and his investigation of that bunch of episodes,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:11.360
 and why he didn't pursue it. And it shows interconnectedness in government that,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:19.200
 on the surface, it would seem really crazy to connect extreme right-wing senators to extreme

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.760
 left-wing organizations like the Christik Institute. But when you start weaving the

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:30.720
 strings together, you get a thousand parts that fit snugly together, and it starts looking

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.800
 somewhat crazy to say, "No, they can't fit together. That's only a coincidence." You get

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:44.000
 thousands of coincidences snugly organized, and you have to look for a more reasonable explanation.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.960
 The official explanation starts sounding crazy.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.840
 - What year was it when Bush and Kerry ran against each other,

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.880
 and they're both Skull & Bones members? What a coincidence.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.320
 - Yeah.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:03.920
 - Okay. I was interested in a big new Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, and the Trilateral Commission.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:10.960
 - Brzezinski was controlling Carter, basically. Rockefeller was controlling Brzezinski and

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:20.000
 Brzezinski-Carter. And Brzezinski cooked up the thing of getting Saudi Arabia to start

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:32.240
 sending people into Afghanistan with U.S. weapons. The Soviets had set up a secular government in

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:42.000
 Afghanistan with education for women and an actual secular government. Every time a secular government

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:53.840
 is created in the Muslim world, it's as bad as being neutral. And Brzezinski was one example of

00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:03.120
 that, the overthrow of Mossadegh in Turkey. That was their first big anti-secular case. But then

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:12.240
 the most fanatic anti-secularism came when the Soviets had set up a non-religious government

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:19.600
 with basically democratic practices as a way of keeping the U.S. from expanding, hopefully.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:27.600
 You know, the Cuban Missile Crisis had the outcome of the U.S. agreeing to take their

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.720
 rockets out of Turkey, and the Soviets hoped to get another buffer state without rockets in

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:45.120
 Afghanistan. And to prevent that, Brzezinski got the fanatics armed with the best weapons to fight

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:52.880
 the Afghan democracy and then the Soviets who supported it. And that went on until Carter was

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:59.120
 out of office and eventually the fanatics won under extreme support from the U.S.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:32:59.360
 19:50

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.960
 I think it's floating around the internet, but there are articles showing what Afghanistan

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:10.000
 looked like in the 1970s. And to me, I have a poor history background, but it's like unbelievable.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.240
 And it just looks like a 1970s modern people walking around. And then they do like comparative

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.840
 shots to today and it's just like rubble. And also -

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:19.840
 19:59

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.480
 - And the religious extremism was all created by Brzezinski.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:30.880
 - Yeah. And there's like a video of Brzezinski like arming the Mujahideen and just saying some

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:37.920
 of the craziest stuff. Like, "It's your land over there. Like, go fight." And it's just very

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:45.120
 manipulative and weird. And it's bizarre. - Yeah. And they brought the same sort of people

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.280
 into Serbia and took over Kosovo. - Unbelievable. Okay. So,

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:56.240
 it's interesting to me that Brzezinski was so tied to Obama. He was in Obama's inner circle.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:03.360
 Obama talked very highly of him. People that I follow were saying like the hope and change

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:09.520
 candidate was preposterous given who was in Obama's inner circle. But I guess that message

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:14.720
 didn't really get out to that many people. - Yeah. It's the same sort of thing as Hillary

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:23.760
 Clinton praising Henry Kissinger. It really revealed who she really is. And you've heard

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:31.440
 about her newest book in which she explains George Orwell's, the real meaning of 1984.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:37.840
 - I didn't catch that part. No. - She says, "It means we should trust

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:45.760
 our leaders, experts, and the press more." - That reminds me of Mayor Giuliani when he says,

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.400
 "Real freedom is about obeying authority," or something similar to that.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:58.560
 - Yeah, exactly. The meaning of 1984. - Unbelievable. So, maybe this is a good

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.320
 time to start with the beginning question. What's your... Like, having been through so much,

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:11.600
 do you see your sense of how things are? Is this like incomprehensible or like what's happening

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:18.560
 right now? Or is it a logical continuation of things you've been seeing in the works for many

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.520
 years now? That's I guess my question. - The only pleasant thing about it is that

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:30.960
 so many other people are starting to see the loose ends where before if you had, for example,

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:38.080
 an economic theory of why wars were fought, you were either ignorant or crazy or criminal

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:44.160
 or a subversive. But the atmosphere has really changed so that there are lots of people

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.520
 questioning things now that unlike 50 or 60 years ago. - One thing I did think was interesting to

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.160
 your point was I feel like if you talked about the deep state, you would be labeled as a crazy

00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:01.600
 person. And the fact that it is being talked about openly on just regular news is pretty weird, no?

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:09.280
 - Yeah. People always prefer surfaces, but now the surface is being slightly redefined.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:17.760
 But before you could see the surface that the state said it was, it wasn't true that the state

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:25.040
 was really rotten all the way down. And now they analyze it and say, here's the surface and there's

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:33.520
 a deep state. But it's always been just one rotten state. And now people are starting to

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:40.640
 break it down into its parts and seeing the illusion, how it's maintained, how consent

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:46.000
 is manufactured. - Like some of the things you said taken maybe out of context could be probably

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.520
 fuel for a libertarian anti-government view, but do you see just the creation of the CIA

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:56.720
 as becoming a total nightmare as being just the real issue and not necessarily the government per

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:04.800
 se? - No. Like when the people first started separating the CIA from the government was when

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:11.840
 Eisenhower had scheduled peace talks with Khrushchev in Europe and everyone was expecting

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:18.560
 big things of that. And then with Lee Harvey Oswald, a U-2 expert in place in Russia,

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:27.120
 Dulles sent a U-2 plane over Russia, knowing that they had the expert who knew exactly the recipe

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:34.720
 for shooting it down, overcoming their radar defenses. And during the few days before the

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:42.400
 peace talk to send this U-2 biplane over to be shot down, knew that it would sabotage the talks.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:53.040
 Eisenhower knew who Dulles was and still let it shoot down the peace talks. And Eisenhower

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:59.680
 was stupid, but he was also the one who kept Dulles in place and knew how things worked.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:07.920
 So you could say that there were different factions working, but they weren't really

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.600
 separate. They were just slightly inconvenient to each other.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:17.040
 - We glossed over that a little bit, but I did watch a video by a woman named Lisa Pease,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:24.240
 who seemed pretty intelligent. And she was echoed what you just said, saying that Oswald was

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:31.520
 incredibly good at radar and locating those U-2. That was the plan?

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.960
 - Yeah, that was what he was trained for, as well as speaking Russian in Japan.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:43.360
 - But she was spinning the narrative that it was like the official story of the JFK

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:50.000
 assassination just is like completely illogical and doesn't make any sense. And given all of

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.360
 Oswald's alleged CIA ties. - Oh, yeah.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:39:02.400
 The information that has come out, it's a complete fine-grained picture of what was going on in the

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:10.000
 assassination. All of the context fits in who was murdered, what the official story,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.800
 how it was composed, what the function of the Warren Commission was. There's not really any

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.960
 mystery anymore. - In David Talbott's book,

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.760
 "The Devil's Chessboard" is a pretty good summation of that.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.040
 - I haven't read that. - Oh, my fault. I thought you had.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.560
 What is your general thought on Trump? Do you see him as part of this

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:35.600
 oligarchical cabal, or do you see him as like a free agent, or what are your general thoughts on

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.440
 him? - Yeah, I think he's a free agent with

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:49.040
 some good instincts, but also an instinct of preservation, self-interest, and his thing about

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:56.960
 not wanting nuclear war, I think is his basic good impulse, but what can you do with just being

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.240
 president? - Some people were, like when the election

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:05.200
 was happening, when he was meeting with Kissinger, were just like, "Oh, this guy is no good,"

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.880
 basically, because he was aligning himself with those people. Did you think of anything of that?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:19.360
 - No, I think he's insincere about most of what he does. But his two or three

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:27.840
 decent policies, he seemed, over the years, to come up with some insights, like about 20 years

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:36.480
 ago when he suggested having a one-time wealth tax. He said it would cost him, I forget what,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:42.080
 $200 million or something, but he said it would pay off the national debt, and then we'd be

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.560
 almost tax-free from then on. - Interesting. Has he talked about that

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.800
 recently, or that was just an older thing in one of his books?

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.000
 - No, I haven't heard any recent discussion of that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.720
 - Okay, right. I think I've exhausted my notes. Oh, the one thing I did want to talk about that I

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:03.920
 thought was really interesting was Truman saying that the whole creation of the CIA was a mistake

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:10.880
 to his autobiographist, that's a word, Mary Miller in 1973.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.560
 - Mm-hmm. - [Laughter]

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.240
 - Recognizing any of its evil, how could he say otherwise?

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:25.120
 - Yeah, right. Well, he went on and he said, "What I can tell," I don't have the quote in

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.200
 front of me, but he's saying that the CIA makes their own wars, which we've been basically talking

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:36.320
 about for an hour. And also, I think he has a quote saying that they killed Dag Hammarskjöld.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.920
 - Yeah, yep. - Yeah, Dag Hammarskjöld was the point of

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.160
 getting something done when they killed him. Notice that I said, "When they killed him,"

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:50.400
 Truman said that, which is nuts. - Yeah. The testimony, a witness to the

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:57.600
 cabinet meeting where Eisenhower told them to do it, it didn't come out for 50 years after that,

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:04.880
 but everyone knew it at the time. I suppose Truman had much better information than the public.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:10.720
 - And just because I'm looking at it right now, do you have any thoughts on Lyman, the

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.400
 nutty actions of Lyman Levincer, who wrote Operation Northwoods? And I think he was the

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.760
 architect of Operation Gladio. - What about him?

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:26.000
 - I mean, reading through Operation Northwoods is sobering on how crazy things can get.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.040
 - Yeah, but I think that's partly the fault of people who keep records. Usually the most

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:39.280
 disgusting things they do in conversation and don't do stupid things like keeping records.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.680
 - Do you think that was a mistake that they let out? I think that was, like,

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:52.480
 declassified under Clinton or somebody? - Yeah. But even the act of keeping records,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.600
 I'm sure they don't do it with the really vile stuff.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:01.520
 - When I was reading through all this stuff, I was like, "This is like 1% of what's happening,"

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.120
 and I couldn't fathom what else was going on, basically.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:13.760
 - Yeah, and in that situation, people are free to imagine and their imagination can seldom,

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.960
 you know, catch up to what's really happening right now.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:27.280
 - To end on a positive note, I mean, obviously you embody a type of resistance to what's happening

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:34.320
 by giving people good information and trying to let people navigate their own lives. Do you see,

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:39.040
 is this, are things so bad that you don't see them getting better for a long time,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.680
 or do you see some hope? I mean, you were mentioning that people were kind of waking up

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.360
 individually. - Yeah, and if you just get a lot of people

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:56.560
 with some very simple insights, like abuse of power is going to be the rule, so there should

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:06.160
 never be power exercised in private or in secret. Just insist on complete openness,

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:14.880
 and people will just sort of automatically start moving in the right direction, which they won't

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:22.560
 necessarily know until they get a lot of that openness into the culture so that people can

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:29.120
 see where they are, then they can start talking about where they want to go. With the control

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:36.880
 systems through the media and the schools and the legal system, everything is going to have to

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:43.920
 happen outside of all of those channels, and it would have to consist just in some basic insights

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.000
 and suspicions of power. - To your point, James Engleton,

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.760
 CIA counterintelligence head, said in his testimony to the church committee, "It is

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:58.480
 inconceivable that a secret intelligence arm of the government has to comply with all the

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:05.840
 overt orders of the government." That's it for me, Ray. Did you have anything else we

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.560
 glossed over that you thought was important? - Oh, probably. Nothing occurs to me.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:16.080
 - Ray, what are you working on right now? - Oh, I'm an article on milk,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:24.000
 putting milk in cultural context. Milk as a sort of a focus of doing what we're doing here,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.440
 looking at the false assumptions and thinking about how to start rethinking things from a

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.480
 new point. - Awesome. I cannot wait to read it. Ray,

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.120
 you've been so generous with your time. I sincerely appreciate it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:45.200
 Thank you. I'll talk to you soon. - Okay. Fun to talk to you. Thank you.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.960
 - Okay. Bye, Ray. - Bye.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:59.440
 - That's going to conclude this week's episode. I'd like to thank Ray again for talking with me

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.600
 today, along with my patrons for their support of the show and all of the content I produce,

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.080
 none of which would be possible without my patrons. So from the bottom of my heart,

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:14.560
 I sincerely appreciate it. This episode was really fun for me. Sometimes I say I know enough about

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:20.000
 nutrition to know that I don't know anything, and I can't even say that about politics. So it was

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.800
 definitely a learning experience talking with Ray, who is obviously a wealth of information.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:30.560
 Again, it was awesome talking with him, and I'd like to thank him again for just giving me an hour

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:37.280
 of his time and writing a great set of newsletters. And this episode, if you don't know, is based on

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:47.120
 his newsletter. And so you can get his newsletter now by sending, I think, $28 to rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:56.560
 And I think it's $28 for six issues each year. So 12 total over two years. And so, yeah, it's the

00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.200
 best deal on the internet, and you should definitely do that. If you liked this episode and you're

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.680
 listening on YouTube, definitely hit that like button or leave a comment, and I'll try to reply

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:12.080
 to all of them. Thank you guys so much. This was a real fun episode, and I'm glad I got to do it.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:18.320
 I know the content hasn't been as flowing as it usually is. A lot of people know I'm writing a

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:23.040
 book right now. But again, I sincerely appreciate you guys listening. It's always fun to do these

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.000
 things, and I'll talk to you guys very soon. Take care.
