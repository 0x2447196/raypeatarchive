00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Broadcasting worldwide from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Well, a very pleasant good morning to you. This is Patrick Timpone. Happy New Year to you. Happy New Year.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And a very pleasant good morning. We are pre-recorded, so don't call in or send emails. We have plenty of emails.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 All righty, for Ray Peat, PhD in biology, we're going to have fun.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 We've heard a lot about Dr. Peat and his writings and work. First through a nice lady, Lita Lee, several years ago. We had her on.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 And she's a great fan of Ray Peat's work. So she told us about him and we've never been able to get together with Mr. Peat.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 As I said, PhD in biology, University of Oregon, specializing in physiology. He's taught at University of Oregon, Urbana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 University of Arizona in Mexico, I assume, in Mexico a lot. And he began his work with progesterone and hormones in 1968. This will be great.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, how are you, sir? Happy New Year to you.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Very good. Same to you.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Yeah, nice to have you here. You live up in Oregon, Eugene, Oregon.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Yeah, on and off.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 On and off. So you spend time in Mexico?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Yeah.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 And what do you do down there?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Just talk to people, paint.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 And what do you paint?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Just everything. Landscapes, mostly.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Did you ever practice medicine or work with patients or just mostly research?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Yeah, when I was at the naturopathic school, sometimes they would have a puzzling patient and they would get me involved.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Ordinarily, I just do consulting with doctors and sometimes they send their patients. Nutrition, counseling, and teaching are the things I've mostly done.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 So when you have a puzzling patient, what kind of things do you test or do to try to figure out what's going on with them?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 Oh, it's always different. I think the basic thing is to look at the person as a unique case and look at their whole history and what their aims are as well as their origins.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And you can often find out what the problem is just by what they've been doing and how their development has gone.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 And they'll very often know pretty much what's wrong with them better than doctors do. Doctors tend to indoctrinate the person to believe that they have what has been diagnosed in them.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 But if you look at them as an individual, very often that's not a problem at all.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 So you're saying deep down the patient often knows what's going on?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Yeah, very often better than doctors. A doctor will take their blood pressure and diagnose hypertension, but that isn't necessarily what was bothering the person.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And increasingly high blood pressure is an invention of the pharmaceutical industry and never would hurt the person within the range that they're considering a sickness.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And the actual figures show that even by medical standards, accidents or misjudgments by the medical industry are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans every year.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 If you interpret the evidence looking outside of hospitals, that's just hospital accidents account for 100,000 or so, but it's close to a million people a year, even by conventional medical standards, who are being killed unnecessarily by these accidents.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Yeah. So Dr. Peate, 160 over 90 or 180 over 100 or something, are you saying that that's not an issue, not a problem?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Occasionally, for it to get up to 160 over 90 isn't bad, but that same person, if you look at them in the afternoon when they aren't listening to the news or something that irritates them, they might be 140 over 90.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And that's perfectly okay for a middle-aged person. But in the morning, when they are sort of dehydrated during the night, their blood will be thicker and they might be 150 every morning.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 But if it goes down to 130 in the afternoon, that's perfectly healthy.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Is 110 over 60 even better?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 For like somebody 70, 40, 50, 60?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Well, sometimes it isn't, sometimes it is.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 It just really, really depends.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Yeah.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 So if you've got a chart on the wall and you go by that, you're saying the docs are on thin ice when they do that.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Yeah, and the drug companies have convinced them that 140 over 90 is a serious problem, but it isn't.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 It's a few minutes after the hour here with Ray Peat. We're going to get to all of your emails that you sent in.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 So let's dig right into nutrition.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 We are what we eat and all of that, Dr. Peat.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 Are we all that different?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 I mean, Patrick, your host here might do really nicely on whatever, meat and vegetables, more paleo kind of thing.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And Ray Peat maybe may do better on brown rice three or four times a week.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 But for me, maybe that's too much.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 Talk a little bit about that, what you have seen all these years about when it comes to nutrition.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 We're a very tough organism compared to rats, for example.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 We can stand a tremendous stress that other animals couldn't stand for many reasons.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Our high metabolic rate and a big brain and a powerful glandular system give us a great adaptive ability.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 But you can see in areas that have lived for many generations on a certain kind of diet,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 that their health shows that objectively that diet isn't good.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Something is either missing or too much.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 What would be an example of that?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Some of the nearly vegetarian villages in Africa and South America.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 People age very fast and are dying off by the time they're 40 of infectious diseases.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 And the explorer who about 80 years ago was studying the diet of the Eskimos,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 he observed that they could avoid scurvy by eating a purely meat diet.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 And he popularized the idea that you don't need the fruits and vegetables because meat is a good source of vitamin C.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 But he himself observed that the people eating that traditional high meat Eskimo diet looked very prematurely aged.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 And just in the last two or three years that is being explained as a phosphate poisoning basically.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 The ratio of phosphate to calcium, when it's too high it accelerates degeneration.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 There's a protein that...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And how do you get too high phosphate?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Well a pure grain diet or a pure meat diet, either one.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 So it can be vegetarians or meat eaters who are basically causing the same kind of toxic inflammatory reaction.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 So most people should maybe look at if they're going to eat meat to also do some grains?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 Well no, the grains are just as bad as the meat, a phosphate source.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 So the ruminants live on basically leaves by preference.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 And leaves have an extremely high ratio of magnesium and calcium to phosphorus.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 So their milk is a pretty safe ratio, it's got about one and a third calciums per phosphate which is a very safe amount.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 But vegetarians who either eat lots of fruit or who cook their greens,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 there are some diets that have up in the high altitude areas of South America and Asia,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 there have been people who eat lots of cooked greens as well as usually sheep or goat cheese and milk.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 And that's a very longevity supporting kind of diet.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Really? Cooked greens and goat cheese? Well that sounds pretty good.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 So cooking greens, kale, cabbage, broccoli, all those things, it's a good thing?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 We can't digest them in the raw form just because the cellulose encloses the nutrients and makes them inaccessible to our enzymes.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 There was a study in 1945 with feeding, people were talking about the loss of nutrients in canned vegetables.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So they fed one group of rats vegetables out of cans and another group fresh vegetables of exactly the same kind.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 And the ones eating the canned vegetables thrived through normally and the ones eating the raw vegetables just couldn't digest enough to grow properly.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Interesting. So Dr. Peat, is there anything going on if you have a nice big salad, romaine lettuce and maybe raw peppers and carrots and sprouts and stuff?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Are we getting anything there?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Well some people have a very vigorous peristalsis and they can get it through and it sweeps out their intestine and that can be a very good effect

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 because the liver puts out some of its toxins in the bile and tries to get rid of the toxins by excreting them through the intestine.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 But if you have a sluggish bowel and not much moving through it, the intestine reabsorbs those toxins and so they recycle.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And many toxins accumulate, especially estrogen.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 The liver should make all of the estrogen that it experiences into a soluble form and excrete them.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 But if you don't have bulk or movement in your intestine, you reabsorb those and that messes up your whole endocrine system.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 So people with a good physical activity and good thyroid function so that their intestine is active, the fibers of any sort will take down the toxins.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 But because the raw vegetables or undercooked vegetables can be attacked by bacteria if they stay in the intestine too long and the bacteria will produce toxins,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 many people by the time they're in their 30s will start having digestive problems if they're eating salad every day.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 And it happens that root vegetables such as carrots have to defend themselves against bacteria and fungus in the soil.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 So they have powerful antibiotics and raw carrots will go right through you without being digested and probably not being attacked significantly by fungus or bacteria.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 But leaves, if you for example put a wad of lettuce into a baggie and put it in your pocket for a few days and a package of raw carrots in another baggie,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 keep them at body temperature for two or three days, you'll see that the carrots are in pretty good condition despite being sealed and warm.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 The lettuce will probably be rotten and very foul.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Sure, sure. And the same thing happens for folks who don't move it through the whole transit time quickly with raw.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 Yeah, and the great interest in fiber that developed in the United States, partly there was a trend around 1900 but it came back with the oat bran publicity in the 1970s.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 The person who had studied the effect of fiber in preventing bowel cancer in Africa came to the US and said, "Why is everyone eating oat bran?"

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 He was talking about potatoes, cooked potatoes in the diet which are a great and pretty safe kind of fiber.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 But Australian studies found that oat bran in particular promoted bowel cancer in rats.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 Oh good, oh good. So are cooked potatoes pretty good? Even sweet potatoes or those little organic new potatoes or baked potatoes, are they pretty good food?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Yeah, very good. The Indians live on basically the traditional diet was almost pure potatoes for 51 weeks out of the year.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Then they would have pork feasts for one week.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 No kidding. And how long did they live? A long time?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 They didn't have any heart disease, not a high rate of cancer, any degenerative disease.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 So potatoes, I have always thought Dr. Peat of those of having their share of sugar, turning to sugar similar to maybe rice or pasta or bread or something and could have some issues with the heart but not so.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 Yeah, the starch, all the starches do turn to sugar but the other ingredients in potatoes are very different from the cereals.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 The cereal is a storage form that has to be dormant for several months until the next season.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 The potato is always moist and metabolizing and so it's always in a physiological state, not concentrated and dehydrated.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 That means that it has a good balance of all of the intracellular minerals associated with the starch. So you have a better balance of phosphorus and calcium for example than in seeds.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 The high phosphate concentration in the seed is in the form of phytic acid or a similar thing that binds minerals so that the minerals are concentrated in association with this phytic acid.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 And when it sprouts, then it forms cells and becomes relatively good nutrition. But a potato is always in that really living state with just granules of starch within functioning cells.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So there's no concern and it's been such for a long time of nightshades and arthritis and they're bad and where did all this come from? You're saying it's not true.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Oh, no, they are allergenic.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Oh, they are allergenic.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Yeah, nutritionally. Potato is almost a perfect food but the whole family, eggplant, tomato, peppers and potatoes are pretty allergenic.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Oh, boy. So how do we find out if we should be eating those things?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 If you lay off some for about a week, you'll see if your symptoms subside.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Okay. So if you don't have any symptoms and you eat a baked potato or a sweet potato, what kind of symptoms would you get to give me maybe a clue that you've got some allergy thing going on?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Well, sweet potatoes are a special issue if they're orange colored. The carotene interferes with the breakdown of the starches and they're likely to have more fibrous starch than a white potato.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 And so a sweet potato can cause a lot of gas because it's slow to digest because of the carotene in it.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 So, actually you mean a white baked potato is even preferable nutritionally to a sweet potato?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 Yeah, for ease of digestion and the protein quality in any potato is higher than the protein quality of an egg.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 So, you can't look at a chart which shows you two or three parts of starch for every part of protein because much of the protein value is present in the form of small molecules that are equivalent to the essential amino acids.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 So, it just doesn't show up in the analysis as protein. But when you eat it, it counts as better than egg yolk.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 I'll be done. And it's okay to just put pounds of butter on them? It's good for you?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Especially with butter because pure starch digests quickly. It turns into pure glucose rather than half fructose.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 The pure glucose is a powerful stimulant to insulin secretion, fat production, and adding butter or cream slows the digestion so it isn't such a powerful insulin stimulant.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 It also reduces the chance of what's called persorption of starch granules. A starch granule, a potato starch granule happens to be very big.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Other starches are more the size of a red blood cell. But a potato starch granule is several times fatter than that.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 But even these huge granules bigger than cells can get squeezed right through the wall of the intestine and/or the lymphatics in the blood system.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 So, within 30 minutes after you eat a starch without fat, you see these starch grains circulating through your blood. And if they're big, they'll plug up your arterioles.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 Studies in mice showed that a high raw starch diet accelerated their aging. And you could demonstrate areas of every organ that were being killed by plugging up the arteries feeding the areas.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 So, the fat is key. The fat is key to have with starches.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Yeah, good thorough cooking plus some fat.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Good job. We're with Ray Peat. And as you could tell, he's a real scientist. What a great fun. It is called rayPeat.com, his website. My name is Patrick Timpone.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 This is oneradionetwork.com. Happy New Year to you. We have a lot of great shows for you. We're going to have Sharon and I will bring you.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 And we appreciate your ongoing support of our sponsors like this one here.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 We're with health motivator Daniel Vitalis about testosterone and pine pollen. Some of the guys have asked if taking pine pollen would dampen their own testosterone production.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 That's a fantastic question. But I want to remind people that pine pollen is a whole food. That's something that can happen with the steroidal forms of isolated bioidentical testosterone.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 We have some issues, bodybuilders who are taking steroids often have. But what I want to point out about pine pollen is that it's a whole food.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 And the amount of testosterone that's present is very rarefied. So, these aren't really issues that we experience when we take the whole food form of pine pollen or a tincture of pine pollen.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 But it is an issue if people are taking synthetic testosterone.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 You've got two to choose from. The gold and what they call the four Ps. You'll see it there.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 I've got an exercise program for 2014. Please consider these rebounders. I've been using mine for 20 years now.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 See how strong I am? 20 years. And I jump on the rebounder probably five or six times a week.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Well, five or six times during the day and maybe two or three times during that day. Sometimes just for three or four minutes or five minutes in the afternoon.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 After I've been on the computer for two or three hours, I'll go downstairs and just jump around for five minutes.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 It's so flexible like this where you're not going to go out and jog for five minutes, right?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 I mean, who's going to do that? Or you could run up and down your stairs, I guess. That works.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 But this is fun because you just go there and jump and jump and bounce around. And I have a few little weights, three, four, five, six pounders. You can do jumping jacks.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 I like to, after I eat, some in the evening, 6, 6.30, try to get done by then so I can sleep well.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 I'll just walk in place with my knees high, rub my stomach in a circular motion and do that for five minutes or so to help digest the food.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And that seems to work real nicely. It's an old Chinese thing where if you walk 50 paces rubbing your stomach, it helps to digest your food.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 And this does the same thing. You just walk right on the rebounder.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 We sell them for $319, tax title license, complete, delivered in all in the continental US and then 50 extra bucks if you live in Canada or Hawaii, 50 extra dollars or Alaska.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And email me with your address in Alaska, Hawaii or Canada and I'll confirm that price just to make sure that it is.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Sometimes it's 55 or 60 bucks depending on what part of the country you live in.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 And then I'll arrange for you to get the extra money. But they're really nice and lifetime warranty. Lifetime warranty. Go figure, when's the last time? Lifetime warranty.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 That's the rebounder from OneRadioNetwork.com. You can click and order anytime.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Okay, we're pre-recorded here this morning. Happy New Year to you. This is Patrick Timpone.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And we recorded this late December and preceding our two weeks vacation with Dr. Ray Peat, PhD in biology, University of Oregon.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 And you can look at his website. He's got some cool stuff, a lot of articles. RayPeat.com. He does research, travels to Mexico and he's a painter.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 And we're talking about one of our favorite subjects, nutrition. And we're going to get your emails here. I don't want to go too long before we get emails because we'll never get through them.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Let's see, what else about nutrition? Oh, I know what. I wanted to ask you, Dr. Peat.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 So often in the last couple of years, we've been hearing all the negative things about grains, right? Rice, basmati rice, brown rice, of course bread, pasta, cookies, cakes, crackers, white flour.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 That's kind of a, I can understand that. But just whole organic non-GMO grains. There's a lot of people that just say these are just not good for us.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 We're not really meant to eat these things and wheat belly and all those things. What's your opinion?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 I mean, should we think about eating grains? Do we need them? Would we be better off having brown rice one or two times a week? What do you think?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 They are relatively a deficient, nutritionally deficient food. But if you need the calories, that's their basic value.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Calories?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Yes. And traditionally, wheat in Asia and corn in the Americas, these grains go way back. But they were processed by boiling the seed either in lye made from ashes or in active calcium hydroxide

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 to break down the toxic components. You can get somewhat the same effect by sprouting the grain, but the traditional way and very quick and producing a tasty product was to boil it in the alkali.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Most people know hominy. That's a form of alkali treated corn. And when you grind up hominy, you make the traditional tortilla or tamale.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 And if people eat their corn in that form or the wheat in a similar form, they aren't susceptible to pellagra, for example, because niacin is created in the calcium treatment.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 It lowers the problem of too much leucine in the diet from the corn. So it nutritionally corrects the natural problems of the grain.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And after or separately from those very ancient processes, the Europeans for generations processed their flour by soaking it to let yeast grow in it, to leaven it to produce a soft bread.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 And the process of soaking it and letting yeast grow naturally in it takes about 12 hours at a moderate room temperature.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 And in that process, enzymes break down the storage proteins that are so allergenic and release the minerals from the storage forms such as phytic acid.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 So the traditional leavened bread was much richer in B vitamins and protein and minerals. And if you eat your grains without any of those old processes, you're going to have the lack of those positive nutrients as well as the excess of phosphate.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 So in China and Japan now, the thousands of thousands of tons of white rice that they eat, is it just a pure calorie thing? And they're just getting calories and not a lot of much of anything else?

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Yeah, because in much of the world, calories are the thing to keep alive.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 I see. So it's keeping them alive, not necessarily nurturing them.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 No, it isn't an ideal food except when you're really hungry.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 So if we wanted to use brown rice, say for just some more calories, say we wanted to maintain weight or in my case, I'd sure like to gain a little weight. Is there a way that I could reasonably prepare say basmati organic or brown rice or something like that to get the most bang for my buck here that wouldn't be too crazy with the preparation method?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 What would you do?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 If it hasn't been either roasted or irradiated before you get it, if it's still alive, then you can just soak it for a few hours and it gets softer and less starchy the longer it soaks, but also more nutritious.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 The enzymes that are breaking down the toxic stuff are releasing nutrients but also synthesizing new proteins.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 The storage forms of the protein are always either irritating or allergenic or toxic, but as the enzymes process them, they turn into living enzymes and structural proteins just like the plant.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 So you just soak them and that does the trick. I guess then you rinse them off, put them in fresh water and then cook them up.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Yeah.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 And just that simple process makes them a lot better food.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Yeah.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Then you get some calories if you want some calories.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 And it's especially good for promoting fat production and the insulin. If you're having enough protein with it, the insulin also can stimulate muscle building.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Would you actually eat protein with that meal? Is that okay?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Like a piece of steak and also some brown rice?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Oh sure. You should always have some kind of carbohydrate with protein.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Oh boy, now you know. Does broccoli count? That kind of carbohydrate?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Yeah. It's pretty starchy.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Pretty starchy. Okay. So you don't have to have a complex carb like a tortilla or grain or bread or something like that or pasta.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 No. The trouble with a pure meat diet is that your brain and blood, for example, need sugar and your body is always going to produce some sugar, some glucose.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 And if you're eating a pure meat or pure protein diet, your body is going to turn some of that into glucose and some into fat for energy.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 But the process of breaking down the protein to make sugar is also going to affect your own physiology.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And I've known people who, a woman for example, was told by her doctors to eat more protein because they saw that her urine contained a lot of amino acids.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 And she went up to, I think it was three pounds of meat a day and she was getting weaker as well as fatter because her cortisol production was extremely high because that's involved in turning amino acids into sugar.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 So if somebody, many of our listeners have weak adrenals, have been told they do and blood sugar issues, keeping that balanced, what are some foods that help to keep the blood sugar more stable?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 The main thing that keeps your blood sugar stable is the ability of your liver to store sugar wherever it got it.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 And the thing that it needs to store sugar is the active form of the thyroid hormone.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 The thyroid hormone also makes you use your sugar very sparingly, producing many times more ATP molecules per unit of food than you get if you burn it or if you metabolize it into lactic acid, which you do when you don't have enough thyroid.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 So thyroid makes you spare your glucose, not waste it and store it in the liver.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 So it's the basic thing for stabilizing your blood sugar.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 And if you have the cholesterol, which is produced only if your liver is in good condition, low cholesterol is behind a serious adrenal failure because cholesterol is the raw material for making the steroids, pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA and cortisol.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 And if your cholesterol is low and your thyroid is low, then you can't make any of these.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 And if you don't make enough of the other steroids, then you will turn any trace of progesterone or pregnenolone into cortisol and get excess cortisol.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 And you will get either adrenal failure or adrenal overactivity as a consequence of having a sick liver or an underactive thyroid.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Is a good solid number in cholesterol of 2 or 225, is that a sign that your thyroid may be pretty good?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Yeah, anywhere between 160 and 230, it's a healthy range. But if your thyroid is a little more active, the cholesterol will probably go down to 200 or 190.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 There's this mirror image relationship between cholesterol and thyroid function.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Are you ever supportive of folks using some kind of natural pig thyroid or whatever to keep it in balance?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Oh sure.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Are you okay with that?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 I've been poisoned basically by stress and a bad diet. Many things interfere with the ability to form thyroid hormone and to use it.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 And polyunsaturated fats will interfere both with the production of the hormone, with the transport of it and with the ability to respond to it, poisoning the mitochondria that use thyroid and sugar.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 So PUFA is what Lita Lee talked about.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Yeah, so when you're under stress, by the time a person is about 30 years old, their tissues have had time to store the PUFA.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Even if they're not eating very much in the diet, the body preferentially oxidizes saturated fats and sugar and puts the PUFA into storage.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 So when you're stressed and 30 years old or more, your blood is going to fill up with PUFA, which blocks all of these thyroid functions as well as the production of progesterone and the other protective steroids.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 And tell folks what PUFA's most people eat in our culture.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Well, the liquid cooking oils, salad oils are mostly the high PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids. Corn oil, soy oil, canola, safflower seed oil, fish oil, all of these are the antithyroid.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 Oh, even a good fish oil, you're not a fan of those?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Yeah, the fish oils happen to be so unstable, they were used as varnish.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 They were easier to oxidize than soy oil, so they made better varnish.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 That same thing happens in the body. In the 1950s and 60s, they were seeing when they fed too many fish to their lab animals or minks or other farmed animals, they had what was called a yellow fat disease, which was from the breakdown of these long polyunsaturated fats in fish oil.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 But when it came out in the 1970s that the seed oils, which had been promoted to lower cholesterol, the corn oil and cotton seed oil, turned out that they were causing heart disease as well as cancer.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 So that opened up the market for the other PUFA, the fish oil type, DHA and EPA.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Some folks take a lot of that too, don't they?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Yeah, but their good feature is that they break down so fast that they aren't as easily stored to become a chronic problem as the shorter, more stable seed oils.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Do we need these DHAs or EPAs? There are people that suggest if we do some oils like borage and coconut and these kinds of things that the body will make, they'll make the DHAs and EPAs that we need.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 Like flax oil, primrose, pumpkin, extra virgin coconut oil.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Actually, there's no definite clear evidence that any of those is an essential fatty acid.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 The best thing I can say about the fish oils or the N-3 fatty acids is that they can protect to some extent against the N-6 seed oils.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 But in themselves, they have been associated with causing increased metastatic cancer, reduced brain size, brain edema, all of the degenerative problems, slowed conduction of the nerves.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 And some of these are turned into virtues such as immunosuppression, which ordinarily is a bad thing.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 You can suppress your immune system and have temporary relief of inflammation.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 And what kind of oils do this?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 The fish oils.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 They also slow conduction. So in some situations, you can reduce arrhythmia of the heart just because you're desensitizing the heart.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 But it also slows your nerve conduction.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 We don't hear much in the mass media about the bad effects of the long fish oils, but there are lots of publications demonstrating.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 So are the safest olive oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, those kind of things?

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 And butter.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Those are the safest and the healthiest.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 You want to do some emails?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Sure.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 So here's some emails that we asked our listeners when we found out we were going to, and they've sent these in even though we're pre-recorded here today.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 I'm a male, hypothyroid, and have been on thyroid therapy 13 and 14 for six months.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 I've accumulated a lot of body fat over the last few years.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 So what's the safest way to lose weight and lower estrogen, prolactin, etc., while keeping free fatty acids low?

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Should I take vitamin E to help while the weight is coming off to protect against prostaglandins?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 One thing that often surprises people who want to lose weight is that milk drinkers as a group are the least likely to be fat.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 I saw this the first time it got me interested, and it was when I was traveling.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 I saw the Russians in Moscow and Leningrad, tremendous rate of obesity, and their diet was heavy on bread, and they had a terrible milk supply.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 I went across the border to Helsinki, and everyone there was slim, and all the stores were full of cheese and milk.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 That started me thinking about the role of calcium and dairy products in preventing obesity and degenerative diseases.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 It turns out that the calcium itself is a major factor in preventing the inflammation process, which is important in turning on the fat storage business.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 So you're okay with cow-dairy, raw, grass-fed cow-dairy milk, cheese?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 Yes, that's the best practical major protein because of the very high calcium ratio to phosphate.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Here's an email from Matt. I think maybe I was recommended by you. Do you have patients?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 No.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Okay, it's a good question. It's a good question. I'm interested in recommending by you to drink orange juice as a means to increase my pregnenolone production.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 Oh, well, I always recommend drinking orange juice and milk because of the sugar and the anti-inflammatory other ingredients in the orange juice, the high mineral content.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 So in a fashion, just pure orange juice is a good food, in your opinion?

00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Yes, and these minor ingredients, norengin, for example, they're very important anti-estrogenic foods and anti-inflammatory.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 They're going to probably turn out to be major supplements when the orange industry finds a way to concentrate them cheaply out of the peelings.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 I often heard over the years, Doc, that just orange juice like that is just too much sugar, too much sugar to be drinking pure orange juice.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 It comes with these high potassium, which works to dispose of the sugar safely, and some magnesium and calcium and so on that also help to stabilize the blood sugar.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Matt goes on, "I feel extremely hypo if I don't take thyroid. This seems to be my only side effect.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 One of the problems with orange juice is it makes me feel very cold. If I drink about a quart, I feel almost like I dropped several degrees.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 I also feel like the juice just collects in my stomach and just lays there like a balloon. Is this some kind of allergy?"

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 I think that's where the milk or cheese is very important to keep the metabolic rate up and watch the thyroid function.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 There are several ways without having a blood test that you can make a pretty good guess about what your thyroid is doing.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 If your hands and feet are colder than average, that's because your adrenaline is holding your temperature up for your brain and heart by cutting the circulation to the extremities.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 So the oral temperature is a good indicator in general, but the cold extremities are the first sign of failing thyroid function.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 I see.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 "One fatty tumor or lipoma is inflamed tissue that is gathered to protect the body from improper diet or drugs.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 What are some ways to melt the enclosed fat in order to shrink the lump, which is about one cup in size?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Wow! I have removed all grains and other inflammatory foods."

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 I've known quite a few people with fairly sizable lipomas, maybe not that big, but I don't think anything is very clearly known.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 I think that some kind of a systemic inflammatory problem is involved causing the inability of the body to clear that out.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 I don't know of any reliable way other than it's usually a very simple surgery just to have a lipoma cut out under the skin.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 I've got a golden retriever doc that's had one for, gosh, years and years and just stays there.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 The vet says, "Oh, she's fine. Don't worry. Just leave it there."

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 It doesn't grow and it doesn't seem to bother her.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 This is from Rainy. "Do you think the sugar has a huge effect on hot flashes?

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 I've been going to a naturopathic doc for a year now and still have hot flashes, but it might be worse when I have more sweets."

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 Well, no. There have been studies in which someone would eat a huge amount of cornstarch, for example, at bedtime,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 and that would turn off their hot flashes during the night.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 But how it works is pretty well worked out.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 It just isn't well publicized, but there have been studies demonstrating that the flushing, especially around menopause,

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 this periodic flushing involves the release of nitric oxide in the blood vessels causing vasodilation, causing heat loss.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 The brain has a temperature regulator which activates the production of nitric oxide to cause this heat loss

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 because something is setting this thermostat in the brain lower.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 Your brain is telling your body to cool off even though it's already subnormal temperature usually.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 And what happens is the stress apparatus, usually they talk about the pituitary and the adrenals,

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 but above the pituitary there is the corticotropin release hormone in the hypothalamus which turns on the whole stress system.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 CRH, corticotropin release hormone, directly activates the nitric oxide in the blood vessels causing the flushing.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 And the things that turn on the stress reaction are primarily related to hypoglycemia.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 So if your brain senses it isn't getting enough sugar, it wants to, in effect, hibernate, reduce the body temperature

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 so it doesn't waste the sugar which it's short of.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 And so if you can tell your brain that you have plenty of sugar, that will suppress the corticotropin release hormone

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 and that will stop turning on the nitric oxide and stop the flushing.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 Interesting. Here's an email from Len.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 "I'm a 60-year-old male and every now and again, not often but several times a year, sometimes more,

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 I have a panic attack that lasts about 60 minutes, feel like I'm going to die, but I don't.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 And I'm just wondering how I can possibly find the root cause of these. Thanks for your help."

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 Hyperventilation is often involved in that and a hormone imbalance and checking the thyroid,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 probably having a blood test for the steroids as well as the thyroid hormones.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 The steroids? What are those?

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 Such as progesterone, pregnenolone, and cortisol.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Oh, and a blood test can do that?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 Yeah.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 And that gives you, if they get out of balance, then the body might do a whole anxiety attack thing?

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 Yeah, when your progesterone is low or your estrogen is high, that tends to cause hyperventilation.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 And once you start hyperventilating, the loss of carbon dioxide causes your blood cells to release serotonin

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 and other nerve transmitters that cause all kinds of nervous and emotional effects.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 So that's why people breathe into a paper bag.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 Yeah.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 Did that work?

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Oh, yeah. I've seen people lower their blood pressure in two or three days

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 and never have another problem of, for example, 160 over 90 or 100 blood pressure.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 With several times a day for two or three days, people can very often get their blood pressure down as easily as that.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 So what do you do? I've seen people do it, but I've never done it.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 Do you actually put it over your mouth and your nose?

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 You pinch it tight around your face so you can't get any fresh air.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 Right. Just breathe.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 You inhale so it collapses the bag and then blow it back in the bag.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 And it just takes about a minute before it gets really oppressive, hot and humid.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 But at the same time, you've used up the oxygen and are starting to breathe almost pure CO2,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 which gets very uncomfortable. So you can only do it until it is too uncomfortable.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 But each time you do that, it tells your brain to reset things and tolerate a little more carbon dioxide and acidity.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 And in two or three days, you can train your brain to hang on to more carbon dioxide,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 which improves circulation to the brain.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 And that same effect you can get briefly by baking soda in water.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 I've seen a couple of people have just almost instantaneous recovery from a stroke

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 by drinking some baking soda, which opens up the blood vessels in the brain.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 So when you have the paper bag thing, is that breathing through your nose or your mouth?

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 It doesn't matter.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 It doesn't matter because it's all going to the same place.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 Yeah, and it's all humid.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 I'll be darned. And the CO2 that you're breathing in opens up the brain

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 and helps everything just kind of reboot your brain a bit.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 Yeah, but not only the brain, it also happens to activate the mitochondria all through your body.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 It's making things more efficient.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 Very interesting. I'll be darned.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 And people have told us, I think I'm correct, that when we breathe through our mouth at night

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 rather than through our nose, that can cause to get rid of too much CO2 and could be a problem.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 Is that right?

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Yeah. The medical opinion is often that people don't breathe enough during the night.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 But when you look at their changes of pH and the actual blood chemistry,

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 the usual thing is that they hyperventilate during the night because as their blood sugar is pushed down to go to sleep,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 their adrenaline comes up periodically.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 And the adrenaline and changed disposition of the sugar makes them have, in effect, higher estrogen,

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 higher inflammatory hormones that drive hyperventilation and blow off too much carbon dioxide.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 And then they don't breathe for a while.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 Then they wake up.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 They wake up with a feeling that they have died or haven't been breathing enough.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 And the best chemical treatment for that is a chemical called Diamox or acetazolamide

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 that causes the body to retain more carbon dioxide, which keeps stimulating the brain to keep breathing at the right speed.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 But it prevents the body from losing the carbon dioxide that holds it in the blood.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 Diamox. How do you spell that?

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 D-I-A-M-O-X. That's the brand name.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 D-I-A. Is that a prescription or just go over the counter?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 Prescription.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
 Diamox.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 It's well established as a cure, basically, for the sleep apnea.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 I'll be darned. Diamox. Never heard of that one.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 And it's also used commonly for skiers who go to very high altitude to prevent altitude sickness.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 I'll be darned.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 Rather than lack of oxygen, altitude sickness is essentially a lack of carbon dioxide.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 But it's not really a cure, Dr. Peat. Would it be more of treating the symptoms so you'd have to take it on going?

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 Well, yeah. Sometimes it gets it going.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 Well, it's like a thyroid. Sometimes two or three days of a thyroid supplement is all a person needs and their own gland will take over.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:24.000
 It's the same with sleep apnea. Sometimes they can get out of the stress and not have another problem.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 But usually you have to work on finding why the hormones are going bad, especially at night.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 Get your blood sugar stabilized. Get a good diet, enough protein and enough fruit in the diet.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 And supplement the thyroid as long as it's needed.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
 What was the other name you had for Diamox?

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
 Acetazolamide is the chemical name.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 Acetazolamide.

00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 It's a diuretic as it's traditional use, but it's probably most often used now for high altitude sickness.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:13.000
 Speaking of sleep, while we're there for a minute, folks, insomnia, as you know, is just an epidemic around our country.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
 People just waking up, can't get to sleep. They fall asleep, can't get back to sleep, they wake up.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 Are there any particular foods or things that you have seen over the years that help to facilitate people getting a better night's sleep?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 Food or nutrients?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 Yeah, a very practical, simple thing is a glass of warm milk with an ounce or two of either sugar or honey in it.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
 And the milk makes the sugar or honey absorb more slowly.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:01:04.000
 And the effect of the sugar is to lower your adrenaline, which the older a person gets, the more problem they have with sleep hypoglycemia causing increased adrenaline.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:26.000
 That can lead to high blood pressure problems so that old people who are told to take a blood pressure drug will often get worse insomnia as their blood sugar falls and their adrenaline goes up.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:46.000
 And sometimes just by eating enough sugar and salt during the day and a little extra at bedtime, they can not only cure their insomnia, but sometimes their blood sugar is corrected enough that the blood pressure problem disappears.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
 So actually a little sugar before bed may help things sleep.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000
 Yeah, especially when it's with a food like milk or something that keeps it in the stomach for a while.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
 Like butter or something?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
 Yeah, ice cream.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
 Oh, ice cream. Now you're my kind of doctor.
