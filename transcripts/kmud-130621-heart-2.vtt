00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 This free program is paid for by the listeners of Redwood Community Radio.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 If you're not already a member, please think of joining us. Thank you.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 [Music]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Well, thank you for that introduction and happy solstice to everyone who's listening.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 As always, the show will run from 7.30 to 8 o'clock with callers,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 and we want to try and make a habit of asking people where they come from,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 so just to get an idea of the demographics of the show.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Okay, so my name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 o'clock,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 I carry on with the age-old intro of "we".

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 My lovely wife is looking after our two-month-old baby,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 and I guess for maybe another month or two,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 she'll be sitting at home taking care of our little girl.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 to this month's continuing subject of the heart.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And also there's another article Dr. Peat's just recently written, the cancer matrix.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 So the number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 That's 1800 568 3723.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 We can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBMHERB

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Well, before we get going with introducing Dr. Peat to the show,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 we're once again very fortunate to have him on to share his expert knowledge.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 I got pretty excited, not that I don't believe,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 but pretty excited that suddenly in the last month,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I think I probably received four newsletters,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 part of Medscape's email newsletter program.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 So the thing that struck me the most about it was that I don't know how many people are listening now

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 who have been long-time listeners or maybe have been just recently switched into

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 what Dr. Peat's been professing probably for the last 35-40 years,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 that the saturated fats and the animal fats and the butter, etc. are the good fats

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 and that the polyunsaturated fats, things like safflower, linoleic acid,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 any of the seed oils, cottonseed, hemp seed, canola, etc.,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 all the bad oils and fish oil, obviously, are one of those oils,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 because the main thrust of industry is to propose these as heart-healthy and cholesterol-lowering, etc.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Well, what do you know, folks?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Dr. Peat's always said that whilst truth races around the world,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 sorry, while a lie races around the world, beg your pardon,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 truth is just getting her shoelaces tied.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And here we go, 40 years later, I got several articles from Medscape,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 and I just wanted to share them with you.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 So the first article from the British Medical Journal was the use of dietary linoleic acids

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and death.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 And I don't want to go on too long with these articles before we bring Dr. Peat in,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 so in the next five minutes or so, I'll just quickly run through some of these.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 The advice to substitute the polyunsaturated fats for saturated fats

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 is a key component of worldwide dietary guidelines for coronary heart disease risk reduction.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 However, clinical benefits of the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 the omega-6 linoleic acid, have not been established.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 So in the cohort that was studied, they substituted dietary linoleic acid in place of saturated fats,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 and they found that it increased the rates of death from all causes,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And this was an updated meta-analysis of 430 patients in the-- where have we got here?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Use of dietary linoleic acid for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and death.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And this was an evaluation of recovered data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 an updated meta-analysis.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So the advice to substitute vegetable oils that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 or PUFAs as they're known, for animal fats rich in saturated fatty acids,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 has been a cornerstone of worldwide dietary guidelines for the past half century.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Now, when this advice originated in the 1960s,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 PUFAs were regarded as a uniform molecular category with one relevant biological mechanism,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 and that was the reduction in blood cholesterol, or so they said.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 So this most recent turn up is just showing, finally, you know, coming to pass,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 saturated fats are actually better for you than the polyunsaturates,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 and they've shown this quite clearly in clinical trials.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Well, another review was done by Steve Stiles,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 and this was also another Medscape article that I got a few weeks back.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And it was entitled, "Dietary Saturated Fat Has Undeserved Bad Reputation."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Well, it's a fairly lengthy article, so I won't go into a lot of it,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 but some of the bullet points were the evidence that potentially carcinogenic preservatives

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 in processed meats as well as high heat cooking methods

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 have influenced perceptions that red meat per se has adverse health effects.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 How the preparation and cooking methods used for foods that are traditionally classified as saturated fat foods

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 may be producing substances from PUFAs and carbohydrates in those foods that are promoting disease.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 I also stated that studies suggesting the positive health effects from dairy fat and tropical oils,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 both high in saturated fatty acids and therefore were discredited as unhealthy,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 and the hazards of diets with increased carbohydrates as a result of being lower in fat,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 in low-fat diets, followed to improve health, especially cardiovascular health.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 So again, another good article there. It's a fairly long article,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 so if people want to check this out on the web, just type in "Medscape Good Fat vs. Bad Fat,"

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 I think one of the titles of the articles is.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 There was another article in the European Heart Journal that the dietary intake of saturated fatty acids,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 or it was about the dietary intake of saturated fatty acids

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 and the incident of stroke and coronary heart disease in Japanese communities,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 which are famous for consuming fairly large amounts of the polyunsaturated, especially in fish oils.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Saying that saturated fatty acid intake was inversely associated with age, sex,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 and energy-adjusted incidents of risk for total stroke, total and deep intraparenchymal hemorrhage,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 and ischemic stroke.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 So saying that all of these things, these cardiovascular disease etiologies,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 were all definitely higher in people that consumed less saturated fat.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 So again, another article proving that the saturated fat that Dr. Peat's been a proponent of for 35 years or so, is true.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 And actually the liquid oils, and especially the fish oils, are very bad for you.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 There was another article, and this again, this is something else that Dr. Peat's pretty keen to bring out as a good dietary substance.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 So coffee. I know Dr. Peat likes coffee for its magnesium content,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 but there's another article here presented by the European Society of Hypertension in 2013,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 during their scientific sessions, it was actually published June 18th, 2013.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Green tea and coffee may guard against stroke.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Chocolate nudges down blood pressure in new meta-analysis.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And coffee versus heart failure. A few cups per day protects.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So I know Dr. Peat's always pushed coffee as being a good source of magnesium,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 and another good antioxidant type food.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And then very lastly, before we introduce Dr. Peat here,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 the food supplement that was linked to lower prostate-specific antigen in prostate cancer patients was a mixture.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 They called it Pommy Tea, and the main components of it were broccoli, green tea extract, pomegranate,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 and the other product was...

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Well, those were three of them. There was four in it, but they were turmeric. That was it, turmeric.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Okay. So they found that this mixture significantly lowered prostate-specific antigen compared with placebo

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 in a study of 400, again, 420 patients with prostate cancer in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 So again, Dr. Peat's always mentioned things like the antioxidants and the flavonoids

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 as being very beneficial components in foods, and that's why he's so behind food as a medicine

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 rather than supplements and drugs, et cetera.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 He's very much behind getting your dietary medicine from food.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Okay. So enough of me. Let's introduce Dr. Peat. Dr. Peat, are you on?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Yes.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Hi. Thanks for joining us.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 So what do you think, then, for 30 years of telling everyone that saturated fats are good for you

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 and probably getting a lot of people laughing and doubting and just casting aspersions on what you bring into light,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 how do you feel about some of these things that are now coming out?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 I'm not sure what the motivation is exactly because the information has been sitting around for 50 or 60 years.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 I guess someone has slipped on their public relations for the fish oil and PUFA,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 letting this stuff leak through into the media.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 It's certainly a big industry, isn't it?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 I've seen some of the numbers that are touted as generating income for fish oil sales, and they're pretty staggering.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 So, Dr. Peat, I don't want to let you carry on without just introducing yourself and your professional background

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 so people that perhaps have never heard your name can hear a little bit about your education,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 and then we'll get going on the show.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Okay. In the '50s and '60s, I had taught various places in humanities mostly, but 1968 to '72,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 I returned to graduate school intending to study brain biology,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 but I found quickly that the nerve and brain department in the university was among the most dogmatic.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Molecular biology, genetics, and brain studies were highly dogmatic,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 so I shifted over to the physiological chemistry of aging and the reproductive system for my thesis.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Okay. All right. Very good.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 So I remember last month the topic was the heart, and again, linked with heart health,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 the common medical misconception that the saturated fats are the cause of blocked arteries,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 for want of a better word, and other cardiac illnesses,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 certainly is not founded in terms of research that's done,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 but yet seems to be the common theme on the lips of most people from what they hear on the radio or television adverts, etc.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 You see a lot of stuff in the medical literature that is spreading the propaganda line,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 and superficially it presents itself as science or research on the effects of the fats on the animals and so on,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 but when you read it closely, it's just like a professional trick in which they compare things that they know

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 or should know to be extremely toxic against the thing they want to sell and say,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 "See, it's less toxic than this other thing,"

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 but since it's common knowledge that the other thing is just powerfully toxic,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 anything compared against it practically will look beneficial.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 That's just almost a trick of the trade.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Just to keep selling a pretty profitable product, especially the fish oils,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I can't imagine, well, I do imagine why the industries do what they do,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 because ultimately things that are waste products, when they're turned into a profit, a profitable product...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Some of the bad research is just carelessness.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 For example, for about 30 or 40 years, people referred to lard as the saturated fat,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 and then they would use some middle of the range of a vegetable oil, canola or something,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 and show an advantage to the vegetable oil over lard and say, "Lard, the saturated fat, has these disadvantages,"

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 but during this period, they were feeding the pigs corn and soybeans to fatten them

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 because specifically of the high unsaturation of the food,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 and so lard was an extremely highly unsaturated fat.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 There were hundreds and hundreds of research papers compared to it, using it as the so-called saturated fat.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Okay, we're talking about fats and cholesterol again.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 What do you see of the harmful effect of lowering cholesterol relevant to heart failure?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 Cholesterol, as far back as the 1920s, probably earlier, was identified as a major protective, defensive molecule.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 For example, around 1920, someone injected half a dozen different toxins, heavy metals, snake venom,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 infectious bacteria, just about anything that was considered extremely toxic,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 and then they gave the animal a cholesterol injection and found that it antidoted all of those harmful things,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 and that has been repeated about every 20 years or so.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Someone repeats a similar experiment showing that in any system you look at,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 increasing the cholesterol improves functioning.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 For example, injecting it in the animals that are being trained, it improves their memory and learning ability.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 It turns out to be a component of every part of a cell's anatomy, the nuclear framework,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 the cell division apparatus, the respiratory system, everything.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 They talk about it as a membrane component, but it's really everywhere in the cell.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Okay, yes, so it's extremely important, and I know that you consistently mention that a higher cholesterol is a lot better

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 and a lot safer for you than a low cholesterol, and that there's much more damaging effects of low cholesterol than there is high.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Yes, I've known several doctors and such who deliberately kept their cholesterol down

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 and bragged about having 100 or 120 milligram percent cholesterol, and I don't think any of them lived much beyond 40 years.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Whoops, whoops.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Okay, so just for the listeners, I know the cutoff point on most lab core, for example, blood tests,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 give 200 milligram as the cutoff point at which they start prescribing statins, which have also --

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 and it reminds me there's also another article that appeared in Medscape in the last month about how damaging the statins were,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 and they're the artificial cholesterol-lowering drugs that are used to counteract so-called high cholesterol.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 So the --

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 One of the Framingham studies found that over the age of 50, people who didn't have higher than 200 on the cholesterol

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 were more likely to have dementia, showing a protective effect on the brain.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Right. That's what you've said many times now.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So people over 50, they want the cholesterol around 200, and actually to lower it artificially with statins,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 which is what happens when a doctor sees that on someone's blood work,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 is actually far more damaging to them than to have it at 220.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Okay. So what about -- because I know you're also a very big proponent of thyroid as an energy molecule, if you like,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 as part of an undergirding framework of metabolism in the body, because everything that happens in the body costs money,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 I guess, in a way to put it simply.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 And that thyroid hormone is the currency with which a lot of these transactions are met with.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 So in terms of low thyroid and muscle weakness, do you generally see muscle weakness as a part of a kind of low thyroid picture?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Yeah.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 There's a very close connection between polyunsaturated fats, and it's inversely related to thyroid function at every level.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 If you take one particular function of thyroid, the formation of the hormone or the secretion from the gland

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 or its transport through the blood or its action on the respiratory or genetic system in the cell,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 each of these functions decreases as the unsaturation of the fat molecule increases.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 And so the low thyroid, which allows muscles to fatigue more easily simply because energy isn't being produced by respiration

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 at the necessary level, as the muscle is fatigued, it activates processes that try to provide more energy.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 But in doing that, they liberate fats from storage, so they become free fatty acids.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 This not only further suppresses the thyroid and the energy production, but it starts an inflammatory process

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 so that the muscle, instead of just becoming fatigued and working less, shifts over to becoming inflamed and breaking down.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Sometimes the muscle breakdown can kill a person.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 That's one of the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering drugs.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Okay, folks, so staph is a bad for you. Higher cholesterol is good for you.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 So don't forget saturated fats are also the good guys, not the bad guys.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 Okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Arb Doctor on KMED Gallival 91.1 FM.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 And from 7.30 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions related to the heart,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 cholesterol, saturated fats, and later on, we might get into some of the latest article on the cancer matrix that Dr. Peat's written.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 If you live in the area, numbers 933911, or if you live outside the area, there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Okay, so again, the misconceptions surrounding the endurance training style of aerobic exercise, it's just not unhealthy, but it's pretty damaging, isn't it?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Yeah, one experiment with just walking fast on the treadmill to keep the heart rate up to about 120 or less,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 they found that the liver's production of the active thyroid hormone decreased radically in less than an hour of that kind of exercise.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 And if the person is very healthy, the thyroid will bounce right back from that kind of stress.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 But if their tissues are loaded with the thyroid suppressive fats, that much exercise liberates the fats and keeps the thyroid from recovering quickly.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Okay, good.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Could you just remind me, you are in favor of someone's resting heart rate to be around 80.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 I know that you don't agree with aerobic exercise because you say that that's, and for that reason that you just brought out, it's damaging.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 But yet you prefer a person's heart rate to be between 80 and 100.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Yeah, one experiment that got my interest about 30 years ago or more was looking at the school performance of, I think it was high school kids and their heart rate.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 And they found that the ones that had the highest grades averaged an 85 beats per minute at rest.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 And the average around 70 were the lower performance students.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So how about these people who maintain that low heart rate is a sign of health and the people that go jogging or they do marathon running and they have a pulse of maybe 50 or even lower sometimes and just say that they're incredibly fit.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 What do you have to say about the people that have that kind of heart rate with that kind of exercise?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 In general, that very slow heart rate correlates with very slow everything.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Sperm production, for example, is usually very low in those endurance runners.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Okay, so not very healthy to have a low heart rate.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Much better to have a metabolic energy production that's more up in the 80s or even a little higher.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Some of the drug companies are doing some trick research to make it look like it's better to have a lower heart rate.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 But what they're doing is including people with heart failure.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And when your heart is in the process of failing, it beats more weakly and so it has to beat more often.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 And so when you include people with heart failure, then you see that those with a fast heart rate are about to die.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Okay.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Now again, this caught my attention because I was always taught that heart muscle cells, they're called myocardiac sites.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 But the heart muscle cells, I was always taught that they were finite and that any heart exercise purely involved a localized swelling,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 if you like, a hypertrophy without an increase in cell numbers.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 But new research is showing that stem cells are able to create new heart cells and have been recognized.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 How does the effect of thyroid hormone promote this?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Well, partly it keeps the cells alive.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 But as long as the heart cells are able to respire using sugar, using glucose and producing carbon dioxide,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 any muscle cell in the heart that is damaged will be replaced by a recruited stem cell maybe coming in from the blood or another part of the heart,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 which in the presence of the thyroid and the good environment of plentiful glucose and carbon dioxide will mature into a muscle cell.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 But if the cell is blocked by these free fatty acids, which interfere with the use of glucose,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 then the cells of the heart produce lactic acid and lactic acid is a signal to produce collagen.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 And the stem cells arriving get that kind of signal from the environment of the sick heart and turn into fibroblasts and produce connective tissue.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 So the heart becomes progressively fibrotic and less contractile cells.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 And in experiments, they've produced two kinds of heart enlargement.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 One in which the heart simply works harder, like when you take more thyroid, it pumps harder and pumps more blood.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Or if you block the output of the heart by having what produces high blood pressure, you create more resistance.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 That causes the heart to enlarge. But the stressed, plugged up heart enlarges by producing more collagen and becomes fibrotic.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 But the enlarged heart that has developed with increased function and thyroid provision is a good muscular functioning heart.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 And when animals have been caused to develop an enlarged fibrotic heart with the other type of heart interference,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 then giving them T3 over a period of time causes the fibrosis to regress and be replaced by good functioning heart.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 And that kind of animal research has been somewhat indirectly applied to people preparing cadaver hearts for donation for transplants.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 And they found that if they gave the donor heart before they removed it, if they provided T3 to have it ready for removal and transplant,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 the transplant was much more successful.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Wow. Wow. All right. That's interesting.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 You're saying that T3, just to recap, you mentioned that T3 was anti-fibrotic.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Yeah. In the liver part, every place it's been studied, it helps to reverse the fibrosis.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Wow. And how do you understand that mechanism being good?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 I think developing good new tissue, stem cells, and keeping the environment low in lactic acid and high in carbon dioxide allows the differentiation to go in the right direction.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 And organs and tissues are always trying to break down and renew the extracellular matrix, which is where the collagen fibrosis exists.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 That's always being broken down and replaced.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 In the thyroid deficient stressed person, the replacement becomes worse than it was.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 But with adequate thyroid and nutrition, the fibrosis is replaced progressively by more functional tissue.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Right. Go ahead.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Doctors, I'd like to jump in here if I could and do some bottom of the hour business and open the phones up to callers because we had a number of callers.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 And I told them to call back after the bottom of the hour.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 So I just want to give you guys a second to catch your breaths.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 And we'll be right back with you, Dr. Peat and the herb doctor.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Support for KMED comes in part from Golden Dragon Medicinal Syrup, an anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antibacterial, antioxidant medicine made without heat or ice.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And KMED thanks Jessica Baker of Jade Dragon Acupuncture for her support of Redwood Community Radio.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Practicing traditional Chinese medicine, Jessica treats conditions ranging from psoriasis to post-traumatic stress.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Located at 607 F Street in Arcata, Jade Dragon Acupuncture can be reached at 822-4300.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 So I want to remind you that the herb doctor is opening up the phone lines now.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Our number locally is 707-923-3911.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 And if you're out of the area, 1-800-KMED-RAD.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 So the phone lines are open. I see they're starting to ring.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 I have one question for you, doctors from a caller.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 A lay person wanted to know if you could give a lay description of what saturated means in saturated fat.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Oh, I'm sorry. There we go.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 All right, you guys are back and I'll get the phones.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, did you hear that question that the engineer has just asked about describing saturated fats to a caller in a simple term?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 The fat is a chain of carbon atoms and they're covered with hydrogen atoms.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 And if you remove some of those hydrogen atoms on the typical middle of the chain carbon, there are two hydrogens.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 And if you remove those from some of the carbons, that's unsaturated.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 It just means if it's saturated, that means it has all the hydrogens attached that it can hold.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 And polyunsaturated means that you've got more than one set of carbon atoms with a double bond of electrons between the carbons lacking the hydrogens where the hydrogen had been filling every possible space.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Okay, and the other thing just to bring out that saturated fats are easily identified more or less by having a characteristic of being fairly solid at room temperature.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 And yeah, and that doesn't apply at all to the living state where we live at 98 or 99 degrees.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Those fats aren't at all more stiff or rigid in any way, but there's a whole literature that talks about them as if they stay stiff when they're at our body temperature.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Promoting the ideology that they're bad for you, right?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 Yeah, and in fact, each carbon in a saturated fat is free to rotate against its neighbor.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 And the removal of the hydrogens creates a stiff bond between those carbons.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 So actually, the polyunsaturated is less free to rotate than a saturated fat.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Do you think just quickly before we have three quarters, but do you think quickly that makes the cell for want of a better word cell membrane less fluid?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Yes, in fact, the fact that the highly unsaturated fat is easily attacked by oxygen means that the fats on the surface or wherever they are very quickly tend to attach chemically to adjoining proteins.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 And so when you look at it in the right situation, you see that the polyunsaturated membranes are often very rigid because of oxidation attaching them to the protein underlying the fat.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Thanks for that explanation for that listener. We have three quarters.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Let's take this first call on the end. If you'd just say where you're from.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 You're on the air. Yes, I'm from Peercy from Minnesota County.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 I lived in the Humboldt County area for 41 years. I'm 66 years old.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Andrew, thank you very much. You are God sent. And I think Dr. Peat is a prophet of the medical profession.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 He sure is. I've been I've been listening for quite a few months now on your program.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 And the problem I have is not related to heart. But what I have is 66 years old.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 I've had four major military surgeries and had all but eight feet of my small intestine removed.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 I have a double ostomy, which means my small intestine and my colon comes to the outside of my body using a prosthetic bag for defecation purposes.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Now, Donatel was a product I was taking to slow down my peristaltic action.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 What was the name of it? My peristaltic action so fast that I dehydrate all the time.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 Donatel is not not not available anymore locally here, at least. It's a Belladonna, of course.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 And I had been trying atropine, which didn't help at all either.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 So what I'm doing right now is my physician has me on hydromorphone.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 And of course, you gentlemen know that opiate derivatives slow down the peristaltic action, causing constipation, which is what I need.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 My peristaltic action slowed down. Is there anything herbal possibly that I could take or any other medicine that you know of that would slow my peristaltic action so that I do not dehydrate and have to go into for leaders of bringers lactate?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Sure. OK, well, Dr. Peay, if you have anything to mention, I've got.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Yeah. Have you tried antihistamines such as Cyproheptadine, which is both antiserotonin and antihistamine?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 No, sir, I haven't. I didn't. I didn't think of that. Neither is my doctor.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 An antihistamine to slow down peristaltic bowel action.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Yeah, they have a slight Belladonna atropine like side effect.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 I see. And what's that called again, sir?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 One which is both antiserotonin and antihistamine is called Cyproheptadine.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Cipro, I think it's C-Y-P-O or is it C-I-P-R-O?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 C-Y.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 C-Y-P-R-O, hep, H-E-P, T-A-D-I-N-E, Cipro, heptadiene.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Yes, I have it down, gentlemen. I want to thank you very much.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 And by the way, for some reason my mother knew that mono and polyunsaturated oils were the basis for lacquers, paints, and varnishes.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 That's right.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Before they discovered that crude oil was a cheaper base for those things.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 And she informed me at a very young age to only use butter, olive oil, or coconut oil.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 And I've been telling these organic hippies in these hills for years to quit eating organic poly and mono unsaturated oils.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 And they tell me, well, it's organic. And my argument is rattlesnake venom is organic too.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Do you think that's any good for you?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Good evening, gentlemen. Thank you very much for your help.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 You're very welcome. It's unfortunate, you know, we're just brainwashed.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 And you can't help but understand how people can be led astray.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 It's not their fault, perhaps. It's just the medical industry and the industries around that industry that are so powerful financially,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 have such vested interest in doing what they're doing that they don't fail to continue the propaganda that, you know, their liquid oils are good and polyunsaturated fats are bad.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 OK, so on a very quick note for an herbal perspective, as an astringent, that would be classically the description of a product in the bowel that would help loose,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 watery stools, which is certainly what you sound like you're talking about.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 So there'd be astringent, whether they're gentle astringent or something a little more tannin rich.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 Tannins are the things in teas that tend to dry or pucker your mouth up.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Tannins are used for diarrhea and there's many different classifications of astringents that could be used internally, perhaps.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 OK, so there's two more callers on the line. So let's get this next caller and find out where they're from.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Hello. I'm from Southern Humboldt.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Southern Humboldt. OK, welcome to the show.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 So you were talking about cholesterol levels earlier.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And I wonder what you think of high cholesterol, you know, HDL versus LDL and how important that is and what people need to do if you think it's important to keep the balance appropriate.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 OK, Dr. Peat?

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 Both of them are anti-inflammatory and that's part of the protective effect is the protein which carries the cholesterol itself has a very important biological effect,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 defending against things that would irritate and inflame. But some of the studies have shown that there's a close correlation between high HDL and some of the inflammatory diseases such as cancer,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 because it rises defensively against exposure to those chemical irritants.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 So the level of HDL or the proportion of the total cholesterol partly is just reflecting how stressful your environment is.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 For example, drinking too much alcohol will raise your HDL. Being exposed to too much of the fish oil type of irritation or peroxidation will raise your HDL defensively.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 So you're saying, again, the opposite of what we hear from the medical establishment. You're saying the HDL is the bad cholesterol?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 No, it's defensive. But having it high doesn't necessarily mean that you're on a good diet program because just drinking too much liquor can raise it.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 I see. And so if I got my blood tested and I had a certain ratio, what ratio would you say is kind of a good sign?

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 I don't think it is as simple as that, but two or three to one is usually reasonable.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Two or three LDL to one HDL.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Yeah.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 Thank you for your information.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 Okay, so there's another caller on the line, so let's take this next caller. You're on the air.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 Hello?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 Hi, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 Bloxburg. I have a speaker phone. Is it bothering it?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 No, I don't hear it.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 I have a couple of questions for you and the doctor. And number one is you're doing a great job.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 I'd like the doctor to describe the function of the lymphoid gland in the jaw area and what function it is.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 And is it dangerous to have a CAT scan in that area?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 The function of the what?

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 The function of the lymph gland or the lymph -- is it lymphoid or lymph gland?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Lymphoid tissue, is it?

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 Yeah, do you mean lymphoid tissue, the kind of -- the lymph that can come up under the angle of your jaw when you have tooth infection, say, or tonsillitis?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 Yeah, the glands in there, I guess they consider their glands.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 Yeah, maybe the parotids or the -- well, not that they're lymphoid, but --

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Hello?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Yeah, could you -- did you hear that, Dr. Peate?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 The caller is wondering about the connection between swollen lymph and whether or not CAT scans are safe.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 Oh, well, definitely CAT scans are not safe.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 That amount of radiation is known to have a permanently inflammatory action.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 The more of them you have, the more certain it is that there will be some lingering damage from them.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 But the swollen lymph glands, sometimes it can just mean that you're being exposed to allergens or possibly foods that you're somewhat sensitive to.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 It's very common in the spring to have a period of several of the lymph glands around the throat and neck to swell up because of air pollen and possibly changing foods from the season change.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Yes, am I still on?

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Yeah, you're on.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Did you hear that?

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 I had this little knot for about four years now, and I went to the doctors and they said to just keep an eye on it.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 It's better just to monitor it and watch it and make sure nothing happens.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 And then just recently, maybe within the last four or five months, it's like a little extra has developed on the side of it and starts swelling the side of my neck.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 I went and had a sonogram and it seemed to have some hard tissues there and stuff, and they want me to go in and have a CAT scan.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 So I felt I needed to talk to somebody, an herbalist or something.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 So is there some herbs or a diet that can reduce the swelling in this area?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 If it's hardened, that suggests that it might be becoming cancerous.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 So I would think that doing a biopsy would be reasonable if it's actually hardened over what it has been previously.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 It's grown about twice the size, and they put me on antibiotics, and the swelling has gone down.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 And then I stopped antibiotics for about a week, and then it continued to swell back up again.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 What area is it in?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 It's underneath the jaw, the corner of the jaw area, and they said it's a very sensitive area, and there are other glands, a saliva gland in that area,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 and they haven't been able to detect exactly what it is.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 If an antibiotic made it go down, I would just keep trying that line of approach

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 and maybe have a raw carrot every day to clean out your intestine.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 Now, we went to some of the herbal places, and they gave us a couple of various things that I don't have a list from.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Now, to cleanse your blood and to cleanse the lymph glands, is that a good idea while you're taking antibiotics?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 Eating a fiber like a raw carrot every day has an antibiotic action,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 and you have to know which herbs you're working with because some of them could increase inflammation.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 Okay.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 There are definitely things like gallium apirini, which is cleavers.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 There are definitely fresh juices of that, which is very well indicated for lymphadenopathy, as is pokeroot.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Pokeroot is extremely strong, and you definitely don't want to use too much of it

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 because it has a very narrow spectrum of activity beyond being toxic in its own right.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 And obviously things like Smilax, sarsaparilla, which is used as a lymphatic agent,

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 and blue flag, the iris verticolor, is also a good lymphatic agent.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 So they may well be worth you trying them.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Could I make a recommendation that the collar massage that area?

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 Because you can sometimes push those lymph obstructions through if you work on it.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 It's your body, and you can manipulate it however you like and destroy that thing.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 Get it through. Work it through your lymph system and make it pass on and get it out of there.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 It's not harmful to touch it or put mild pressure on it?

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 No.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 Okay. Well, thank you very much, and you guys do a great job.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 This is really good for the community, and I am in the Bloxburg area and hear you very well.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 Thank you very much.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 Thank you.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 I would definitely go easy before you start putting too much pressure on it, for sure.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 Okay.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 There's definitely some trains of thought that would also say that that in its own right might cause irritation locally.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Take it easy, but what Dr. Peat is saying initially is good advice.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 Antibiotics, a lot of gut-related things can show themselves in lymphatic swelling.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 So the fact that it's in the mouth, it's part of the GI tract, may well be relevant to the fact that some food or allergen,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 either aerosol, allergen, or edible, may be causing it.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 Okay.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 Thank you very much.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 We do have a couple more callers on the line, so let's give everyone a chance here.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 You're on the air?

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 You're on the air.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 Hello?

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 Hi. Good evening, Andrew and Dr. Peat.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 Where are you from?

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 Thank you for taking my call.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 My question was generally about the idea of stealth, that is, heart-to-death pathogens in the body, like Lyme, et cetera.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 I was wondering, Dr. Peat, what you think about those as maybe the root cause of such elements as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia?

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Specifically, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia are so closely related to nutrition and the hormones.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 I think the mysterious infections are over-diagnosed.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 Some doctors specialize in them because they're good business if you have to treat them for months at a time.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 But if you think you might have been exposed to something like that,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 a good course of the right antibiotics should clear it up in maybe two or three weeks.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 In many of your recommendations, you talk about diet and several other things.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 I was wondering if ever there are cases with stealth pathogens in which maybe like a catch-22 situation,

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 that they are somehow preventing the thyroid from functioning optimally, and so the thyroid can't then eradicate them?

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Well, just ordinary bacteria, any of dozens of different kinds of bacteria living in the small intestine, which should be sterile,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 this great range of bacteria in the intestine will cause enough toxicity to interfere,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 mixed with everything else to interfere with your thyroid function.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 So keeping the intestine clean is the first step.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 And that's increasing the transit time, or sorry, decreasing the transit time so you excrete waste more regularly.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 And then you've always mentioned raw grated carrots.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 So for people that are listening, the main reason Dr. Peat is promoting daily serving of raw grated carrot for people that have issues,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 especially GI, is that the carrots themselves, they're indigestible, number one, so you don't digest them.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 They pass through, but they have a very defined sweeping action on the bowel wall,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 basically either dislodging, removing waste, and/or absorbing excess and removing excess estrogen, which is one of the compounds.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 Yes, there have been some experiments with either antibiotics in the intestine will lower estrogen and cortisol and increase the protective hormones.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 Carrots do the same thing.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 Apparently, both antibiotics and carrots are working by lowering the endotoxin absorption.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 The carrots actually carry away a lot of the estrogen, which otherwise would be recycled, reabsorbed, and passed through the liver again.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 Good. So just another reminder, folks, good old carrots.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 I remember what Dr. Peat said about carrots as well.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 If you've got carrots in the bottom of your refrigerator, they can be there for months, and they're very hard to break down.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 But they're also very good at having an antibiotic action in the gut.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 We've got one or two more callers, so let's take the next caller.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 We've got two more, so let's see how we can get through.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 Hello?

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 Hi. Yeah, I do have a cholesterol question, but first, that fellow who had the lump,

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 you were saying that if it was hardening that he should probably have a biopsy to make sure that it's not cancer,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 and that was kind of glossed over.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 Well, I mean, he can do all kinds of things, but if it's cancerous and he's not addressing that,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 I mean, cancer can be cured much better when you catch it quickly.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 So don't you think he should have a biopsy anyway, even though he's going to do other things?

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 Well, if it softens and seems normal after taking an antibiotic for a few days, that means pretty well that it wasn't cancer.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 I thought that he just said that it -- yeah, it wasn't -- it went down and then it went back up again,

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 but the hardness, I don't know.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 I don't know that it softened.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 He just said it got smaller and then it got big again.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 Yeah, the hardness is a very accurate way to diagnose.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 They found that when doing breast cancer surgery, that just feeling the lymph nodes in the armpit,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 they can diagnose accurately just by whether they're hard or not, whether there's cancer in them.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 So you're saying if he took the antibiotic and the swelling went down,

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 it wouldn't do that if it was hardened cancer?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 Yeah, it would stay hard.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 Okay.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 Okay. Would it stay the same size?

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 No, it could get smaller, but if the part of it is hardened and cancerous,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 it has like a mesh of compacted collagen surrounding the cells which are becoming defective,

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 and that collagen takes days or weeks to soften up when it's being cured.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 Okay, so you don't think he needs a biopsy.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Okay.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 My question is, my daughter recently had a blood workup thing, and it says that her cholesterol is 264.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 Now, I know I'm very well aware that we're cholesterol phobic

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 and that it's okay for it to be over -- you said around 220 is okay, but is 264 a little bit too high?

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 How old is she?

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 She's in her early 40s.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 Yeah, I think that's probably just expressing low thyroid function.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 The cholesterol is the precursor to several of the protective hormones, pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHEA.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 Well, she's had thyroid problems,

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 and she's going to get reevaluated to see if she's on the right level of medication

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 because she seems to need to take thyroid.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 I think her thyroid doesn't produce enough on its own.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 When the thyroid function goes down, your cholesterol goes up in a defensive reaction,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 trying to keep the production of those protective hormones up.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 So when you take thyroid, you start turning cholesterol into the good stuff,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 and so the cholesterol goes down.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 So she just needs to address the thyroid and then take it from there, and it'll probably balance.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 Yeah, and temperature and pulse rate and appetite and quality of sleep are good indicators of thyroid function.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 Okay, and you don't think that eating butter and beef fat is going to clog your arteries?

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 Do you think that's not true?

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 No, probably not.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 I have to jump in again.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 Thank you.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 Dr. Peter, Sarah has called in, and she's afraid you haven't made it completely clear

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 of which are the polyunsaturated oils and which are the saturated oils.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 I thought you'd been pretty clear about it tonight.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, let's hand it over to you to quickly define the polyunsaturates.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 And we've only got two minutes to go.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 Then I will make sure people get your information, and thank you very much.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 So just define the polys for us.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 Yeah, if you just name some of the popular ones,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 mayonnaise is almost always highly unsaturated, corn oil, safflower oil.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 Hemp seed oil.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 Yeah, linseed oil and fish oil.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 And olive oil contains about 10% of the potentially dangerous polyunsaturateds,

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 and it has so much of the monounsaturated that it's relatively safe.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 And all the seed oils are the same thing, right?

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 Yeah, olive oil is a fruit oil, technically.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 Okay, let me hold you there.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Thanks so much for joining us.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 It's been a great show.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 We've had to cut off at least four or five callers,

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 so let me give you the details out, if you will.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 Okay.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat can be reached on his website, www.raypeat.com,

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:20.000
