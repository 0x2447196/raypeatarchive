 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is Juan, Radionetwork.com.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.480
 Well, a very pleasant good morning to you. Welcome back. Hope you enjoyed Dr. Massey.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 He's always fun and likewise always fun and informative. Here's our next guest. He's here

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.880
 on the third Monday of the month at 1130 Central. It's Dr. Ray Peat. He's been a nutritional

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:43.440
 counselor a very long time, a PhD from the University of Oregon, specialization in physiology,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.800
 and he wrote his dissertation in '72. He outlined his ideas on progesterone and the hormones

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:58.080
 closely related to it. His main thesis is that energy and structure are independent at every

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:06.960
 level. Energy and structure are independent at every level. That's a mouthful, Dr. Peat. Good

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:17.520
 morning. Good morning. Interdependent. Interdependent. So tell us what that means.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:28.000
 I think St. George was one of the first people to point that out with his studies of the rabbit

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 heart, for example. There's a thing called the staircase effect where if you accelerate the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:49.520
 stimulation of the heart, each beat gets bigger, so a tracing of it rises like a stair step. He

00:01:49.520 --> 00:02:00.880
 explains that the structure that governs the contraction builds up sort of the way if your

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:12.320
 heart doesn't get a lot of blood to fill it very quickly, then it has a very weak beat and fails

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:21.840
 to make that staircase effect as it accelerates. That's typical of shock. In the normal heart,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.680
 if you need more blood, your heart will accelerate, but besides accelerating, each pump gets bigger

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.640
 because more blood is returning quickly to fill it. In the healthy normal state, progesterone

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.720
 is essential for being able to build up that structure that allows it to beat harder rather

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.400
 than just faster. So the anti-shock effect on your heart is a characteristic of progesterone.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:08.160
 It's very similar to the effects of DHEA and digitalis or digitoxin, the cardiac glycoside.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.480
 In a way, progesterone is our natural cardiac glycoside that allows us to build the structure

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:27.760
 that performs the strong beat. Under the influence of estrogen, like shock, the heart can't build the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:36.640
 structure. So when you stimulate it faster, it just has a weaker beat, if anything, as it goes

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.840
 faster. So it's possibly even a negative staircase under the influence of estrogen, which is

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:54.000
 preventing the building of structure in the tissue under the influence of energy expense.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.400
 So that would be more like anxiety, would be a faster heart rate, but it's weaker.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:13.760
 Yeah, anxiety borders on the shock state to some degree, like panic.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.600
 Is that then estrogenic? High estrogen causes that?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:30.000
 It's a whole range of physiological things that are analogous to estrogen. Lactic acid

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:42.800
 is the characteristic thing in panic attacks. The estrogen anti-staircase action or pro-shock action

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:53.840
 involves the substitution of lactic acid for carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide helps you to

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.600
 relax and restore your structures that guarantee performance.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.840
 That's why breathing into a bag or not over-breathing helps with the anxiety or panic

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.800
 attacks. Yeah. And if you practice something like swimming as far as you can underwater,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:24.000
 that gradually builds up the effect of retaining more carbon dioxide and having less anxiety.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.680
 So anxiety is tied, though, with, it could be, as you say, a multitude of factors to be the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.040
 causative for anxiety or fast heart rate or something. Thinking that motions could all be

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.960
 tied in together with even high estrogen, dietary-wise? Oh, most often it is. Yeah,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.120
 low thyroid, high estrogen. Low thyroid, high estrogen. Wow.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.320
 So that's why when people are manipulating their little thyroid beds,

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.640
 they can feel it. If they got too much or too little. Wow.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:10.640
 Interesting. We were talking about it before. You've actually experimented with

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.360
 getting carbon dioxide and putting it in your bathtub and laying in there?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.960
 A big plastic bag will do. Really?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:28.480
 But if you don't have a lot of breeze in your bathroom, then you can plug the drains with tape

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.880
 Right.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:38.480
 and fill it up and carefully get in. You can test the level of carbon dioxide by having a candle

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:48.400
 that you, or just striking a match so you can see exactly where the surface of the carbon dioxide is.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.600
 Isn't it? So you can actually take a candle, move it down the tub, and as soon as the candle goes

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.520
 out, you know that's where the carbon dioxide level is. Yeah. And for more than 100 years,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:10.800
 people have described the effect. For example, one source said sitting in a tub of CO2 for

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.000
 an hour or so is like a day at the beach for feeling rejuvenated.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.440
 Is that right? And have you done this before? Oh yeah.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:27.920
 Do you do it often? It's not very convenient to sit around in a plastic bag,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.680
 but sometimes we watch TV while sitting in these giant bags.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.400
 So you could actually, you've made a bag so you put the carbon dioxide in a bag?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:48.800
 You empty a big bag and then put the CO2. Put a hose in the bag and fill it up so there's no

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:56.880
 air there, all pure CO2, and then carefully get in the bag without tipping the top and spilling the

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.120
 gas. So why doesn't the CO2 must then be heavy? And so that's why it stays where you put it.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.320
 Yeah, much heavier than air. Much heavier than air. Have you done it in the bathtub as well?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:15.440
 And it's just more user-friendly to do it with a bag rather than a bathtub?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.320
 Yeah, because if there's a breeze, you lose the CO2 fairly quickly.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.960
 Any kind of a breeze, wow. So it's not that heavy. I mean, heavy enough to withstand a breeze, right?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:37.920
 Yeah, like if there's a crack in the window, a little movement of air will cause turbulence and

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.440
 takes about 10 minutes to empty a tub.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.960
 Whoa, so you really have to be careful. And where do you get this CO2? Where do you get it?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:58.320
 A welder shop. A tank that is possible to move is very heavy, but a tank about two feet tall

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.760
 holds 10 kilograms of it, and you can get several dozen bags full out of that.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:15.440
 Wow, so if you just get a two foot tall CO2, you can get quite a few bags full in that.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:22.560
 Yeah, it's something you can, if you're fairly strong, you can carry it from your car to the

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.600
 house. Sure. Yeah. How much does it weigh about? Any idea?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:35.840
 The metal tank probably weighs 30 pounds in itself, and so with 10 kilos of gas in it.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:43.680
 50 pounds, right? Yeah. And the alternative would be the huge things that you need a

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:51.120
 hand cart to move. Yeah, you could get a dolly and get it from your car. Wow,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.840
 that's pretty interesting. So this bag, where do you get that? Is that like just a big trash bag?

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:03.200
 That'll do. Sometimes you can find one that reaches all the way to your neck.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:11.360
 Huh. But armpits is good enough. Oh, so if you just get as high as you can. Have you ever seen

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:18.240
 somebody actually makes these bags that you could purchase? I don't know who sells them, but

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:26.800
 we got some, for example, from a florist supply wholesaler that specializes in

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.600
 plastic wraps and such, but I'm not sure of where a reliable source is.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.720
 I'll be. I bet you somebody could find one of them. I bet somebody makes one of those,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.320
 you think? I mean, they probably. Oh, sure. There are people

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.200
 working on fairly elaborate things like a suit you can put on.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:56.240
 Really? Wow, that's fascinating. A couple years ago, we talked to a fellow, and he kind of talked

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:04.480
 me into getting an oxygen tank and filling up a big, huge plastic thing, right? And then you put

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.880
 on a mask, and then you breathe oxygen while you exercise. But I kind of got rid of it pretty soon.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:18.080
 I sent it back. It didn't feel right. That's not a good idea, right? Yeah, it can hurt your lungs to

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:30.320
 breathe high concentration oxygen. Wow. And a few hospitals make a carbon dioxide to oxygen

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:40.000
 mixture called carbogen that was proven to be the proper way to resuscitate people and to

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:49.040
 maintain people with breathing problems. But in 1955, a British government committee

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:58.480
 declared that when you're suffocating, adding carbon dioxide is the last thing you want to do.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:06.160
 But in fact, it's essential for delivering oxygen to the tissues to have a certain amount of CO2

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.480
 present. And so pure oxygen is just about the worst thing you can do it. Wow. First harms the

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:20.960
 lungs, and then the brain. So when they put people on oxygen at the hospital,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:29.760
 that's other than the very best thing for them. It's kind of the rule for something with a stroke.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:38.640
 The reasoning is that like hyperventilating, or is your CO2. And in effect, you're making the

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:47.760
 stroke patient hyperventilate by giving them oxygen without CO2. And that shrinks constricts

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.120
 the brain and blood vessels and reduces circulation to the brain. Not good.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:03.280
 That is not at all good for the brain. But the reasoning is that injuries to the brain causes

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:13.760
 edema that causes increased pressure with problems. So they want to shrink the delivery of

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:24.480
 blood to the brain. CO2 just isn't scientifically based. But it's like 99% of the hospitals in the

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:33.920
 US still refuse to use carbogen. Carbogen. So 99% of the hospitals, they don't they refuse to use it

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:40.800
 or don't know about it. One of the other. Yeah, up until 1955. It was used everywhere,

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:48.000
 practically. Wow. Then this ignorant declaration of the British Medical Committee

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:58.080
 spread around the world and hospitals swallowed it without evidence. Now there's a couple of groups

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:06.160
 in the US showing that carbogen protects the lungs, heals the lungs, protects the brain,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:16.000
 all the organs safely delivers oxygen to them, reduces edema. CO2, one of its

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:28.160
 obvious effects is to reduce edema. If, for example, you injure your hand or your lower leg,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:39.280
 you can put it in a small plastic bag of CO2. And in about an hour, you get pain relief and

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:48.160
 the elimination of the swelling and edema. Fascinating. So up until '55, carbogen was

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:56.080
 routinely used when they went to the hospital and then this British medical thing came out and then

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.400
 they just changed it. They just stopped doing it. Right. Wow. Man.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:15.360
 There were several changes around 1964. Something that hospitals had been doing right

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:26.800
 seemed illogical and someone said, "No, that's going to hurt the patient rather than

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:38.960
 healing them," as had been observed. For example, brain injury causes brain swelling.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:50.000
 It was found that quite a lot of extra urea added to their system, either orally or in the bloodstream,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:01.680
 resolved the brain edema. Someone conceptualized that as an osmotic effect.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:14.320
 And so they counted the number of molecules in a gram of urea and were previously

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:28.640
 isotonic salt solution, normal for the body fluids, had been used with added urea. So by number,

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:36.000
 it seemed to be hyperosmotic. And so people doing their arithmetic, but not their science,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:48.080
 thought that using distilled water with the proper concentration of urea was proper,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:56.560
 not to use saline solution. And since urea is not an osmotically active molecule the way salt is,

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:06.160
 what it amounted to was giving an intravenous solution of distilled water, and that breaks

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:18.720
 your red blood cells and interrupts the delivery of oxygen. So after one or a few people

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:28.640
 miscalculated and didn't use the facts about urea, that convinced people that urea was going to

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.000
 break down of red blood cells and that stopped its use for brain swelling.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.440
 But it could be used if it was used properly.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:48.000
 Yeah, and it was used for heart failure patients, for example, and kept a failing heart working

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.280
 for years and years, just taking it orally because of the anti-edema effect.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:18:00.640
 Could that be an argument why some people advocate urine therapy, drinking some of your own

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.600
 pee in the morning? Yeah, I'm sure that's part of it.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:17.840
 Part of the misconception of what urea is, is the concept of uremic poisoning for your kidneys

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:27.760
 are failing because they call it uremic. They think urea might be the cause of uremia.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:40.480
 In fact, it's counterbalancing the toxic effect of intestinal toxins formed from breaking down food,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:48.320
 especially breaking down serotonin. It's intestinal toxins that accumulate

00:18:49.520 --> 00:19:01.440
 in uremia and poison the kidneys. But urea is an anti-edema, anti-inflammatory substance.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.360
 How could that idea of urine therapy, just from your perspective,

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.920
 there's a lot of people that do it. I've drunk pretty every morning for 20 years. I don't know

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:20.480
 why. Why does it work? The kidneys aren't putting out waste material?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:33.520
 Oh, sure they do. But they use healthy cows sometimes for the source of the urea. I think

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:42.000
 that's better than having a sick person drink their urine because a sick person is going to have

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.440
 the toxins from the intestine. Because when you're sick, you're trying to discharge toxins.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.720
 Yeah. The liver detoxifies them and it leaves through the kidneys.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.720
 As you probably know, all of these porta-potties around the world, they sell this urine.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:06.160
 Really? Oh, yeah. They sell it. I think it's Sandoz, S-A-N-D-O-Z. They sell it. The Swiss company,

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:14.240
 they sell it. They clean it up and they put it in most face creams, right? Most face creams and

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.720
 cosmetics for women and all that. Guys, too. All has urine here, doesn't it?

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.480
 The bulk of urea on the market is chemically produced.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.120
 Is it? Wow.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:35.600
 Just ammonia and carbon dioxide combined to make urea. That's one of the functions of CO2 in the

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:43.600
 body is to combine with the toxic ammonia and eliminate it as a safe urea.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.040
 It's eliminated as a safe urea. Wow. That's what carbon dioxide does.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.600
 Yeah. Detoxifies the ammonia.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:58.640
 And then the CO2 can be retained with things like butyco-breathing and

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.680
 just not over-breathing, right? And retaining more CO2, right?

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.640
 Wow. I'm going to call around with some welding shops and they'll sell you or rent you the whole

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:17.920
 tank and everything. You just go pick it up? Yep. You take the empty one in and they

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.440
 give you a full one for, it costs about $20.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.320
 Oh, you probably have to buy the first one, buy the first tank?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:32.720
 Yeah. That's a good idea to spend $60 or whatever for having a tank of your own.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.800
 A 10 kilo you would get 10 kilo?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.200
 Yeah. I think they often charge about $2 a kilogram.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.320
 I think. Somebody wrote in and said, "Would a cadaver bag work for a CO2 bag?"

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:57.120
 I think so. Experimenters at high altitudes had, I think it was like a cadaver bag that zipped up

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:06.400
 and made a fairly tight seal that they would put them in the bag with oxygen at the high altitude

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:14.160
 and the oxygen they thought was curing their altitude sickness. But being in the closed bag,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:24.640
 they quickly filled up the bag with CO2 as they consumed oxygen. So someone just put some CO2 in

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:35.840
 a bag and found that it cured mountain sickness. After that, lots of people going skiing at a high

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:44.960
 altitude would take a little hand-sized tank of CO2 with them and take a whiff when they started

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.280
 feeling altitude sick. Rather than oxygen? Rather than oxygen.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.720
 It's the main therapeutic thing that prevents lung edema.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:02.320
 Isn't that fascinating? That's amazing. The whole hospital thing is just to me, just wow.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.960
 Is it any wonder that once you go to the hospital, so many people just have a hard time getting out

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:17.120
 of there? Is it any wonder? Yeah. They're ruled by formulas that they don't understand how to apply

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:25.840
 in many cases. It's really pretty unusual when you find someone in the hospital who

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.640
 reasons properly rather than by rote formula.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:41.360
 Here's an email from George. Patrick talks about in the Molecular Hydrogen Institute,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.920
 they use hydrogen that he breathes for stroke patients. Does Dr. Peat know why that would be

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:55.120
 the case? It's anti-inflammatory. That's its number one thing, right? Anti-inflammatory.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:03.440
 So a stroke is an inflammation process? Yeah. Immediately when there's some

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:13.520
 injury to the brain, edema starts setting in and spreading the influence from the injured cells

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:22.480
 to healthy cells. It can spread clot formation as well as inflammation. It's important to

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:31.840
 catch it quickly after a stroke using things like CO2 and aspirin and progesterone.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:41.360
 Back to this progesterone idea, that's why you created a little product. I think it's Progest-Ease

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.720
 and you just recommend a little dab of that every day, correct?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:57.200
 Yeah. When a person is under some kind of stress like aging or if they've been unable to control

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:05.920
 their own estrogen levels, a combination of thyroid and progesterone will tend to correct the

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:13.040
 estrogen excess. The estrogen excess. Could that be similar to what this stroke...

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.640
 What's that? How do you say it? Strophanthesis that Dr. Cowan talks about? It's this climbing

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:27.520
 ivy out of Brazil for heart. Do you know the function of that? What do they call that?

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:34.640
 Something that's a plant, strophanthin. Yeah, strophanthin, right.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.760
 It's similar to digitalis and progesterone in their effect.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:48.080
 Similar kind of an idea, right? Here's an email. What are the details of carbon dioxide therapy

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.240
 or is the best place to buy or rent a CO2 tank? Does it take more than a regular bathtub plug

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.240
 to keep the CO2 from leaking? We covered a lot of that.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:10.640
 You say you would just tape up the drain, right? Yeah. If you think you're going to stay in the tub

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:20.320
 for a long time and want to really save it, I will usually put a layer of tin foil over the drains

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:27.440
 and then tape that down. It won't go at all through the tin foil, but it will slowly go through

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:36.480
 tape. Kind of sneaky. I hear you saying that the bag idea could be easier to work with.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.200
 Yeah, a lot easier. We just got to find a bag that may be up to your neck or something and

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.800
 just make sure it doesn't leak out. What keeps it from leaking out? Just

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:54.400
 tape? Keeping the opening of the bag higher than the bulk of the bag. Oh, so it works the same way.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:01.440
 It's just not going to run out of there, right? Yeah. Some people put a bungee cord around the

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.720
 top of the bag to tighten it. How long do you sit in there? An hour, typically.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:17.040
 Then you just let it go after that, huh? Yeah. When you are doing it just on one arm, for example,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:26.800
 in 30 minutes to an hour, that arm becomes pink. It will keep its pinkness relative to the rest

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:36.800
 of your body for a few hours because all of the tissue becomes so saturated with CO2 that it

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.640
 remains for quite a while after you stop putting it in through the skin.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:45.600
 But is this more than just an hour symptomatic thing, feel good and

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.560
 benefit? Is this CO2 going deep in there and helping long-term?

00:27:51.600 --> 00:28:05.120
 Yeah. There's fairly recent research in Japan using it to treat cancer of the mouth or places

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:16.080
 where you can deliver the gas. A very old book written, I think, in 1905 gives a history

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:25.440
 up until then of using it to treat various diseases, including cancer, or they can apply it,

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:36.160
 for example, to the uterus or to the breast or any place that's accessible to flooding it with CO2.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:52.080
 For almost 200 years, people have been recognizing that natural carbon dioxide springs,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:29:02.560
 for example, are therapeutic. Priestley, the oxygen discoverer, was interested in the

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:11.440
 therapeutic effects of these naturally carbonated springs, and so he was working on carbonating

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:24.080
 water as a therapy. That was very influential. It actually started the practice of carbonating water.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:32.480
 First it was for medicine, but then people liked the flavor of it, and so they kept doing it for

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.000
 just a pleasant drink. So in general, is carbonated water pretty good to drink?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.600
 Oh, yeah. If you take it gradually so you don't burp it all out,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.720
 it gets into your cells and acidifies a stressed cell. Under stress, the inside of a cell

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:06.880
 becomes relatively alkaline, where it should be slightly acidic, and replenishing the CO2

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:16.400
 restores the natural acidity of all of your cells. You can do that with baking soda.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:25.840
 Same thing. You have to do it in stages. One person treated his cancer for years with,

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:38.480
 I think, two ounces of baking soda during the day, divided up in three or four tablespoons

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:48.080
 in a glass of water during the day. In your body, the absorbed baking soda, bicarbonate,

00:30:48.080 --> 00:31:02.800
 sodium is quickly eliminated by the kidneys, and that lets the bicarbonate equilibrate with the

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:10.400
 cells. If they're under stress, it turns into CO2 and acidifies the cell, for example,

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:17.760
 the cancer cell or the stressed cell. So that is why... Who was a fellow, Dr. Peat?

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:26.080
 Simoncini in Italy, and he was using baking soda to go in and go after cancer cells, right?

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:34.000
 Yeah, it actually works. He was helping lots of people, but he was strangely

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:46.640
 saying that cancer is just a fungus. That didn't go over well with this establishment.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:54.640
 So they watched him closely. He had lots of people he was treating, and when one of them died of

00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:03.280
 their cancer, he was arrested and imprisoned. If you did that with every person treating cancer,

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:09.280
 you'd have hundreds of American doctors imprisoned.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.960
 They put him in prison, Dr. Peat?

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.180
 Yep.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:17.520
 Yeah, we interviewed him years ago. It's still on our website somewhere, the show,

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.560
 if you'd like to look it up. Simoncini, and we called him in Italy. Interesting fellow.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.000
 Do you know, is he still in prison, or did he ever get out?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.720
 No, he was sentenced to five years, but I don't know how much he actually served.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:38.400
 Then a second patient died, and they took away his license.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.480
 Probably be a good interview now, right? See what's going on.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.560
 Yeah, I'll check him out, see if I can find him again. Dr. Peat, stay right there. Ray Peat,

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:54.160
 Patrick Timpone, One Radio. Boy, what a strange world we're living in now.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.920
 How many people must die of cancer, and they blame it.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.400
 If you'd like to get Dr. Peat's newsletter, it's a great one.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.080

 and Ray Peat's on the 800 line. So just use email if you'd like to give him a question.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.400
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.280
 One of the very first things I do in the morning is come sit at my meditation chair,

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:43.680
 and that's when I take my dual extracted mushrooms from Surthrival, the Chaga and the Reishi.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.800
 Both of these mushrooms are immunomodulators. If you had too strong of an immune system,

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:54.480
 like autoimmunity, it'll help to downregulate and calm the immune system. If you have too

00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.640
 weak of an immune system, like an immunodeficiency, they help to upregulate or strengthen your immune

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:05.520
 system. So whatever you're dealing with, they help to bring your immune system to balance.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:12.000
 In addition to being immunomodulators and adaptogens, Chaga is probably best known for

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.280
 its extremely high aurac value or antioxidant content. It scavenges the body of free radicals.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.800
 And Reishi has a long history being used in conjunction with meditation and for reaching

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.520
 higher states of consciousness. And that's why I like to take these right before my meditation.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.000
 There's a lot of medicinal mushroom supplements on the market to choose from, but most are made

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.200
 with cheaply produced mushrooms grown on grain and either ground up and put in capsules or

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:46.320
 extracted in non-organic alcohol. Surthrival does it differently. We use wild harvested Chaga and

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:53.040
 organic certified wood-grown Reishi fruit bodies, not the mycelial extract. And then we use an

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:59.840
 organic alcohol and a hot water extraction method and then recombine so you get the full benefits

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:06.240
 of these extremely high quality mushrooms. These are really, really great products.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:14.160

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:36.080
 because it's a great sale. Daniel Vitalis talks about his two premier medicinal mushroom products,

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.840
 Chaga and Reishi. Because Reishi and Chaga are considered not just adaptogens, but they're also

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:47.360
 considered immunomodulators, they're safe for daily consumption for a lifetime. There's a lot

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.080
 of herbs, as you know, Patrick, a lot of herbs are not that way. So many medicinal herbs are meant to

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.960
 be used for short periods of time. But there are those few that can be used daily forever and

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.320
 medicinal mushrooms are that way. So these would be called the tonic, tonic herbs. Yes, they're

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:06.400
 essentially tonic. But if we want to get even more specific, they're adaptogenic. I feel like we've

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.520
 set a new standard and it's going to, we raised the bar, but check it out, see where the bar has

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:14.240
 to back it up, that distilled water bubbled with hydrogen is a very good way to go. George Wiseman

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:21.120
 is an authority on hydrogen. 98% of my fluid intake of all beverages have been distilled water

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.360
 that's been bubbled with the Brown's gas. I am now younger biologically than I was back then.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.440
 This is why I'm saying that a lot of what happens with spring water, for example, is you get,

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:36.160
 not only you might get the hydrogen, but you'll get minerals that are not necessarily bioavailable.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.640
 A lot of places has excess calcium, for example, and ends up with calcium deposits in the body

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.360
 because you're getting too much calcium, even if it is bioavailable. Now that I've been inhaling

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:51.600
 the hydrogen, I find that I get my major nutrition, which is the hydrogen, calorie free. So I was able

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.880
 to lose a few extra pounds. The cells won't regenerate. You won't have stem cells and that

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.840
 sort of thing. If you have got enough hydrogen, your cells have a certain life and they're shutting

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.440
 down if they're not getting their hydrogen. They're literally dehydrating. That's where the

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:15.840
 word comes from. Dehydrate, go figure. Dehydration, which is dehydrogen. Exactly. Whoa. Maybe you'd

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.760
 like to eat a little less food and stay hydrated. We know how important hydration is. It's my key.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:29.600
 The Aqua-Q machine bubbles hydrogen gas in your water and also breathe it in your body. 10% off.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:34.640
 Now I'm going to interrupt you, Patrick, because we have 20% off. I think you're going to like this

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.840
 technology. I've had it for a couple of years. I breathe it often throughout the day as I work on

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:48.400
 my screenwriting downstairs. I can do my exercises and lift weights or chin-ups or hang or jump on

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.640
 the trampoline. My little rebounder, breathe the hydrogen. And then I've been bubbling the water a

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:01.360
 lot more since we had George on last week. And I have to tell you, you can feel, you know, I just

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:07.120
 fell off the wagon as far as drinking the water, but you can feel the hydration effects. Something

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:13.920
 just really good about it, especially about 30 minutes before you reach for digestion. I'm just

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.960
 digesting. I guess it's just helping the stomach acid thing to do its thing. I'm not sure. That's

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:40.560
 he has safety features that not too many of them have or hardly any of them have. And hydrogen is

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.920
 a very volatile, not volatile, that's not a good word, but it's a very powerful gas. I mean,

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:53.040
 they can do hydrogen buses and hydrogen bombs for that matter. So it's a very prolific molecule

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.840
 on both sides of the periodic table, but you got to be careful with it. And that's why George's

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:04.640
 machines are very safe. And I'm very confident that I use it. And he has all the different

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:10.480

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:37.200
 Well, we have the honor of talking with Dr. Ray Peat every third Wednesday. Dr. Peat,

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.480
 thank you so much for coming on the show. We deeply appreciate your time. Thank you.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:51.680
 Okay. I wanted to mention that the newsletter has changed to quarterly instead of bimonthly. So

00:40:52.320 --> 00:41:01.760
 now there are four issues instead of six per year. But the subscription can still be for 12 issues.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:08.320
 Now it takes three years to get 12 issues. And what is the subscription cost?

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:18.640
 Pretty close to what it was. I'm not sure because we have just changed, but it's something like

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:32.720
 $30 probably for 12 issues. That's great. And that's correct, right? RayPeatsNewsletter@gmail.com.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:42.800
 Yeah, somebody sent me this. Our Lin who takes our notes, 2018, he received a Simoncini, a five-year

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.440
 jail sentence, culpable manslaughter of cancer patient. Wow. And then in 18,

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:58.640
 that's what, got two, oh, and his assistant radiologist, Romberto Gandini, got two years

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:09.040
 in jail, both were found guilty of manslaughter. That's really something. Wow. So let's see if I

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:17.840
 get my mouse to work here, Doc. Let's see if we can go to some emails. Okay. Oh, I wanted to mention

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:24.320
 this and get your take on it. Adam Bergstrom, who's a big fan of yours, and he kind of got turned

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:29.840
 on to orange juice from you long ago, and he's on our show regularly. He lives out in California.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:39.120
 He said that the orange juice thing just kind of cures his edema. It just went away. What's up

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:52.080
 with that? Yeah, orange juice is one of the most available and pleasant to use sources of the

00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:02.560
 flavonoids. Coffee and purple grape juice are other good sources, but for quantity use, orange

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:09.600
 juice contains a great variety of the anti-inflammatory flavonoids. So the flavonoids,

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:17.920
 but, and coffee actually has it as well. Yeah, quercetin is a major flavonoid, but there's

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:27.840
 several minor ones in coffee. Well, that's really, really something. And orange juice

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:37.680
 tastes great. I mean, holy cow. Yeah. Did you ever hear of Johanna Brandt's

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:47.040
 Grape Cure? She wrote a little book about six years ago, and the purple grapes are

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.640
 an extremely good source of the flavonoids.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:44:00.080
 People actually did, didn't they call it the Grape Cure, Cure Doc, or something like that?

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:09.280
 Yeah, but some of the institutionalized places charged horrible amounts and gave them watered down

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:18.400
 grape juice. They essentially were putting them on a semi-fast and collecting their money.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.080
 Yeah, I guess now these days you can get organic grape juice. Even Welch's has an organic

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:34.800
 variety these days. Yeah, yeah. Orange juice for daily use is, for drinking a quantity of it,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:42.000
 it's more pleasant for a lot of people. Sure. Here's an email for Dr. Peat from Phil.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.480
 He's in London. Dr. Peat, you recommended button mushrooms on one of Patrick's shows.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.040
 What are your thoughts on other mushrooms like shiitake or oyster mushrooms?

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:59.920
 Oh, oysters are my favorite. Oyster mushrooms, they're good, aren't they? Yeah. Shiitakes?

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:08.720
 I don't think I've enjoyed them. I think I tried them once,

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:17.760
 but if they taste good and they're well cooked, I think they're all going to have some benefits.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.400
 And so most mushrooms, if they're well cooked, are beneficial for us. Most mushrooms.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.720
 Can you please ask Dr. Peat this?

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:40.640
 White blood cell count in the blood could be the cause of, and she'd like to increase

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:47.680
 the white blood cell count. It's usually a sign of stress or infection.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:54.160
 Mm-hmm. But in an extreme depleted condition, I suppose

00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:03.920
 you can actually have too few white blood cells. But general nutrition and

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:11.840
 anti-inflammatory conditions tend to normalize either high or low white blood cells.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:24.800
 Here's an email from Lily. She has what's been diagnosed as dysmenorrhea. D-Y-S-M-E-N-O-R-R-H-E.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:34.800
 She's 45 and she vomits, have the shake sweats, and severe menstrual cramping.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.040
 And this has been going on for a long time. No gynecologist understands it.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.840
 They all say I produce too much progesterone. Is this true cause of it? They put me on a pill

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:52.320
 when I was 25. I was on the pill for over 10 years. I've been off the pill since 18. But every month

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:58.000
 I eat Advil like it's candy. I want to have normal menstrual periods and get off the ibuprofen.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.560
 Any ideas Dr. Peat has? Wow.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:10.720
 I think actually aspirin is in the long run safer than ibuprofen, although anything

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:20.640
 anti-inflammatory helps. But hypothyroidism is the main cause for dysmenorrhea, leading to

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:31.200
 high estrogen and relatively low progesterone and prolonged bleeding. I've known women who

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:41.120
 have been hemorrhaging for three weeks or longer, very heavy bleeding, who were able to turn off

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:54.000
 the menorrhea just with frequent doses of T3 triiodothyronine, the quickly active thyroid.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:04.560
 And it's fairly well recognized that it goes with hyperlactin, high estrogen,

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:11.200
 and low thyroid and low progesterone. So literally you're suggesting she look

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.640
 at her thyroid carefully, make sure her TSH is like 0.5 or below.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.640
 Yeah, and checking body temperature and pulse rate.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:27.440
 And for a woman her age, she's 45, a good pulse rate would be in the neighborhood of?

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:37.680
 It should be in the 70s when waking up and then during normal daily activity in the 80s.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.360
 Different for guys?

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.520
 What was that?

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.320
 Different for men?

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:50.080
 Oh, not very different, but women have smaller hearts generally and so slightly faster pulse.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.640
 Dr. Peat, do you know of any bad effects from taking

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.280
 cascara sagrada? What are the benefits? Thank you.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:08.080
 If it hasn't been properly aged, it causes overstimulation, irritation, cramping,

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:17.760
 considerable pain. But when it's very well aged and is darker than chocolate,

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:30.240
 approaching the dark rose coffee color, then it doesn't have that stimulating cramping effect.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:40.000
 What it does is reduce inflammation and increase the flow of water through the intestine

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.080
 to soften the stool or prevent over dehydration of the stool.

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:57.440
 And the FDA several years ago took it off the market as a laxative. At that time,

00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:06.480
 the pharmaceutical industry was investigating it, discovering that its main

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:16.240
 active ingredient, Imodin, was very promising as a cancer treatment. But the FDA used the excuse

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:24.880
 of calling it a possible carcinogen to take it off the market because they wanted to promote

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:41.760
 a better equivalent. Except it turned out that the maximum safe use period was only five or six

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:48.080
 months. At the end of that time, they said, "Then you have to find some other laxative." But they

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:56.560
 had taken cascara off the market, so the real alternative didn't exist. It turned out that

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:06.480
 very quickly they took this new laxative, a proprietary chemical, off the market because it

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:16.320
 was causing death of the colon. Death of the colon? Yeah. It reduced the blood supply to the

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:27.280
 colon by increasing serotonin. The serotonin was causing increased spastic type stimulation.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:36.560
 That would force the bowel to move for a while, but then it was creating chronic irritation and

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:42.880
 deprivation of oxygen to the intestine, so they had to have their colons removed.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:49.680
 Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Now, but so I suspect then if one is a good researcher,

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:54.880
 they could find a cascara sergrata that is well-aged. You just have to figure it, find it,

00:51:54.880 --> 00:52:05.600
 right? Yeah. The whole ploy calling it a potential carcinogen really was motivated by the urge to

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:12.240
 sell something that turned out to be really deadly. Wow. Wow. Now, something like cascara

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:20.080
 sergrata or some people use, well, let's just do that one. Would one be at risk to become totally

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:30.400
 dependent on that or would it just be used now and then or? Yeah. Well, using it to prevent

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:38.720
 all of the constipation symptoms and reduce inflammation, then you can figure out what

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:46.640
 is wrong with the foods that you're eating that are causing the inflammation and constipation.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.960
 I see. So you use it as a medicine and not something you take every day.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:53:02.720
 Yeah. Although people have taken it every day for decades. Really? And the first argument was that

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:13.680
 there might be something wrong with it because chronic laxative users had brown pigmented

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:23.040
 colons. But doing the study properly, it turns out that constipation and irritation

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:33.440
 cause the pigmented colon and proper use of laxatives would be reducing the irritation

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:41.760
 and formation of the brown pigment. But that was just part of basically the pharmaceutical FDA

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.440
 campaign against natural substances. So in your opinion, after all these years,

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:52.800
 what would be like the number one cause behind constipation, which is kind of like an

00:53:52.800 --> 00:54:01.040
 epidemic in our culture? Slow digestion makes every food a potential.

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:06.000
 So it starts in the stomach if you're not really digesting the food, right?

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:12.160
 And hypothyroidism is the main cause of sluggish digestion.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:19.520
 Low thyroid will cause the acid to get messed up and you don't digest well?

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:28.160
 Yeah. Slow down of all of the digestive secretions and of peristalsis. And so simply

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:39.120
 adding a bulk fiber to your diet, if it isn't something that can be converted in the gas by

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:48.160
 bacteria, if it's a really indigestible fiber, that will stimulate the peristalsis, that will

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:58.240
 eliminate estrogen and other toxic irritants, and that will tend to increase thyroid function.

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:01.120
 Interesting. Because estrogen is a blocker of thyroid.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:09.120
 And what would be your favorite kind of to take a supplemental fiber if you wanted to take one

00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:16.560
 for our listeners? For many years, I was recommending a daily carrot, especially grated

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:28.800
 with a little bit of vinegar and salt and olive oil. But that easily becomes very tiresome.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:37.840
 And so I looked around and found that bamboo shoots are very, you can put cheese sauce on them

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:48.800
 and make them very early tasty dish. And mushrooms, well cooked mushrooms are another functional

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:57.440
 bulk provider with a slight antibiotic action. How do you find bamboo shoots? Are they raw,

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:06.160
 like in produce or health Japanese stores? Yeah, in some Asian stores, they will be

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:14.240
 available raw, but they have to be cooked. Sure. And you can buy them in huge cans at a good price.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:25.120
 I've seen a can that in our Asian store sells for $2.50, I think 20 ounces or something like that.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:32.640
 Some places want to charge $25 for it. But it should be a very cheap food.

00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.880
 And you would just eat some of it out of the can and then put it in the fridge and then

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:44.960
 eat the rest of it? Yeah, it's good, I think to boil them a little in case the can was leaching

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:53.760
 chemicals. What's that one kind of fiber that so many people take? And the name's escaping me right

00:56:53.760 --> 00:57:02.080
 now. Pure cellulose. There was a product sold for weight loss and diet control. It was called AIDS.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:12.640
 Which was basically really fairly pure cellulose. But with the appearance of the disease AIDS,

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:20.080
 had to either change their name or went out of business.

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:24.480
 What's your opinion of you can get organic psyllium husks? What's that?

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:32.240
 They work for most people. But you have to be watchful if you really have an inflamed intestine.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:43.040
 Some people find that the mass of the husk instead of holding water, the husk itself or the gel

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.720
 becomes dehydrated and turns into a roping material that makes the problem worse.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:55.040
 So you got to be careful with that one. But you like the cascara sagrada because it holds the

00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:04.560
 water. It causes the intestine to secrete more water. Here's an email from Rachel for Ray Peat

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:12.720
 on this 21 February day as we are live here. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. We are going to have

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:21.760
 Mike Stone on tomorrow. Mike Stone was recommended by Dr. Cowan. Mike Stone, his website is amazing

00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:28.720
 and the work that he's done with the work in virology and showing what this whole germ thing

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:34.240
 is about. So we're excited to have him on. That'll be tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:41.520
 I recently started taking Progest-E, writes Rachel. Could you please ask Dr. Peat if it is

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:49.440
 anabolic for females or if I should be concerned about losing muscle because of its effects on

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:56.960
 testosterone. Also, is it true that if the dose is too low, it reverts to becoming estrogen

00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:05.840
 at a higher dose it's initially required? No, in humans, it doesn't turn to estrogen.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:17.600
 It does not? No, its product can be glucocorticoids like cortisol or aldosterone.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:29.600
 But since its effect is antagonistic to cortisol and to aldosterone, you can't increase your

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:40.080
 corticoid effect by eating more progesterone infected. It's a partial antidote to those

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:56.720
 and to the stress in general. It antagonizes estrogen's ability to increase your cortisol

00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.960
 and aldosterone. I see. Okay.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:11.520
 It's anti-catabolic is the effect the studies on animals have found. It is neither

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:22.400
 pro-catabolic nor pro-anabolic. Thyroid itself is muscle anabolic, but progesterone,

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:30.640
 its action is mainly by preventing excessive action of estrogen and cortisol.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:38.000
 And both of those are antagonistic to good muscle development.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.720
 But the progesterone, if I hear you correctly, is neutral as far as muscles?

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:49.760
 Yeah, as far as the animal studies can find. Sure. Our second question is, does T3 increase

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.640
 histamine levels? No, it's basically

01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.480
 protective against all kinds of inflammation. I see. Okay. All kinds.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:10.480
 For example, overactive bladder involves estrogen and mast cells producing histamine.

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:20.240
 And combining aspirin and/or antihistamine with thyroid supplement will take care of

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.760
 the overactive bladder. Again, a little aspirin and what?

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.080
 Say it again? A little aspirin and what for overactive

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.640
 bladder? Oh, antihistamines and thyroid.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:42.240
 Antihistamines. Can you get a real good antihistamine over the counter, natural that

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.920
 you could use for that to get the bladder not so overactive?

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:53.680
 Pretty much the FDA has taken care of all of the most useful natural drugs, getting them

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.480
 off the market. Oh, great.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.920
 So bad imitations can come on from the pharmaceutical industry.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.600
 You had mentioned a pharmaceutical one show, an antihistamine that you like. Do you recall?

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.320
 Oh, acyproheptadine. Yeah, cyproheptadine. That's pretty safe?

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:21.040
 Yeah. I've known people who went up to 28 milligrams a day for the normal doses, two to

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:32.560
 four, and took that for a few weeks and were cured from their, for example, dysmenorrhea

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:42.320
 and hemorrhaging and didn't need to keep taking it. But I suppose there's some extremely

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:53.280
 high dose that will, for example, turn off your urinating ability. So kids who have taken

01:02:53.280 --> 01:03:02.640
 a gigantic overdose of cyproheptadine sometimes have to be catheterized to get the urine out.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:11.600
 Wow. So is the cyproheptadine and aspirin totally symptomatic for an overactive bladder

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:17.440
 or will it help the body to get back normal? It gradually helps the body to, it takes quite

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:26.400
 a while to eliminate the mast cells that were attracted by the estrogen. But if you cure

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:35.440
 the symptoms for a while, your thyroid and progesterone will tend to prevent their activation.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.120
 So that's the initial cause of the overactive bladder, which many people have, is too high

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:47.360
 of estrogen. Yeah, leading to a high concentration of mast cells.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.880
 Mast cells. Wow. And too high estrogen, if I keep following this black hole, I'll keep

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.600
 going down this rabbit hole, too high estrogen, the main cause?

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:04.320
 Yeah, it attracts mast cells, progesterone inhibits them.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.240
 And what causes the estrogen to be too high generally?

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.920
 Hypothyroidism. Back to thyroid again.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:22.800
 Yeah. And the polyunsaturated fatty acids have intriguing estrogen effects in themselves

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:32.720
 and also block thyroid very specifically. And so the PUFA in at least two different

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:40.720
 ways increases the action of estrogen while decreasing thyroid.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:47.680
 Can you tell what the PUFA, there must be some place online to tell the PUFA content

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.560
 of various oils? Oh yeah, you can just look up fatty acid

01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:00.800
 composition of different foods. I see. And does any PUFA not just stay away

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:11.680
 from it or low? Yeah, since the food oil industry tried to

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:19.120
 convert the population to eating stuff that they've been selling for making paint because

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:29.520
 of the petroleum innovation of making paint more cheaply, the seed oil industry dug up

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:40.560
 defunct science of George Brewer whose claim that the PUFA are essential fatty acids. They

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:50.320
 revived that even after it had been many times disproved 20 years after it was disproved.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:06:02.240
 They convinced the public that PUFA is an essential nutrient. And contrary to all of

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:12.720
 the evidence since the 1930s, they've convinced the public that PUFA is a nutrient rather

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.560
 than a hormone disruptor. And it just isn't. It's a hormone disruptor.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:23.360
 And again, so if I'm clear, any PUFA you just stay away from, even low, low on some

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:28.480
 oils? Low? Yeah, small amounts you can handle unless

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.600
 you're overeating in general. I see.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:39.400
 And when you overeat in general, PUFA tends to be the part that gets stored to gradually

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:46.480
 increase your body PUFA content. I see. Hi Patrick, when you asked Dr. Peat what

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:56.320
 is the cure for, let me spell it for you, URTICARIA angiodema, I am struggling with

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.480
 it for a couple of months now for the second time in the past six months.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:09.480
 That's another thing involving concentrated mast cells and activating them. For example,

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:18.120
 low blood sugar will activate them, many irritants, but things that cause a drop in blood sugar

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:25.960
 will activate the mast cells that secrete histamine and serotonin and cause edema.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:35.400
 Again, these mast cells do their thing, right? Yeah, so antihistamines are the first treatment.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:41.680
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat if he has any suggestions for eliminating cataracts that

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:50.960
 does not involve surgery? No, basically preventing them involves things

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:59.080
 like keeping your PUFA intake low, but once they're formed, their disappearance is very

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:06.800
 slow. A few people I've known, just by changing

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:16.320
 their way of living, who had beginning cataracts when they were in their 60s, by their 70s,

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:26.600
 had no detectable cataracts. So very good living conditions can very slowly cause them

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.480
 to fade away. I see. Rhonda wants to know, she says, "I've

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:38.080
 been reading that taking a bath in 3% hydrogen peroxide and magnesium flakes is good pain

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.800
 relief remedy." Can you ask Dr. Peat if he knows if this would be a reasonable thing

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.360
 to do? Oh, it's very bad for your skin.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:51.960
 Bad for their skin. Stay very long in contact with that concentration

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:58.360
 of hydrogen peroxide. I see. Not good. Can Dr. Peat please discuss

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:08.000
 the pros and cons of using DMSO and also MMS, chlorine dioxide?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:19.000
 They both have potential problems. The DMSO got famous when it was used for treating arthritis

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:29.880
 pain, and it can activate the respiratory process and help to eliminate water from tissues.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:37.440
 Too much of the sulfur compounds can very easily lead to disturbance of your thyroid

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.000
 function. This is from Emily, "I've been taking the

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.040
 sulfur that Patrick promotes and I like it, but now I'm seven months pregnant. Can I

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:54.160
 still keep taking sulfur? This is just pure sulfur." What do you think, Doc?

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.160
 Hundreds of milliliters of sulfur. That's different, right?

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:04.120
 Yeah, it's a very safe thing to take. Just a pinch of it, two or three hundred milligrams

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:14.560
 orally will help to suppress the candida and other fungus development without causing any

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.800
 noticeable change in the person. But the sulfur that she has, can you comment

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.960
 if this is okay if she's pregnant? I told her I didn't know and I would ask you.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:30.320
 She emailed me. That very small amount, if you have a candida

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:41.160
 problem, it will clear out the candida and then doesn't have to be used continuously.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:47.080
 But it's very good and safe for getting rid of the fungus.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:53.440
 But if she wants to take it on going like a lot of people do for detoxification, that

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:58.320
 could be an issue when you're pregnant, could it?

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:03.920
 It hasn't. There's no evidence I know of that it's harmful, but I think it's

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:11.560
 best to minimize all kinds of treatments when you're pregnant.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.800
 Yeah, to be careful. Here's something. I have constant mucus,

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:21.040
 writes an emailer, one side of my throat. If I push my finger into my throat near the

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:27.600
 clavicle and swallow it helps. I drink very little milk and it makes it worse.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:33.240
 Even though it's from a local grass-fed cow, I eat a little cheese, eat a pretty clean

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.840
 diet. Do you have any ideas on how to clear this

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:44.440
 clogging feeling of the mucus? Sometimes, fallen thyroid gland causes all

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:53.400
 kinds of swallowing discomfort and difficulty. So I would have a doctor check for any swelling

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:59.040
 of the gland and any elevation of TSH.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:07.200
 MK wants to know if Dr. Peat could talk about premenstrual dysmorphic disorder.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:16.400
 Apparently, it can happen to younger women in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:26.000
 I have a normal reaction to progesterone. Was it dysphoric or dysmorphic?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.960
 Dysmorphic. The usual thing is dysphoric, meaning basically

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:41.120
 premenstrual syndrome. But the dysmorphic thing that some women have is misperceiving

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:51.920
 the amount of fat in their belly and feeling that their body shape isn't right. So they

01:12:51.920 --> 01:13:01.400
 feel they have to diet even when it isn't objectively abnormal.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:07.480
 Dr. Peat wants to know the difference between pig thyroid and the prescription kind.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:17.360
 Most of the prescription kind has been historically from pigs. But the Armour Company used beef

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:29.640
 and/or pork thyroid. They were both identical in function. But the standard thing that American

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:37.040
 medicine has moved to is to say, "Don't take anything with T3 in it. Take only synthetic

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:47.880
 thyroxine." That works fine for most young men, but for very few women, it's appropriate

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:56.400
 because the estrogen blocks the ability to convert T4 to the active form of the hormone

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400
 T3.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:02.240
 So the thyroid that the conventional MD prescribes is okay?

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.160
 No, it's likely to be thyroxine.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.600
 And so what kind could you get prescribed? What would you ask for?

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:17.200
 The last of the fairly reliable desiccated thyroids is Armour. By chance, you might come

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:25.920
 across one of the natural desiccated products that is well standardized, but it's a fairly

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.280
 random thing now.

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.280
 Wow.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:39.520
 And there's only one well-balanced product that I know of, CINO+, which was a synthetic

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:48.400
 imitation of the old Armour product. There are others containing both T3 and T4, but

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.120
 the balance is best in CINO+.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:15:04.360
 And the CINO+ has a good product that has a little more T4 in relation to the T3.

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.360
 And the CINO+?

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.360
 Mm-hmm.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.840
 And you like a little more T4 than the T3?

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.200
 Yeah, a good ratio is three or four to one, T4 to T3.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:19.760
 And the CINO+, would that be the closest thing to a natural kind of piggy desiccated?

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:23.440
 Yeah, it's the closest thing to the traditional Armour.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:30.800
 And the CINO+, if I recall, the only place you can get that, can you get that in the

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.600
 United States or do we have to go to Mexico?

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:41.120
 Yeah, Mexican drugstores such as Farmacias Del Nino at .mx.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:47.440
 Farmacia Del Nino, you can get CINO+. And would that be the same kind of dosage as the

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:52.000
 other, similar?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.680
 The pills come in a potency that's a little more than two grains equivalent of Armour.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:04.960
 So it's good to start with one-eighth of a tablet, which is a quarter grain.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.920
 And just kind of work your way up, huh?

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.920
 Mm-hmm.

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:10.920
 Interesting.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:16.840
 And can you get too much progesterone and what symptoms would you have?

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:23.280
 I'm supplementing with progesterone in a couple of different forms, progest-E and a prescribed

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.520
 form.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:33.920
 In vitamin E, it actually gets into your bloodstream through the digestive system.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:42.360
 And too much of it will put you to sleep, and so it shouldn't be combined with opiates,

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.960
 for example.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960
 Too much of the progest-E?

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:55.800
 Yeah, because it's a sedative. The normal rise during pregnancy should become the anesthetic

01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:02.840
 for childbirth. When progesterone is high enough in relation to estrogen, delivery is

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:08.960
 without pain. They used to call it the chemical midwife.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.240
 Interesting.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:15.200
 Can you use progest-E for sleep, insomnia?

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:24.040
 Oh, yes. I knew one woman who used a half a teaspoon of the progest-E every night to

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040
 go to sleep.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:28.640
 Is that safe?

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:36.600
 I don't recommend it because it might make you so drunk you stumble on the way to the

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.600
 bathroom or something.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.080
 Really, it gets you that kind of loopy, huh?

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.960
 But you could experiment with it and maybe help sleep?

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:52.240
 Yeah. I accidentally overdosed, probably got close to a thousand milligrams of progesterone.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:18:02.880
 I was in a margarita by accident. I first noticed that I couldn't tell where my hands

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.800
 were, and then I couldn't tell where my feet were unless I looked at them.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:19.080
 That's great. Somebody wants to know about the long-term effects of ivermectin.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:29.520
 It's safe if you follow the traditional anti-worm doses of just a few milligrams on

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:39.560
 one or two days periodically, but it's definitely not something to take every day preventively.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:46.120
 Rachel has recently added another T3 to my Synthroid. My body shuts down conversion from

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:54.480
 T4 to T3 during synthetic ingestion. Should you still take T4 even if your liver is ineffective

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.200
 at converting to T3?

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:04.520
 The other tissues have some ability to do the conversion if that isn't blocked too

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:14.360
 by estrogen and PUFA. So you do get some effect even if your liver is malfunctioning.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:23.960
 I see. Wow. Here's a 68-year-old male, bicycle, no booze, good weight, having wild

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:30.880
 arrhythmias for the past few weeks. Wow. Taking magnesium and bio-BC complex, what can I do

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.200
 to get heartbeat back to normal without drugs?

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.600
 What is wrong with his heart rate?

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.920
 It's arrhythmias. He's getting arrhythmias.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:51.560
 The low progesterone, high estrogens, one of the things like Synthroid showed, but low

01:19:51.560 --> 01:20:01.760
 thyroid leading to high adrenaline is a very common cause. The clotting system tends to

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:11.440
 become overactive with hypothyroidism and doctors are very afraid to prescribe thyroid

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:20.040
 for various kinds of arrhythmia because it can suddenly increase your adrenaline, which

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:28.160
 increases the clotting system, which can lead to strokes and so on. So it's something that

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:34.680
 you have to correct very gradually with, for example, increasing your orange juice and

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:39.680
 milk intake to stabilize things first.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:44.920
 Orange juice and milk. Here's an interesting one I haven't heard. Phil, I've had eye

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:52.600
 bags, bags under my eyes for years. What's the original root cause of this?

01:20:52.600 --> 01:21:06.000
 Stress and too much fat in the diet, for example, are blocking thyroid function. Sometimes the

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:16.120
 area around the eye is pigmented brown as well as being puffy. I've seen both of those

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:24.400
 corrected in just a matter of days by getting the right amount of thyroid supplement.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:29.400
 Just puffy could be not enough thyroid or too much?

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.400
 Not enough.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:38.120
 Not enough. Let's see, one more and then we're going to let you go to work here.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:43.840
 Hi, Dr. Peat. What can a 50-year-old man do to keep his receding hair? Boy, if we had

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:48.720
 the pure answer for that, we'd be millionaires. So what do you think hair loss is the root

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.720
 cause, doc?

01:21:49.720 --> 01:22:00.960
 There are several things that starve the follicle for energy. Not enough calcium and vitamin

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:10.440
 D in the diet increases your parathyroid hormone, and that is closely connected to under-functioning

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:17.760
 of the follicle, but it also goes with blocking thyroid function. So there's a connection

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:28.320
 between aging and blood lipids, hypothyroidism, low vitamin D, not any one thing that's

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:36.440
 going to correct it, but getting your whole metabolism at a higher level is a basic thing.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:41.000
 And again, that's generally low thyroid.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
 Yeah.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.800
 Low thyroid. And temperature first thing in the morning, how relevant is that for your

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.040
 thyroid function?

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:54.520
 Very important. Broderbarn's books are worth reading.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:55.520
 Really?

01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:04.600
 He was working before any good blood test came on the market, and he found that it was

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:07.040
 extremely reliable.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.760
 And what's your minimum temp you want to be to let you know you've got good thyroid

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.760
 function?

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:17.280
 Close to 98 degrees Fahrenheit when you wake up.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.280
 98?

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.280
 97.8 to 98.2.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.280
 Oh, so even 97.8 is okay?

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:30.360
 Yeah, for waking up, but after breakfast it should go up above 98.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.640
 Throughout the day then it wants to be above 98, somewhere around there.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.640
 Yeah, around 98.6.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.240
 And that's a good indication.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.360
 Very good.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:43.760
 And if you were taking too much, would that temperature get too high?

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:54.320
 Yeah, generally it holds your temperature around 99 degrees even when you're resting.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.920
 Do any of these, have you ever seen any of these little things where you put on your

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.720
 forehead, are they accurate do you think?

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:01.720
 No.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:06.560
 You've got to put it in your mouth, that's the only way to go.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:07.560
 Or eardrum.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.560
 Or eardrum?

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.400
 Oh, there's some eardrum?

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:17.560
 Yeah, the electronic IR infrared thermometers work on the eardrum.

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:25.240
 Electronic infrared on the eardrum, so you don't have to sit there and hold a thing in

01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:26.240
 your mouth, huh?

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:27.240
 Yes, quicker.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.240
 Quicker, yeah.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.240
 Electronic infrared, oh, never heard of those guys.

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:35.640
 Well, Dr. Peat, we have another show under our belt.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:37.920
 Thanks so much for being here.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.480
 We've covered a lot of territory today.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.120
 Appreciate your help, sir.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.680
 Okay, thank you.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:45.560
 You take care of yourself, all right?

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.560
 Very good.

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.560
 Thank you.

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.560
 Bye-bye.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.560
 Dr. A. Peat, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:50.560
 What a nice guy, right?

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:51.560
 What a nice guy.

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:58.600
 So grateful for him to come on the show once a month.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:04.520
 And we've got a few more emails, but we generally only keep them an hour and a half.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:08.040
 That's the deal, so we did an hour and a half.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.440
 All right, I love you all.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.320
 Thank you for your ongoing support.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.840
 Probably a 90% chance that Mike Stone is going to be here and talk about this whole germ

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:17.840
 thing.

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.940
 I got an email from him this morning.

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:25.120
 He says that they have some pretty bad weather up where he is, not sure where he is.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:31.480
 And he may have to take his son to school or his son may be home and he'll have to take

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:32.480
 care of him.

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:33.560
 So stay tuned.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.600
 If it doesn't happen, I'll just come on and we'll play.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:42.200
 But we'll let the snow angels take care of it and not concern ourselves with it.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.240
 But it should be a pretty fascinating show.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:50.000
 And if it wouldn't happen because of the weather, well then we're going to make sure that he

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.640
 comes on real soon.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640
 Mike Stone.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:58.520
 Then also, Stuart Nunley, I think one of the best biological dentists anywhere.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:04.400
 So if you have a dental question, root canals, cavities, any kind of thing about your mouth,

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.040
 just email me, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:12.720
 Dr. Stuart Nunley out of HealthySmilesForLife.com.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:14.480
 You can look at his website.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.260
 He's out of Marble Falls, Texas.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:19.320
 He's going to be here Wednesday at 10 o'clock.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.480
 So get your questions in for him.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:27.280
 And then one of our faves guys in the world of finance, Richard Mayberry at 11 o'clock

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.800
 on Wednesday.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.880
 So thanks for your ongoing support.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.560
 Don't forget now we have the Saunas.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.560
 I'm sorry.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.060
 Well, Saunas everyday sale, $12.95.

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:43.600
 But the Hydrogen Machine, 20% off, promo code OneRadio if you'd like to get that.

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.600
 Like Peat just said, hydrogens are excellent antioxidant.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.480
 We've been talking about that.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.040
 And then also the Shaga and the Reishi are on sale for the next week or so.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.920
 Sir Thrivill, use promo code Fortify15.

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.960
 F-O-R-T-I-F-Y 15.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:04.000
 I'm going to get myself some.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
 They're fun to take.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.880
 Really very beneficial medicinal mushrooms.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:11.720
 They're tonics, so you can take them everyday.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:12.720
 All right.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:13.720
 Love you all.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:14.720
 We'll see you tomorrow.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:20.960
 The creeks don't rise and the snow don't fall with Mike Stone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.960
 Thank you.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:22.960
 Take care.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:34.520
 May the blessings be.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.520
 .

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.100
 (upbeat music)
