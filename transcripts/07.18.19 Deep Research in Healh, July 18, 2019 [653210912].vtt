WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
 Oh my, what fun.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.960
 Good to talk to all these doctors, man. No wonder I feel good.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.840
 That's uh, that's true. All these doctors to talk to. All right, we're gonna have fun now,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.600
 talk to Dr. Ray Peat, and it's great to have him on the show again. We've been inviting him about

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.680
 once a month and he keeps saying yes, so we'll just keep inviting him and as long as he says yes,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 we'll do it because it's, he's just fun to have around and to talk to. He's a renowned nutritional

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.040
 counselor, just renowned. He required a PhD from the University of Oregon with a specialization in

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.920
 physiology. Started his work in hormones in '68. Wrote his dissertation in '72 where he outlined

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.080
 his ideas on progesterone and hormones closely related to this. His main thesis is that energy

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.560
 and structure are independent at every level and you can get Dr. Peat's terrific newsletter that

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.600
 we put right on the show page. You can just kind of, very nominal fee, and you can get that every

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.480
 couple months and rock and roll and talk to him. Well, Dr. Ray Peat, good morning, sir. How are you?

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.280
 Very good. You always sound good, doc. What'd you have for breakfast this morning?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.200
 Coffee and milk, green juice. Coffee. I like your breakfasts. It's really good. You know,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.840
 it's funny, after hanging out with you a little bit, doing these shows, I start thinking about,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.920
 well, I'm going to try some milk too. I have access to raw goat's milk and I never did really

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.320
 well with it my whole life and I'm just doing great with it now after a couple months. And I'm

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.520
 wondering what could change in the body where, if I wasn't able to do even raw goat's milk,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 and this tummy just wasn't happy or elimination, what would change, Dr. Peat, to make it more fun

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.000
 for me now and real fun? The body is always changing to adapt to circumstances. And

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.440
 they've done experiments with people who thought they were intolerant of lactose. And by introducing

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.360
 an ounce or two or three or four ounces of milk per day within their tolerance, they found that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 in a few weeks, even lactose intolerant people, at least the ones that believed they were,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.960
 for example, I think that was done in San Francisco with Chinese,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:53.040
 they found that they were able to drink regular amounts of milk because the enzymes take a couple

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 of weeks to adapt. And that applies to any food. When you change to a different kind of

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.000
 major energy source, your intestine takes weeks to really adjust to it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.600
 Interesting. So if you are going to change and maybe introduce something that you haven't for a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.080
 while, it'd be best to kind of real go just a little bit every day and kind of, and just kind

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.440
 of let the body know what's going on kind of thing? Yeah, you give it signals of what's happening,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.840
 and it starts making new enzymes to handle the new material. And that happens most easily when

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.680
 you have all of the essential nutrients in adequate amounts and your thyroid is working

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.840
 efficiently so that you have lots of energy to do the new protein synthesis.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.440
 So I'm curious when you say you drink milk and you've been you drink it and

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.200
 is milk that good of a food for folks to even consider?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.680
 Yeah, the only major deficiency it has is iron because during pregnancy,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.800
 high estrogen causes the woman to absorb iron with extreme efficiency.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.400
 I think they say nine or 10 times more efficiently than a man extracting it from food.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 And that charges up the woman's body with high amounts of iron. And so the baby is born

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:33.520
 overloaded with iron stores. Their liver stores enough iron for almost a year of life living on

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:44.240
 milk. And so milk lets them adjust to that newborn state of iron excess. So it's designed to

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:53.760
 be deficient in iron. And so you can't live indefinitely on just milk. But the large,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:03.600
 the estrogen also makes the woman absorb calcium very efficiently because the bones of the baby

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.800
 are going to require lots of calcium. And so milk has an excess of calcium for adult requirements.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.960
 But it turns out that even in an adult who doesn't need it for growing bones,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.880
 that excess of calcium turns out to have a very powerful anti-inflammatory, anti-stress effect.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:36.000
 Interesting. I have access to raw cream too. And boy, man, there's nothing. Holy cow. I don't know

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.400
 if it's good for me, but just to take a big hit of that, you know, like an ounce or two,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.000
 and just kind of, "Oh, it sure feels good." It really does.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.560
 If you have good coffee with fresh, heavy cream, that's delicious.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.000
 It's like the real deal. And I think that's important too. I mean, you know, for me and

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.480
 others, if you have warm milk or a cream or something like that before bed, if it's soothing

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.080
 you and making you feel better and you're happy, I mean, that goes a long way too.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:21.280
 And during the night, the lack of light causes a developing stress. After about the age of 30,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.200
 all of the changes related to aging happen during the night because of the stress

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:40.880
 that requires sleeping to get through it. The pituitary hormones all zoom up during the night.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:49.360
 You've heard of growth hormone and the gonadotropic hormones and cortisol rising.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:58.560
 The parathyroid hormone rises during the night and it exacerbates things because it inhibits

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:06.000
 energy production, which makes you need the cortisol. And the combination of parathyroid

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.960
 hormone and cortisol rising very steeply during the night takes your energy down and breaks down

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:19.280
 your bones. So morning urine is full of the calcium that you've torn out of your bones during the

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:27.840
 night. And so milk at bedtime, experimenters have found that that greatly lowers the night stress.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.760
 - Isn't that fascinating.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.080
 - Some of the surge of those stress hormones.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.080
 - Maybe that's where the whole idea of it's been around for years, I guess,

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.680
 warm milk at night and all that, maybe that's where that comes from.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.720
 - Probably.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.160
 - Probably so. Gandhi did pretty good. And I think if he's on goat's milk, that's kind of lived on.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.200
 So what's the difference? Do you know any big difference between goat's milk and cow's milk?

00:07:51.200 --> 00:08:00.720
 - Yeah, it has several differences. Partly it's because of the goat's favored diet. They won't-

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.800
 - Eat everything, right?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:12.720
 - Yeah. And they are stubborn and won't eat the stuff they make cows eat. But basically

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:22.400
 it's creamier and the cream is emulsified in a different way. So it's slower to separate,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.960
 makes it easier to digest for a lot of people.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.520
 - Yeah, yeah. I was just on a call with the doc and we're playing around with the blood test just

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.720
 so we could show people how he works with them. And he said I could use some more, you know,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:42.160
 fat in my brain kind of stuff, that number was. What else could, what could I do to people to

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.880
 get more, make sure we're getting plenty of good fat? What are some foods and some things?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:54.880
 - Well, the interesting thing is that babies, if the mother keeps her blood sugar up,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:04.160
 the babies make their own fat, which is all saturated except for the polyunsaturated

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:13.280
 minus nine fatty acids that are synthesized in the baby's liver. And so babies are born

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:23.120
 with a highly saturated brain. And in that state, in their first few years when the brain contains

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:32.720
 only our native polyunsaturated fats and lots of saturated fats, they have their highest metabolic

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.640
 rate and a tremendous rate of learning. So by the age of five or six, they know five or 6,000 words.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.760
 Imagine an adult trying to learn five or 6,000 words in five years.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.760
 - Wow. So we humans, how do we pony up on more of that good fat in our brain?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.480
 - Sugar, just like a baby.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.240
 - Sugar. I like you, boy, sugar. Okay.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:07.120
 - Starch and sugar both turn to fat when you eat enough of them.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.960
 - Now, what would be the difference between, I don't know, having like a coconut milk

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:20.000
 ice cream with some sugar, you know, real good sugar, pure cane, organic sugar, and maybe some

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.840
 pork fat, really well-tended pork. I mean, does the brain like them equally?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:38.880
 - It actually prefers saturated fat, but since our diets have been industrialized,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:48.320
 the pigs now have highly unsaturated fat. For about 50 years, the Department of Agriculture

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:56.320
 published lists calling pork fat or lard, calling it a saturated fat, but it turned out to be

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:04.800
 extremely polyunsaturated because they feed them so much soy and corn to make them fat.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:14.480
 And those polyunsaturated corn and soy oils are highly fattening, where coconut oil is more like

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.800
 natural human fat. And it's not so fattening.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.160
 - Yeah. Boy, you'd love this person. I've been talking to her every week at the farmer's market,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.160
 and she has pictures, and I've been out there to visit. Doc, that they feed their pigs,

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.480
 you know what they feed them? They get all this food that's thrown away at Whole Foods,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.240
 mostly vegetables and grass. That's it. Yeah. - Everyone used to feed their pigs that way

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:46.640
 when I was a kid. The creameries would make cheese and give away huge amounts of whey,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:57.360
 and the farmers would mix whey with whatever apple crops or anything that was waste vegetable or

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:05.440
 fruit. And that was really a kind of ideal diet, milk, protein, and fruit and vegetables.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:10.160
 - Wow. Yeah, and she was saying there's a huge difference between what she's doing out there

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.440
 and these people with these pigs. And like you say, even if you go get some kind of organic

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.600
 pork or something, you don't know what they're feeding them, really. They can be feeding them

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.920
 organic soy and all kinds of stuff, right? - Yeah. I used to really like pork when I lived

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.680
 in Mexico because the farmers would feed them that sort of food. Yeah. - And they'd just eat

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.280
 anything. I've seen a picture of them eating pumpkins. They'll just eat anything you put in

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.960
 front of them, really. I guess that's why they call them pigs. But they get a pretty good fat

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:47.600
 if you get a real nice pig, don't they? Good stuff for us. - Yeah. When I was a kid, my grandmother

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.840
 a few times sent me to the store to buy some lard for her cooking. And at room temperature,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:01.440
 it sat in square cubes, just like butter, nice and solid. But the last time I saw lard in a

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.760
 meat store, it was almost liquid. - Yeah, yeah. Just because of the feed,

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.920
 what they feed them, huh? - Yeah. - Here's an email for you, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.400
 "Is reduced-fat, ultra-filtered milk, lactose-free good to drink?" Reduced-fat,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.400
 ultra-filtered milk, lactose-free. I've seen this stuff at the store. Is that good to drink? Right,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:29.200
 Nancy? - Yeah, it can be if there are no serious additives in it. The lactose, they put an enzyme

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:36.880
 in that breaks lactose down, and all it does is make glucose and fructose out of it, or glucose

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:47.120
 and another monosaccharide. I forget what the name of it is. But it's perfectly good sugar.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:54.240
 Makes it taste sweeter. - Is there an issue with drinking,

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.480
 even say, organic grass-fed milk you can now get at the hippie food store that's been homogenized

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:09.040
 and pasteurized? Is that a real negative for the body? - No. - Good, good. I'm glad. That's great.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.000
 So everybody has access if they want to do some moo juice, right? - Mm-hmm. - And these days, boy,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.320
 you have so many choices. So do you do recommend they'll get folks as high a fat as they can in

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.440
 the milk, or does it matter? - Oh, no. You can get fat. I used to drink a gallon a day of,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:35.520
 when I was working, easily a gallon a day of whole milk. But when I became sedentary going to school,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:43.360
 I started getting fat on that. And so I reduced it to 1%. And I could drink a gallon of 1% milk

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:49.600
 without getting fat. - My goodness. - One of the virtues of milk is that the high calcium content

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:59.760
 stimulates heat production the same way sodium and protein and sugar stimulate your metabolism.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:07.520
 And the calcium is a major factor in maintaining a high metabolic rate. - Yeah. Is it the calcium

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.800
 that gets into the little mitochondria in the cells and little energy bunnies, Don? - Yeah.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:22.000
 Both sodium and calcium stimulate the cell to counteract their stimulating effect. And the

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.280
 rising energy production relaxes the cell. But in the process, it burns up a lot of energy. - Yeah.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:38.320
 You can check out Dr. Peat's work, raypeat.com. How long have you been at this, Dr. Peat? - Well,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:45.920
 I got my PhD in '72, and I've been sort of constantly at it. But before that, I'd just

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:56.480
 seen particular needs already in the '50s. I was offering my advice to people. - Yeah.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:04.400
 Wow. And you're a bit of a contrarian, aren't you, in a way, because of the research that you do? I

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.880
 mean, if I had a dollar for every person who's been on this show in the last 12 years that said,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.080
 "Well, humans are not made to drink milk after weaning," you know, I mean, that meme is out there.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:26.560
 - That is a very popular... - That's a popular thing to say, right? - Yeah. And like mainline

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:35.120
 medicine, there's a sort of mainstream counterculture that has ideas like that. And

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:43.760
 naturopaths and chiropractors have lots of counterculture ideas, but a lot of those are

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.720
 wrong, too. - Yeah, yeah. And they just keep getting repeated over and over, don't they?

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:57.200
 Over and over and over and over. What are some of the things that you know that folks can do more of?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:04.480
 Because one of the biggest ideas that doctors, natural or otherwise, are being presented with

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:10.800
 is low energy. Talk a bit about that. I mean, that's the number one complaint when people go

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:19.120
 to the doctor. "I just want more energy." - Yeah, mostly that turns out to be a low thyroid state,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:28.560
 and that relates to a lot of things that have become more problematic in the national diet

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:37.760
 over the last 50 years. But even in the '30s and '40s, there were people who were in a position to

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:46.720
 see a lot of problem patients, and they were estimating that probably 40% of the population

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:54.080
 was practically hypothyroid, suffering some symptoms of hypothyroidism. And since then,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:02.880
 the diet has deteriorated. So using those same standards, you could say that probably 60 or 80%

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:10.960
 of the people are suffering from hypothyroidism, but the standards for measuring it since the 1940s

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:20.560
 have changed to revise the definition of normal. So the people have stayed normal by their tests,

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:28.800
 despite the changing circumstances. And it turns out that the standard they use for diagnosing

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:38.080
 hypothyroidism is TSH, the thyroid-stimulating hormone made by the pituitary. And what they

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:46.240
 overlook is that the stress caused by hypothyroidism and bad diet, the stress hormones

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:55.120
 lower TSH the same way an excessive thyroid hormone would. And so a stressed, tired,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:03.600
 low-energy person will have very low TSH production because of the stress hormones.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.440
 The doctors looking at it...

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.400
 - Wow, you're good.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:16.320
 - Yeah. And quite a few people have had a diagnosis of hypothyroidism because their TSH is so low,

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:24.640
 but then their symptoms, such as water retention, fatigue, and so on, hair loss,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.760
 they're diagnosed by those as hypothyroidism. So several people have told me, "I'm both

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:38.560
 hyperthyroid and hypothyroid." It makes absolutely no sense, but quite a few doctors are actually

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.040
 saying that.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:46.480
 - They're saying it now. So on the whole panel on the thyroid, which marker do you

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.560
 kind of look at that think people should pay attention to if they want to kind of dig into

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.120
 this a bit?

00:19:53.120 --> 00:20:02.160
 - It's good to look at all of them, but the free T3 and free T4 and TSH, each of those

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:10.720
 is ambiguous under stress. And so the ones I look at mostly are, is there hemoglobin

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:22.560
 and hematocrit up to normal? Is there cholesterol above normal? And two or three little

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:31.200
 metabolic indicators like that, how are the liver enzymes? Those going a little bit off-center

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:38.160
 are typical of high thyroid people. And so you have to take those into account. And their

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:48.000
 temperature and heart rate are pretty good indicators. The real indicator that was abandoned

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.560
 after the pharmaceutical companies took over in the '40s, they used to measure actual oxygen

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:05.200
 consumption and heat production or calorie use. And if a person was only burning two-thirds as

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:15.680
 much energy as a healthy person, not to mention the extra vital people who burned 20 or 30% more

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:22.880
 than average, those people were given a thyroid supplement to bring their oxygen consumption

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:30.480
 up to normal. And their symptoms went away. Their cholesterol went down. Temperature came up. Heart

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.840
 rate was normalized. Blood pressure came down if it was high, came up if it was low.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:44.560
 So looking at oxygen consumption and calorie consumption, a person just by keeping their

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.080
 own records of what they're eating and drinking can get a good impression of their calorie

00:21:50.080 --> 00:22:00.880
 consumption. Women who diet a lot, they have been found, instead of the textbook 1,700 calories per

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:09.120
 day that used to be published, they were found to be able to maintain their weight on 700 calories

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:16.640
 a day because of low thyroid function. Fascinating. So it's fair to say, and I guess we can't even

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:24.400
 quantify, of what it is when folks worry or are stressed out and have angst and such,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.840
 to know what it's really doing with the body. But it certainly changes a lot of things.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:37.840
 Is that fair to say? Yeah. And low thyroid people chronically have anxiety because

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:45.120
 when your energy production goes down, it happens to everyone during the night, it compensates with

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:53.120
 increased adrenaline and cortisol to counteract the stress of low thyroid. But when your thyroid

00:22:53.120 --> 00:23:00.800
 is chronically low, you run around in the daytime with elevated adrenaline and cortisol.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.880
 Cortisol, yeah. Yeah. I've seen people with several times the normal amount of adrenaline

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:18.080
 production. And even for that would make a normal person seem very agitated and anxious.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:24.080
 Some people can function normally with four times as much adrenaline production as normal.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.680
 My goodness. And that's why some low thyroid people tend to sometimes get anxious or

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:37.520
 AFib and that kind of thing. Yeah. And especially at sunset when the stress hormones are normally

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:45.760
 rising, a low thyroid person can go into a very anxious, worrying state chronically. Every night

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:52.000
 they start worrying. So you mentioned that that's why we sleep, because the stress hormones come

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.240
 out. Why do they come out at night? Experiments on rabbits in Leningrad. They found that

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.960
 as soon as the lights were turned out, the mitochondria started swelling a little.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:17.600
 The nights there in the winter are about 16 hours long. And so halfway through the night,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:25.040
 the mitochondria were extremely enlarged. About three or four in the morning, they started

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:33.920
 exploding and collapsing and stopping energy production altogether. And they found that

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:41.760
 generally at the end of winter, because of these very long nights, their mitochondria

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:51.600
 had been seriously deteriorated the way an old person's mitochondria are. The DNA is lost,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:59.840
 for example. But because their summer days are extremely long, rabbits and people have

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:06.560
 more opportunity to restore their mitochondria. And certain kinds of exercise in old people

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:13.200
 can do the same thing that very long days do for rabbits and people in Leningrad.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:24.160
 You can restore even the DNA. A few surviving mitochondria with good DNA will multiply quickly

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:32.320
 under prolonged light and good exercise. In humans, there was a study in which they

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.600
 put a tube in their arms so they could take a blood sample every 15 minutes during the night.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.800
 And they found that when they turned the lights out, within 15 minutes, there was a rise

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:55.120
 in cortisol, which continued giving them an extremely high morning cortisol. But the ones

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:04.960
 who went to sleep, the rise was much lower than if they stayed awake. So sleep is a way of reducing

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.560
 our need for cortisol. I see. And we've been told over the years that it's really good to

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:17.360
 sleep and get early, and that that's really more beneficial than going to bed at 1, 12,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.560
 or 1 or 2 o'clock. Do you think there's something to that? Yeah. People who have spent the summer

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:30.640
 months in Antarctica, where the daylight is constant, have said they felt the best of their

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:39.600
 lives, didn't feel any of that nighttime stress. But getting to sleep early so that you're

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:47.840
 minimizing the stress of nighttime is very helpful to the body. Yeah. Speaking of light,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:52.960
 we've been doing some research and people are talking more about it, these near-infrared lights.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.280
 Do you have any opinions on the possible beneficials of some of these things?

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:07.680
 Infrared is basically heat, and it's good to help keep your metabolic rate up just by staying warm.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:15.920
 Like old people sleep better if they wear a wool hat and wool socks at night,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:24.880
 or even take a warm bath before bed. But the warming effect is one thing, but

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.600
 different wavelengths of infrared penetrate differently. Most of it is just warming the water,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:43.520
 so it's highly absorbed by your tissue. Red light, a fairly narrow band from orange to red,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:50.240
 is not absorbed by most of the things in the tissue. It passes right through water without

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:59.840
 heating it, but when it runs into a blue protein, a blue enzyme, which we have quite a few of those

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:07.840
 containing copper that makes them blue, under stress the free radicals and free electrons

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:21.440
 reduce that blue copper and turn it red. The red light being absorbed by those copper-containing

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:35.120
 enzymes changes the state, re-oxidizes the copper. It favors the oxidized and oxidizing state of the

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:43.760
 copper rather than the reduced state. That puts the mitochondria back to work because the copper

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:51.200
 enzymes are the final enzyme of the mitochondrial energy-producing system.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.960
 - So are you saying then some of these red lights can be beneficial?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:03.440
 - Yeah, they can, within just a minute or two, restore the enzyme activity and

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:12.400
 they've measured rats' cognitive ability and oxygen consumption in their brains,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:19.520
 just shining red light through their head. It restores their mitochondrial oxidation very

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.440
 quickly. - And then it'll continue on its own for a bit without the light?

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:31.680
 - Yeah, it has a certain momentum before the stress knocks it out again. So about every 10

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.440
 or 15 minutes having a little flash of light on your body would probably help.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.080
 - You'd almost put a red light thing on your bed and put it on a timer or something like that.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.680
 That might be fun. We're hearing a lot between this, I think, 600 to 800 nanometer range of the

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.520
 infrared lights. Do you think there's some value in that kind of an idea of working with those?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:00.800
 - Yes, 600 to 700 is the most important band. - Can you put that in your eyes as well,

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.920
 shining your eyes? - Yeah, there were experiments with,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:14.000
 for example, welders who burned their eyes with ultraviolet light were found to have

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.240
 instant pain relief almost when they looked at red light. And experimenters with deadly

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:31.200
 amounts of gamma rays that would kill a frog from radiation sickness in the first few hours after

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:38.800
 exposure, just a gigantic dose, when they gave them red light immediately after the radiation,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.200
 it didn't kill them. - My goodness.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:48.320
 - It had the same effect on the electrons which had been knocked out of their proper

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:55.760
 condition by the gamma rays. The red light restored the enzymes that would have led to

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.280
 fatal inflammation. - Cool. Dr. Ray Peat,

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.040
 stay right there, sir. We're going to just do a quick little break. Oh, it's fun talking to him,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.840
 isn't it? I mean, I don't know how he knows all this stuff. So it's an honor to have Dr. Peat here.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:17.600
 His website is rayPeat.com. He has a very fairly priced, very, very, very, not much at all. He can

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.680
 tell you in a couple, every couple of months, he does a nice newsletter. You can sign up for that

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.360
 one on rayPeat.com. If you, we're going to get to some of your emails. We've got more coming in,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.120
 but go ahead and get them in now. And we're going to jump through as many as we can here.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:37.120
 Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com. We got our hydrogen machine yesterday. I was able to get one

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:44.480
 because we sold some and through the commissions with George Wiseman, who has been working with

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.200
 these things for about 30 years and more and more, there's some really cool things going on

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.880
 with hydrogen gas and hydrogen bubbling your water. We'll see how, you know, what my experience is.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:00.080
 I haven't put it together yet, but I'm going to do that this afternoon and we'll be here tomorrow.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.720
 And I've got some real interesting things to talk to you about on what I discovered and how I created

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.760
 a situation where a little bug can go on my tummy from the spiritual level. And I think you'll find

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:16.080
 it interesting. That's tomorrow on Open Phone Friday at nine o'clock. And here's George talking

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.000
 about George. This was previously with George Wiseman about his AquaCure machine, making

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:31.600
 hydrogen gas and water out of the same hose. Listen. The body accepts that gas and uses it to

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:38.960
 heal everything. It's like the fountain of youth. It's astonishing the amount of ailments. In fact,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.520
 in scientific studies, and they have over a thousand scientific studies now, they are showing

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.400
 that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly from virtually every ailment that

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.600
 ails any water-based life form. But it works just as well on animals and plants and lizards and

00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:00.080
 birds and everybody. And you're saying this because this machine called the AquaCure split

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:08.080
 into five different parts. Six. I got hydrogen, oxygen, electro enhanced water, water vapors,

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.440
 monatomic hydrogen, what else? And monatomic oxygen. Oh, the monoxygen. And that's what your

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.480
 machine does? It splits it? Yes, it makes that mixture inside the machine and all that comes

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:24.320
 out a single hose, the same hose. Gas? As a gas, in gaseous form, yes. And you breathe it or you

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.720
 put it in water? So if you bubble the browns gas into this water, into let's say distilled water,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.800
 it will go to a negative ORP. And when you drink that, it actually gives your body an

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:41.680
 electrical energy. These electrons. Instead of sucking energy from you, it gives it. So you can

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.520
 have water that is healthful and not healthful just by the energy that's in the water.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:51.200
 You want to get one? Me too. Ours is on the way. Check this out. Lifetime warranty on the machine

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:58.960
 itself. And then a one year, no questions asked, money back guarantee if you like the machine

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:05.040
 within a year. I mean, have you ever heard of a warranty like that? The AquaCure. Use promo code

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:11.760

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:17.840
 fun, huh? So we'll see. And lots of questions about it. And actually Dr. Mark Circus on his

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.600
 website, he's going to be back in a couple of weeks. He's really into the hydrogen thing. Has

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.760
 been for 30 years. And he's got a lot of information on it. And you can go there too

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.920
 and read his stuff. And then if you want to get one, come back to our website, please,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:41.760
 and order it through our store. We have the Elk Velvet on sale right now. I want to remind you

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:48.800
 from Daniel Vitalis. And also, if you would like to help your sleeping, you could check out Ken

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.000
 Roller's scalar energy device. It is the Golden Pyramid. And it is put out scalar waves about 10,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.920
 15 feet. Put one of these puppies like on your headboard, you know, on your bed stand. And it's

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:05.280
 a beautiful little golden pyramid. And it helps people sleep. It just helps a lot. And I think

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.440
 you'll enjoy it. Or even at night, if you spend a lot of time in your living room reading or

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.560
 something, you could put one in there too. And the scalar energy device, as well as the water

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:24.320
 or the structuring device is in our store. And it's called the Vitalizer Plus. Great thing to

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:30.560
 structure water with. Helps your body to absorb better water. And I don't wonder how that's going

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.360
 to go. I could do structure the hydrogen water. I don't know. Well, we'll play with it. And it's

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:45.760
 all on oneradionetwork.com in our store. We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat, who's been at this

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:52.400
 forever. A long, long time. Dr. Peat, this is interesting. A lady just sent an email and she

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.680
 says, "I fall asleep and sleep well with my chicken light shining on me." Oh, that's the red

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:06.720
 kind of chicken light. Yeah, it looks like an ordinary incandescent bulb. But they're designed

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:17.920
 to run on 130 volts. And so on 120 standard voltage, they're less blue oriented. They're

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.760
 richer in the red light. And so I have one over my head all the time. Do you really?

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:30.000
 And it doesn't get too warm? I just have to be very close? I don't know, about three feet

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.360
 over my head. But in the winter, I use two of them. They help warm the room. But it's always a

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:44.560
 beneficial anti-stress light to be going right through your skin into your head. But these would

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:51.280
 be different. Is it just a different technology or strength? You tell me, please, the difference

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.000
 between those chicken lamp things you can get in Home Depot and the bulb and not very expensive.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.480
 Some people are even putting them four or five in a row and making a little sauna out of them.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:07.120
 Or some of these more expensive six to 800 far red thread things. I mean, is there a beneficial to

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:17.360
 the to the more juicy or the more souped up ones? No, no, no, the $5 ones are fine. Yeah. They used

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.640
 because they were designed for the higher voltage. They used to burn forever on standard 120 volts.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.920
 But I think now that the demand for them has increased, they've learned how to make them burn

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.800
 out like an ordinary light bulb. So you have to buy a new one. Well, ladies and gentlemen,

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.280
 we've been talking to an engineer that made a beautiful little thing where there's four of them

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.920
 and you can get it and we're going to we're going to be selling it on our website. So Dr. Peat says

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.320
 they're just as good as the more expensive ones. And you could put one and do a little sauna or

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:52.640
 just kind of, you know, sit in front of it. You know, Dr. Peat, I've got about three of them on

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.000
 a chair, you know, one of those big black things where you can hook them on a chair.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.720
 And as you said, in the winter, if I'm reading or watching a movie, I like to shine those on me.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:08.240
 And it's really comforting, isn't it? They're very nice. Yeah. And even with serious neurological

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:14.880
 diseases, they can help restore mitochondria. This is an email from Jerome. He is in Germany.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:22.560
 Well, hi, Jerome. It's probably seven o'clock in the or six or so in Germany. He says I'm about 65

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.520
 revolutions around the sun. As Patrick says, I'm in very good health, but I do have some

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.840
 numbness toes, my feet sometimes and it just feels numb. And I like the circulation is not

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:40.320
 going well. Can Dr. Peat give me some ideas what could be going on and what could be some remedies?

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:49.520
 I think with age, one of the things becomes chronic inflammation, inflammation, slow digestion,

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:57.520
 and the intestine not only releases its inflammatory signals into the bloodstream,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:06.880
 but the nerves that pass through the pelvic area, I think are being poisoned by the

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:16.560
 intestine emits some of these serotonin, histamine, nitric oxide, endotoxin substances

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:23.040
 out into the general pelvic area. And so it can affect the way the bladder works,

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:30.160
 tends to slow down the muscle contraction. And it can also poison the nerves, as well as the

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:38.400
 blood vessels passing through the pelvis and slow down the nerve and circulation, energy production

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:45.840
 in the legs and feet. Wow, very interesting. So let's go back to the cause of that. What kind of

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:56.080
 things can Jerome do? The accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the tissue means that

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:05.600
 any particular inflammation, for example, a green salad isn't digestible by humans and so it feeds

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:15.840
 bacteria and the bacteria will produce various things that activate the signals of inflammation.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:24.960
 And the more polyunsaturated fat you have stored in your tissues, the more inflammatory prostaglandin,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:36.720
 especially PGE2, will be produced. And that circulates through the body as it only goes a

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:44.000
 certain distance in the blood, but it creates these cascade effects of one thing stimulating

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.240
 another. So cutting your polyunsaturated fats or using aspirin chronically, the aspirin will block

00:40:52.800 --> 00:41:00.560
 the formation of prostaglandins and reduce that amplifying effect. So the aspirins would be a

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:08.000
 negative thing, right? The aspirin would be a negative thing? No, it helps to block that

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.160
 amplifying of the inflammation. It blocks prostaglandin formation. Oh, it does. So Jerome,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.240
 could he even try that? I mean, just like a bear aspirin, how much would you take or a little baby

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:28.240
 aspirin? Enough to make the symptoms go away is the basic thing. And if you're going to do it

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:36.240
 chronically, especially if you have used antibiotics and disturbed the intestinal bacteria, a chronic

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:45.360
 use of aspirin can cause abnormal excess bleeding. And so you want to make sure your diet has some

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:54.320
 vitamin K in it. When I was first experimenting with chronic use of aspirin, I noticed that if I

00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:01.520
 scratched myself slightly, I would leave drops of blood for about 20 or 30 minutes afterwards.

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:10.560
 So I took vitamin K and now I can take a little bit of aspirin. A thousand milligrams a day

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:16.320
 doesn't cause any bleeding abnormality. Just because you're taking the K? Yeah. Is that K2

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:25.360
 or just K? Our liver can make the whole range. Okay. If you eat liver, oh, two or three times

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:32.880
 a month, you get the range of K1, K2 and various others. You're not the, as you know, the only

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:37.440
 person that recommends folks do a little liver a couple of times a month. It's really beneficial

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:46.400
 for most people. Is it? Okay. Yeah. Here's an email from Carol. Does Dr. Peat, do you prefer certain

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:56.880
 types of protein powders? No, powdering protein. Most proteins contain two or three amino acids

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:04.560
 that are very unstable. When they break down, they can produce inflammatory toxins. The indoles made

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:15.040
 from tryptophan, for example, are age-related and stress-related toxins. And if you oxidize a normal

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:23.040
 protein, you will get some breakdown of the unstable amino acids. Cysteine and tryptophan

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:33.200
 are the worst for breaking down in processing. So the only protein that doesn't have these

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:43.840
 unstable amino acids is gelatin. So nicely made clean gelatin can be powdered.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.000
 Gelatin? You mean you're just talking about gelatin from the store?

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.880
 Yeah. That's protein.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:58.880
 Yeah. It isn't a complete protein for a growing animal, but an adult who isn't growing

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:07.760
 has a very small requirement for tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine. And if you reduce

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:17.840
 an adult animal, reduce the methionine alone in its diet, experiments have found a 40% extension

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:26.560
 of their lifespan just by that one protein being reduced to a minimum maintenance requirement.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:36.400
 I think you'd get better results reducing the cysteine and tryptophan at the same time,

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.720
 which gelatin would do.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.120
 Gelatin. Well, here's an interesting, it ties right in. So let's see.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:51.120
 Let's see. It's kind of long. I'm going to paraphrase. Judy says she talked to somebody

00:44:51.120 --> 00:45:00.480
 on YouTube, Dr. Gray, and talked about Parkinson's and he said that he helped with a few things and

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.280
 she's been doing it and actually sleeping better. She's taking a little bit of tyrosine, cysteine,

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:13.840
 and 5-HTP for potential Parkinson's and to sleep. Does Dr. Peat think this could be a good idea?

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:22.800
 No, I don't think the 5-HTP is good at all. It can lead to increased inflammation.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.920
 Oh, it just does. How about the cysteine and the tyrosine?

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:32.720
 Cysteine, no. It produces inflammation and can damage mitochondria.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.640
 Oh, good. And tyrosine?

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.680
 I think it's okay. Not too much of it.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.760
 What does it do? Just take a little bit?

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:46.320
 Well, it leads to adrenaline, for example, and in moderation, that isn't harmful.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.600
 Okay. Why would you take it though if you're not doing the other ones? Do you think that

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:55.520
 she would get the results that she wants? A little bit of it isn't harmful and it

00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.600
 can have a slightly stimulating effect if you're somewhat low in protein. But

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:12.320
 gelatin, for example, has a generous amount of the precursors to adrenaline and dopamine.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.080
 Yeah, this just popped in. We might as well say it while it's here. Ken says,

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.920
 "So where do I get this gelatin Dr. Peat is talking about?" It sounds interesting.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:31.520
 There are two companies I know of that have a good, clean product. Great Lakes Gelatin is an

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.960
 old company from the 1920s or '30s. I think they were selling medical gelatin.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.120
 We know them. Yeah. Great Lakes.

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.080
 I think Innovation Products, something like that is the name of the other one I've used.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.840
 I got it by an 80-pound bag, I think it was.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.280
 Wow. So you can take a lot of it. You can take a lot of it.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.360
 Yeah. 30 grams a day is fine.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:01.440
 Now, the Great Lakes, they offer the red can and the green can. I think the green is a little bit

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.680
 more processed. Does it matter to you, Dr. Peat? No, I haven't used much of it, but I don't think

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:13.680
 there's any harm in using the soluble one. Oh, you mean the green label is soluble?

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.640
 Easier to dissolve without too much stirring and heating.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:22.960
 So just basically, the body likes this kind of a protein.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.400
 The adult body. The adult body likes it more than all

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.080
 these other things that they sell out there, these pea proteins, all that stuff?

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.840
 Yeah, those all have toxic breakdown products when they're dehydrated.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.240
 Oh, great. Same with liver powder.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:44.960
 You can't safely dehydrate liver. Here's an email, Dr. Peat.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:53.600
 My blood glucose level came back at 127. The normal range says 70 to 99, so I guess he's

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.600
 talking about the fasting blood glucose. Should I be concerned? All the chemistry readings were

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.440
 in the normal range. I wouldn't be concerned, but you should

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:12.720
 pay attention to things like your temperature and pulse rate, and watch your cholesterol if

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:25.440
 you have a blood test. In the long range, it will probably come down when your thyroid function is

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:30.480
 optimal. When you say the pulse rate, talk a bit about that.

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:42.800
 When your adrenaline rises to compensate for low thyroid, it prevents the very, very slow pulse

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:50.560
 rate of hypothyroidism in the classical sense. Often, a person waking up in the morning when

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:58.000
 their cortisol is high, they will sometimes have a racing heart, which slows to normal

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.520
 after breakfast. That's because of the high stress hormones during the night.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:14.720
 So either very high in the morning pulse rate or very low during the day. I've seen people as low

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:22.880
 as 35 beats per minute who are still getting around, usually very sluggish and depressed,

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:32.000
 sometimes as a result of over-training. Heavy training lowers your thyroid and metabolic rate.

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:45.920
 The healthy, high IQ kids in some studies all had around an 85 beats per minute pulse rate.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:58.320
 Some studies on older people found that, like the high school age kids, the pulse rate varied with

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:09.600
 their IQ. Very low thyroid tired people have lower mental functioning. So they had people who had had

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:18.160
 heart implants, and so they gave them a mental test with a heart set at 70 beats per minute,

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:26.320
 then turned up the stimulator to produce 85 beats per minute, and all of their mental functions,

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:35.280
 ability to calculate and reason and memory increased just by turning up the rate of the

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:42.240
 artificial heart stimulator. Fascinating. So as folks' thyroid get more in balance for them,

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.560
 generally they're going to increase their pulse rate a bit.

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:53.040
 Yeah, in the range of 80 to 90, I think is good for most people.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.560
 That's amazing. Dr. Peep.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:03.360
 And that tends to go with a stable blood sugar, usually around 90, and a stable blood pressure,

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:07.120
 usually roughly in the range of 120 over 80.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:15.600
 Boy, mine's been 60 pulse rate for 50 years, I think. If I got to 80 or 90, I'd probably,

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:21.280
 I don't know, like, "Whoa, man, it would feel not good to me." So I'm kind of confused.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:30.640
 The first week or two that you supplement thyroid, if you're running around keeping your heart rate

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:38.720
 going with adrenaline, the first thing you feel is that the thyroid is like speed. It makes you

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:46.880
 anxious and tense. That's a typical reaction to the first days. But if you go very slow,

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:56.800
 like a fourth of the standard dose or less, do that daily for several weeks, you'll find that

00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:02.560
 your pulse is slowing down and your temperature is slightly creeping up.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:15.280
 When you are fully oxidizing, the energy production from the high oxidizing function of the

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:24.000
 mitochondria, that has a relaxing effect on your nerves and muscles. Your muscles will

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.440
 instantly be able to go into a relaxed state, and sleep will come on very quickly because your brain

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:40.720
 quickly goes into the deep sleep. A low thyroid person, typically, when they measure the brain

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:47.680
 waves, they aren't able to get into the deepest levels of sleep, and so sleep isn't restful.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:54.800
 Very, very, very interesting. So you have people even start maybe 15 of those milligrams of a 60

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:59.440
 caps thyroid thing and just kind of juice it up a little bit. So then eventually,

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:05.280
 would then the pulse rate go up a little bit, but do it normally, not on adrenaline,

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.360
 but because your thyroid is working better, is what you're saying?

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:13.280
 Gradually, as your temperature and oxygen consumption increase, one of the first things

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:20.000
 that happens in the first hours or even minutes after taking a thyroid supplement is that your

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:30.480
 cells begin making more energy, and they're able to retain magnesium in the cell because magnesium

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:40.400
 binds to ATP. A low thyroid person is breaking down the ATP because there's not enough magnesium

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:46.480
 to stabilize it, and if you don't have a good reserve of magnesium somewhere in your body,

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:56.880
 increasing the thyroid runs into a wall where there's not enough magnesium, and so it does

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:04.480
 nothing but increase stress. So making sure you're getting enough magnesium is essential when you're

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.520
 adjusting the thyroid. And what's a reasonable dose to look at daily of MAG?

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:17.360
 Oh, in the first two or three days, it's okay to take a gram or two of magnesium carbonate,

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:27.680
 but just have a good diet. Coffee is rich in magnesium, milk, orange juice, meat and fish.

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.120
 All of those are good magnesium sources. Is magnesium glycinate okay? I've got some of those.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.240
 Yeah. Yeah, it is.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.000
 That's good. Wow. How'd you figure all this stuff out?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.600
 What?

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:44.400
 How'd you figure all this stuff out? I'm just amazed. It's like, whoa.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:53.360
 A professor at University of Colorado did the experiment on magnesium.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.000
 I see.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:02.480
 And the doctor friend tested it on his patients, found that giving a combination of T3 thyroid

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:12.160
 and magnesium IV instantly relieved his allergy patients, but when they got the magnesium with

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:18.480
 the thyroid, it kept them out of the allergic state. It cured the allergy instead of just

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.360
 temporarily relieving it. My gosh. The T3, a lot different, straight TV,

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.720
 T3 is a lot different from just your standard piggy thyroid and the 60 milligram things that

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:38.640
 they sell. Yeah. And it works within actually seconds. You chew up two or three micrograms of

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:45.680
 it, but if you just swallow a pill, it works maximally an hour and a half after you swallow

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:52.080
 a pill. And then it fades off losing half of its activity in the first 12 hours. So

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:58.480
 it isn't something you can take once a day because you would have very sharp ups and downs.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:03.760
 That's why the glandular powder is better.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.120
 Ellen writes in, can you, can Dr. Peat recommend a brand of Colorella that he likes better than

00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:23.920
 others? Colorella? No, I wouldn't touch it myself. How come? All of those organisms have some

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:32.160
 irritating components, but sometimes the growth in the lake can become contaminated with a toxic

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:42.400
 version. So I think it's always risky. Spirulina, same caution. Spirulina, same cautionary tale.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:51.920
 Mitchell is writing in, I wonder if you could ask Dr. Peat about hammertoes. Do you know anything

00:56:51.920 --> 00:57:00.480
 about hammertoes? Not really. I think it probably involves some of the same inflammatory things that

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:08.480
 affect the nerves and blood vessels of the feet, but I've never experimented on anyone with it.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.480
 Okay. Gio, Gio, that's a nice name. I was wondering if you could ask Dr. Peat about

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:23.520
 bloating. It seems to be caused by sugar. Myelin blue and methylene blue, M-E-T-H-Y-L-E-N-E blue

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:32.240
 sometimes help. Does he have any advice? Slow digestion. And when you have bacteria

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:39.520
 living where they shouldn't, they should stay in the colon. But when your digestion is poor and

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:48.080
 slow, they can move up. A very hypothyroid person sometimes has bacteria and yeast living in the

00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:55.360
 stomach. You've heard of the stomach cancer and ulcers caused by bacteria living there.

00:57:55.360 --> 00:58:04.800
 Sometimes various microorganisms can occupy the upper parts of the intestine. And when you have

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:14.800
 bacteria in the small intestine, they will eat anything that they contact. So sugar, which should

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:22.320
 be absorbed very quickly in your stomach and very early part of the upper intestine, the bacteria

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:30.240
 can get to it before you can absorb it. So sugar can very quickly produce gas. Ordinarily,

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:40.960
 the slower digesting vegetables with starches that are intertwined with fibrous cellulose-type

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:49.120
 material, like Nens, those are the things that normally cause bloating and feed bacteria in the

00:58:49.120 --> 00:59:00.800
 lower small intestine. Beans, even in the colon, the fibrous material in beans very commonly will

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:08.800
 cause gas. But other vegetables, if your digestion is slow. So the first thing is to accelerate the

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:17.360
 transit of your food. And thyroid is the main thing behind that energetic quality of the intestine.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:23.200
 - Okay. So you're talking about this whole SIBO thing that people talk a lot about this

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:26.880
 small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. - Yeah.

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:36.240
 - Yeah. Can you ask Dr. Peat his information on what, oh, taking turpentine would do to the stomach

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:43.680
 acid overall. Have you heard people doing turpentine? - Oh, yeah. Since I was a little kid,

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.920
 you would put a drop on a sugar cube, for example. - Oh, so you know about that, yeah.

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:55.760
 - I always loved painting with turpentine as the solvent. I like the smell of it. And I think it's

00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:03.840
 basically harmless. If you look at the internet, you'll see thousands of warnings about toxicity.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:10.320
 - It's harmless, yeah. - Yeah. You can become very allergic to it.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:16.240
 And so you'll know if you're allergic to it. And it's the same with the citrus thinners that

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.160
 they're selling to replace turpentine. They can become extremely allergenic,

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.600
 especially if they're aged. - And if you're hearing this for the

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.400
 first time, you want to make sure that you're using like pure gum spirits of turpentine and not

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.840
 just an old can off of Home Depot. Just get the real deal. And we have one in our store that's

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.840
 just pine trees. That's all they do. They just say, "Sap it and cook it." Yeah.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:47.040
 - Some of the companies are selling stuff in their old pure gum spirits, pine turpentine cans,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.520
 and it turns out to be gasoline. - Oh, my goodness.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:56.960
 - Selling it for $25 a gallon instead of $3.50. - So be careful. I would do the

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.800
 Diamond G Forest products. You can go on Amazon or I think we have it on our store still,

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.440
 Diamond G Forest products. We've talked to those people. They just tap a pine tree,

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:12.880
 they take out the sap, and they cook it. That's all they do. That's it. Just pretty cool.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.800
 Stay right there, Dr. Peat. We have more questions for you. Patrick Timpone,

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:26.160
 oneradionetwork.com. It's so interesting. Dr. Peat mentioned the bacterial overgrowth thing,

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:32.160
 and I've been playing around with Wayne Blakely's Bifido 2. Now, the Bifido is a very cool thing

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:39.200
 with the curcumin from India where you can get the little yttrium. They got some very nice special

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:46.320
 bacteria in there that helps the yttrium to get released. And that's one of the reasons why

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.840
 Richard Ulrey and other people have said that the yttrium doesn't get released much in the

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.280
 horse oil because the bacteria is not there. So that's curious. But you can get the Bifido 2,

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.960
 and you can put this in your ears. I've been doing it every night. My body likes it. And you can put

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.520
 it in each ear and then bend over, and hold the ear, do the other ear. And then you can also use

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:14.720
 the Bifido 2 in your eyes along with Florapium in your eyes, just a drop or two. And I'm getting

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:23.840
 gooey stuff coming out of my eyes like every day. It's like crazy. And it looks like it's trying to

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.360
 just clean up a little bit of scarring on the eyes, a little bit of fat. I'm not sure where

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.480
 the gooey stuff's coming from, but I like it. And my eyes are getting clearer and brighter.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.360
 Just using it in the eyes over a couple of weeks. Pretty interesting. So these are a couple of

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.960
 things you can play with if you're interested in living streams, the Bifido 2 or the Bifido.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:51.600
 Yeah, that's it. Previously, we talked with Brandon Amelani about his Blue Shield product

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.760
 to protect against EMFs in your home. The more connected we are, the more

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.160
 electromagnetic radiation we're going to have. So years ago, I'd play with Q-Links. Just anything I

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.240
 can get my hands on that, whether I felt it working or not, I just wanted some kind of

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.240
 leverage against electromagnetic radiation and those frequencies and how they affect the cellular

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.800
 biology. But then when I met Mark and started really getting deep to his technology and really

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:18.480
 looking at the microprocessing technology, I've never found any EMF company that would not only

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.600
 to test on not only human blood and urine analysis, but also on animals, which totally weeds out the

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.640
 idea of placebo effect. I mean, the fact that you can plug these devices into a chicken farm,

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.160
 a factory farm for about 15,000 laying hens, and all of a sudden the mortality rate, which is

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.720
 averages from 60 to 150 deaths per month, it goes down to zero. I mean, it's pretty profound that a

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.960
 little device, a little energy device could actually create such a harmony and balance within

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.480
 the environment to where claustrophobic chickens that are crammed in together actually get along

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:56.560
 better and actually feel better. And the biological markers are improved over that one year study.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:00.160
 There's quite a bit of science with this Blue Shield product. You can see the ad on the front

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:08.080
 page. Promo code OneRadio will get you a 10% discount. This works on the cells in the body.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:14.000
 Very cool technology. Front page, blueshieldoneradionetwork.com. Previously with

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.640
 Brandon Amelani of Shen Blossom talking about our very special ginseng. And you don't want something

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:26.160
 that's been corrupted coming into your body. Like the ginseng is a super important example of that.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:32.080
 You know, when you're using aggressive alcohols and solvents, it has a strange effect with ginseng

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.240
 in the sense that when you're not only over processing it, but putting it in really aggressive

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.200
 alcohols, what's going to happen is that you're going to flip the chemistry on some of the

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:48.800
 androgenic. Naturally, it's androgenic. It's going to basically protect the telomeres and add life to

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:55.280
 the body and protect the genetic replication of the cells. But it's also going to boost the

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.640
 androgens and boost the male hormones in the body. But if you incubate it in really aggressive

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.440
 alcohol, it flips those to become estrogenic. Now, estrogens, phytoestrogens are not necessarily bad

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:09.440
 in balance, but you really don't want that with your ginseng, especially if you're getting like

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.880
 a really high quality, a really old root, something that's very special. You want to

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.360
 like treat it with care and make sure it's delivering what ginseng has to offer. Just a

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.240
 short clip from Brandon talking about the way they do the ginseng, just to give you a better

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:28.560
 idea of where this company is coming from, the quality and the ethics. Brandon and the Shen

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.680
 Blossom link on OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:44.240
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information. Know the source. OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:51.440
 Yeah, I like that line a lot. And while we do what we can here and just trying to provide as much

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:56.800
 different opinions and ideas, and this morning is one of our faves and we appreciate you coming

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:06.080
 on Dr. Peat from time to time. Dr. Ray Peat, his website, raypeat.com. This one, Leslie,

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:11.680
 I'm getting so much different information on the internet about iodine. Some people are taking

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:18.000
 massive doses. Some people say you don't need it. And I wanted to what Dr. Peat says in general,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.040
 do you think I need should be taking iodine every day?

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:30.400
 No, milk, for example, is a good source of iodine because the cows won't give milk if they're iodine

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:38.320
 deficient. Chickens, chickens will stop laying eggs if they're iodine deficient. So milk and eggs are

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:50.960
 guaranteed sources of iodine. And seafood, any kind of ocean fish, oysters, crab, cod, whatever,

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:58.240
 is going to provide enough iodine along with the associated selenium, which is an essential

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:03.440
 nutrient for thyroid function. Can we get enough selenium with Brazil nuts and other foods?

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:10.560
 Yeah, those are fine. Good. Here's an email after taking digestive aid without lots of quality

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:18.080
 foods at it and curious of his thoughts on that. I don't know what she means by that,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:21.200
 without lots of quality foods. Does he suggest soaking?

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:35.760
 Some digestive aids like pancreatic enzymes can be extremely helpful. But you want to watch that

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:44.160
 they aren't made from just a fungus. If they're including a lot of strange enzymes, they're

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:50.000
 probably from a fungus and they can contain allergens. So you want to be cautious. Some

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.960
 people can have very intense reactions to them. Can you and she wants to know if you can put some

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:01.280
 foods in an enzyme solution to see if it digested? Is that a reasonable experiment?

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:12.240
 Not really. There were experiments with the pancreatic enzymes and stomach acid in a test

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:20.400
 tube. They found that they were extremely slow when they mixed up a protein with acid and the

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:32.160
 pancreatic protein aces. But when they took a piece of intestine, fixed it with formaldehyde

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:42.480
 so it was totally dead, but dropped this fuzzy piece of intestine lining into the solution of

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:53.200
 acid enzyme and protein, and suddenly the reaction went at top rate. It's because the enzymes in a

01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:01.120
 free solution don't contact the proteins that they're supposed to digest. But if they're laid

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:11.200
 out in the proper arrangement on the fuzzy lining of the intestine, that's where any

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:18.960
 substrate protein tends to fall against this flat surface, be bound,

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:25.920
 adsorbed to the surface, and then you get instantaneous protein digestion.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:41.200
 So a baby, for example, in the very first few months does assimilate protein from the liquid

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:50.320
 phase, but with maturation, the lining of the intestine becomes at least 90% of the

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.800
 digestive activity for proteins. Wow. What source of progesterone would

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.560
 Dr. Peat suggest I use if I want to take progesterone?

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:08.560
 The kind that I designed and have been using for about 50 years was Progest-E

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:20.240
 Complex. It's a progesterone in the oily solution that I found works well through the skin

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.800
 as well as orally. Progest-E. Can people buy that?

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:32.560
 Yeah. Kenogen is the maker of it that has been following my formula for 40 years.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.920
 Ketogen. K-E-N-O-G-E-N.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:41.520
 Oh, Kenogen, like Keno. So what's the source of that? Is it the Yam stuff?

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:50.960
 That, it can vary. I don't know what the company, it's an American company that makes the

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:57.840
 actual progesterone, but I don't think it matters at all what the original material was because

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.800
 there are about 20 chemical reactions in between the Yam and the progesterone.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:09.760
 Are men listening this morning, is there any reason why they might look at progesterone too?

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:19.600
 Yeah. The stress hormones will cause testosterone to be turned to estrogen very quickly.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:28.720
 And that's why testosterone declines with aging as estrogen rises. And getting the stress hormones

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:36.800
 down, progesterone and pregnenolone are the two main things for stopping the formation of estrogen

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:47.840
 from testosterone. So a large dose of progesterone will have an anti-androgen effect. If you take

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:55.680
 like 100 milligrams, you can notice a temporary neutralizing of testosterone. But at small doses,

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.480
 its only effect is to free up the natural functions of testosterone by blocking

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:09.600
 the stress conversion to estrogen. Wow. But you don't want to just take too much of that,

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:17.120
 it just takes a little bit. Yeah. I've taken 100 milligrams. Twice I did that for a migraine

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:24.320
 headache and the headache stopped within one or two minutes. But the following day,

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:30.800
 I didn't have any whiskered growth. That's funny. So your testosterone wasn't happy.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:36.160
 Yeah, just totally neutral. But I guess on that company you mentioned, they probably dose it out

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:44.720
 pretty cleanly and tell you what to take. No, you can't overdose if you use it only on your skin.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.960
 Right. And so this is a cream, this Kenogen thing? An oil.

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.040
 I know, it's an oil. Cool. Oh, you can't overdose if you do it on there?

01:12:53.040 --> 01:13:02.000
 Yeah, but not orally. You can overdose orally. Here is an email. Can you tell us more about

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.960
 the protein content and vitamin C content of potatoes? The question is from a couple of people

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:16.160
 who think a day without a potato is an incomplete day. That's funny. So do you know about potatoes?

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:23.840
 Can you talk about that protein? Yeah, there were studies in the Pacific Islanders.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:30.000
 They found that they were eating nothing but potatoes for 50 or 51 weeks of the year. And

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.680
 then at the end of the year, they had a festival where they would eat pork. But they were very

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:45.040
 healthy, well-muscled people, 50 weeks of the year, pure potato diet. So they did experiments

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:53.920
 and found that potatoes, by analysis, they seem to have a very low protein content. But

01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:03.040
 with animal feeding experiments, the protein turned out to be higher quality in terms of

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:10.160
 biological effect, higher quality than egg yolk protein, which was defined as the perfect protein.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:19.600
 So what was happening was that in the juice, there are amino acid, keto acid versions of the

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:29.680
 essential amino acids, not protein, not even amino acids, but a ketone equivalent. As soon as the

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:38.160
 body absorbs it, any ammonia that's available can be attached to this keto acid, turning it into an

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:47.040
 essential amino acid. And so what was invisible to chemical analysis suddenly in the body functions,

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:56.160
 making it a higher quality protein than a perfect protein, just because they weren't able to measure

01:14:56.160 --> 01:15:03.040
 what was present. And he's asking about the vitamin C content of potatoes? Yeah, these people

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:11.120
 who ate a pure potato diet had no vitamin deficiencies at all. It isn't just vitamin C,

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:23.680
 but everything except vitamin B12, and they're low in iron too, and vitamin A,

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:30.400
 actual animal form of vitamin A is not there. But other than that, they're a good source of

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:36.080
 the B vitamins and most of the minerals. Very interesting. So would this work for russets,

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:40.560
 or the new potatoes, or purple potatoes, sweet potatoes, everything, all of them?

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:48.480
 They vary quite a bit in composition. Sweet potatoes often have keratin that makes it

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:55.520
 harder to digest, interferes with the enzymes. And the others, some potatoes are very watery,

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:03.600
 some very starchy. But if it tastes good, basically, it's going to have some of the

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.160
 high quality protein value. We have a regular guest, Adam Bergstrom, I think you know that

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:12.000
 he talks about dextronizing the potatoes. So if you do it at a low temperature,

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:19.120
 maybe 325, 350, where it takes two or three hours for a baker, where it actually makes the starch

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:24.000
 you could turn more into sugar, more easily digestible. And they taste good too. Oh,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.880
 yeah, they do taste good. And with butter, phew, forget about it, right? It's like all you need,

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:35.520
 man. You're just good. Let's see, boy, we got to burn through them here before we let you go.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:43.360
 Can Dr. Peat recommend a certain body weight to serving ratio for eggshell calcium powder?

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:48.880
 I was interested in finding a safe daily amount to use. So he's wanted to take eggshell calcium,

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.800
 but he wants to know body weight serving. Do you recommend taking eggshell calcium?

01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:00.800
 It's the next best thing to milk as a source of calcium. Milk and cheese, and then eggshell,

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:06.640
 and then the next would be oyster shell. It's calcium carbonate in a very pure form.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:14.960
 And if it isn't finely ground, it is irritating to some people's stomachs. So you have to

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:28.000
 watch out for your reaction. But in milk drinkers, there's no harm in getting thousands of milligrams

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:38.160
 of calcium per day. With eggshell, if you had 5,000 milligrams of it, five, five grams would be a

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:46.880
 pretty massive chunk of eggshell to have going through your intestine. It could be irritating.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:54.000
 So I think the effect on your digestion is the main thing because if you absorb it,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.720
 then it's going to have an anti-inflammatory effect.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.280
 Boy, the people that make those posters that got milk with a white mustache,

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:04.160
 they must love you, Dr. Peat. Probably.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.760
 Do you know of anything, here's an email, most effective in regrowing hair? Lost people

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:19.120
 experiencing chronic long-term digestive orders. So he thinks the digestive disorders have caused

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.320
 his hair to kind of, do you know anything to regrow those babies?

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:33.600
 The anti-stress hormones, all are helpful. But one of the crucial things, you've probably heard

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:42.000
 the connection between hair loss and heart disease. There is an association. And that's because of the

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:51.760
 stress hormones. And one of the basic stress producers is the parathyroid hormone interacting

01:18:53.440 --> 01:19:03.760
 with the bones and mitochondria. And it happens that the high parathyroid hormone is very

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:11.680
 destructive to the hair follicle. And so lowering the parathyroid hormone with vitamin D and calcium

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:20.960
 in the diet is probably the single most protective thing that can be done both for heart disease

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.720
 and the hair follicle. Because that will help to restore your thyroid function,

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:33.200
 which helps to restore progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, and so on, lowers the stress.

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:37.840
 And when you mention these different vitamins, Dr. Peat, you're not necessarily suggesting people

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:42.480
 run out and start supplementing with these. But we can get a lot of these things from

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.240
 food, is that correct?

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:51.840
 Yeah. When I was teaching nutrition, I had my students think of the simplest foods that

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:59.840
 you could get all of the nutrients from. And eggs and orange juice, they found that you could get

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.960
 all of your essential nutrients just from those in the right quantities. And with milk, eggs,

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:14.800
 and orange juice, and assorted other things, it's very easy to get all of your required vitamins in

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.840
 more than required amounts.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:25.280
 Patricia writes in, "Can you elaborate on how and why calcium could go rogue and forms and

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.520
 is deposited as harmful plaque and calcifications in the joints?"

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:36.880
 Yeah, exactly the same thing that causes the heart disease and hair loss and so on. The

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:46.160
 mitochondria are the first thing poisoned by misplaced calcium. And what parathyroid hormone

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:56.400
 is to block mitochondria metabolism, turn on lactic acid production. And lactic acid

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:04.240
 is essential for taking calcium out of your bones where it should be. And in the process,

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:11.520
 it shifts the balance in a way that makes it tend to deposit in soft tissues where it shouldn't be.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:18.960
 And parathyroid hormone rises when your diet doesn't have enough vitamin D, calcium, and

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:25.920
 magnesium. And so increasing your calcium in your diet will lower the parathyroid hormone and

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:32.240
 protect you against blood vessel calcification and other improper calcifications.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:39.120
 Here's a lady that's looking at taking, she would like to take a little magnesium as well as zinc,

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:44.560
 but wants to know what your recommendations are like glycinate or the different sinks or

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.480
 the different magnesiums. Do you have favorites?

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:56.480
 I've never heard bad reports from magnesium glycinate, but the only one I've ever used

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:04.400
 was magnesium carbonate. But that can cause headaches. Apparently some impurity gets into the

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:13.120
 supplement form. So I rarely recommend any supplement. And I think it's best to get it from

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.440
 pure natural foods.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.680
 Right. But magnesium is a reasonable thing from many people?

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:24.960
 Yeah, if you don't get a headache or asthma or diarrhea or something.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.600
 Something like that.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.640
 From the supplement.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:29.840
 And how about the zinc? If somebody wanted to take zinc for some reason,

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.920
 is there a better kind than others?

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:41.600
 Not really. Gluconate is okay, but I don't think doses above 10 milligrams per day are safe.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.880
 Oh, so just stay below 10 milligrams for the zinc.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.380
 Yeah.

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:54.960
 Earlier you mentioned a machine to make hydrogenated water.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.720
 Yeah. It's a gas where you can put hydrogen in the water. Yes, sir.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:05.440
 I think it would be good if you can have the opportunity to experiment with carbonated water

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:13.360
 combined with your hydrogen water. Both of those, I think it would work together to restore cell

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:14.000
 energy.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.560
 Really? So in other words, you just get like a carbonated, maybe something like a

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.080
 Perrier or something like that?

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:30.240
 Something like that. You can buy cheap supermarket carbonated water. The person who

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:38.400
 discovered oxygen, it was really incidental. He was working on how to carbonate water because

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:44.800
 they knew in the 18th century that naturally carbonated mineral water was good for the

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:52.400
 health. So he was working on making carbon dioxide and accidentally came across oxygen.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:57.360
 So you're thinking if we're going to get one of these machines, which I have,

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:01.680
 maybe try it with carbonated water too and see if you can feel a difference?

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.600
 I would bet that it would be about twice as effective.

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.200
 Really? Wow. What's the science behind that again? Just quickly.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:18.240
 Well, Joseph Priestley, who discovered both oxygen and how to make carbonated water,

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:29.120
 at that time people quickly put this carbonated water and pure carbon dioxide gas to use in

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:37.760
 various diseases. They found that alleviated breast cancer, for example, and they described

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:45.920
 patients who were kept in a relatively healthy condition, healing the ulcer of a cancerous

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:51.920
 breast, for example. The ulcer would close up when they were exposed to carbon dioxide. So

01:24:51.920 --> 01:25:00.880
 they were giving CO2 enemas and douches and applying it locally to injured tissue.

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:07.200
 As early as the 1790s, they were writing about its therapeutic properties.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:13.920
 And the Japanese are currently using it experimentally against cancer.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.600
 What do you think about the therapeutic properties just of the hydrogen in general?

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:25.200
 There has been very little study of that because it's counter-cultural.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.080
 Counter-cultural, yeah.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:38.800
 Very thin line of research suggesting that we can dehydrogenase enzymes that feed energy into

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:47.840
 the mitochondria, probably can assimilate this gaseous hydrogen right from the environment,

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:55.360
 turning it into energy. But the amount of research on that has been very thin over the last 50 years.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.160
 A lot of peer-reviewed studies, though, about the benefits. But so we'll see. People seem to

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:06.640
 really like it. That's interesting about the carbonated water. I mean, my goodness. That's

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.000
 just real. Double it, do you think, could double the benefits, you think?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.680
 I would guess.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.080
 Oh, that's pretty fun. Well, Dr. Peat, we've burned through it here. It's time for you to...

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.240
 What are you going to do the rest of the day?

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.480
 Oh, I'll probably read.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.960
 Probably read. What are you reading these days?

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:31.760
 Oh, I'm thinking my next newsletter is something to do with energy and serotonin.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.960
 Oh, you're always working at it, aren't you, Doc?

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:35.360
 Yeah.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.120
 Yeah. Well, good for you. Tell folks about your newsletter before we go. It's

 Yeah, for emailing information on how to subscribe. It's $28 for two years every other month.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.840
 That's great. $28 for two years. You can't even...

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.640
 That's my email.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:13.200
 That's right. Ray Peate's newsletter at gmail.com. Okay, we'll put that into the show page.

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.400
 Okay, thanks.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.360
 We so much enjoy you taking the time to join us here. You've got a lot of fans out there around

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.800
 the world. So I really appreciate you coming on from time to time.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.160
 Okay, thank you.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.920
 All right, sir. Take care of yourself.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.320
 Okay.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:26.480
 Bye.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:26.720
 Bye.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:34.080
 Wow, what a nice man. Well, I'll tell you what, he seems to be on it with a lot of stuff.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.640
 Man, he just... I don't know how he remembers all these things. But he does.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:45.120
 Well, that's really fun about the carbonated water and the hydrogen.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.160
 I will say, though, there's probably a lot more research on it than Dr. Peate is familiar with.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.800
 And why would he be if he's not researching it? But George says there's just, I don't know,

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:03.600
 lots and lots of peer-reviewed stuff on it that you can get if you email George.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.440
 And I'm going to give you... People are asking me for George's email because they have a question.

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:13.920
 So I'm going to put that George's email on his show page too.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.920
 Okay, so we will see you tomorrow. I have a lot of fun things to talk about.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:22.800
 I've seen some real insights into how I created a situation where a bug could

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:30.320
 set up a home in my tummy. And we're going to talk about that. So you're going to learn some

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.400
 things tomorrow that I've learned. And I'm going to share them with you just because I love you.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.680
 And I do. And I'll see you tomorrow. This is Patrick Timpone. May the blessings be.
