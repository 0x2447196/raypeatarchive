00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray and for this

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.660
 month Sarah won't be with us but she will be back in December. For those of you who

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.360
 perhaps have never listened to the shows that run every third Friday of the month from 7

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.680
 till 8pm, we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.520
 with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.880
 patients about a wide range of conditions, recommend herbs, supplements and nutritional

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.600
 counselling. So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.480
 from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.960
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject of vitamin D. The number here if you

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 live in the area 923 3911 or if you live outside the area the toll free number is 1800 566

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 837 23. That's 1800 KMUD RAD. And we can be reached toll free on 1 888 WBM HERB for

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:14.760
 consultations or further information Monday through Friday 9 to 5. Well first things first

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.920
 we're very close towards the end of the players drive. There's lots of people here doing all

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.640
 the support that it takes to run a show like this and a radio station that can't emphasize

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 enough is pretty unique in the States in terms of free speech radio. I know in England free

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.220
 speech radio was kind of maligned and pretty much kept in a very fringe area in broadcasting

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.840
 but not given any support other than local support and that's what keeps this show alive.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.120
 So thanks so much to all the people that are pledging money making donations supporting

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.560
 the radio show keeping it on the air to make this kind of program and all the other excellent

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.420
 programs that KMED brings that are just filled with alternatives. So this is an alternative

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 medicine show and the other alternatives are also valuable outside sources of information

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 that you're not going to get from the mainstream. I think in this last political campaign without

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 being politically sided I would say that more so than ever we have seen the mainstream or

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.840
 lame stream media completely eradicated, disingenuous and completely false. So it's excellent to

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:55.520
 see alternative radios, news sites and websites coming with the internet and the age of free

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.520
 information. I thought it's a very small piece I just wanted to say about the internet and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.520
 it's the ICNN handover. It was under American governance for a long time but the present

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:15.280
 administration decided to pass that off but I'm not too sure whether this incoming administration

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.200
 will be able to do anything about that before censorship carries on like it is in China

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.200
 for sure. Okay so this month's talk is on vitamin D. Most people will have recognized

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:35.240
 vitamin D probably from rickets in the early 1900s I know in England and in many countries

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.200
 that are north of 37 degrees there is really very insufficient sunlight especially in the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.360
 winter months to generate vitamin D and so rickets was a fairly common presenting condition

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.680
 and still is in some parts of the world. So we're once again very pleased to have Dr.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.560
 Raymond Peat with us who's a wealth of information and never seems to be any end to the things

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.540
 that he knows, the things that he's found and his insights are as always outside the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.240
 box so thanks so much for joining us Dr. Peat. I guess first things first would you just

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.480
 outline your professional and academic background for those people who perhaps have never listened

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.160
 to the show and then I can get into the questioning and I'd like to run along the lines of the

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.160
 vitamin D subject. Basically a PhD in biology including reproductive physiology and biochemistry

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:39.960
 at the University of Oregon. I know you've got plenty more in terms of research background

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:49.600
 and I know it's led you in very many different directions. Steroids and their production

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.600
 and their uses etc. I know you're very interested in the anti-aging for one of the reasons of

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:08.680
 pregnenolone and/or progesterone and its anti-inflammatory and anti-aging effects. Now vitamin D is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 actually a pro-hormone, it's not strictly speaking in the sense of a vitamin is it?

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 So in terms of the discovery of vitamin D and its association with rickets, do you think

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:33.200
 there's adequate vitamin D in the general populations? For preventing rickets, pretty

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:45.480
 much all around the world there is very little rickets left but since the early 1900s, there

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.160
 was a period when people started thinking about nutritionally and eating a lot of food

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.520
 was established. That really cut off thinking and research about what vitamin D really is

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:09.040
 and what it's doing. In the 1950s, there was a period when people started thinking about

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:21.920
 nutrition for themselves like Adele Davis' books came out and the medical establishment

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:29.920
 reacted to discourage the public from using their own therapy. For example, vitamin A,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:40.880
 there were stories about how horribly toxic it was, it would destroy your brain and make

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.880
 your skin fall off and very little evidence backing it up. You can poison rats and mice

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.880
 giving them a million or so units of vitamin A. The same, there were some animal experiments

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.880
 with gigantic doses of vitamin D and supposedly there was a case of a baby whose mother gave

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:13.080
 it a million or so units of vitamin D or took it while she was pregnant and that supposedly

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.360
 caused the bones to thicken so much that there was no room for the brain to develop. So the

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:29.360
 newspaper stories in the 1950s were saying that vitamin D causes brain damage. I had

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:38.320
 been reading Adele Davis in the 1950s but despite that, I was sort of directed away

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.840
 from vitamin D because there was such a taboo about anything more than 200 or 300 units

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.280
 per day.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.280
 Okay, it's interesting, you've said that Ricketts is relatively unknown in the world. I know

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:05.840
 in England, since I've lived here for 15 years now, but I know I kind of keep in touch with

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.440
 some of the news that comes from time to time that's worth looking at. I know in England,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.720
 especially in Northern England, they were saying that Ricketts was starting to appear

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:22.720
 again. It's kind of a little bit off tonight's subject really. But the advent of fear mongering

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:31.000
 from cases of skin cancer, melanoma, the use of sunscreens, the inherent phobia about being

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:38.320
 in the sun, all of this was actually implicated in the British Medical Journal as being causative

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:45.280
 for the rise in Ricketts. It was being seen again by doctors and some people had never

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:52.280
 seen it before. It was kind of the first times for 30 and 40 year old doctors. So there is

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:59.400
 definitely an amount of Ricketts that seems to be in the populations at Northern latitudes

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.400
. But in terms of the vitamin D levels measured on blood tests, I know I've seen

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:19.920
 people with very low vitamin D and I know just like TSH as a measure of the call, the

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:29.920
 body's call for thyroid hormone has been down revised by the Endocrinological Association

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:37.040
 of the USA. They brought it down from 4.5 to 3.5, highlighting the fact that there are

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.040
 more and more people with hypothyroid type tendencies. And so this figure has been down

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:50.040
 regulated. I know the levels with vitamin D, the beneficial levels have been raised

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:59.120
 so that the lower limit I think was 20 nanograms per mil. Now they've raised that to 30 and

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:06.600
 a lot of people and places are advocating levels of 50 to 70 nanograms. In fact, for

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.840
 athletes, I think they've even come out with studies that show there's positive associations

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:17.840
 for 100 nanograms per mil blood levels of vitamin D. What do you think about that even

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.280
 in the absence of rickets that there is a tendency in the population to have low? Yeah,

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.280
 several of the conditions that are well associated with vitamin D deficiency, some of them have

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:37.920
 doubled and tripled in the last 20, 30 years. And it looks like it's because of that fear

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:47.800
 of the sunlight, sunscreen and such. I've talked to a few people who have had vitamin

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:55.800
 D deficiency and they've had a lot of people who had 10 or below nanograms per milliliter

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 or 15 or 20 and their condition really corresponded to how low they were. Like one woman in her

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:14.800
 60s said she was so weak she could hardly walk. Her muscles were simply very, very weak

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.800
 at 7 or 8 ng per ml. Within a week of taking just a moderate, I think it was 5,000 units

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:33.480
 a day, she could walk around. When you look at the symptoms of people with 15 ng per ml,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:45.080
 20, 25 and so on, you can see gradations of that weakness, depression, shrinkage, and

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:53.080
 shrinking muscles, insensitivity to insulin, tendency to have high blood sugar, all of

00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:05.400
 the most common diseases of stress. Blood pressure is also associated positively, isn't

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:11.520
 it, with a lower level of vitamin D? Yeah, everything related to aging and degenerative

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:18.520
 stress. Atrial fibrillation, enlargement of the ventricle, calcification of the valves,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:28.520
 degeneration of the valves in several different ways, hardening of the arteries, calcification

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:35.760
 of the coronary arteries, even calcification to the extent of what they call a heart stone,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:47.400
 a huge mass of calcium. Okay, we'll get into plenty of the different conditions for which

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:54.640
 there's been lots of peer-reviewed papers written on processes that I actually wasn't

00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:01.640
 that aware of. I think probably like most people have just associated vitamin D with

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:08.680
 calcium and phosphorus metabolism, weak bones, osteomalacia, and degenerative stress. So

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:15.520
 degenerative skeletal type situations. But there's a very clear and positive link to

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.360
 energy production and inflammation. And I know the last few shows that we've done with

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:26.360
 you, you've been looking a lot at inflammation and the processes producing inflammation and

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:33.560
 the sequelae of inflammation and how inflammatory processes in general are extremely destructive

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:42.600
 and counterproductive to energy production. When you look at the mechanism of just the

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:50.680
 outline that calcium helps to balance, or vitamin D helps to balance the relation between

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:59.480
 calcium and phosphate to prevent the over-accumulation of phosphate and to keep up the right level

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:10.440
 of calcium. When you look at the relation of that balance to inflammation, it turns

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:19.360
 out that it's really a serious problem in the population, the amount of phosphate relative

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:25.480
 to calcium. And that's because people aren't eating enough

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:30.720
 dairy? Or green leaves. Green leaves and cheese and

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.720
 milk are really the major good sources of calcium. And meat, nuts, grains, beans, all

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:48.000
 of those have terrifically high phosphate content. The excess phosphate and the reaction

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:58.240
 of the parathyroid hormone to that high phosphate intake, it's exactly the same as a deficiency

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:07.240
 of vitamin D. So too much phosphate, too little vitamin D, and you get what amounts to an

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:17.440
 early stage of chronic kidney degeneration. Parathyroid hormone and phosphate are called

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:26.760
 uremic toxins, late stage kidney disease. But people are starting that process very

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.800
 early and they don't eat enough calcium and vitamin D.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.800
 Okay, well I want to talk a little bit about the natural conversion in the skin, the process

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:47.400
 by which sunlight activates the cholesterol precursor, and then how those metabolites

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.320
 are changed in the liver first and then in the kidney and how they become active and

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:58.360
 how this could play out in people with liver disease as well as kidney disease and how

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.760
 this could negatively impact them because they've automatically weakened the process

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.640
 by which this pro-hormone is converted into the active form. So you're listening to Ask

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:16.640
 Your Ob-Doctor on KMED 91.1 FM from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock. You're invited

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.160
 to call in with any questions. Dr. Ray Peat is joining us once again. We're discussing

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:27.440
 the widespread use of vitamin D and how important it is and I think the lack of sunlight and

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.840
 the phobia surrounding sun and cancer, how this is all playing into decreasing our levels

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.160
 and how there aren't that many foods that really produce or have enough vitamin D in

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.200
 them to actually keep levels of vitamin D at good levels and how those levels have actually

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.680
 been raised in terms of the reference range for blood tests showing a positive association

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:52.680
 with increasing levels of vitamin D and decreasing disease. So number here if you're in the area

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:59.680
 it's 923 3911. If you live outside the area there's a 800 number which is 1-800-568-3723

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:08.440
 or 1-800-KMUT-RAD. So lines will be open from 7.30 on. Dr. Peat, talking about the conversion

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:16.200
 in the skin and again I wanted to also bring up the fact that I had heard and read that

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:22.320
 washing directly after sunbathing was actually counterproductive because you can wash the

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.320
 precursor metabolite off of the skin. I don't know how you view that as true or that's just

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:35.960
 some bad science and then the conversion of the cholesterol type molecule in the skin

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:42.800
 into the 25-hydroxy form and how that is then further hydroxylated downstream by the kidneys

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.200
 to the active form. What do you think first about washing if you're sunbathing and I think

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:54.480
 I read only 20 minutes was necessary to produce peak amounts of the pro-hormone so that the

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.720
 body actually stopped producing more after about 20 minutes so it wasn't necessary to

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:06.720
 lie out in the sun all day to get adequate vitamin D from sun exposure from UVB mainly.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:13.720
 I think that's only when you're in the middle of the day at a moderate latitude. The UVB

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:24.280
 is so low most of the year in the high latitudes that it takes a long time to get enough but

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:33.280
 in like from 11, 10 to 2 in the summer in high latitudes it only takes 15 or 20 minutes

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:41.800
 to get enough. Okay because there's a definite decrease in UVB exposure with angle of the

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:49.480
 sun I mean yeah so okay given that you're perhaps I don't know down in San Francisco

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:56.680
 or that kind of latitude then from I know probably September through to April, May you're

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.440
 probably not again getting exposed to enough sunlight and if you are you probably need

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.680
 to be out in the sun probably for an hour or two then rather than 20 minutes. Yeah and

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:12.920
 the color of your skin, the natural color makes a tremendous difference and age makes

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.920
 a difference. There is apparently less cholesterol metabolism and such in an old person and just

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:29.640
 the degree of pigmentation influences the amount of reaction you have to the ultraviolet.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:41.320
 In Mexico for example even the women who are outside all day if they have dark skin and

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:48.320
 are only exposing their face and hands they tend to be deficient in vitamin D even at

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:57.600
 high altitudes and brilliant sunlight. Because I read the association between previous kind

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:07.640
 of agrarian lifestyle or at least labor based lifestyle where most people worked for a living

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.600
 with manual labor. I don't mean people don't work at computers or whatever these days but

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:20.600
 a manual labor they're outdoors and more associated with agrarian lifestyles, farming and just

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:26.480
 being outdoors whether it's cutting wood or you know any other outdoor activity. Those

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.960
 people obviously then were getting exposed to sun but obviously with our modern lifestyles

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:38.480
 you know most people are kind of indoors and sedentary which brings its own other negative

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:45.480
 components to health. But in terms of the amount of sun that people get and using supplementation

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:51.200
 I think probably supplementation is one of the easiest way to go about getting adequate

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.120
 levels of vitamin D because I don't think, do you think people get enough vitamin D from

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:03.120
 the food that they eat? No, that's almost impossible. If you drink say 2 to 4 quarts

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:13.080
 of vitamin D supplemented milk if it isn't whole legally it has to be supplemented with

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:20.440
 vitamin D but that's only, I forget, I don't know what the current amount is but I think

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:30.080
 has been around 300 units per quart, something like that. Okay, per quart. Wow. And I think

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:38.800
 the modern levels that are advocated now up to 2,000, I know 2 to 4,000 IU per day so

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.760
 if you're getting 300 IU from a quart of vitamin D 4 to 5 milk it's going to take a lot of

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.360
 milk to reach that. And it is in a few other foods, things like oily fish but again I know

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:58.360
 you're not an advocate of oily fish from a PUFA perspective. Egg yolks as well I think

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.880
 20 IU per egg yolk so you're not going to get a lot of vitamin D from eggs either. Is

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:10.440
 there any other forms of vitamin D rich foods? Oh well mushrooms, mushrooms. They've been

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:17.440
 exposed to light, have a lot but interesting. During the 40s and 50s the main form of supplemental

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:28.040
 vitamin D was synthetic by ultraviolet radiation of fungus and the research that changed the

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:42.920
 popularity of that claimed that it was responsible for the hardening of the arteries of young

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:50.360
 people starting in the 40s and 50s. And this hardening was because of calcium deposition,

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:57.560
 aberrant calcium? Yeah which normally happens in a vitamin D deficiency but there were publications

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:05.880
 arguing that the use of the synthetic vitamin D might have been contributing to abnormal

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:13.720
 calcium metabolism. I don't know if that's true but that came out around 1970 and milk

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:23.200
 added, it was switched over to vitamin D3 right after those articles came out so I think

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:30.640
 they were just being cautious. So you said earlier that mushrooms exposed to light are

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.240
 a significant source of vitamin D. Did you know, have you any figures in terms of per

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:43.240
 ounce of mushrooms consumed what you'd get? No I don't know. It depends on the type of

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.720
 mushroom and the intensity of the ultraviolet. Interesting because we always think about

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.720
 mushrooms growing in the dark or in the woods or something so they would irradiate with

00:23:53.720 --> 00:24:00.720
 UVB then mushrooms at some point in our history. Yeah and if they gather them outside just

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:10.480
 being exposed to daylight for a few hours is enough. There have been studies using mushroom

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:19.200
 powder as a vitamin D supplement. It only took I think it was less than an ounce of

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:30.320
 powdered mushroom to make a distinct rise. It actually depressed the vitamin D3 and increased

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:39.760
 the vitamin D2. Wow that's interesting I've never heard of that. So this would be things

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:46.760
 like the common field mushroom, the white kind of the white agaric mushroom that's kind

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:53.200
 of common culinary mushroom that would be growing in the fields, button mushrooms. These

00:24:53.200 --> 00:25:00.200
 would be sources? Yeah if they've been exposed at all to sunlight they probably account for

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:09.040
 quite many people have a measurable amount of D2 in their serum. Interesting. Now the

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:15.760
 other thing I just want to go back a little bit. You've been an advocate of mushrooms

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.440
 specifically for something else, certainly for producing a soup of mushrooms and having

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:28.440
 this as a dietary supplement. Yeah for the anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer functions.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:37.760
 Interesting. Okay so I guess getting on to specific diseases that have been characterized

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:44.760
 with low vitamin D and how the studies have shown in cohorts of people that they've tested,

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:52.280
 those with higher initial levels of vitamin D did better in the outcomes than those with

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.960
 low. I know I've always associated vitamin D with bones because of rickets I think most

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.480
 people have. I don't know how many people are actually aware of the cancer association

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:10.480
 with vitamin D, how many people associate TB and multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:17.760
 with vitamin D. But I'd like to bring out some of these things and get your perspective

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.200
 on the inflammation that's happening and how you tie in the inflammatory process through

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.880
 parathyroid hormone which I know you've always said is inflammatory and how through using

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:35.880
 thyroid hormone and pregnenolone being two anti-inflammatories which quell that inflammatory

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:42.400
 cascade how they tie into how you see these inflammatory disorders that I've mentioned

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:49.400
 rheumatoid, MS, etc., cancers. So looking at something that I haven't mentioned which

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:56.600
 is fibromyalgia, I saw that there was a definite, well it was a theoretical mechanism because

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:03.400
 they haven't tested it any further but I know the fibromyalgia syndrome where people have

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:09.760
 very tired, aching muscles and they feel muscle bound and they just can't move because their

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.880
 muscles are functioning. I know you'd probably associate that more with hypothyroidism and

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.880
 low thyroid state because you've clearly spoken many times about the patella or the Achilles

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.120
 tendon reflex and that's a direct response of the muscle not being able to repolarize

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:35.120
 quick enough and this lag phase that happens with the twitch. How do you see fibromyalgia

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:42.960
 in terms of vitamin D deficiency being relative to energy production and repolarization?

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:51.160
 I think it's parallel, almost identical to the hypothyroid condition. All of the energy

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.800
 -- all of the inflammations that you get with low thyroid function are structurally and

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:05.800
 functionally similar to those you get from a vitamin D deficiency. The thyroid stimulating

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:14.560
 hormone is an agent of those inflammatory processes. Actually more than the direct effect of thyroxin

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:27.040
 which lowers TSH, the TSH itself directly activates and causes tissue to release the

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:35.840
 inflammatory cytokines, interleukins and so on and parathyroid hormone does that. Just

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:45.080
 by taking vitamin D or increasing your calcium intake or decreasing your phosphate relative

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:53.480
 to the calcium, all of these changes in your diet will lower both TSH and parathyroid hormone

00:28:53.480 --> 00:29:04.560
 and both of these hormones are directly involved in things such as mast cell activation, releasing

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:15.240
 histamine and serotonin, increasing all of the cytokines, tumor necrosis factor, nitric

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:23.080
 oxide, all of the things that promote degenerative inflammatory processes. So functionally vitamin

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:34.400
 D and thyroid are really parallel. You can't quite separate them.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:44.640
 And then looking at the response to the immune system amounts to infection or other symptoms

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:51.960
 like infection or cancer or inflammatory responses. There are lots of papers published for, and

00:29:51.960 --> 00:30:01.240
 again this is a little bit of a divergence, I know tuberculosis as a lung disease. There

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:09.440
 were other lung type pathologies which were definitely seemed to improve and had lower

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:19.640
 morbidity associated with it with people that had higher vitamin D levels.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:26.440
 There are vitamin D levels when they are brought into hospital. The higher the vitamin D when

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:33.440
 they come in, the more likely they are to go out alive.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:41.000
 I think it's probably a no brainer if somebody is in, for many different, I mean how many

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.240
 different illnesses are there that you can say don't have an inflammatory portion to

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:50.720
 them? Not too many, right? I think inflammation is one of those widespread systemic processes

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.720
 that happens in many pathologies. And so I think just recognizing that vitamin D is implied

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:04.440
 in inflammation, suppressing inflammation would make anybody want to supplement with

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.280
 vitamin D, wouldn't it?

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:13.280
 Yeah, and HIV, AIDS, malaria as well as tuberculosis are very widespread conditions that are known

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:24.520
 to increase their morbidity and mortality in proportion to how low the vitamin D is.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:34.040
 I read an article about a compound called catholicidin and this was an antiviral defense

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:41.440
 that again was heightened by vitamin D in the body and that lower levels produced lower

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:49.520
 levels of this compound and also decreased natural interferon production. So these would

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:57.800
 tend to implicate viral conditions to be positively associated or the outcomes of viral conditions

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.920
 to be positively associated with increased vitamin D.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:07.920
 Yeah, and I think the viral process is basically an energy process. When the cells are well

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:18.200
 energized they're resistant to infection and replication of viruses.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:22.760
 And again, you're just saying that's from an energetic point of view to be able to withstand

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:28.560
 the processes that cost energy to drive a system more positively than being overwhelmed

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.640
 as it were.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:36.640
 Yeah, and I think you can see the energy process in the brain conditions that are associated

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:44.880
 with vitamin D deficiency. Brain injured patients have very low vitamin D and probably the injury

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:54.760
 itself is causing it to be lost in some way.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:00.600
 I read that Parkinson's was also implicated in low levels of vitamin D in some Parkinson's

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:06.720
 patients showing that that was a kind of interference either with dopaminergic type interference

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:13.720
 or another neural signaling interference that vitamin D positively influences.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:21.160
 And the prion diseases are probably influenced because vitamin D prevents the polymerization

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:29.800
 of the prion protein which is involved in scrapie, mad cow disease, Alzheimer's disease

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:37.480
 and probably several other of the degenerative brain diseases. Anxiety and depression are

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:43.760
 associated with very low vitamin D.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:50.600
 Yeah, interesting. Again, that's an interesting thinking about things like from a perspective,

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.720
 things like hypericin from St. John's Wort being a classic treatment for depression and

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:03.720
 how the alchemists classified St. John's Wort way back before there was any "science" although

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:11.640
 they were very methodical and very scientific in their own right. They classified it as

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:17.600
 heating and drying in the third degree saying that it was a solar rule by the sun. And so

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.840
 that again, anxiety and depression with St. John's Wort use is kind of hand in hand with

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:29.440
 the sun and its energizing effects if we want to get kind of holistic about the mechanism

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440
 by which that works.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:35.440
 Okay, we are listening to Ask Your Rev. Dr. K. Medhi Galvan, 91.1 FM. From now until the

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.400
 end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.240
 to this month's subject of vitamin D, its metabolism and the effects that it has on

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:49.440
 the body. It sounds like someone's coming into the show to do some plug-in for the pledge

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:56.440
 line so let's bring him in now.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:02.280
 So we're stealing the airwaves.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.440
 Go ahead. The reason we're here is because people contribute and they pay for it and

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.320
 they support it and it wouldn't happen otherwise.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.160
 Right, and we need the community support and there's a reason we have, you know, why you're

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:19.840
 on the air and why we have these talk shows is for the community to communicate with each

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.560
 other and it's a really important aspect of KMUD and thank you so much.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.880
 Oh, you're welcome.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.760
 For being here. My name's Ruby, voice in ether by the way.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:34.360
 And I'm Rob and when I, especially when I started listening to this station when I moved

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:38.060
 out here, I always thought of the talk shows as sort of the community sitting around the

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:44.560
 campfire, you know, exchanging stories and ideas and I don't think that's too far off

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.840
 from what actually happens.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.280
 So how far are we from reaching the...

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.680
 Oh, we're close.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.280
 Yeah, I saw that.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.880
 We're at $91,146.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.880
 So thank you so much callers for calling in to 923-3911.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:04.880
 And we only need another 3,500. No, yeah, 91, if you said 91 something, this says 90,800.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.080
 We're so close.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:15.080
 So please call in and pledge and donate and give. We're not far away. So it's very important

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.240
 that we keep this station fully funded. I mean, over and above the 90,000, 95 is the

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.560
 goal, but obviously any more over and above that is totally works towards supporting the

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.560
 show.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.600
 We always appreciate the extra funds.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:35.480
 It always disappears at least as fast as it comes in. That's one of the sad realities.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.200
 Where are we at with that thousand dollar?

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.680
 We're really close. We made about a third of it, but we still need a little bit more

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:49.680
 and we're trying to reach that before eight. And so let's call in 923-3911. And yeah, so

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:55.080
 the way a challenge works is somebody ante's up a thousand dollars, but we don't get that

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.080
 money until other people match that challenge.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:05.080
 So like I said, we have a little over $600 to go until we meet the challenge. So 923-3911.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.440
 1-800-K-MUD-RAD.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.080
 We've got a whole half hour to do it, but don't waste time folks.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.640
 923-3911. We'll let you get back to it.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:22.640
 Thank you. No problem. Yeah, you're welcome.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:29.640
 All right. Okay. Now I will get right back to the topic of vitamin D and its association

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.680
 with various pathologies here that I think some of which I hadn't realized until I started

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.000
 looking at this information earlier on today.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Okay. So if you're in the area and or on the internet and you have any questions again,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.040
 923-3911, I know people are going to call in and pledge. That's what we want. So let's

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:57.240
 see the lights lighten up and see who's calling. There is a 800 number, which is 1-800-K-MUD-RAD

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.360
 for those people either listening to the internet or in a different state. We often have people

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.480
 from the middle of the country and the East Coast calling.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:13.480
 So Dr. Peat, I said at the beginning when I started introducing this subject for this evening

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:19.920
 that I found a very interesting parallel. But again, I'm always very cautious how far

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:26.440
 down the rabbit hole to go knowing that there's such a lot of misinformation, especially in

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:33.440
 science. I mean, talk about a revelatory electoral cycle, what we've seen from the mainstream

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:43.160
 media, what we've seen, all the stunts they've pulled, all the lies, all the cover-ups, all

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:49.240
 the conspiracy. It's everywhere. And I don't believe that it's not in medical journals

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.880
 or in especially in pharmaceutical press releases.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:01.880
 So getting to the subject of the conversion of vitamin D, first in the liver and then

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:10.720
 in the kidneys before it becomes active, are you aware of anything that would bypass the

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:17.920
 necessity for healthy livers and healthy kidneys in order to have adequate vitamin D? If not,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.960
 that I think is a main stumbling block that people need to know about and hear about.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:29.960
 I think the low level of vitamin D and calcium is probably the cause of the sick liver and

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.680
 kidneys.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.400
 Interesting. Go on.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:43.400
 Rather than being a product, and so supplementing just with calcium and vitamin D, I think in

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:53.880
 many cases will correct whatever the liver and kidney problem is. It isn't a matter of

00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:05.280
 curing the disease so that they can make or activate vitamin D. It's a matter of getting

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:14.840
 the vitamin D and calcium into the system. And maybe you don't need to think about the

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:22.160
 disease of the kidney and liver as having some other mysterious cause such as a virus.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:30.280
 Okay. Because I read one particular abstract that seemed to show that the... Okay. This

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:39.400
 was the other subject, vitamin D receptors. Now given that, I think you have said that

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.360
 there are many different places where the tissues in many different organs and other

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:51.360
 tissues including nerve presumably, where vitamin D receptors are located. So they are

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:58.480
 ubiquitous a little bit like the sites that are binding sites for various different molecules

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:06.520
 or hormones or drugs or other things that the body produces.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:13.520
 But in terms of what they call the vitamin D receptor and its ubiquity in the body, it's

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:21.520
 reasonable if you know, but is it reasonable to increase the amount of vitamin D receptors

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:30.120
 that your genotype would express in order to overcome any shortfall in the absorption

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:38.360
 of vitamin D or the pickup of vitamin D?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:45.360
 The receptor is the problem of some of the stress conditions make the receptor disappear.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:51.120
 Make them disappear?

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:58.120
 Yes. So that I think getting enough calcium and vitamin D and good nutrition generally

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:08.160
 is necessary to make sure that you aren't suppressing the receptors.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:16.160
 Some of the receptor repression is done by over-methylation and that can be something

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:25.440
 that your mother, for example, was deficient in vitamin D or calcium. That sets up a methylation

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:36.520
 pattern in subsequent offspring that can affect their sensitivity to vitamin D.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:44.520
 By methylating the receptor or other interacting.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:53.680
 Do you know how long lived these receptors are then? If you talk about a kind of transcriptional

00:42:53.680 --> 00:43:00.480
 event that occurs in DNA to produce all these different things, one of which is the vitamin

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.880
 D receptor, which is so important because it has such an implication in so many different

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:11.880
 inflammatory processes, not just degenerative bone disease but down to cancers. How long

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:18.560
 these vitamin D receptors last once they've been produced and therefore if you're talking

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:24.560
 about the over-methylation being negatively associated with these vitamin D receptors

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.200
 disappearing or not being produced.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:32.440
 That would be the rate at which they're replaced and I don't know specifically how long they

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:39.440
 last but other receptors are typically turning over very fast so the cells can remain adaptable

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:51.000
 usually just two or three days and much of the receptor has been recycled.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.080
 Okay, we do have a caller on the air so let's take this first caller. Caller, you're on

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.440
 the air, where are you from?

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:56.680
 Hello?

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.440
 Hi, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:58.840
 Philipsville.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.440
 Oh, Philipsville, hi. What's your question?

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:08.440
 A while back I had a vitamin D test and I was kind of low and they said to take more

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:18.080
 and then I think I was checked a while later and they said I was on the low end of normal

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:25.080
 but I still needed to up it and they suggested I take 5,000 units a day so I was taking 5,000

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:30.720
 units a day but I also take a multivitamin, kind of a strong multivitamin mineral. I'm

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.720
 a little older so I want to make sure I get everything I need and I noticed that the multivitamin

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:44.920
 had 3,000 units in it so that meant if I was taking both every day I'd be getting 8,000

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.040
 a day. Is that too much?

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:54.040
 Well, I would wonder first how quantitative the amount was actually in the tablet if it

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.640
 said 3,000, how bioavailable it was over a liquid form if that was...

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.360
 It was a liquid capsule, the 5,000.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.160
 Yeah, the liquid capsule was a 5,000 but what was the 3,000 one that was in the multivitamin

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:06.640
 and that was in the tablet?

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.640
 Yeah, that was in a big pill.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.240
 Yeah, so Dr. Peat, 8,000, if she got 8,000?

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:19.240
 Yeah, if you figure that being in a bathing suit in the sun for 20 or 30 minutes enough

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.440
 to just start turning pink, that can make 10 or 15,000 units.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.320
 Oh, okay.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.080
 So 5 or 10,000 units is never going to be harmful.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.760
 So that's not going to be harmful. So if I take... Because I was starting to take the

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.280
 5,000 one every other day because I take the other one every day. But you think I should

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.640
 go back to taking the 5,000 every day with the multi?

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.720
 Yeah, I've never heard of 10,000 a day being harmful.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:50.640
 All right, and this is only 8. Did you say that you need added calcium for the vitamin

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.800
 D to work better?

00:45:52.800 --> 00:46:01.040
 You need a good ratio of calcium to phosphate. I think it's really protective to take in

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:08.080
 well over 1,000. I try to get about 2,500 milligrams of calcium per day.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.520
 I see. And what are the foods that are good for that?

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:17.440
 Milk, cheese, and leafy greens that are well cooked and the water they cook in.

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.840
 They have to be cooked because I eat a lot of salad, but those aren't cooked.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:30.760
 We can't digest raw leaves, so most of the calcium is not being assimilated from salad

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760
 greens.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.280
 So I should eat like cooked broccoli or something like that?

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:46.200
 Okay, how much? Anything green, like green beans, anything that's green has the calcium?

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:58.760
 One or two big servings of kale or chard would give you a good part of your day's requirement,

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:05.480
 but I think the best way is to have more than a quarter day of low-fat milk.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:11.760
 Well, I can't possibly drink a quarter day of milk. I eat a little cheese, you know,

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.040
 and sometimes a little sour cream.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.320
 Just for example, can I just ask you this? How much do you weigh?

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.360
 I'm not going to tell you that.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.360
 No, you should. Come on.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.200
 You don't ask a lady her age and her weight.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.440
 No, no, it's important. I need to ask you. You need to tell me.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.120
 I ain't going to tell you.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.440
 Okay, well, Dr. Peat, thanks for your call. I wanted to do a...

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:31.880
 What does it have to do with my weight?

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:34.480
 Oh, it has a huge amount. So if you like...

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.320
 I'm a bit on the heavy side, let's say that.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:41.080
 Yeah, well, there's been very, very, very positive associations with an inability to

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:47.200
 absorb vitamin D. And I'm not saying you're obese, but in obese people. So the body fat

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:54.480
 has a direct, yeah, a suppressing effect on vitamin D absorption. So Dr. Peat, how about

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.480
 that? You understand that.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:06.040
 Well, vitamin D and calcium both have a direct suppressive effect on fat formation. The fatty

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:14.280
 liver, for example, is in animal studies, it's corrected by both vitamin D and calcium.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.280
 So that suppresses fat. That will help you not get so fat if you eat vitamin D and calcium.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:25.040
 And the high calcium intake by itself, just with a normal amount of vitamin D, is very

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.960
 effective at preventing overweight.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:32.640
 Oh, that's good to know. And what did you say would happen to the kidneys? That was

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.240
 something bad would happen to the kidneys from not having enough calcium or not enough

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.560
 calcium and vitamin D?

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:50.200
 Not enough calcium and vitamin D or too much phosphate. The combination, any of those will

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:58.440
 cause your parathyroid hormone to increase. And elevated phosphate and elevated parathyroid

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.760
 hormone are very toxic to the kidneys.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:09.480
 Well, I actually had an overactive thyroid that I had developed a few years ago. I hadn't

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:17.680
 had it before. And that led to atrial fibrillation problems. And I had a radioactive iodine to

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:25.200
 shrink the thyroid. So now I take 88 micrograms a day of thyroid to keep it up to the normal

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.360
 level. So I assume I'm getting the normal level of thyroid that I need.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:40.120
 Yes, thyroid works in many ways similarly to vitamin D and regulates calcium and magnesium

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.120
 in particular.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:48.360
 Well, I'm taking both. So I guess that's a good thing. Okay. Well, thank you.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:52.480
 Thank you for your call. We do have another caller. So let's get this call. And the lights

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:57.000
 are flashing again. So let's take this call away from. What's your question?

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.400
 I am calling you from Finland in Scandinavia.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.240
 Thank you. Finland. Okay.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:12.160
 I was wondering if yourself or Dr. Peat could enlighten me about sediment in the urine.

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:20.320
 Is this a good thing? Is it normal? Any observation about sediment in the urine?

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:25.640
 Yeah. Okay. Well, first of all, do you know, is this sediment, is it a solid sediment?

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.680
 Or are you talking about an amorphous kind of sediment that's actually part of the fluid

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.680
 make up? I mean, is it crystalline?

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:42.640
 Yeah, like a dust, like cloudy. If you let it, let's say if you would urinate in a jar

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:50.480
 and let it sit, it would have, it will make a cloud kind of a.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:56.520
 Have you ever had any investigations for any kind of kidney stones or any type of calculi

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:03.640
 that you know of? I've never had an issue with that. I actually

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:12.120
 started investigating that when I heard claims from people eating mostly fruit that this

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:21.240
 might be a sign of good assimilation of or good function of the kidneys. But I'm not

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:28.960
 sure about the scientific claims. Okay. Dr. Peat, what do you think?

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:38.520
 If you have a fairly high protein intake and your urine is on the acid side, down around

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:46.960
 pH five, and you have a very high calcium intake, say from the equivalent of two liters

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:56.400
 of milk per day, you'll have a lot of calcium appearing in the urine. And if the urine is

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:05.400
 acidic, it isn't likely to form stones. But when it stands, the pH can rise. And as the

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:17.640
 carbon dioxide evaporates, and that can precipitate crystals. So other things being equal, it

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:23.200
 isn't necessarily harmful to have a precipitation in the urine.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:28.320
 Okay. Did you get that? Thank you very much.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:32.120
 Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you. Thank you for your call. Okay, just quickly switching

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:41.160
 to urine as a kind of urinalysis. And do you think that people that have clear urine are,

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.640
 for want of a better word, healthy compared to those people that have not cloudy through

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:54.360
 pigmentation, but you know, less than see-through, opaque type urines? Do you notice any association

00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.360
 with that? Because I'm sure people have wide ranging presentations from both color and

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:04.280
 opacity. I think the clarity is largely from the amount

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:12.440
 of fluid you're drinking. And if the urine is acidic, I don't think some cloudiness is

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:22.160
 going to hurt. But there can be bad causes of cloudiness, infection, for example. And

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:32.760
 I think the yellow color of urine is considered to indicate cell turnover. So sometimes the

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:40.960
 morning urine will be yellow and the afternoon urine clear. Because during the night, with

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:50.040
 the high stress hormones, a lot of cells are breaking down. And the fragments of the nucleic

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.320
 acids turning over, I think, can produce some of the yellow pigment.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:54:00.480
 Okay, well I'm afraid that is all we've got time for because we're coming up close to

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.200
 two minutes to eight. Thank you very much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.840
 I wanted to mention that the clotho protein that we talked about a few months ago, which

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:20.000
 is the anti-aging protein, it's very similar to vitamin D in some of its functions. Vitamin

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:28.280
 D deficiency produces the degenerative changes that a mutation or deficiency of the clotho

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.160
 protein can produce. Interesting. Well, I really wanted to talk

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:38.440
 more to you about the vitamin D receptor and how that could be enhanced. Because I think

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:44.280
 vitamin D is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the process of inflammation and all

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.000
 the diseases associated with it. So maybe next month we can pick up just the last part

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.840
 of what I wanted to look at with vitamin D and maybe bring the vitamin D receptor into

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:59.440
 more light and help people understand how important vitamin D is to get, especially

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.720
 now we're going into the darker times of the year. So thanks so much for your time, Dr.

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.200
 Peat. The calcium metabolism and sugar oxidation

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.120
 is another subject we talked about. Excellent. Good. I've got some notes here.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.160
 Thanks very much. Okay. Thank you.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:18.800
 Okay. So for those people that have listened to the show this evening, thanks for either

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:22.880
 calling in or listening. I can only hope that there's lots of people out there who listened

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:29.360
 and didn't call. But I would also stress the point that this is a funded radio station.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:34.560
 We do need your financial support. So hopefully the phone will ring off the hook once 8 o'clock

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.680
 comes around here and people will start pledging. For those of you who've listened to the show,

00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:44.040
 thanks so much. The truth is out there. There's lots of information on the internet. Don't

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.040
 believe the media. The media is dying. In fact, the media is virtually dead. I think

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:53.600
 it's got a 6% trust rating at this point in time. So thanks for listening and until December

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.240
 next month, good night.
