WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800
 You even said, I think, in one of your newsletters that the engineering sort of genetic dogma

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:15.580
 school of science even thought that memory was a function of brain cells dying like holes

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.920
 being punched in an IBM computer card and that's how you, they were postulating that

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.040
 that's how you remember things.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040
 Yeah.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.680
 If you look at the history of science from the wrong perspective it looks like a big

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.440
 comedy that's so farcical that it's hard to believe.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.840
 But these are top notch mainline people with these stupid theories.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.120
 Well, I suppose if they're coming from a certain point of view, they've all been educated in

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.200
 universities and they've all done probably very well there and so they're probably trying

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.640
 to work within those parameters and come up with something.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.520
 And I guess if you're looking at life from the perspective of as a machine that doesn't

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.760
 have any intelligence then I suppose an IBM punch card is a good model.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 Yeah.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.920
 It all comes down to the culture that teaches us, it's been going on for 800 years or something

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:21.720
 like that in philosophy, teaching us that matter is stupid and inanimate, has nothing

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.720
 to do with the guiding principle of spirit and life.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:39.120
 It's an invention that came out of a particular culture sometime after the Renaissance.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:51.080
 The doctrine of matter as some kind of a special devilish material that has nothing of the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.360
 life properties or the spirit properties.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.000
 It's just this mortal, essentially dead material.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.960
 So the gene doctrine came in on top of things like Descartes' doctrine of the mind running

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.520
 an inanimate machine.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:26.480
 And the whole idea that matter has its own tendencies and principles was submerged under

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:36.520
 a doctrine that matter is essentially stupid and can only follow randomness, mathematical

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.440
 randomness has to be invoked when matter is treated.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.080
 And so it applies to the idea of nuclear fission.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:56.200
 There's some kind of a mathematical oversight that governs the half-life of each type of

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.200
 substance.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:09.000
 And people who question that whole idea of matter have done some experiments showing

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 that even nuclear decay is context-sensitive.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:27.360
 For example, I think it was 1971 when an experimenter used radioactive carbon in an oil form and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:37.640
 found that the decay rate was non-random when it was made into a monolayer on a metal surface.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:47.960
 And that violated the whole doctrine of inert matter following some kind of mathematical

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960
 rules of randomness.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.560
 And so no one paid attention to it.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.400
 Lots of physical experiments violate the rules and so people ignore them.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:09.560
 By the way, the genetics people ignored regeneration research, cancer cures.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.000
 It was only the genetic engineers and the cloning researchers that finally opened up

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.480
 some space in the culture.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:31.080
 The genetic engineers didn't want it to happen but giving Barbara McClintock the recognition

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 and finally accepting that Dolly really had been cloned even though for 50 years they

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.720
 had been denying the possibility of cloning when people were doing it with frogs, it wasn't

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720
 acceptable.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:54.040
 And finally the culture is being opened up by their own wrong thinking that has led them

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:03.440
 into a corner where they are forced to recognize that something like a field sometimes is involved

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.040
 in biology.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.480
