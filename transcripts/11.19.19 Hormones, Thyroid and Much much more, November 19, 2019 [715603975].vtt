 Good morning, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 The telephone number is 888-663-6386

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Email patrick@oneradionetwork.com

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Know the source, oneradionetwork.com

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Well, welcome back, hour two of our little show

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and it is the third Tuesday of the month

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 and that brings us to Dr. Ray Peat

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 who's been at this nutrition healing game for a very, very long time

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Dr. Ray Peat, good morning

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Good morning

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 How are you, Doc?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 I'm very good

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 You're feeling, you're looking pretty good, we have a picture of you up there

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Sorry we couldn't get Dr. Peat on the video

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 because you're much of a, somewhat of a luddite

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 you don't have a microphone or camera or any of that stuff

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 I have a new Dell monitor but it doesn't have a camera

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Doesn't have a camera

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 or speakers or anything

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 How's your life these days?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 What have you been doing?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 What are you most passionate about?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 What have you been thinking about in your world of health and healing?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 I'm working on a newsletter on progesterone for this month

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 something I've been working on for 50 years

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 but always something new to think about

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Really? Now what could possibly be going on with progesterone

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 that would warrant that kind of attention in so long?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Talk about that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Partly that the industry is reverting to some of the old myths about it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 The estrogen industry, people discover the dangers of estrogen

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 and that moves interest towards progesterone use

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 and then the estrogen industry has to defend itself

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 because it's a multi-billion dollar a year industry

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 and so they subsidize studies to make people worry about the risks of progesterone

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 They're starting to say that anything that estrogen is known to cause for 100 years

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 they're starting to say, well, really progesterone is involved in it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 so it's distracting attention from the dangers of estrogen

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 and in the absence of any real information

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 they're just putting the thought out there that if estrogen does it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 maybe progesterone is really involved somehow

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 So when we talk about estrogen, are we speaking of the estrogenic foods?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Oh no, just the supplement

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Just the supplement, yeah

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 The industry got started when someone synthesized a very simple chemical

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 that triggered the whole fertility cycle in mice and rats

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 In the 30s, someone was thinking about the fact that chimney sweeps got cancer of the scrotum in the 18th century

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 from getting soot and not bathing

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 and that led to someone putting soot on rabbits and finding that it was very carcinogenic

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 but they noticed that besides causing skin cancer, it triggered estrus in the female rabbits

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 and so they did extracts of soot and found that there were hundreds of estrogenic substances in soot

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 In the soot, which came from the wood, I guess?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Yeah, you put a piece of cold metal or porcelain or something in the flame of a candle or a Bunsen burner or anything

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 and carbon spontaneously condenses at high temperature

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Methane is a single atom of carbon with hydrogen

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 and when it burns, like if you have a cloud of natural gas and it explodes

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 it creates a cloud of soot

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 which results when the single atom of carbon surrounded by hydrogen condenses spontaneously into very symmetrical six-membered rings

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 and then ten members on each ring being a hexagon of carbon atoms

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Some of the cyclic molecules are huge

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 and they being very large, heavy, stick to each other and form these gobs of black material

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Each molecule has this pattern of six-membered rings which happens to be analogous to the steroid molecule

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 The steroid molecule has three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 and when those don't have the proper oxygen atoms added in the right places

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 they act as estrogen, so you can get a million different estrogenic substances just from soot

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Wow, that's fascinating

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 So the estrogen industry realized that everyone could have a patented unique molecule and sell it as estrogen

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 which they called the female hormone

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 because it can be found in the ovary of a pregnant animal

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 so they advertised that they were selling the female hormone

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 which they said would make women more fertile

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 because if it's a female hormone, being fertile is what supposedly characterizes women

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 and so they convinced even Harvard doctors, two of them did studies giving this basically a soot derivative

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 diethylstilbestrol to pregnant women claiming that it prevented miscarriage

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 but the animal studies in the 1930s and early 40s had all demonstrated that every kind of estrogen creates miscarriage or stillbirth

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 my thesis advisor was one of the early researchers showing that as you increase the dose of estrogen

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 you can create an abortion or miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 a tiny dose will prevent implantation, a larger dose will cause miscarriage at the first week, a bigger dose at the second week and so on

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 so they knew that estrogen caused miscarriages but they were selling it to the public to prevent miscarriage

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Wow, just the opposite

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 simply because they could

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 Wow, so what's the takeaway, by the way Ray Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon specialization in physiology

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 and he's taught at the University of Oregon Urbana College, Montana State University

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 and been involved in natural medicine for a very long time

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 I guess could you go back to, I guess your early work was in the late 60s right, with hormones?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Yeah, and my dissertation advisor Arnold Soderwal was the person who did some of these early studies showing that estrogen is a miscarriage

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 So what's the biggest piece of misinformation to our lady, both ladies and gentlemen, listening around the world about estrogen and progesterone

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 What is out there that most people believe that you believe is untrue?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Well, lots of doctors still refer to progesterone as the pregnancy hormone

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Just a couple of weeks ago someone said her doctor said she had had her uterus removed so she didn't need progesterone because progesterone is only the pregnancy hormone

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 An absolutely ridiculous idea going back to the 1940s, doctors were taught that to sell estrogen

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 To get pregnant, to get pregnant

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Yeah, and they knew that estrogen causes cancer of the uterus, that was one of the early demonstrations of soot

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 That as estrogens of all sorts, the first most sensitive organ is the uterus, then the breast, then the brain, then the lungs, then every other tissue

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 But it's just a matter of sensitivity and the uterus is the most sensitive

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 And then someone discovered, actually about 1945 it was already discovered that progesterone prevented uterine cancer from estrogen

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 And so they said if you take estrogen and don't want uterine cancer then you should take progesterone with it

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 But then the profitable thing was to do a hysterectomy and so hysterectomies were being done

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Everyone by the age of 30 or 35 was being urged to have a hysterectomy

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 And without the uterus then they said there's no need for progesterone

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 So the woman would have her ovaries and uterus removed and they would refuse to give her progesterone

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Because supposedly the uterus was the only organ that needed progesterone being a pregnancy hormone

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 But in the 1930s the ovaries were found to produce hundreds of times more quantity of progesterone than estrogen

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 Estrogen is really a minor hormone from the ovary

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 In experimental surgery people have demonstrated that when they measured the amount of estrogen coming out of the ovary

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 As a control they measured the blood coming out of the monkey's arm

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 And found that the arm was producing as much estrogen as the ovary

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 So the idea of estrogen as an ovarian hormone is really out of context

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 When every tissue of the animal produces a large amount of estrogen when it's under stress

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 So laying it out as you have been you can see how there's so much confusion in the medical world and the natural world about these hormones

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 I thought a lot of that had been settled 30 or 40 years ago

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 But doctors are still being told if you don't have a uterus you don't need progesterone

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 When the brain is one of the biggest sources of progesterone

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 The placenta in pregnancy, the corpus luteum of the ovary

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 The brain contains 10 times the concentration of progesterone that the blood serum does

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And the skin is another major source of progesterone

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 But when you take out the ovaries you're putting an extra load on the brain and the skin to maintain the concentration of progesterone

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 So what's the best advice you can give to our ladies around the world right now regarding these two hormones

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Whether supplementation or just in general

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 I know you don't do medical advice to help them to understand what they should or should not be looking at or doing or not doing

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Well they're very likely to be told still 60, 70 years after it was proven false

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Told that estrogen is a lifelong female hormone

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 But old men rival women of the same age in the amount of estrogen being produced

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Because it's a stress hormone produced by tissue of any sort under stress

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 So question the claim that aging is evidence of a need for more estrogen

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Old tissue increasingly tends to make estrogen

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 But the opposite is true

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Progesterone failure is the primary thing that brings on menopause

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 The monthly surge of progesterone produces the monthly cycle

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 It's an outstanding feature of the monthly cycle

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 When that stops what is left is a surge of estrogen which is no longer balanced by progesterone

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 But that's the natural way it works for ladies though right?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 I mean that's the way it's been set up to do a god thing kind of

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 When the monthly cycle ends like menopause

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Well the stress symptoms increase as menopause approaches

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 And the healthier the woman is the longer she's able to maintain these monthly surges of progesterone

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 And with supplementation it's possible to keep menstruating to a much older age

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Is that a sign of health in general? The longer a lady menstruates?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 I think so

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Interesting

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 And then the hot flashes and all that people have said that that's due to possible toxicity in the ladies body

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Can you relate to that?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Stress even in the 20's or younger

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 I've known women having hot flashes that were resolved when they took thyroid or progesterone

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 To normalize and prevent the stress

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Oh with the thyroid functioning more appropriately they're able to deal with the stress more easily

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Yeah and one of the immediate chemical changes that produces the hot flash in the skin

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Is a surge of nitric oxide of acetylation

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Oh it dilates the blood vessels

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Yeah and unopposed estrogen is a powerful activator of nitric oxide

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And so I'm convinced that unopposed estrogen is the cause of the hot flashes

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And doctors looking only at a blood test of estrogen will say no at menopause

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 A woman's estrogen in the serum is very low

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 But this has been very competently studied

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 If you take a bit of tissue and compare it to the serum

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 This has been done not only in animals but in women during menopause and in pregnancy and in the cycle

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 A bit of tissue compared to the serum

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 The tissue has 10 or 20 times more estrogen than the serum

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 And what makes the difference what can raise the estrogen in the serum is progesterone

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 So if you're deficient in progesterone your tissue is likely to have 10 or 20 times more estrogen than shows up in the blood

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 When you have a normal cycle with progesterone

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 The progesterone does 8 or 10 different chemical actions causing the tissue content of the estrogen to decrease

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 And as it decreases in the cell it enters the bloodstream on its way to the kidneys and liver to be excreted

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 But in the absence of progesterone those changes that release estrogen to be excreted don't happen

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 And so the estrogen stays inside the cell at a concentration much higher than in the blood

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 So that's part of the idea you said unopposed estrogen the opposition would be the balance of progesterone

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Yeah

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 And why does that get low?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Does it just living on planet earth with stress and diet and everything why the progesterone levels go too low?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Yeah for pregnancy to be safe for both the mother and the baby

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 The placenta must produce a huge amount of progesterone everyday

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Hundreds of milligrams per day rising all the way through pregnancy to a peak approaching a gram a day

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 But when the woman or animal is under stress the stress changes the pituitary and all the other glands to avoid pregnancy

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 A stressed animal of any sort would be less likely to survive if it got pregnant

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 So the trick is that pregnancy is prevented by stress for the safety of the mother

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 So it's a natural kind of evolutionary thing

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 Yeah

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 And it works the same way with bears or deers or girls

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Yeah stress specifically turns off progesterone for the avoidance of pregnancy

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Yeah

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 We've talked to so many ladies over the years they get stressed out of course because they want to get pregnant right?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 It's hard you know because they're all worried and concerned about not getting able to get pregnant

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 Yeah there are lots of stories about a couple that gives up getting pregnant, adopt a kid and immediately she gets pregnant

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 That's right

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 The stress is relieved

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 We have more kids than we need right?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 So what's the idea though that many feel like a little bit of progesterone cream just a dab or so helps to keep testosterone levels better for guys?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 What's going on there?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 And is that a reliable thing to look at for guys listening?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 I've heard that from several men over the years

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 My first experiences experimenting with progesterone was it would stop my whiskers growing for a couple of days

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Because a good dose of it blocks, that's one of its functions is to block hormones that could interfere with pregnancy

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 So progesterone puts everything down the middle when it's high in pregnancy

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 You don't want any stray hormones disturbing the pregnancy

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 So that's one of the functions of progesterone is to aim at survival rather than whiskers or production of large amounts of collagen or bone material or anything

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 So it keeps things right down the middle

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 So it's not necessarily a testosterone builder or a more anabolic thing, the progesterone cream?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 No, it just blocks the stress and if you get it at the right level you don't have enough to block the testosterone, just enough to block the stress and leave your own testosterone

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 So you're sounding like for the guys don't even mess with it, you wouldn't do it

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 No, most of the men that I've known who used it, it did shrink the penis and stop whisker growth

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 It shrinks the penis?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 Temporarily

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 Why?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Because testosterone is maintaining the circulation and the nitric oxide causes acid dilation

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 That really isn't the mechanism of erection, it's testosterone which gives muscle tone to the veins which empty the penis and the nitric oxide opens the vessels into the penis

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 So they're doing the same thing in different ways but the right amount of testosterone maintains a certain tone in the exit vessels allowing a considerable amount of blood to stay there even in the passive state

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Right, so I'm kind of confused, so this little dab of progesterone that many guys do to keep their testosterone levels up, does it work? I mean is that good? I'm kind of confused, sorry

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 At just exactly the right amount it can leave the luteinizing hormone active and let the testicle continue producing an adequate amount of testosterone

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 How would you know what just the right amount is?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 I think only by trial and error because I've known men who had anti-testosterone symptoms with 10 mg, others who felt an increase of testosterone with the same small dose

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So you'd have to be, I think most of the progesterone, the one I saw from Dr. Wong, they talk about a little, and it's from yams I think, just a little tiny bit, just a dab or so of this cream

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Wow that gets a little tricky, you've got to be careful with that, you mess around with that, right?

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, stay right there Dr. Peat, we have lots to talk about this morning, it's an honor to have him on our show on the third Tuesday

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 If you care to have a question, you can just email Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com

00:26:48.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 We've been learning quite a bit about hydrogen and some of the cool things that you can do that hydrogen does, you just google molecular hydrogen and a lot of fun things are going on in some of the more mainstream areas of life

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 With the stroke victims, they're using hydrogen along with oxygen to help the stroke victims to heal

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And then we learned from Dr. Thomas Levy that oxidation, he believes, is one of the chief causes of disease

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 And then, well you can hear the story right here on the promotion of this hydrogen thing, it might be of interest to you

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Oops, I pressed the wrong button, sorry, I just pressed the wrong button

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 I got it now, I got it

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Previously with the highly credentialed Dr. Thomas Levy, he argues because the literature shows that oxidation is the cause of disease

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 But the whole point is the location, the concentration, the duration, the distribution of oxidized biomolecules determines 100% of all diseases

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 And so that's why I say oxidative stress doesn't cause disease, oxidation is disease

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 If there's no oxidized biomolecules, you don't have a toxin

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 The toxic effect is oxidation of biomolecules, that's the entirety of it

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 And by the grace of God, several months ago, George Wiseman said this about hydrogen

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Hydrogen is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than vitamin C, things like that

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your body and go right into the very DNA and repair it

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 So now it makes sense why George was able to say this back in August 2019, with such conviction

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 The body accepts that gas and uses it to heal everything

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 It's like the fountain of youth, it's astonishing the amount of ailments

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 In fact, in scientific studies, and they have over a thousand scientific studies now

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 They are showing that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly from virtually every ailment that ails any water-based life form

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Okay, I'm sold, and I was able to get one a couple of months ago, thanks to your support

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 It's called the Aquacure Hydrogen Machine, breathe the gas and bubble the water

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 There's a promo code OneRadio for 10% discount, I think a great investment for you

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Knowing what we know now, on OneRadioNetwork.com

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 So, it's pretty cool, I've been really enjoying the hydrogen machine

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And I can tell you there are some interesting things going on that I'm just not sure why or something

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 But things are getting better for me, I'm sleeping better, I'm feeling just more comfortable in my body

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Which, you know, for me is just kind of, you know, just something nice going on

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 I'm feeling some less, the numbness in my little toes after a couple of months on the hydrogen

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Of course, I do some other things, so I can't honestly say for sure, you know, that's what it is

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 But we like it, we think there's a lot of science behind it, there is a lot of science behind it

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 We don't think we know, I saw one article that hydrogen was being used as medicine

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 Back in 1888, the Annals of Surgery recorded one of the very first publications that linked hydrogen to medicine

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 It referred to Dr. Nicholas Senn, who at the time was using hydrogen for intestinal applications

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 And they have all the things here that you can look and check it out and see if what they just said is just made up or what

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 So, it's interesting, I think there's something here for you

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 There's a lifetime warranty and then a one year money back warranty if you don't like it

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And you just get it back

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 OK, I've got to do one thing, something just locked up on me quickly

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 But not to worry, I know how to do it

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 I've got a little thing that does that, and I think that's going to work

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 And, sorry, I think we're just 60 seconds away from Dr. Ray Peat

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Previously with Daniel Vitalis, we were talking about pine pollen

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Pollen is essentially the equivalent of what an animal would have as sperm

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Pollen is like the male part, the semen, and it fertilizes the ovum of the flower which becomes eventually a fruit

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 And so if we were going to draw the equivalent, it would be like that the flower is like the female sex organ

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 And the pollen is like the male sexual ejaculate

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Well, pine trees, which sort of just dominate so much of the landscape of North America and so much of the world

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Pine trees, their semen, they dust the landscape in pollen

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 And that pollen, being the sort of male part of the plant, has some correspondences to male physiology in our species and many other animal species

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 So what I'm saying is pine pollen contains all of these different anabolic androgenic hormones

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Plant versions of hormones that we need like testosterone, like DHEA

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Well, the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Good stuff, guys, and for you girls, too

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Several choices of pine pollen, any Sir Thrival link, oneradionetwork.com

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Pine pollen is on sale for three days, we have Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Big sale, pine pollen, any of the Sir Thrival links on oneradionetwork.com

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 It's the third Tuesday of the month and Dr. Ray Peat, thank you so much, Doc, for coming on once a month

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 I'm getting emails from around the world

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 You've got a lot of fans

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 How did all these people find you over the years? I'm real curious

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 I mean, you have a pretty standard kind of basic website and you're out there to promote

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 People just found you?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Yeah, it's interesting, in the 70s when I started giving out samples of thyroid and progesterone dissolved in vitamin E

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 People got such tremendous results, just giving it away to whoever happened by

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 They started talking about the amazing things that happened with progesterone and thyroid

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 And it has just spread

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 So long ago you were actually giving out little samples of progesterone and vitamin E and also the thyroid, the piggy thyroid in the vitamin E

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 And people were just...

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Yeah, I bought a small barrel of armor thyroid powder

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 And at that time it was popular to use powdered kelp as a dietary supplement

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 And so I would put a little bit of armor thyroid powder in with the powdered kelp and tell them it was a weak form of natural thyroid

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 And they were acquainted with the idea of using kelp as a supplement

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 But the thyroid was really the active component

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Interesting, so what kind of experiences were...

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 And how much were you giving this little dose of the progesterone and the vitamin E?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 What kind of experience were the guys having and the women too, were having different good experiences?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Oh, yeah, one suicidal young woman, 21 or 22 years old, every two weeks she became absolutely suicidal

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 And her husband had to hire a babysitter to keep her from killing herself

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 And finally committed her to the local psychiatric ward

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 But because it was cyclic, she was in for a week and was perfectly sane the week she was in

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 But as soon as she got out, she tried to turn on the gas and kill herself

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 So her husband brought her over and she was sobbing as he brought her in

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 And I gave her a bottle of progesterone in oil and told her to go in the bathroom and spread it all over her body

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 And she came out and within five minutes had stopped sobbing

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 And the bulging veins on her hand disappeared as the next phase

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Forty minutes after putting it on, she was smiling

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 And exactly 45 minutes after putting the oil on, she said, "It's like night turning into day, I wish I could always feel this good"

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 And two weeks later, the same thing happened

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 She went into a suicidal state and I had given her progesterone dissolved in vegetable oil

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 And it hadn't stayed in solution, so she had oiled herself but wasn't getting the dissolved progesterone

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 So she was suicidal again, but when I gave her some of the actual dissolved material

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Exactly the same cycle, the sobbing stopped, the veins disappeared, the smile

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 And at 45 minutes, exactly the same sort of from black to white mood change

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 Interesting, and the guys in general, what kind of feedback did you get from them?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 And how much progesterone were you giving in that little dose?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Two or three men rubbed it on their scalp every day and got fuzz to grow

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 In about four or five weeks, they were getting probably 20 milligrams a day on their head

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Was that affecting raising testosterone levels to cause the hair to grow?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 It was one of them that mentioned the shrinkage

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 After all these years with progesterone for men, you have a kind of a gram or a milligram standard that you would kind of start guys at if they wanted to experiment with it?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 Five milligrams

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Five milligrams, I guess you could, I don't know how you'd measure that, but somehow, well interesting

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, we have a lot of good emails, patrick@oneradionetwork.com

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Here's an email for you Dr. Peat, here's a gentleman that says you recommend 2000 milligrams calcium per day

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 A concern expressed by other nutritionists is that calcium may not go to the bones, but into the soft tissue and other places causing systemic damage over time

00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 If one does take your suggestion, what are the prerequisite actions or physiological cell metabolism assumptions you are making for taking 2000 milligrams?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 And what kind of calcium?

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 I know there are still lots of doctors and nutritionists who have that idea, but the parathyroid gland is constantly regulating, responding to conditions

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 And if you eat an excess of calcium and a moderate or low amount of phosphate, the parathyroid gland becomes very passive, especially if you have adequate vitamin D

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 And the parathyroid gland, its main function seems to be to take calcium out of the bone and bring it into the blood

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 But a side effect of taking it out of the bone is that it activates take up by the soft tissue and keeping the parathyroid gland as inhibited as possible

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And that leaves your bones unaltered, the calcium can still go in, but the parathyroid isn't going to be bringing it out of the bones into the bloodstream where it can affect the blood vessels

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 And when you eat an excess of calcium and have an adequate vitamin D level in your body, the calcium passes right through your kidneys into the urine

00:40:43.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 But if your parathyroid is active, it can form stones on the way out, the blood ability to keep it in solution changes

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 And it's that same change that causes it to go into the blood vessel wall

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 Carbon dioxide is the factor that keeps the calcium in solution in the bloodstream and stable in the bones

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Calcium carbonate is the first molecule deposited in the bone and it's gradually changed to calcium phosphate

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 But carbon dioxide is responsible for putting it into the bone

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 When the parathyroid hormone is active, it forms lactic acid in the bone and it's lactic acid that dissolves, removes the calcium from the bone

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 So the balance of carbon dioxide versus lactic acid is under the control of parathyroid hormone in the bone

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 And that same process happening in the blood vessels, the carbon dioxide keeps the calcium dissolved, ionized in solution

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 But the lactic acid, if it is allowed to form either in the blood or blood vessels, that counteracts the carbon dioxide, precipitates calcium and forms hardening of the arteries and kidney stones and so on

00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 So keeping the parathyroid hormone low and your carbon dioxide production high relative to lactic acid is what's going to keep bones strong and arteries soft

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 That's why Dr. Cowan, the fellow on the heart, he's a proponent of keeping the lactic acid levels low, so that's probably why, because he knows it happens or it's tied in with the calcium deposits potentially in the arteries

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Yeah, and prolactin and cortisol and parathyroid hormone all tend to interfere with carbon dioxide production

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Progesterone and thyroid are the things that most support the production of carbon dioxide and suppress the formation of lactic acid

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 Suppress it. Yeah, this ties right in. Jerome says that I have some history of my grandfather and father having a stroke, one in the brain and one around his heart

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 Can Dr. Peat give me some ideas, some things I can do or not do to strengthen my arteries and veins so they don't have a problem later in life?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 Good question. So is that what a stroke is? Is it a stroke where the veins will just actually...

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 No, there are two main kinds of stroke. One in which a clot forms and plugs up the small arteries and the other where a blood vessel breaks and leaks blood, it can form a giant clot outside of the blood vessel, so it's a bleeding stroke or a clotted stroke

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 There's two different kinds. Let's first talk about...

00:44:44.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 And then there's another relatively harmless thing which is a transient ischemic attack. That's where the arteries or capillaries close down because carbon dioxide isn't being produced

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 So that's what they call these mini strokes, Doc?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Yeah

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 So the ischemic kind of things, they're not good but they're not life-threatening

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 And so before we get to the clot, let's talk about the carbon dioxide. We over-breathe, that releases carbon dioxide?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Yeah

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Breathing fast?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 You lose carbon dioxide when you breathe too hard

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 Too hard

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 And a low thyroid person is producing very little CO2 and so it takes very little over-breathing for a hypothyroid person to experience that constriction of blood vessels from loss of CO2

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 Interesting. So that's another reason to keep that thyroid happy and in good shape so you can retain more CO2

00:45:51.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 Yeah, it's low thyroid people who suffer high altitude sickness because to get more oxygen in thin air, they over-breathe

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 Is clotting, going back to Jerome's question, on clotting on the potential strokes, is that the number one cause?

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Yeah, in the United States at least, that's by far the most common type of stroke other than the transient ischemic

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 And why do these little clots form, do we know?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 It isn't quite a deficiency of aspirin but it's related to that. A serotonin excess, serotonin increases when you're under stress, especially if you're hypothyroid

00:46:43.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 And hyperventilation raises the pH of your blood by blowing out the CO2, carbonic acid should be keeping the pH of your blood towards the lower end of the range

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 And as the pH of the blood rises from hyperventilation, your platelets lose the ability to bind serotonin

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 And so serotonin rises in the blood when you hyperventilate, but serotonin in the brain stimulates respiration and makes you breathe harder

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 And the doctrine for about 30 years has been claiming that serotonin produced in your intestine and carried in your bloodstream can't get into the brain to affect the respiration

00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 But in fact, very clear experiments have shown that the blood-brain barrier as far as serotonin is concerned really doesn't exist because serotonin breaks down the barrier

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 So when it's high in the blood, it gets in your brain, makes you breathe harder and if you're low in carbon dioxide to start with, it increases the release of serotonin into your bloodstream in a vicious circle

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 And that could cause then the platelets to do their thing and clots

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Yeah, and that's how an emotional stress, something that just makes you breathe faster

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 If you're hypothyroid, it will start the cycle in which the pH rises, the serotonin is released from platelets, activates your brain to breathe harder, exacerbating the problem

00:48:47.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 Fascinating. So can you conjecture then that just angst and tension and planet earth and worry could be a really chief cause for these strokes that people have?

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 Yeah, on the background of a low thyroid function

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 On the background of a low thyroid function. Because if Mr. Thyroid is happy and you have a TSH, I mean way down, 0, 1 or 2 or something, and your body temperature is up, the body is not affected by stress as badly?

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 Yeah, because your progesterone and DHEA and pregnenolone are being produced generously by the well-circulated blood supply carrying sugar to all these tissues

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 Hypoglycemia is something that works with low carbon dioxide in the blood. They both tend to increase lactic acid, which wastes sugar and makes the problem worse

00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 So low blood sugar actually creates lactic acid, but I mean, we were taught that sugar is more acid and creates lactic acid

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 Only if you're under stress and can't oxidize it. Thyroid and progesterone increase your ability to oxidize glucose into carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide by regulating the pH turns off lactic acid production

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 So it increases efficiency to increase your metabolic rate

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 On the thyroid, how powerful of a metric is the body temperature in your opinion, Dr. Rapey, for thyroid function?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 It's almost the ruling factor. If you cool your body to 95 or 96 degrees Fahrenheit, it's essentially impossible to metabolize properly

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 You don't always metabolize rationally if your temperature is at 100 degrees, but it's a lot easier to get full oxidation all the way to carbon dioxide when your body temperature is up

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 So the fever production is a curative thing. In a way, it's equivalent to giving a good supplement of thyroid, progesterone, sugar, and calcium and so on

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 We had talked to a doc a few months, maybe a month ago, who was suggesting if you get one of these little infrared thermometers, you ever see those? And you can, you know, about a foot away from your surface and you can tell your surface temperature there

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 And he said if you did it on your big toe, if you're about 90 degrees, that's another indication that your thyroid is happy. Have you ever heard of that? Do you think that could be valid?

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 Well, adrenaline is protective. When your thyroid is low, you increase adrenaline and serotonin

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 And a primary function of adrenaline is to keep the blood flowing to your brain and lungs and heart and it will make your hands and feet get very, very cold

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 And a person can still be functioning very well adapting to the low thyroid by keeping their brain and lungs and heart hot and well supplied with whatever sugar and oxygen are available

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 So the adrenaline takes the blood out of the extremities to keep things working in the core

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 Which is the cold hands and feet, right? That's the cold hands and feet

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Yeah, and when you shake hands with a person on a warm day, if they have cold hands, they're very likely hypothyroid unless you're scaring them

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 So a 90 degree toe with this thing could be a reasonable metric?

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 Yeah, if the room is warm, your hands and feet should be reasonably warm

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 And when they're very cold, it means either that you're being frightened into high adrenaline or that your thyroid isn't adequate to keep the heat up in the extremities

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 Here's another question on thyroid. We always get a lot. A question for Dr. Peat.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 What is the mechanism for how proper thyroid function and stomach acid break down or neutralize oxalates in the diet?

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 Does it matter how much oxalic acid is consumed? Also, how effective are mineral compounds like magnesium or potassium citrate at preventing the negative effects of oxalic acid?

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Do you understand the question?

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 If you're eating enough minerals, the calcium oxalate is likely to precipitate in your stomach and intestine and not even be absorbed

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 So I think the calcium and magnesium content of your food is protective by keeping it out of your system, keeping the oxalate out of your bloodstream

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 Here's an email. I've been having trouble finding good thyroid supplement. Is there anything else to help me with my hypothyroidism?

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 I'm avoiding polyunsaturated fats and don't eat an excess of uncooked cabbage or kale or other vegetables of that family. When they're raw especially, they can be very antithyroid

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 Somebody was asking about putting a red light on your thyroid. What does Dr. Peat think about that to raise thyroid levels?

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 It does have an action but what it's doing mostly is opening blood vessels and that in itself can increase the production of thyroid but it affects the respiration of cells, can increase efficiency locally

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 I've got an experience I just wanted to share with you, Doc. I've been putting black cumin seed oil on my thyroid and a little DMSO and going to sauna, you know, and let it get hot and the infrared lights and also using the red light and tapping a little bit and just kind of talking to it and being, saying, "Mr. Thyroid, get happier"

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 My body temperature has gone up really in the last month probably about a half a degree.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 What kind of oil?

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Black cumin seed oil. So I'm kind of thinking maybe there is some toxicity going on and that helped to get that out. I don't know why the black cumin seed oil being heated up would do that.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 I think it is able to catalyze oxidative metabolism.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 Oh, it's an antioxidant.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 From the shape of the molecule, it looks like it would be a pro-oxidative, pro-thyroid factor.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 But I've also been breathing the hydrogen in the water too so that could be helping. Very interesting.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 So that might be something fun for you all to play with. I don't know. I can't give medical advice but put some black cumin seed on your thyroid and put a little heating blanket on or something or a red light.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 It couldn't hurt though, I don't think.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 Here's a 68-year-old man on Natrithroid with healthy weight and have tried many diets, no processed foods and exercise but still cannot cure type 2 diabetes.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Don't want insulin or metformin. What would your experience suggest I try next? This is from Jim in Eugene, Oregon.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 Getting a perfect, well-balanced diet is the first thing. Adequate calcium, a fairly high ratio of calcium to phosphate in your diet.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 Not too much meat or beans or nuts because of the high phosphate content in those relative to calcium.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:30.000
 There are two main classes of food that provide a very high calcium-magnesium content and low phosphate. Milk and cheese are one and cooked greens is the other category.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 Vitamin D should be in the middle of the range, 50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 Beyond that, you want to make sure that your thyroid is good and the pH of the blood and the CO2 level are indicators of that.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 I don't think blood tests are the most reliable way to measure your CO2. A breath analyzer is really good.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 Actually using carbon dioxide supplements, absorbing it through your skin or taking little bits of baking soda in water,

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 that will actually suppress the lactic acid production if you do it in a graded amount like half a teaspoon in a half a glass of water a few times a day.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 That will slightly increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood which will increase the CO2 inside cells,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:57.000
 adjusting the pH and suppressing the lactic acid production and shifting the cell to be able to oxidize the sugar.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 Diabetics, they talk about the sugar not being able to get into the cell but it goes into the cell and it's turned to lactic acid is the problem.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 Oh, so that insulin resistance thing you talked about, Dr. Peat, you're saying that it's not the whole story.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
 They got it wrong somewhere.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 Stress increases the liberation of free fatty acids from your tissues.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:39.000
 So apart from the amount of fat you're eating, it's the liberation of free fatty acids which get into the cell and shift,

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:50.000
 block the ability of the cell to oxidize glucose and when glucose isn't being oxidized, it's likely to be turned into lactic acid.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.000
 And the lactic acid shifts the pH and starts the whole process.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:09.000
 Here is James. He's listening on Facebook. Can you please ask Dr. Peat some of the best ways to improve the health of my liver?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 A good diet is the first thing. B vitamins are extremely important for getting things running.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 Selenium is essential for being able to use the thyroid molecules to put it into the right active T3 form and carbohydrate is very important.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:50.000
 But then you want to periodically check, have a blood test to see if your vitamin D and thyroid hormone is in the right range.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.000
 From Adrian, Dr. Peat talks about taking some good forms of sugar.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000
 Does he believe that the A1C blood test, which I think, and I'm just adding this point, isn't that over 90 days or something,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
 is a reliable metric to see if I'm taking too much sugar?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:20.000
 No, I don't think it relates very closely to sugar because it will be influenced by breakdown of free fatty acids.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:35.000
 The polyunsaturated fats break down into fragments that look like sugar fragments, but the fats are much more oxidizable and toxic.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
 The proof is it's easier to oxidize those guys.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
 Yeah.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
 Yeah, and so doing proof is actually raise your A1C.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 Yeah, as they break down.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:54.000
 But doing organic beet sugar or honey or maple syrup, that doesn't raise your A1C or if it does, do you care?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:15.000
 Yeah, the numbers have been exaggerated so that the lower than, I think, seven, they found that the sickest people weren't at the highest level.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:21.000
 So the numbers were cooked a bit for whatever reason.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
 It's a lot more complicated than just sugar causing that to rise.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
 It generally is with you, Dr. Peat. That's why we like you.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 Here's an email from Trent.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
 I donate blood several times per year.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 What, in your opinion, is the optimal serum ferritin blood level for someone age 70?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
 I don't think ferritin is meaningful enough to worry about.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 Don't even worry about it?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 Watching your hemoglobin level, at the low end of the normal range of hemoglobin, I think it's the safest place to be.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
 Say that again, please.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
 The low end of the normal range for hemoglobin.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
 Okay.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 Hemoglobin is the essential thing for delivering oxygen.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 And ferritin can go up and down according to inflammation.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:32.000
 Keeping it in a moderate range usually means that you're not very sick because sickness and inflammation will distort it greatly.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
 What is the idea that we hear...

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
 Oh, excuse me. Did I interrupt you?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:49.000
 The saturation of transferrin, the percentage saturation, should be under 30, a little under 30.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
 Under 30.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
 So what is this idea of giving blood every so often to get rid of excess?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
 Is it iron that people do this?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:05.000
 That was the traditional idea that it would prevent the accumulation on a standard Western diet.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000
 Men constantly during their lifetime tend to accumulate iron.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000
 Women after menopause start accumulating it at the same rate because they aren't losing it.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:28.000
 And so blood donors were seen to maintain an adequate level without so much accumulation with aging.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
 But in the last several years, people are saying that there are other things.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 One label for them was stressins, units created by stress.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:52.000
 There are several different names for substances released into the bloodstream during stress and aging.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
 And getting rid of those has a slightly rejuvenating effect.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 Interesting. This is from Elmer.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 Please ask Dr. Peat the difference between taking something like Pogest-E and pregnenolone powder.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000
 And also if I'm trying to lose fat, should we be drinking lower fat milk?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:24.000
 Yeah. I think milk is such an easy nutrient to get almost all of your nutrients

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000
 that drinking two or three quarts a day is good for most people.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 But you don't want to drink that much whole milk if you aren't doing very hard labor to burn calories.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:48.000
 So 1% is an average amount of fat for a person of average activity.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:55.000
 Totally anecdotal, Dr. Peat, but after starting to drink milk and more and more of it after talking to you over the past few months,

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
 raw milk that I'm just warming up a little bit, a little bit of sugar in there, beet sugar,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 I've gained about, well I'm starting to lift weights, but I've gained about three pounds already.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
 And that's pretty unusual, that's very unusual for me.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
 I haven't been able to gain weight pretty much my whole life.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 So that's interesting, interesting information.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
 But it's whole milk, you know, grass-fed whole milk.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 Yeah, milk contains small amounts of progesterone and thyroid.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 In the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, lots of people, lots of babies were born without thyroid glands.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
 But those who were breastfed, as long as they were being breastfed,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
 the doctors didn't notice that they had no thyroid gland function.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
 As soon as they were weaned, the absence of thyroid showed up,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
 showing that the breast milk was keeping an adequate amount of thyroid to keep them growing.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 But cow's milk isn't as rich in thyroid and progesterone.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 But you get a little bit though, you get a little bit.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000
 Yeah, that small amount adds to the effect of the calcium to stimulate your metabolic rate slightly.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:20.000
 Do we know, or is there any research to show if there's a big difference between grass-fed milk and regular old milk,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
 even if it's organic? Who knows what they're feeding them, organic feed?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
 Do we know?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
 Yeah, food can be organic and still not be ideal.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
 Sure, of course.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
 There can be stinky weeds in the pasture that make it taste bad.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 But grass-fed milk has more vitamin E, according to the research.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:47.000
 But not necessarily, we don't know more hormones or progesterone or anything like that.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
 We don't know that. We haven't seen anything there.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
 I don't think anyone has tested that.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
 Good idea, that'd be great.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
 Thanks for having Dr. Peat on as a regular guest.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.000
 From Chris, before I ask my question, could you please convey my sincere gratitude for Dr. Peat for helping me deal with a heart issue.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 This helps me to get out of the clutches of the medical world.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
 Here's my question.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
 Why do feet swell up especially when it is warm?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
 The swelling reduces later in the day, and when it is cooler, it does not completely go away.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:29.000
 I'm on two grains of natural thyroid and following Dr. Peat's dietary considerations such as avoiding polys, poofas, drinking some milk and orange juice.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
 Thank you.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000
 A little sweet, Peat's swelling but it seems to, when it's warmer.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:45.000
 I've heard that from quite a few people, but I don't really understand how it works.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.000
 I think it's partly the shift of the nervous system.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 You let down your adrenaline a little bit when it's warmer because adrenaline's function is to keep the blood up in your vital organs.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 And when it's warmer, you can reduce the adrenaline and that relaxes blood vessels and lets any leakiness show up.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:32.000
 But I think it means that you're maybe not producing enough albumin in your liver or having some other effect of an unbalanced estrogen level.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:40.000
 Estrogen makes blood vessels leaky and reduces the formation of albumin in the liver.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:53.000
 And albumin, working with sodium, is what keeps the blood, keeps the fluid in the bloodstream rather than leaking out into your feet.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:05.000
 So the cold feet then, it's tied with the thyroid low, but then it's the adrenaline combination that's not getting the blood there to the extremities.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
 Is that right?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
 Yeah.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:15.000
 Adrenaline keeps things working, but it changes the way they work.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
 Speaking of estrogen, it just came to me.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.000
 Are these what birth control pills are?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:31.000
 I don't know if they're very popular as they used to be, but are these estrogen manipulators for the ladies?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
 Are they dangerous?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:43.000
 Yeah. In the '30s, they already knew that estrogen prevented implantation or caused miscarriages.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
 They didn't want to sell a miscarriage pill.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:04.000
 And all through the 1940s and '50s, the drug companies realized that it would be a very profitable product to sell a birth control pill, but they didn't have the ideology that they knew it killed the embryo.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 And they didn't want to have the drug company identified as baby killers.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 But in the '50s, someone thought up the idea that it isn't acting on the uterus, it's acting only on your brain and pituitary, and it's going to stop ovulation.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.000
 If you can stop ovulation, you won't be accused of causing abortions.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
 But that was fake news.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
 I think so, yeah.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
 There was no evidence.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
 How can you see when a woman ovulates an ovum?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:53.000
 In an animal, you can dissect them and watch the process and catch the actual ovum.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
 Yeah.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
 But in humans, it was simply declared rather than observed.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
 In general, do you know this?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 I know you may not know this, but are these birth control pills still very popular in our culture?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
 People use them a lot?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:22.000
 Yeah, the first wave of them was causing sometimes fatal hemorrhages, often disabling strokes by causing clotting in the brain.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 So they reduced the amount of estrogen by about a factor of 10 from the first wave of contraceptives and made them more saleable because so many women were having strokes or hemorrhages.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:59.000
 But still, the medical literature is heavily biased against recognizing any damage done by them.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:18.000
 But still, the literature is out there showing that depression, various mood changes, movement disorders, restlessness, lots of problems are still associated with them.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
 Yeah.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
 Dr. Peat, stay right there.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:28.000
 Patrick, Tim, Pony, we'll do a quick little break here, and then we'll get into our last segment with Dr. Ray Peat on Radionetwork.com.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:37.000
 Please like these things on Facebook, there are videos now, and on YouTube, subscribe, and all these things help to kind of spread the word.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
 And we appreciate that if you would do that, that would be totally cool.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:15:03.000
 Kathy writes on Facebook today that forgot to mention, oh she wrote two of them, but she said, Kathy says here, forgot to mention that sulfur was one of the first things that helped me to bring my health back and started me having, started me healing.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
 Oh, that's very nice of you, Kathy.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 Kathy, if you'd like to try our sulfur, we have a great product, just go on our website, two pounds of sulfur for a particular price, and then another price for Canada, another price for worldwide.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000
 If you want more than four pounds, email me, Patrick@1radionetwork.com, and we'll take care of you.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 Previously, Dr. Hal Huggins on detoxing mercury.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
 You do not have to get all the mercury out of the body, that's not what the problem is.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 It's the direction it's going.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.000
 If you have more going out than you have coming in, then you're going to have a good chemistry, you're going to feel good.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:50.000
 But if you have more going in to the body than going out, chemistries look bad and you feel bad.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 If you had to name just a few things on the top of your list to help get mercury out, whether they be supplements or foods, give us your top five.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
 Okay.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
 Off the top of your head.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 The best thing would be the infrared sauna.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
 The thing is, detoxification is easy.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 Anybody can release a lot of mercury, but if you're using a sauna or especially the infrared sauna, then you are eliminating the mercury through the skin and you are bypassing liver and kidney.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
 So that's a very good way to go.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:34.000
 It certainly is, Dr. Huggins. We love Dr. Huggins. I'm sure he's doing well wherever he is.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
 If you'd like to get one, just email me. These are great units, folks.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:44.000
 You can see how they look here. There's no plugs, there's no wiring, there's no plumbing.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
 Well, you just plug it in.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000
 There's two far infrared units at the front of this unit, if you look at the front, right at the first two.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
 And you can do just one of those if you don't want it as hot.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
 And this baby will get up there maybe 160, 170 degrees, and believe me, you'll sweat.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 And as I said, you know, I talked about Dr. Peat and the black cumin seed oil and my body temperature going up on my thyroid.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:17.000
 I put it all over my thyroid with a little DMSO, and then you just kind of scoot down in the chair, as you can see the lady there, and then your thyroid is, you know, covered.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:26.000
 So you can use it, and you can do the black cumin seed oil, you can do it on your tummy or a little bit of turpentine, pure pine gum spirits on your tummy with DMSO.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
 Well, you probably don't need it.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
 So there's a lot of cool things you can do with this.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
 Also put turpentine or castor oil on the bottom of your feet, and that'll soak in there with a nice hot.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000
 So they're fun, and we'll get you one for $9.95, $9.95 delivered, continental US.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 And if you'd like to get one and you live around the world, just simply email me and we'll hook you up for a pretty good price.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
 Now's the time to get them, $9.95, have it for the holidays.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 Just email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
 We love this product that you're seeing the picture of.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
 It's called Pearlseum.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:18.000
 Now, Chinese medicine and, or even medicine have used for hundreds, well, thousands of years have used pearl for beauty, for longevity.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
 You can use pearl on your face with a face cream.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
 You can brush your teeth with it, which is amazing.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
 And this, you can also take it internally.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
 It's proven by science to really work.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 It has, it's made, it's real live pearl, which I believe is calcium carbonate.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
 I think that's what it is.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
 And Dr. Peat, while he wasn't endorsing this product, he said the calcium carbonate was a good way to take calcium.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:52.000
 So we thought so, and of course it wouldn't be around for thousands of years if the pearl, you know, if the calcium was ending up in your arteries.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
 You know, it just doesn't do it with this product.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000
 I would get two containers, two little green containers, and then put one in your bathroom, one where your supplements are.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
 Brush your teeth with it.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
 You can take a little bit before bed.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 It helps you to sleep.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
 It's a very nice product.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
 Pearlseum, real pearl.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
 That's all there is in there, nothing else.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000
 Real pearl from OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:21.000
 We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being on OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
 Dr. Ray Peat has a website, and you can check it out.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:36.000
 It's RayPeat.com, and we always put a link on his show page, and you can click on there and support Dr. Peat's work by getting his newsletter, which comes out, Dr. Peat, what, every couple months, right?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
 Every two months.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
 Two months, yeah.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
 Every two months.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
 What's your latest one about?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
 Progesterone.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
 Oh, progesterone, of course.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 Progesterone.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
 It'll be out in about two weeks.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
 And you look at your bio.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
 I mean, you were looking at this, what, 50 years ago?

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 Yeah.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
 Wow.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:12.000
 I'm putting in a little bit of the history, but bringing it up to date, putting in some of the recent carbonic acid, carbon dioxide connections.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
 Yeah, yeah.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
 Here's an email.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:24.000
 What's the percentage, or what percent of tryptophan ingested from food is converted to serotonin?

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:37.000
 That depends on your level of stress and other things, but it can be very high when you're under stress.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
 Other times, very little of it.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
 This is an interesting question.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 Is risk-taking in life conducive or not to the state of learned helplessness?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 Is risk-taking involved in being in the state of learned helplessness?

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
 Do you talk about learned helplessness?

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
 Oh, quite a bit, yeah.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:16.000
 Serotonin turns on the stress system, but it can also turn off the adaptive things, such as production of progesterone.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
 And you can break out of learned helplessness by increasing your energy.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
 Thyroid is a crucial thing in stopping learned helplessness.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
 And what exactly is learned helplessness?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:44.000
 The term relates to the old studies in which they convinced a rat that escape was impossible.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:56.000
 But the animal in that state would allow itself to drown very easily because it saw no use in swimming.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 Its heart would simply stop after maybe just a few minutes of resisting.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:11.000
 But if they put the animal in the tortured situation that caused it to become helpless,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:22.000
 if they then showed it some exit possibility, it in effect vaccinated it against stress.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 So that when dropped into the water, instead of drowning in a few minutes, sometimes they would resist and swim for more than a day.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
 Interesting.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
 Simply a mental change, something they learned.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
 That's why it wasn't called a physical thing. It was a learned helplessness.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
 I see.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:54.000
 Somebody wants to know, is that Mexi-Coke that you two were talking about, does it have cocaine in it?

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
 Which thing?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
 Mexi-Coke.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:04.000
 Oh, I think all Coke is made from an extract of the coca leaf.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:12.000
 But around 1940, we're told to remove the cocaine.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:20.000
 And so there are molecules closely related to cocaine that I think are beneficial.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 Some of the same benefits that the coca leaf cures have for endurance and anti-inflammatory and such.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:38.000
 But according to the official analysis, the real cocaine has been removed.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:50.000
 Would you ask Dr. Peate to talk about free will and determinism?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
 That might take a while.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.000
 Well, if you're into it, we are. We have no place to go. It's up to you, sir.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:09.000
 I think we, life in general, things in general, I think we are determined to have free will.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
 It's part of our nature, part of the nature of every living thing.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:24.000
 And like I mentioned, the formation of soot molecules, extremely complex, organized, symmetrical molecules,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 form spontaneously when methane explodes.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:45.000
 You get some carbon dioxide, oxygen consumes the hydrogens, but the carbon atoms have an intrinsic ordering principle.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:53.000
 They spontaneously organize into these very, very big, complex molecules.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 I think that spontaneous tendency to improve things, create order out of chaos,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:13.000
 I think that's where determinism affects free will so that the situation,

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:23.000
 the carbon atoms didn't have a written plan for what they were going to do, but it was in their nature,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:30.000
 given the opportunity to create high orders of organization.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:46.000
 I think our inherent free will is intending to create high-level order.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:54.000
 As we press forward, moving in our life, our free will is what's creating order and more peace and love.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:08.000
 Yeah, in other words, I think we're biased against the creation of chaos and inclined towards the creation of order.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
 Yeah, I like that. That's great. Good for you.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.000
 As women get older, Ellen wants to know, what are signs of low progesterone?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
 As women get older, what are signs of low progesterone?

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
 Just about everything.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:33.000
 Aging. It's so at the center of life and stability.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:45.000
 For example, weakening bones, loss of elasticity in the skin, loss of moisture and oil production in the skin,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:27:00.000
 stiffening of joints and arteries, a change of reduced curiosity and initiative,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:10.000
 less interest in adventure, more interest in security.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:17.000
 Everything from mental processes down to the smallest.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 Is this for both male and female in general?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
 Yeah.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000
 I've been listening to several of your shows and you have a Dr. Peat. I think they're just great.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
 Thank you so much for having come on.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
 Well, it's our pleasure.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:39.000
 Here's a question. Recently, I've seen new cookware in department stores, titanium ceramic nonstick.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 Does Dr. Peat think this would be safe to use? Titanium ceramic nonstick?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 Without seeing any tests of it, I would refrain from using it to cook anything acidic

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:09.000
 because ceramics, unless they're specially designed to resist acid and corrosion,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:20.000
 you wouldn't want to cook a tomato sauce on it, for example, in case it might release titanium into your food.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:28.000
 Generally, though, we've heard that pure ceramic like La Cruze, that expensive stuff, is good cookware.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
 Is that your opinion as well? Pure ceramic or not?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
 Did I just hear you say not with spaghetti sauce?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000
 Ceramics, remember, lead-based ceramics were a major problem.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:52.000
 Ceramics aren't necessarily acid resistant. It takes some special chemistry to...

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:00.000
 The more it's like a simple silicon glass surface, the safer it is.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
 So glass is really... I don't know if they even make it anymore. I think it's a vision cookware.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:11.000
 You can find them online. I got a whole set on eBay, but I think that's probably some of the best, right? Glass?

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000
 Oh, sure. That's what I've been using for years.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.000
 Like I say, folks, they don't sell it anymore. It's called vision cookware,

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000
 but you can go on eBay and buy a whole set for pretty inexpensive.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000
 I don't know. People just stocked them up when they knew they were going out of style or something.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:36.000
 Here's... This is a good one. Oral micronized progesterone, is it equal to progest-E in its effect?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:46.000
 That's what the drug companies are now... For several years now, they've been selling progesterone.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:58.000
 It's usually in an emulsion or just a paste of peanut oil and micronized progesterone.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:06.000
 And so the progesterone is mostly in a crystalline, though micronized, form.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:14.000
 And a lot of that, as your bile emulsifies the peanut oil,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:22.000
 very little of the progesterone goes in the solution because peanut oil isn't a great solvent.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:31.000
 Like the girl I mentioned that had no effect from the vegetable oil dissolved progesterone

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000
 because it had crystallized out in a period of two weeks.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:46.000
 Some of it, as it contacts the micronized crystals contacting your intestine surface,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:57.000
 will be taken up, molecules released from the crystals will go directly from your intestine to the liver

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:05.000
 and will then be attached to a sugar-like molecule, glucuronic acid,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000
 which then circulates through the body but quickly leaves at the urine.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:22.000
 That causes the progesterone to have a very different effect from the natural form that circulates in the fats.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:31.000
 And so when it's dissolved in vitamin E, vitamin E, as it's emulsified by the bile,

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:42.000
 breaks up and enters the form of chylomitrons, which enter the body in a very different pathway,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000
 going through the wall of the intestine into the lymphatic vessels,

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:56.000
 which then the chylomitrons dump into your general circulation, bypassing the liver.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:06.000
 And the chylomitrons, we normally process our fats through this system

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:11.000
 and this lets the progesterone distribute through the whole system,

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:23.000
 getting equilibrated under red blood cells, under the cholesterol-carrying proteins and other cells

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:30.000
 so that it can pass endlessly through the liver in these forms.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.000
 The red blood cells can keep it in circulation for more than a day after one dose.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000
 It goes into the red blood cells from the chylomitrons, for example,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
 to be at a higher concentration inside the cells and in the serum,

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:56.000
 where the micronized progesterone, as far as it hits the intestine wall,

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.000
 is going straight to the liver to be glucuronidated and excreted.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
 How do you remember all this stuff?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
 Oh, just...

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
 Is it right you're 83 revolutions around the sun? You're 83?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000
 Yeah.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:22.000
 Wow. Man, whatever you're doing, sir, you're doing something good. You remember all that stuff.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
 It's seeing the pattern.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
 Yeah.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:39.000
 The way a cat learns, for example, they can keep a cat in a cage for a long time,

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:48.000
 but once it sees how the lock works, if it's some sort of a latch,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
 once it sees the way out of the cage, it never forgets.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
 That's great.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:02.000
 But if you teach it something by rote, it'll forget it the next day.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000
 So you get it at a deep level of who you are because of your passion,

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 and it's like it's there for you. It's not like you have to remember a phone number or something.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.000
 Yeah, it's seeing how things work.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000
 Yeah, fascinating. James is on Facebook. He says,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
 "I don't have set meal times, and I just kind of follow my hunger signals.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:28.000
 Is this negatively affecting my circadian rhythms? Is there anything else I should care about?"

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
 Just eating when you're hungry?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.000
 I don't really think so. I think it's okay to eat whenever you feel like it.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:46.000
 The experiments on mice claim that it's good to go a long time to fast for a while,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
 but a lot of things are involved.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:53.000
 Mice are nocturnal animals. They normally eat at night,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:05.000
 and just changing their schedule creates such stresses that it's hard to extrapolate from rodents to people,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
 especially things like eating.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
 Yeah. Ellie says, "I'm fascinated with the conversation about milk.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.000
 I've never really thought about drinking milk, and I was just wondering—I'm kind of an extreme girl—

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000
 could you really just live on good milk? I mean, could you live?"

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
 Could you? I guess you could.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:30.000
 Yeah, people have created a milk diet of 30 to 60 days on just milk,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
 but you get iron deficient if you try to live on it,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:46.000
 because the pregnant woman's high estrogen causes her to absorb a very large amount of calcium and iron,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:53.000
 and so the baby comes out very highly charged with iron,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:06.000
 and to overcome that load of iron, it has to have a diet essentially free of iron for up to a year

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:14.000
 so that it grows into the large amount of iron that it has stored in its liver and bones.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:20.000
 Interesting. So it's all set up so when they're just nursing with nothing else, it's got everything.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000
 So later on, though, you don't have the iron. Yeah, that's fascinating.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000
 How would you supplement the iron if you wanted to do milk for a long time?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000
 Eggs are a very good source.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.000
 Ray Peat mentioned on the last show, wearing a sleeping hat.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.000
 Does it matter what it's made out of?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
 Not at all, as long as it's comfortable and warm.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.000
 And so what's going on at night? I like to wear these little socks, you know, and put some oil on the winter,

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
 like sesame seed oil, and then put these little socks on. That's kind of fun.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000
 Yeah, when tissues get below, I think it's about 90 degrees,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
 your hands and feet easily can get down to that temperature.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:14.000
 The cells start producing, the white blood cells passing through those cold areas

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:20.000
 will start producing inflammatory signals, which they carry up to the rest of your body.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000
 And so cold feet really can affect your brain.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000
 Yeah, maybe that's why Aria Bettis talked about doing the sesame oil, you know, at night and putting these little socks on.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
 And it's kind of fun, especially in the winter when it's so dry. It's a very nice thing.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
 So you all might try that.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:46.000
 Ian writes in, "I would like to ask Dr. Peat's opinion on the cause of vertigo

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 and what he would do to combat it, vertigo."

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000
 A very common cause is toxic bacterial growth in the intestine,

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:14.000
 causing a surge of serotonin, leading to a balance that shifts water into your vestibular apparatus that governs your balance.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
 That's probably 90% of the cases of vertigo.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:31.000
 But there are other types that involve serotonin, dopamine, and histamine imbalance farther down in your brain,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.000
 not just in the balance apparatus itself, but in the brainstem,

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:43.000
 the reticular apparatus that feeds the information to your balance system.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:51.000
 Maybe 1 or 2% of the vertigo people are having a chemical imbalance farther down.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
 But the first thing to concentrate on is cleaning up your intestine.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
 Intestines, wow.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, I think we did pretty good today. Thanks for sticking around so long.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
 We really always enjoy talking to you.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
 So what are you going to have for Thanksgiving, like turkey and stuff and everything?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
 I think so, turkey or maybe a lamb roast.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
 Lamb roast or something, yeah.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
 And your newsletter, we'll put a link on our show if people want to get that for you.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
 How much is it? Very inexpensive, very affordable.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
 $28 by email.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
 For a year, right?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:34.000
 Yeah. I'd like to mention a book that people can find on.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:44.000
 It was written in 1905 called "Carbonic Acid in Medicine" by Achilles Rose and Robert Kemp.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:52.000
 It has some very interesting stuff about the history of therapeutic use of carbon dioxide.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
 Oh, cool.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:02.000
 It's just now starting the last five years to come back into medicine as a therapeutic anti-inflammatory.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
 Carbon dioxide.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
 Yeah.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000
 So the name of the book is "Carbonic Acid in Medicine" and the author?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
 Achilles Rose.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
 Rose. You can probably get it on Amazon or somewhere.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000
 Yeah, it's free. I don't know exactly where I found it, but it is on the internet.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
 Oh, you can find it somewhere.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
 Yeah, for no cost.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
 It's pretty interesting that all our political heroes want to tax CO2, so I am not sure what that's about.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.000
 I mean, it's so good for you. Why would you tax it?

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
 Don't worry. You don't have to respond to that.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
 Dr. Peat, thank you. We love your work and we love you, sir.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
 You take care and we'll see you next month, okay?

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
 Okay. Thank you.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
 Thank you. Bye.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
 Bye.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
 He didn't have to mess around with that one.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
 Yeah. Well, great fun.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
 I get so many emails about Dr. Peat and having him on the show and we're glad to do it.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
 He's just a great guy to talk to.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:13.000
 So, we are going to go out in the sun, thank you very much, and hang out there for a while.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
 The Real World of Money with Fred Dashefsky will be, he'll be here tomorrow.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:25.000
 And Fred Zinica, he stays on as best he can with everything that's been going on in his life.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000
 And there's so much cool stuff to talk about with the money thing.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
 Let me find my slide that I want to take off.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
 So, he'll be here tomorrow.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
 And then we're going to talk to a gentleman, his name is Dan Root.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:49.000
 And he is really doing some interesting work with the sauna, with niacin and the flushing and the whole thing.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
 So, that'll be fun, a detox.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
 So, we're going to do that on Thursday, maybe somebody else.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.000
 So, thank you and appreciate you being here.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
 Please spread the word on NowThatWe'reVideo and even all the audio.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:14.000
 Remember, we have about 3,000 podcasts and audio on our website, One Radio Network.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.000
 And you can go there and put whatever you're interested in in our search function.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
 And it's a pretty good one.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
 I mean, it'll find a lot of things, either a particular thing like thyroid or detox or put a person's name in there.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
 You'd be surprised after 12 years on this show of how many people we've talked to.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
 So, we get folks a lot who'll say, "Why don't you have this person?"

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
 And I always check my search engine first on our One Radio Network.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
 And generally, we've already talked to them.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
 But that doesn't mean we can't do it again.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.000
 So, if you have people you'd like to hear from, thanks for your ongoing support.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
 Please like us on Facebook and YouTube and subscribe and all that stuff, all that geeky stuff.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
 And that helps spread the word.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
 So, we'll talk about money tomorrow at 9 o'clock.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
 Bring your money questions to Facebook and also to One Radio Network.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
 And remember that you're doing the best you can.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
 I mean, regardless of what anybody says, you are doing the best you can.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
 We all are. Every moment, every moment, we're doing the best we can.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
 So, I love you all very much. Thank you.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
 And we'll see you tomorrow. OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
 We are listener supported. One Radio Network.
