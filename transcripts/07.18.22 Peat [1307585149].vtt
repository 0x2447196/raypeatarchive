00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Pushing this button. Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is Juan,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.200
 RadioNetwork.com. Well, well, very pleasant good morning to you. Welcome to part two of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:25.200
 our little show today on the third Monday of the month. We have the pleasure of following

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 Dr. Massey is having Dr. Ray Peat on. He's a kind of a legend in nutrition, PhD, biology,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:42.280
 University of Oregon, specializing in physiology. He taught schools all around. He was in Mexico

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 for a long time. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.200
 Wow, that's a year I started radio, 1968. Dr. Ray Peat was doing hormones and I was

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 playing Frank Sinatra records. 1978, Dr. Peat, you and I have been around a little bit. Good

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.520
 morning.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.080
 Dr. Peat Yeah.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 Dr. Massey Nice to have you here. How are you?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 Dr. Peat Just about the time I finished my dissertation

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.080
 related to estrogen metabolism, the news was that there was a tremendous pituitary tumor

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:38.120
 after the development of tumors with excess production of prolactin.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.560
 Dr. Massey Yeah, you heard us talking about prolactin.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 Dr. Peat Yeah. For several years, surgery was the only thing. I think it was a 300-fold

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 increase in prolactin surgeries in just a few years. It turned out to be the onset of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 the birth control pill that was causing this terrible epidemic of surgery for the pituitary.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 After several years, probably a little over 10 years before doctors really would consider

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.880
 using a drug such as bromocriptine to change the pituitary system, the pituitary system

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.880
 changed the hormones away from the estrogen prolactin effect, so it became a more manageable

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:59.760
 problem when they realized a fairly safe drug could do it.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.880
 That was sort of all there was to it. It was swept under the rug and it had been a purely

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:19.720
 atherogenic problem because of the massive use of estrogen treatments for menopause and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:30.720
 birth control. But then the doctors realized that it was a very, very, very, very, very

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.720
 dangerous drug. The background of the problem started being discussed. People working in

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:52.240
 the salmon industry realized that the natural physiology of salmon and other different species

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 of fish involved some radical changes in prolactin. The shift from high salt intake

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.440
 in the ocean to a very low salt intake, high water intake, turned on the prolactin, which

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.440
 is a water regulator helping to get rid of excess water. The essence of estrogen poisoning

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.680
 is that it causes excess retention and poisoning by water. So the salmon effect on prolactin

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:08.640
 is also the estrogen effect. The fish coming in from the ocean is not only

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.640
 edible for good tasting, safe fish, they're very deteriorated. The flesh becomes mushy

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.520
 and unpleasant. What is happening is if you look at the progress of the salmon going up

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:59.960
 the river as the meat deteriorates, the salmon is preparing to oscillate and die. The fish

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:07.960
 is preparing to oscillate and die. The process of oscillating is part of the process of keeping

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:25.440
 adapted to excess of bone water. The process that keeps the fish alive is the process of

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:33.440
 destroying the bones. The process that keeps the fish from dying is the process of destroying

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:41.280
 the bones. The process that keeps the fish from dying is the process of destroying the

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:49.320
 bones. The process that keeps the fish from dying is the process of destroying the bones.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:57.320
 This involves the parathyroid hormones as well as the whole estrogen reproductive system.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:19.600
 The effect is to cause kyphosis which is the bending of the spine. The salmon doesn't have

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:35.400
 to hold itself in an erect posture the way old people do, but they call it kyphosis,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.360
 whether it's either in salmon or in old women. The upper part of the spine turns sharply

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:52.840
 forward. In the case of women, they talk about it as if it's gravity pulling you forward

00:07:52.840 --> 00:08:03.680
 causing your spine to bend into a hook shape as you form osteoporosis.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:11.680
 But in salmon, the salmon floats at both ends, so there's nothing causing gravity. It's nothing

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:25.200
 but the destruction of the skeleton, the parathyroid hormone, the loss of calcium and fat, and

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 of course the water regulating minerals. The sudden onset of death and the prolactinoma

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:40.200
 petrified the whole aging syndrome in salmon exactly causes the prolactinoma

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.200
 petrified the whole aging syndrome in salmon exactly corresponds to the aging effect associated

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:15.040
 with estrogen and osteoporosis.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:23.040
 So the high omega-3s in salmon, is that tied in with the early aging process or fatty liver

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.160
 and stuff with humans?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:37.160
 Which is why you don't want to eat salmon every day or anything.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.160
 Do you?

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160
 You don't want to eat salmon every day then.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:50.160
 I stopped eating it altogether when I learned about the high PUFA content and the association

00:09:50.160 --> 00:10:00.160
 with high estrogen prolactinoma.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:08.160
 I've been reading, coming across this fellow Ansel Keys from time to time the last month,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:24.880
 I don't know why, it's just been kind of one of those things. Who was this guy and did

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.880
 he put out a lot of misinformation, Ansel Keys, do you know of him? What was his story?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:42.480
 He seemed to be an honest but misinformed biologist.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:48.880
 So he was honest, you think, but misinformed biologist.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.880
 Yeah, he was just inclined in the wrong direction by propaganda, which practically everyone

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.600
 is in biology.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:06.600
 A project of mine for the last few weeks has been in doing my searches, I in effect ask

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.960
 people alternate forms of the different questions, but with the seemingly innocent intent of

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:36.440
 finding out what people believe is the cause of aging and which things cause better oxidation

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:48.840
 and which things cause worse oxidation.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:55.840
 I found that if the PubMed was an individual, but I've also done it with individuals to

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:09.680
 in effect lead the PubMed or the person to the right answer.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:17.680
 Lead them to say something that seems obvious and intuitive to them, but if I innocently

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:31.520
 seem to change the way I ask a question, what is the factor that causes the aging, you can

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.280
 lead people very easily, even if it seems to be the objective database.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:55.680
 You can lead PubMed responses to be predominantly incriminating fat in aging or predominantly

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:06.600
 incriminating sugars and carbohydrates in aging.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:13.600
 Wow, it just depends where the motives or the preconceived notion of the person doing

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.520
 this.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:23.520
 Yeah, I did the same thing for the oxidation in general as well as for aging.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:43.280
 You can lead what seems to be the objective result of looking at hundreds and hundreds

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:59.880
 of responses when you get a very hyper person shifting your responses.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.720
 What is the cause of age, oxidation, deterioration?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:19.640
 You can say it's caused by fat or by carbohydrates.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:26.640
 It all comes right up to the same database.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:33.880
 If you look at it without suspicion, just because you're a scientist, you can't tell

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:40.880
 because you innocently were focused for some reason on fat eating or sugar eating.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:53.920
 It can lead you innocently to an 180 degree direction of error.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:03.520
 So it's talked about that he was actually working for some sugar companies at one point

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:11.440
 and was trying to make the case that sugar was okay?

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:20.200
 When was he, back in the '70s and '80s?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:30.160
 There has been a change in the time drift of answers.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.680
 So when you see the change over time, it's gotten more from blaming things on sugars

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:49.640
 to more blaming them on oxidation.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:56.640
 That can give you the opinion that it's objective and historical.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:05.760
 When I looked at just the issue of immunity, what are the things that cause immune system

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:24.120
 failure or activation?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:31.120
 The same thing happened in the 1990s with a series of absolute looking articles, especially

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:49.680
 the Science magazine, the very top prestige magazines, were blaming it on sugar.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:57.680
 They were blaming immunological changes in insulin and roundworms had been identified

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:26.440
 as causing aging by mutating the quality of their diabetes molecules.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:43.480
 They were producing too much, too active insulin.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:54.640
 So insulin, back in 1998 to 2000, the great stress was suddenly discovering that high

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:07.200
 insulin or high glucose would cause rapid aging, premature death.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:22.400
 But then, just in 20 years, the different way of asking questions is diabetes the cause

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:38.240
 or is it preventing?

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:46.240
 It turns out that the failure of good glucose function, good insulin response, is the preferred

00:18:46.240 --> 00:19:07.760
 apparently objective answer.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:15.760
 But most of these different studies, if you talk about carbs and fat or meat or whatever,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:23.000
 most of them are all, I don't know what the term is Dr. Peat, they're just asking questions

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.520
 of people and they fill out forms mostly.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.520
 They can be other than totally accurate, correct?

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:38.520
 They're just asking questions.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:45.520
 The culture, the simple advertising publications in medical journals and television, huge influence

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:58.240
 of television on what to expect from the pituitary tumors, the liver, the heart, the lungs, the

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:06.240
 pituitary tumors or carbohydrate or not enough insulin or too much insulin.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:17.280
 We were talking about it earlier because I've been playing around with my diet.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:24.280
 In general, is it overall better, medium, or does it matter of your fasting blood sugar

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.760
 being lower?

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:34.760
 Is that preferable to be 60 rather than 90?

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:43.240
 Your insulin is working and providing ATP for your cells.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:53.680
 The drift of thinking now is very well-objective.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:01.680
 It's well-objectively supported to show that it's the ATP provided to the tissues that

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.280
 prevents aging.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.480
 ATP to the tissues.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:17.480
 And what provides ATP more directly to the tissues than glucose?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:25.640
 And so glucose, ATP, anti-aging is now very clearly a matter of simple availability of

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:36.600
 energy.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.600
 Energy has always been the life factor and that has slipped by people.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:52.440
 And how does that relate to insulin and blood sugar levels?

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:59.440
 When you're failing to make good insulin or you're producing or eating too much fat, so

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:12.040
 the fat is blocking your insulin, then you have accelerated aging.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:21.800
 So it can be genetic distortion of the insulin or it can be just too much fat in the diet,

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:38.760
 called causing insulin resistance.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:45.760
 Insulin is resisting because?

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:52.760
 Your insulin is resisting getting into the cells?

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:59.760
 Yeah, they each are blocking the ability of the cell to oxidize glucose directly to get

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.960
 at the ATP.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.960
 Got it.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.960
 Here's an email for you.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:18.960
 Does PUFA inhibit thyroid hormone because the body actually wants to lower the body

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:25.960
 temperature to help prevent the PUFA from becoming oxidized or rancid?

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:32.960
 Or is it more directly inhibiting thyroid hormone?

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.960
 Layers and layers. So what's PUFA doing?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:44.960
 Well, it's activating estrogen effects, serotonin effects, lowering body temperature, interfering

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:54.840
 with thyroid function.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.840
 All of the above?

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:03.840
 And more, all the different enzymes you could involve.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:15.800
 So that's just many reasons why they're just not good for us, right? Many reasons.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:23.080
 Can Dr. Peat explain what natural remedies can dissolve or remove?

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:30.080
 I'll spell this for you, Doc.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:37.080
 ARCUSCENILIS, which is a thick, bluish white ring that can develop around the iris that

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:42.080
 are often called cholesterol rings or calcium rings.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:49.080
 In iridology, why would these rings develop in the eyes of people who are in their 20s?

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920
 Cholesterol rings, do you know from those?

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.200
 Who was saying that?

00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:03.200
 This person evidently has these rings, the ARCUSCENILIS, and they're bluish white rings

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:11.200
 that developed around the iris. Are you familiar with those?

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.200
 That involves calcification.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.200
 Calcification.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:22.200
 As well as fat, and not just pure cholesterol.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:34.200
 In tissues like that, the cholesterol is partly a protective attempt to defend the system.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:47.200
 In the blood vessels, it's very clear that the first reactions of the cholesterol are

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:57.200
 to combine with the toxic effect of the PUFA that's already taking effect.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:07.200
 When it fails to be sufficiently antitoxic, then it gets the blame.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:24.200
 But really, it's the age pigment development of the lipoflavin-accumulated PUFA that causes

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.200
 the problem.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:40.200
 And in the brain, the senile brain has much more total cholesterol than the healthy young

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.200
 brain.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:58.200
 In the situation very close to the senile artery, the detoxifying effect of the insulin,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:10.200
 the binding of cholesterol to the age pigment, as that fails, you get more cholesterol in

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.200
 the blood vessels.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:24.200
 As it fails to protect your brain, your brain gets close to twice as much accumulated total

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:30.200
 progesterone as the non-senile young brain.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:46.200
 But the amount of free, protective, interactive insulin, which is in the process of removing

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:58.200
 the toxic pigment as the senile brain loads up on more total cholesterol, the amount of

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.200
 functional free cholesterol decreases radically.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:19.200
 So a senile brain full of cholesterol is really a way of talking about a brain whose detoxifying

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:31.200
 system has failed tremendously to the point that it has accumulated undermining quantities

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:44.200
 of polyunsaturated fat, and in the process has knocked out the protective function of

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.200
 the cholesterol.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:50.200
 Dr. Daniel J. Greenberg, MD, PhD

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:57.200
 Life Extension promotes the drug metformin as an anti-aging drug with many health benefits.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200
 What is your opinion of their recommendation?

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:29.200
 Metformin is possibly doing something good by blocking apparently good functions.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:43.200
 But the basic mechanism is blocking what you would

00:29:43.200 --> 00:30:01.200
 think is a protective progesterone use, but still the effect is to protect against PUFA

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:07.200
 just as much as against cholesterol.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:13.200
 So that's the anti-aging potential benefits protecting against PUFA?

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:26.200
 Yeah, by wasting cholesterol it seems to also take down cholesterol.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.200
 I see.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:34.200
 And we don't necessarily need to do that or want to take down cholesterol, do we?

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:54.200
 No, but everything about metformin seems sort of surprising and perverse because it's one

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:06.200
 of the original anti-diabetic drugs that always impaired the mitochondria and ended up increasing

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:13.200
 lactic acid and killing people more than protecting them.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:30.200
 So they found one of these diabetes drugs that turned out not to be more deadly than

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:51.200
 the disease.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.200
 So the average benefit seems to be good.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.200
 Here's from Robert.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:05.200
 If fasting or a low-carb diet is not good for our health, how is it possible that many

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:14.200
 people who practice low-carb diets and fasting lived maybe to a very old age in good health?

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:23.200
 For example, Dr. Wolfgang Lutz, who lived to 97 in very good health on a low-carb diet.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:41.200
 I think the thing to pay most attention to are the statistical effects, how often it

00:32:41.200 --> 00:33:04.200
 is beneficial for many people a low-carb diet leads to depressed metabolism.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.200
 Lower thyroid function.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.200
 I see.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.200
 Here's an email for you, Dr. Peat.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:25.200
 This person has been diagnosed with carcinomic liver cancer and she's doing everything

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.200
 she knows how to help it.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:35.200
 Do you have any suggestions for helping cells that seem to be growing this mass beyond its

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.200
 borders?

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:43.200
 She says, "I have constant diarrhea, so nourishment leaves quickly without becoming

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.200
 absorbed.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.200
 Apparently, it's a side effect of the carcinoma.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:53.200
 Nothing I've tried has curbed the diarrhea except for some natural supplements that then

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.200
 cause constipation.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.200
 I have Progest-E and take it often during the day.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.200
 I will buy more and take as much as you think I need."

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:08.200
 So, would this be a good thing for her to be taking Progest-E with this carcinoma going

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.200
 on and how much?

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:15.200
 And do you have some ideas about the carcinomic liver cancer?

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:37.200
 The effects, I think it should be a matter of symptom relief.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:54.200
 Everything else being similar, if you can control the diarrhea and constipation, the

00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:09.200
 total effects of this progesterone is going to be anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:25.200
 The overall effect is causing diarrhea or constipation.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.200
 What are some other things she could do for this liver cancer?

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200
 Any ideas?

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:45.200
 Oh, have you heard about the several studies in China in which they were using, well, two

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.200
 different drugs, but ciprohepsidine.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.200
 Oh, ciprohepsidine, I know that one.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:36:02.200
 Yeah, in just two or three weeks they caused an end to metastatic liver cancer.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.200
 Really, ciprohepidine.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.200
 Didn't you tell me about that years ago?

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:11.200
 I think I even have some for histamine.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.200
 Is that the same thing?

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.200
 The lower histamine levels?

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.200
 Both anti-histamines and anti-serotonin.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.200
 Wow.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:30.200
 The drugs are protective against cancer in general, but just two or three or four weeks

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:36.200
 and metastatic, several cases were cleared up right away.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200
 No kidding.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200
 Wow, that's interesting.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:44.200
 They're doing that mainly in the Orient, using that in the Orient?

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.200
 Yeah.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:58.200
 And some other surprising systemic results come from using other anti-inflammatories,

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:07.200
 such as local anesthetics, lidocaine for example.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:12.200
 So it's an inflammatory thing, this cancer?

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.200
 Yeah.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.200
 Hi, Patrick and Dr. Peat.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:23.200
 I have psoriasis on the nape of my neck and started applying some Progest-Ease to it,

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.200
 which has helped tremendously.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.200
 Wow.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.200
 63 in age.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.200
 Is there anything else I can do?

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:38.200
 I have a friend who's had breast cancer, surgery on the lump, and then radiation,

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:46.200
 which he finished, could she use Progest-Ease as well?

00:37:46.200 --> 00:38:03.200
 I think Progesterone is the most basic anti-cancer agent for Progesterone-related cancers.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:22.700
 And originally, everyone wanted to find the Progesterone receptor, what is really causing

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.800
 the action of Progesterone.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:36.660
 But they couldn't find that in most tissues, or they couldn't identify what it might really

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.960
 be doing.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:51.560
 But they stopped assuming there should be specific Progesterone receptors for every

00:38:51.560 --> 00:39:04.080
 function because empirically, they saw that Progesterone had general functions that always

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:11.560
 seemed to be in the same line, always protective, always anti-inflammatory.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:18.640
 And finally, it occurred to someone, maybe they're looking for the wrong thing in the

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:29.440
 case of Progesterone, how can it have two or three different receptors supposedly having

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:44.880
 different actions if they're all going to act in the same direction?

00:39:44.880 --> 00:40:00.840
 And so when they stopped looking for a specific pair of actions that never showed up, they

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:09.640
 saw that there was a generalized action.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:16.960
 Without exception, cells became responsive to Progesterone.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:29.400
 So they had been creating an illusion that there was this mysterious, why did both kinds

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:44.840
 of Progesterone have similar functions, and it turns out that when you look for it, it's

00:40:44.840 --> 00:41:06.960
 the mitochondrial melanin-sensitive so-called Progesterone receptor, but it's really the

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:18.240
 energy producing property of the mitochondrial substance, the mitochondrial Progesterone

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:25.040
 receptor is in effect the mitochondrion function itself.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.560
 Okay, fair enough.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.560
 Dr. Peat, stay right there.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.160
 We're going to do a couple of commercials and we'll be right back.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.280
 We talk about products here.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:40.360
 We support ourselves financially on One Radio Network.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:48.480
 We have a wonderful line of products that we've been, you know, some of these products,

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:55.480
 we've known these people for, I don't know, 13, 14 years, Daniel Italis and some of the

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.840
 other things, the sulfur and some of the other people.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:05.680
 If you are looking for some things to help you stay happy and snappy and stick around

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.800
 a long time without going to the hospital, which is what we try to help you do around

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.480
 here, is go to our website.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.480
 It is oneradionetwork.com.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:21.760
 You go in the store, look on the front page, and you'll see all the different people that

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.680
 we promote.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.060
 We think it's a great lineup of folks.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.060
 We know it is.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:34.200
 We use everything ourselves, taking all these things, continue to take most everything all

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:42.680
 the time, the saunas and the sulfur and the perlcium and blue shield and everything.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.160
 We just use them all and we think you'll like it.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.160
 We think you'll like these products.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:54.640
 They're all very well done and not just, you know, I don't think you're going to be wasting

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.640
 it.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.640
 I know you'll be happy.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.320
 You're not going to waste your money on any of the things that we promote.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:05.960
 We wouldn't be promoting them, continuing for this many years if people weren't having

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.720
 a good experience with them.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.060
 Here's a little thing on the sulfur.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:11.060
 We like the sulfur.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.320
 I put it in my water every day.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.280
 I use a tablespoon twice a day.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:22.080
 I think it's a very nice product to take, something that you can take every day without

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.520
 getting messed up, which is unusual.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520
 Here's a little bit on that.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.880
 Dr. Patrick Flanagan has been regarded as one of the most important scientists in the

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.560
 last 50 years.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.520
 We talked to him about sulfur.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:45.200
 There's a product called organic sulfur and organic sulfur was put into trade in 1865

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.320
 as organic sulfur.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:54.440
 Some people call it MSM or methyl sulfonylmethane, but most of the MSM in health food stores

00:43:54.440 --> 00:44:01.080
 have been contaminated with a kind of silica that prevents its absorption by the body.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:09.640
 But anyway, what happens is that if you take a tablespoon of MSM and the organic sulfur

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:19.320
 in hot water in the morning and a tablespoon in the afternoon, it sulfates 192 different

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:24.480
 compounds, heavy metals from the periodic table.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.880
 And once it sulfates them, I'm talking about radioactive elements and other things, once

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:39.160
 it sulfates them, these sulfates cannot stay in the human body for more than 12 hours.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.680
 And what Dr. Flanagan just mentioned is one of the key reasons why our sulfur is different

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:49.200
 from most out there, Amazon, no matter where you go, because it's pure.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.520
 Click and order, front page, oneradionetwork.com.

 Click and order, oneradionetwork.com.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800
 That's pretty cool, huh?

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:15.200
 Think about all the things that get sulfated and then they move out of the body.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:21.000
 I've had a good experience with it forever and I'm very blessed with good health, so

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 knock on wood.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.960
 So I think you'll like it.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.760
 It's very affordable.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760
 It's pure.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760
 It works.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.800
 I think it's worth taking every day.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.240
 Just keep on doing it, baby.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.120
 And we have a good one.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.400
 No additives here, excipients or anything like that.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.800
 Pure organic sulfur from oneradionetwork.com.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.800
 And if you'd like to grow big and strong, here's a good thing to try.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.840
 Have you ever wondered why elk velvet antler could be good for you?

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.160
 So every year they shed it and then in the spring they begin growing a new rack in these

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.160
 set of antlers.

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.720
 For three months they grow it.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.720
 Three months?

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.360
 Think about the biggest moose rack you've ever seen, the biggest elk rack or deer rack

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360
 you've ever seen.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360
 That's three months of growth.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.360
 That's amazing.

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.880
 So what you have is this organ that starts off as nothing and grows within three months

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:13.080
 to be an organ that's covered in skin, hair, veins, arteries, nerves.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.240
 It's totally innervated.

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.200
 It's got bone and osteous tissue and bone marrow.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.960
 It's essentially a limb.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.600
 It requires special molecules like growth factors to accelerate the growth of it.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.280
 And so there's growth factors in there that grow all the types of tissue that are found

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.280
 on it.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.320
 Bone, bone marrow, nerves, skin, blood.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.120
 All of that is being grown by these growth factors.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.560
 And you can put that into your own blood and help yourself regenerate tissue.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.960
 Well, that's why we use it around here.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.240
 You can click and order Elk Velvet Antler from Daniel Bytalis Sir Thrivill and he's

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.360
 Sir Thrivill Link right here on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.360
 And he's Sir Thrivill Link.

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.280
 That's our fave.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:05.080
 If you'd like to learn more about the really systemic benefits of getting your own little

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:11.800
 infrared sauna in your home, you can go to OneRadio Network, click on the sauna, the

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:19.200
 little ad on the sauna, and see a video with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:23.680
 And she's really an infrared sauna monster.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.680
 She loves them.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:29.720
 But she's looked deeply into some of the benefits and some of the other docs we've

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:38.040
 had on, talked about them as well, of the heart and the whole thing going on with the

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:45.280
 heart and saunas and the benefits, the whole system.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.280
 Really cool.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.480
 And it turns out, according to Dr. Patrick, that on this video you'll see, it's a new

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:59.360
 one, that the more you do it, the more benefits can be calculated and proven for the whole

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.640
 heart system and the veins and arteries and everything.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.480
 Saunas.

00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:10.160
 So don't just think about saunas as being a detoxification thing, but also for a really

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.280
 good systemic workout for your body.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:17.320
 Your body almost thinks like it's exercising.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.960
 I don't exercise all that much.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:26.120
 I rebound every day and walk and do a few weights, but I'm pretty limited.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:33.880
 And I'm in good shape here with working on 76, 77, I don't even know anymore, years

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.880
 in this body.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:36.280
 So, I think they're good.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:41.160
 I've used it every day for probably 10 years.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.720
 You can see a picture of it here.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.440
 I'll show you a picture.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:46.980
 So it's a personal one.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:53.640
 You can see here if you're on video that you sit in it, your head is out.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.920
 And I've never used those little slots, I don't read, but you can do that if you

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.920
 want.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.200
 And it's cool.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.520
 And boy, you'll sweat.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.200
 So you get far-infrared health.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.560
 And I think you could do this every day.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.800
 I'm going to do it as long as I'm here.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.720
 And it's just good for you.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720
 You can tell.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.520
 You can feel it.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:17.000
 Just the way the body just likes to sweat.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 Just does.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 Just does.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.920
 The Relaxed Far-Infrared Sauna.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:29.320
 The only way to get this value and the sale price that we offer is to email me.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:35.320
 And that's patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.240
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:43.720
 Just email me and I'll hook you up for the best price regardless of where you live.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:48.360
 And tell me where you live when you email me and I'll give you the best price we can.

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.800
 And you're not going to get a better price anywhere.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.800
 Guaranteed.

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.800
 No way.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800
 No way, Jose.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.640
 Just not going to.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.200
 So don't fall for look-alikes, too.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.120
 You'll see saunas on Amazon and other places that look just like this and they sell them

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.440
 for $700 or $800.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.600
 Ours is $1,295 delivered.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.600
 And they're not the same thing.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.000
 They're just, who knows what's in there.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:20.160
 These are saunas that have won several awards for their technique, their technology.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.680
 And they're made in a medical university in Taiwan.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:27.160
 And as long as China doesn't take them over, I guess we'll keep having them.

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.680
 I don't even want to think about that one.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.320
 So just email me and we'll get it done.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.320
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:41.960
 From the hill country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.080
 Talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.080
 He's a PhD.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.560
 He's been at this for a very, very long time.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.360
 It's drPeat.com.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.000
 And you can do his newsletter, which is, I'm sorry, rayPeat.com.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.400
 Sorry, rayPeat.com.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:06.800
 His newsletter is Ray Peat's Newsletter, plural, at gmail.com.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.960
 And you can sign up for that.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.880
 Dr. Peat, thanks for coming on the show each month.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.480
 Here's an email for you.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:21.320
 My wife is in her 60s and she's recovering from Lyme disease and has chronic upper body

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.800
 pain, constant sore muscles.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:31.960
 Her biceps are very weak and her hand and foot tendons continue to be super tight and

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.960
 injure very easily.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:48.080
 I'm wondering what you can give us some ideas on what she could do.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.440
 So she's recovering from Lyme and lots of upper body pain.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:52:06.080
 Oh, all of the anti-inflammatory things, especially the antihistamines, anti-serotonin drugs,

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:17.640
 the vitamin D as a general anti-inflammatory, pro-energy, progesterone and thyroid to get

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:22.520
 your energy back up and working.

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:27.480
 So she has to get her metabolism and everything back up and working after that.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:43.000
 There's a constant opposition between the availability of energy as ATP derived from

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:50.560
 glucose and all of the anti-inflammatory constructive functions.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:55.800
 So it's energy versus inflammation.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.360
 Energy versus inflammation.

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.360
 Yeah.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.360
 Yeah.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:05.120
 That drug for the antihistamine, that could be possibly tried to do that?

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.560
 What was the name of that one you mentioned?

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:13.440
 The antihistamine medicine?

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.320
 Yeah.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:31.160
 If I remember to take it, I would stop having the allergic voice symptoms.

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:39.920
 After an episode of allergy, I have to remember to take my ciprohepidine.

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.160
 Ciprohepidine, yeah, that's the one.

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:45.120
 So do you take that sometimes?

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.160
 You can tell when you don't take it?

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.800
 Oh, sure.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:54:03.600
 The irritation, the tendency to cough, is just tremendous without it.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:10.080
 But it's the surest way to stop background inflammation.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.080
 Background inflammation.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080
 Ciprohepidine.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:18.480
 I think when I bought it for the antihistamine thing I was getting, histamine, two years

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:24.320
 ago, I think I got it on the Mexican or Canadian pharmacy or something.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.880
 If I remember, you could get that online.

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.880
 And you said it was safe, right?

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.320
 It was just little bitty pills?

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.320
 Yeah.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:40.000
 For a while, you couldn't get it from Mexico because it was liquid.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:48.680
 But sometimes you get it through and it's always available as a four milligram tablet.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:50.960
 Yeah, it's a little bitty thing, yeah.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.960
 I took it for a little bit.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.960
 It seemed to help me.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.960
 I was sneezing a lot.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:55:03.320
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat on strategies to lower the adrenal response to T3?

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:07.400
 Lower the adrenal response to T3.

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:20.040
 Oh, if you keep your blood sugar steady, there's no problem.

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:27.800
 You'll have an adequate response, but not too much.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:35.480
 What should the blood sugar do three or four hours after eating, either carbs or protein?

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:42.040
 Is there a kind of a metric that you go by to see if everything is functioning properly?

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:46.840
 Not for everyone.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:56:05.120
 It can be fine at 80 milligrams per cent, or it's often fine for a while at 150 milligrams

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.920
 per cent, right after eating.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.880
 A percent increase, right?

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.800
 No, an absolute number of 150.

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.640
 Oh, I see.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.640
 That's an absolute number.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:29.240
 And then it should just normally go back to your main line, whatever that is, 70, 80,

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.240
 90.

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.240
 Yeah.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.240
 Okay.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.240
 Here's Richard.

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.400
 He said he's a senior with blood sugar 200.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:36.400
 Wow.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.920
 Eat good food, bike and stay active.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:48.240
 I'm trying your milk on orange juice regimen, but sugar is still high.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.360
 What can I do?

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.680
 He wants to know what he can get this down to naturally.

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:58.280
 Would leaving a red light in the bedroom overnight help reduce inflammation and cortisol?

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.040
 So he's got two questions.

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.440
 So blood sugar is pretty high, 200, right?

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.600
 That's more higher than we want, right?

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:06.600
 Yeah.

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:14.480
 And thyroid is often the problem.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:15.480
 Low thyroid.

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.480
 Yeah.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:28.680
 You should be able to get below 100 if you have residual good functioning thyroid.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.560
 Thyroid, right.

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:41.120
 So he should check his thyroid and your best number, if I recall, the TSH wants to be .5

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.120
 or below, correct?

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.400
 Yes.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.840
 Preferably well below that.

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.000
 Even well below.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.920
 I mean as low as you can.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.000
 Like almost zero if you've got a TSH of almost zero.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:11.480
 Yeah, I haven't found any satisfying idea of an essential function of TSH as far as

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.000
 I can tell it's all pro-inflammatory.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 It's pro-inflammatory.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 Wow.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 That's crazy.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 So his second question, he wants to know if leaving a red light in the bedroom overnight

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.120
 can reduce inflammation and cortisol.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:30.640
 Yeah.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:33.160
 Does it?

00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:40.800
 It doesn't always work, but very often it's helpful.

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:47.640
 But often it will work, just reducing cortisol just to red light.

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.680
 Mm-hmm.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.600
 Here's Harish.

00:58:53.600 --> 00:59:01.920
 Hypothetically, what would Dr. Peat do for, I don't know, I'm going to have to spell this,

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.760
 Dr. Peat.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:06.080
 CARCINOID syndrome.

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:10.040
 Is that familiar?

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.200
 Carcinoid syndrome.

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.480
 Say it again.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.360
 CARCINOID syndrome.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.360
 Carcinoid syndrome.

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.680
 Carcinoid?

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:26.680
 Yeah, carcinoid.

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.680
 Yeah.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:36.640
 Yeah, that's a small, not too dangerous tumor that produces serotonin.

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:42.520
 It can be very dangerous.

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:55.640
 It can make a person completely non-functional, can cause tumors in places that destroy your

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.640
 functions.

00:59:56.640 --> 01:00:09.280
 But generally, it's a syndrome of very high serotonin action.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:21.080
 And the whole pattern leading to serotonin excess should be taken care of.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:31.960
 More thyroid, more anti-estrogen consideration, progesterone and so on.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.840
 We ran a video of a doctor this morning.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:42.640
 He was addressing the idea that people think that, pretty interesting video, that people

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:47.520
 think that meat putrefies in your gut, in your colon and all that.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.360
 And he showed all kinds of things and people in colostomy bags.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.840
 And he said, "That's not the case."

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:05.080
 And he talked to a lady, you know, these colostomy bags they put on people, sometimes, who has

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.880
 worked for thousands, these bags, filled them and emptied them and everything.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:17.880
 And she said she found, not meat in there, but she found things like nuts and corn and

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.880
 oats in these colostomy bags.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.000
 What's that?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.480
 I didn't get the last phrase you said.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:42.680
 Oh, you know colostomy bags they put on people sometimes, right, in their intestines.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.600
 I guess it's in their small, I don't know, or even large.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:56.440
 But she found nuts and corn that never digested, and some oats as well, oftentimes, in these

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.520
 bags, these masti bags, or whatever they're called.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:04.360
 How do you explain that?

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:10.680
 Nuts are hard, I guess, to digest, huh?

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:14.920
 Dr. Peat, this is Rich.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:22.480
 Do you have any solutions for heavy metal toxicities or glyphosate toxicity?

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.480
 Glyphosate or heavy metals?

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:41.520
 Yeah, I think Stephanie Seneff has written a lot about the glyphosate, but it's mostly

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:44.960
 to be cautious.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:03:00.600
 She hasn't proved exactly what's going on, but I think it's an analogous process to endotoxin

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:20.080
 poisoning, and estrogen, glyphosate is a watering disruptor of the anti-estrogen, anti-endotoxin

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.480
 processes.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:30.920
 She's often talked about, too, how it really tangles up the whole sulfur cycle as well,

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:35.800
 which inhibits people to get toxins out of the body.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800
 Interesting.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:42.920
 And they've done some blood tests on lots of people, even people who eat organically,

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.200
 and they seem, these glyphosates are getting around, aren't they?

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.480
 I mean, it seems like they're everywhere.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.800
 Okay, here's somebody that's taking levothyroxine.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:59.200
 Do you know that one, Dr. Peat?

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.720
 Levothyroxine, and was diagnosed with Hashimoto's.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:09.480
 I do some experimentation at times to try to help myself.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:17.960
 I began taking a product for thyroid support, and he was taking this thyroid support with

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:33.520
 a blend of hydroxycortisol, acetate, and Guglielusterone extract, iodine, and selenium, and the results

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.240
 of taking this supplement have been surprising.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.520
 I've been able to cut my levothyroxine dosage in half.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.880
 My heart palpitations have significantly diminished.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.480
 No more loose stools.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.880
 Could you possibly tell me what could be going on?

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.240
 The MDs don't have a clue.

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.240
 Wow.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:05:03.000
 Yeah, well, MDs invented the problem many years ago.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.920
 Levothyroxine is simply not the thyroid hormone.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:23.000
 It's a drug alternative that doctors unthinkingly are kind of forced to prescribe.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:34.120
 They can actually lose their license if they question the appropriateness of levothyroxine

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:47.120
 or even the propriety of questioning the proper level of TSH.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:06:00.680
 Levothyroxine is pretty good at lowering TSH, but it doesn't necessarily have all of the

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.240
 thyroid or thyroid defects.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:19.080
 So you can lower your TSH with it and get some benefit, but just lowering the TSH might

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:26.800
 not be enough to get the benefits you actually need.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:40.960
 The ability to convert the T4 levothyroxine to convert it into the active T3 as well as

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.120
 to lower the TSH.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:51.560
 So she might be on the right track with lowering her dosage of the levothyroxine.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:07:00.040
 Yeah, you really should look at every time you have a test, you should check to see that

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:15.480
 your TSH is appropriate for the level of levothyroxine.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:22.640
 What would be the best healing protocol procedure for a person who is a 47-year-old recovering

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:31.800
 alcoholic, popaholic, smoker with a colostomy bag, wow, since 24, now in a hospital with

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.800
 heart and liver issues.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.880
 Wow, they've got a lot going on here.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:42.760
 Anything they could do for somebody in a hospital with that going on?

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.320
 For what purpose?

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:52.840
 Just as recovering alcoholic and drinking a lot of sugar and smoking and want to get

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.720
 some advice to help this person.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.080
 It's a tough one, huh?

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:04.360
 It could be that they would run into good advice in the hospital.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:12.360
 Dr. Peat, a few months ago my dog killed a squirrel and I think it made him sick.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.800
 The next three days he wouldn't eat and was having thick black sludge, diarrhea.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:23.280
 He also insisted on staying outside in 20 Fahrenheit weather where he could hide in

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.720
 a bush.

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.240
 Since then he mostly has diarrhea.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:29.160
 Once or twice a week he won't eat the whole day.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.840
 Do you have any idea what could be wrong?

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840
 What could I do?

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.880
 Boy, that squirrel must have been nasty, huh?

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.640
 What does he think, constant?

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:53.080
 The dog killed a squirrel and that's when all this started.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:09:03.360
 I don't know how that would work but I should check if he had a change in bowel function.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.120
 He might have been exposed to microbes.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.320
 Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.800
 He says that the dog had this diarrhea once or twice a week and he wouldn't eat for a

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:18.800
 while.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.120
 So this squirrel was full of something, right?

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.120
 That he just was not happy.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.160
 Yeah, I'm not a vet but to this person I would say put him on raw meat.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:34.040
 I think that's your best choice for carnivore dogs, I think.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.640
 I think that's the best way to go.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.520
 He's probably going to find his way out of that one.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:41.520
 Here's an email.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:47.920
 Can thyroid hormone help with a metastasized cancer?

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.120
 Thyroid hormone help with a metastasized cancer?

01:09:53.120 --> 01:10:04.640
 Yeah, it sometimes brings back your balance between estrogens and anti-inflammatory.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:19.080
 Keeping in mind all of the anti-inflammatory things is important.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:31.440
 I've been looking more at oxalates, writes Brenda, and she wants to know if milk or butter

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:38.440
 helps with lowering the oxalate intake with potatoes and black tea.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.440
 Oxalates?

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:53.440
 No, they can contribute to kidney stones.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440
 Yes.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:11:05.000
 She's asking if the milk and the black tea or the green tea or the butter with the potatoes

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:11.440
 helps to diminish how many oxalates we ingest is what her question is.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:18.800
 No, I don't think it has much effect.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.320
 You're going to get them either way, huh?

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.400
 Do you think the oxalates in a baked potato are worth avoiding baked potatoes?

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:40.320
 No, I think it takes a diet fairly high and consistent to see any effects.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:48.320
 So you'd have to eat a whole bunch of them to have some oxalate issues, you say?

01:11:48.320 --> 01:12:04.920
 Yes, the sort of astringent leaves and potatoes are in total, I think, worth it.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:12.480
 I think one of the highest ones in oxalates, I used to know, chard.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:15.320
 Chard's really high, and spinach, right?

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:20.320
 Oh, yeah, but occasional.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.320
 Chard is so tasty.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.320
 It's pretty good, yeah.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:36.320
 What's the minimum milligrams of calcium needed to prevent osteoporosis in a sedentary

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.320
 people in their 70s and 80s?

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:49.320
 So we have a 70 or 80-year-old, and the minimum milligrams of calcium to prevent osteoporosis.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:13:01.320
 It depends on the balance between vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcium, and magnesium.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:08.320
 But really, it should be at least a thousand milligrams.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:16.320
 Generally about a thousand, and that's pretty easy to get with food, right?

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:27.320
 Yeah, milk and cheese and some vegetables.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:31.320
 Here somebody said they're confused about using baking soda for cancer.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.320
 I heard Dr. Peat mention in one of your shows that it would take one and a half or 40 grams

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.320
 a day, but I'm not sure how to take it.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.320
 There are many suggestions on the net using maple syrup, too.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.320
 It's not clear what's the best way to take baking soda.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:14:03.320
 Yeah, seeing what you need really had some effects, but his silly talk about that showing

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:09.320
 that cancer was a fungus just didn't make sense.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:23.320
 But in fact, there's a very powerful, very widespread effect of both carbon dioxide and

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:32.320
 baking soda on suppressing cancer development.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320
 Carbon dioxide, too.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:40.320
 Have you used the carbon dioxide that I sent you, that little thing that you could put

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.320
 around your body?

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.320
 I'm going to try it.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:54.320
 Yeah, sitting in a bathtub with the drain taped up or just in a big plastic bag.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.320
 Sure.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.320
 Yeah, I haven't got mine yet.

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:06.320
 I've been looking at it, and it appears, Doc, that you can buy a tank that's aluminum, so

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.320
 it's not so heavy to carry after you fill that baby up.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.320
 You had suggested to get a, did you tell me a 2K or 20K, 10K?

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:24.320
 I think the ones I use are only 10 kilograms.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320
 10 kilograms.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:30.320
 And would that last for a while if you fill that baby up with CO2?

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.320
 Yeah, just an occasional bathtub.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:38.320
 I forget how many you get, but something like seven or eight.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.320
 Oh, that'd be good, yeah, and then get it filled up again.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.320
 So I'm going to try.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.320
 Have you done that recently?

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.320
 Have you done it, used a carbon dioxide bathtub thing?

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.320
 Yeah, I've done it twice in the last two days.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.320
 Oh, been doing it more often.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.320
 I'm going to try it.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.320
 I'll let you know.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.320
 Well, Dr. Peat, we got through all the emails.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:03.320
 Thanks for coming on the show.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320
 You take care of yourself.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:11.320
 Drink your milk, orange juice, and you can do raypeat.com and look at his website.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.320
 Okay.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.320
 Thanks, Doc.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.320
 You take care, okay?

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.320
 Thank you.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.320
 Thank you, sir.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.320
 Bye-bye.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.320
 Dr. Ray Peat, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.320
 What a nice man, huh?

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.320
 Yep.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:32.320
 Yeah, I've been looking at that, and you can actually find a tank, aluminum.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.320
 I'm going to get a 10K tank, and they have a place.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.320
 I sent Dr. Peat.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.320
 I'll send you one, too.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.320
 I think it was like 50 bucks, and you get this.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:50.320
 It's like a body bag thing, and you put it up to here, and you just put the CO2 in there,

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:55.320
 and then, and this hangs out in CO2, and it's really good for you.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.320
 So we're going to do that.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.320
 I'll let you know.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:03.320
 And then we're always experimenting with stuff.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320
 We're going to have a fun show tomorrow.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:08.320
 We have two people.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:14.320
 Brandon Smith, and he's been looking into an organization.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.320
 You're going to love this one.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:21.320
 This one is run by the Rothschilds.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.320
 So you know this is going to be good.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.320
 The Rothschilds, it's called Inclusive Capitalism.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:33.320
 These are the people, and also a lot of the bankers and all the boys are in on this inclusive capitalism,

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:38.320
 and they are the ones that do the legwork for Klaus Schwab.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.320
 They're the think tank.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.320
 The Klaus Schwab people, right, in the World Economic Forum, the crazies,

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:51.320
 and then the inclusive capitalism people, they're the ones out there working with all,

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.320
 you know, paying off senators.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.320
 It's crazy.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:59.320
 We're going to play a video, and this is what they have in trying to push on us next.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.320
 So this is fun.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.320
 That'll be tomorrow, and then tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock central,

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:13.320
 Moses West, he's out of San Antonio and Austin, and he's building machines,

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.320
 and I don't know how much they cost or anything.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.320
 We'll find it all out tomorrow, but I've seen them, the videos.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.320
 It's amazing, and they're just taking water out of the air.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.320
 There's humidity.

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.320
 There's water everywhere, and I've seen it.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.320
 He's got a huge machine, pretty big one, like two refrigerators big,

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:40.320
 and it just dumps water out like a faucet like this, and it just keeps going.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:44.320
 It just keeps going.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.320
 I want one.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.320
 It's just distilled water.

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.320
 So we're going to talk to him.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.320
 He created this thing, and then I'm going to be here, Adam Bergstrom, on Wednesday,

01:18:53.320 --> 01:19:01.320
 Adam 2.0, he's on the third Wednesday, and then we have somebody else on Wednesday as well.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:07.320
 Oh, Matthew Errett, who's looking into what China and Russia are up to,

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.320
 and they're doing more than playing cards tonight together, baby.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.320
 So we may need to learn Mandarin or Russian if things keep going the way they are.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.320
 So I love you all very much.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:25.320
 I will see you tomorrow, and we'll talk about making water in your backyard,

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320
 and take care.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320
 Love you.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.320
