 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our show, they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject of carbon monoxide

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 and other related entities surrounding the interactions of carbon monoxide.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area, the toll free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 We can also be reached toll free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Once again, this is becoming very usual on the show.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is sharing his wisdom with us and someone's holding up a sign to...

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 It's the disclaimer.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 You want me to read it out?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 I figured you knew it. I can read it too.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 The views and opinions expressed throughout the broadcast today are those of the speakers

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 and not necessarily those of the station and staff or underwriters.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Time will be made available for other viewpoints.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Thank you for joining us and sorry for interrupting you.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Thank you for reading that Michael.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Thank you for reading that.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 So this month, I'm very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peat back on the show.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And again, it astounds me where he has spent all of the years of his postdoctoral life researching.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 And this other subject tonight, carbon monoxide, is something that he said he was researching 30 years ago

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 and started doing work towards better understanding of carbon monoxide

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 and its implications in toxicology and pathogenesis of disease.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So Dr. Raymond Peat, thanks for joining us again.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 There were a couple of topics that directed me towards carbon monoxide.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 I had previously been very interested in Otto Warburg's theory of cancer.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And one of his experiments to study the respiratory enzyme involved poisoning that enzyme with carbon monoxide.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 And so I was aware that the most interesting enzyme of all happened to be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 And he found that light restored the activity of that enzyme.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 And that came back up in my attention when I was studying the toxic effects of the long northern dark winters,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 lack of light exposure, leaving this enzyme susceptible to poisoning.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Okay.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 I think without cutting you short, Dr. Peat,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 just the other thing that strikes me is that we get callers who have listened for the first time to this show that goes out every month.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 And I wouldn't want anyone listening to be deprived of getting a little bit of background information from you.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 So I appreciate you launching straight into the topic.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 But would you just give people an idea of your academic and professional background?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I went from teaching linguistics and humanities subjects right into graduate school in biology

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 because I wanted to understand how the brain works when it does things such as making language or art and so on.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 So I was studying nerve biology at the beginning and found that that was a very dogmatic area, I think, at every university,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 but including the University of Oregon, where I started in graduate school in 1968.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 And so within about six months, I had switched over to the other end of the organism, reproductive physiology and how aging affects that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Right.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Okay, because I think that's another important point about this topic that I'd like you to expand on here.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Aging in the process of degeneration and cell degeneration, excuse me, is, I think,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 probably becoming more of a heard topic on people's lips and in the papers and in magazines and in the popular press.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And Alzheimer's disease being one of those neuro degenerative disease diseases that we're hearing much more of nowadays,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and collectively that neuro degenerative collective of diseases.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 This is something that relates fairly intimately with carbon monoxide, doesn't it?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 That there is many different processes that cause or have been shown to exacerbate the formation of Alzheimer's in any given population.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Yeah, they find that old brains in general have increased amounts of the enzyme that produces carbon monoxide in the tissues.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 Any tissue can produce it, but stress increases the amount of the enzyme.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And so the more stress there is, the more risk there is of poisoning itself.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 And not only increasing age increases the enzyme, but they find that schizophrenic brains have increased amounts of the enzyme making carbon monoxide.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 Alzheimer's brains and in Parkinson's brains in the particular area affected by the Parkinson's disease,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 they see an increased amount of the enzyme.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And in breaking down the heme, which is its basic purpose, it releases iron as well as carbon monoxide.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 So deposits of iron are found in the Parkinson's brain in that area.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Let's just refresh for people who probably want to understand this process a little more.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 The enzyme first off is heme oxygenase, isn't it?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Yeah.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And just give us a run through of what that's doing.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 It attaches oxygen atoms to the heme molecule, which is what carries oxygen in hemoglobin.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And the heme molecule is what binds iron, and that in turn binds oxygen.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 But carbon monoxide is similar enough electrically to oxygen that it can outbind oxygen to the hemoglobin in its place.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 So we can be exposed to carbon monoxide from external sources like burning fuel,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 but you're saying that this is also happening inside our bodies and inside our cells due to an enzyme?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Yeah. It's just the only way the body has to get rid of unused or inappropriately released hemoglobin.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Anytime a tissue is injured and leaks blood, the hemoglobin is potentially very toxic in itself.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And so to detoxify this hemoglobin, which would act as an enzyme, just wildly consuming oxygen,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 the enzyme is there in every injured tissue that tends to bleed or release heme to destroy the heme

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 and turn it into things that can be recycled, such as the iron atom and the carbons from the heme molecule.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 So this enzyme has a function in damaged tissue to help mop up the waste products,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 but in certain brain situations like we've been describing, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, it's in excess amounts.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Yeah, apparently because of chronic stress.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Another brain situation in which they find that exactly associated with the problematic cells in the brain,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 multiple sclerosis in the plaques, they find increased amounts of the enzyme making carbon monoxide.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 About 20 years ago, I had gotten away from the cancer carbon monoxide connection for several years

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 because I couldn't find anyone willing to listen to the idea that it was such a neat idea to explain how the Barberg cancer theory works.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 But I came back to it in the 90s, applying it to multiple sclerosis,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 because the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are very similar to those of multiple sclerosis.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Go ahead and describe them.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Well, clots tend to form in the brain, and every place there's a clot, the blood vessels become leaky

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 and proteins leak out into the brain and are part of the inflammatory process.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 The carbon monoxide activates those same processes,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 a tendency to clot, a definite tendency of blood vessels to become leaky,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 and let things inappropriately seep out so that any time you have a situation of leaky blood vessels,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 injured liver, for example, leaking its enzymes, inflamed muscles leaking enzymes and proteins,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 heart attack leaking its substances,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 you find hemoxygenase and carbon monoxide there, making the cells more permeable and leaky.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Am I right in thinking that carbon monoxide is actually produced by tumors too?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Yeah.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 In transplanting a tumor into an animal, they found that it had many toxic effects on the animal.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 For years they talked about a toxic hormone or a cancer hormone,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 and in one set of experiments they gave a chemical to the animal receiving the tumor implant,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 a chemical that would inhibit hemoxygenase and stop the formation of carbon monoxide

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 and stop the toxic effects of the transplant.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 I think we can get into that a little bit later on.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 They're looking at this as potential research,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 but you can see some pitfalls in some of the approach that they want to use.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Is that for a potential anti-cancer treatment?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Yeah, there are several groups working on it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 They can stop cancer growth for a week at a time with an injection of one of the chemicals

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 that just turns off hemoxygenase,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 and they're designing many chemicals that will do it, for example,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 reverse structure RNA molecules that interfere with the production of the enzyme very specifically.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 So then this would have possible clinical applications with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 if it's actually turning off that enzyme.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Yeah, all of the degenerative stress-related diseases, cancer and the brain aging.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Atherosclerosis.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 And arthritis involves excess carbon monoxide too.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Okay, so let's just go back for the benefit of the listeners listening to this program right now

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 who perhaps don't have the same kind of scientific background

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 so they can understand a little more about hemoxygenase.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 You mentioned that this enzyme, hemoxygenase, is part of our body

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 and every cell has the ability to utilize or break down rather the products of hemoglobin into.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 You mentioned iron and carbon monoxide and then there's a pigment called bilirubin.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 So this is happening.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Our blood cells are turning over every 90 days and the spleen mops up these blood cells constantly,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 breaking down the red blood cell into byproducts like the hemoglobin and carbon monoxide and bilirubin 24/7.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 So this is the process that is happening in our bodies anyway.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 But what's the mechanism behind which we're protected from the carbon monoxide?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Well, one design feature is that having it all happen in the spleen

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 keeps it away from your brain and heart and reproductive organs and so on.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 What about those people who perhaps have had a splenectomy and it's been taken out

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 or it's been ruptured or damaged and they don't have one?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 I don't know exactly what the consequences are,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 but you would think that it would expose their other tissues more to the effects of chronic stress.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 What about when someone has an enlarged spleen?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Are they just able to do that much better?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Because usually enlarged spleens are indicating liver disease or other problems.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Yeah, I imagine that as long as it's confined to the spleen,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 that's the main purpose of the organs is to keep it happening somewhere

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 that the carbon monoxide has a chance to diffuse away in the bloodstream before it gets to the organs.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Okay, the main purpose of the talk and this discussion,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 we'll get onto that as well in a little while,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 is that propane, if it's burnt incompletely

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 and the byproducts of that incomplete combustion are carbon monoxide

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 and environmental pollution from traffic exhaust, high in carbon monoxide.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 That's basically what we're looking at smoking as another good example of carbon monoxide exposure.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 And even wood smoke too, right Dr. Peat?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Yeah, a bad stove or fireplace can put out a huge amount of carbon monoxide

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 and even if you have a perfectly adjusted gas stove,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 if you put a cold pan down on the burner so that the flame touches it,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 cooling the flame is going to make it release carbon monoxide.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 So tell me, you had a recent encounter with somebody,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 you were consulting with someone and they were lucky enough to get their hands on a good carbon monoxide meter.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 So just talk about that a little.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 They were all having symptoms and they noticed that they were worse in the winter

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 when the house was tightly closed up and they happened to have access to a very sensitive meter

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 that would measure down to a few parts per million

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 and found that just 15 minutes of having the stove on, the burners were producing 15 parts per million

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 and the oven, 29 parts per million, 18 and 29.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 And it's a matter of how long you keep breathing it

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 because if it fluctuates then you have a chance to breathe it out as well as breathe it in.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 And in one particular experiment with rats,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 they exposed the rats to the supposedly upper safe limit for human exposure,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 for example, in cities, 50 parts per million.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 And in just one hour of exposure, the rats' brains were structurally damaged.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 So were they getting infarcts or some other kind of damage?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 No, much less.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Small cellular changes.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Right, so it was the beginning of something bad, something worse.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And that's what you mentioned is the level in a lot of cities, right?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 50 parts per million.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Yeah, it comes and goes, but they saw permanent changes in prolonged exposure

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 to even lower amounts in the animals, 30 parts per million, for example.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 So the average housewife who spends all their time cooking over the stove--

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 no, sorry, that's not the average housewife.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 It could be exposed to a lot more than healthy levels

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 because gas stoves could be emitting a large quantity of carbon monoxide.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Yeah, and the symptoms are very rarely associated with carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 You traditionally think of the person who's shut himself in a garage

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 with a rubber pipe coming out of the exhaust pipe into the garage, right?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Yeah, and for many years, doctors thought only in terms of the blood being saturated

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 with carbon monoxide and not being able to deliver oxygen to the tissues.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 But the carbon monoxide goes right into all of the tissues,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 and we've got many, many enzymes that use heme.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 It isn't just the blood and myoglobin.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 But, for example, the enzymes that make steroids use the heme group.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 It's the most intense symptom of getting your tissue saturated

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 is you poison the energy-producing enzyme.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 But very moderate amounts of chronic poisoning will shut down your ability to produce steroids

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 so that the testosterone level, for example, falls with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 But interestingly, the adrenal corticosteroids are increased under the simulation

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 because the adrenals are designed to recognize a stress emergency situation,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 which carbon monoxide is.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 The actual enzymes that produce the bulk of steroids are blocked by carbon monoxide.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 Okay, you're listening to R.Scuro, Dr. Ron KMUD, Carbohydrate 91.1 FM.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 From 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of carbon monoxide.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923-3911,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 or if you live outside the area, 1800-KMUD-RAD.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Okay, so we're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 and he's explaining some of the mechanisms behind carbon monoxide poisoning,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 and we're just covering some of the sources of which perhaps we probably haven't really considered that much.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 So I think the thing with stoves, the cook stoves, I never really--

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 I mean, I always recognized the fact that a poorly-adjusted flame

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 was probably the main cause of carbon monoxide emission from propane-burning appliances,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 and that the presence of an orangey-type flame rather than a blue or a kind of violet flame was indicative,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 and then soot and that kind of thing, sooty deposits around the nozzle,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 were pretty diagnostic of incomplete combustion.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 But you're saying that if you can put a pan of water, a cold pan of water, on the stove,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 actually on the burner, there's sufficient cooling there to cool the flame to the point where there will be incomplete combustion,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 and then carbon monoxide generated?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Yeah, and typically you see a little bit of the flame turning yellow where it hits the pan.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Right, exactly, yeah, and I think we've all seen that.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Yeah, no, I've seen that.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 But the other point about this carbon monoxide emissions from propane stoves

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 is that people's houses are becoming more and more airtight.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 I know our house is very airtight, so--

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 It's-- maybe the old or drafty houses, a little bit leaking out of your stove,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 it was diluted with plenty of wind.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 Plenty of air.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 So do you think we're going to see more Alzheimer's now, Dr. Peat?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Continue with everybody's airtight houses.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Well, we are seeing it.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 I know, but continue on.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 It's a question of whether it's coming from propane stoves or not.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 The first symptoms are often so light, people just think they have a chronic cold,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 or sometimes people get anxious or depressed.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Some people have crawling sensations on their skin, muscle cramps, heart arrhythmia.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Practically any symptom you can think of.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It's well known as a sign of carbon monoxide poisoning,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 but it's just very rare for anyone to think of it when they have the symptoms.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Or what about those heaters that you see in a lot of people's houses?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Space heaters or something like that.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Yeah, that are actually gas-powered heaters.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 I guess maybe they're more popular in England than they are here.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Yeah, a lot of people used to have them even without a vent.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Well, these ones in England, people have in their house don't have any vents.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 It just sits in the front room radiating heat.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Yeah, the same as a gas cooking stove.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Another thing to cover, too, is the government regulations

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 concerning the presence of carbon monoxide detectors in houses now.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 I think probably for a few years,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 the first thing was smoke detectors and then it was carbon monoxide detectors.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Describe briefly, because I've seen the limits and the statutory regulations,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 government regulations and industry regulations that have set these limits.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Just describe them for us a little bit.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Years ago, I bought one of the cheap meters

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 and was testing it on various things and nothing would register.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 So I put it in the garage with the car running and left it for, I guess, half an hour

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 and still nothing happened.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 It wasn't strong enough.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 I learned that the government requires or the industry and government requires

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 that they not sound an alarm unless the concentration is reaching the life-threatening point.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 So if it's a low level, below 50 parts per million,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 one of the standards says it has to stay at that concentration for 48 hours steadily

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 before the alarm can sound.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 So what would that do to your brain if you had a 50 parts per million steadily for 24 hours?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 48 hours.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 I think they require the alarm to sound after something like 30 to 60 minutes

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 of a 50 parts per million concentration.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 They've got the charts published, but it's definitely not a healthy concentration,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 but they don't want you bothering the fire department

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 any time you're just getting a burst of 70 parts per million because it won't kill you soon.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Or complaining to your range manufacturer.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 Yeah.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 So what about this meter that you said is very, very sensitive?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 What's the name of this meter?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 I have seen it on the Internet.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 I don't know the brand.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 One company that makes them is KIDD.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Oh, right. They're manufacturers of smoke alarms, too.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 I think it was their company that had one for $340

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 that actually registered down in parts per million, which is exactly useful because--

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Right, and in real time.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Yeah.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 You want to know, for example, if you breathe out,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 a healthy person will make less than one part per million exhalation.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 If they're very sick and under stress,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 they might go up to five parts per million just from their internal production.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 I'm pretty sure we have a caller on the line,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 but let's give it a couple of seconds here because it's not 730 yet,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 and I want to make sure that we can keep covering more material.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 The thing that struck me earlier when I was looking at some of this

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 was that smoking exposes a smoker to about 500 parts per million carbon monoxide from a cigarette.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 In that little stream.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Right.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 So let's try to be comparative here.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 In terms of incomplete combustion from a propane stove,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 you said 28 parts per million for the oven and 18 for the--

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 If you had that concentration of the cigarette in your room air,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 you would be dead pretty quick.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 At 500 parts per million.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Yeah, because you're breathing quarts of air for every puff of smoke.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Right, so it's very diluted.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 So what do you think--

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 I wonder what a quart to a puff would work out as a concentration.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 Probably 30, 40, 50, somewhere around that.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 So standing around your oven could be just as bad as smoking cigarettes?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Definitely in some houses.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 If the oven is not well adjusted.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Let's take this first caller if they're still there.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Hi, you're on the air?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Hello.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Hi.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Oh, can barely hear you.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Okay, well--

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 I can hear you.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Okay, good.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Go ahead.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Question for Raymond Peat.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Probably two or a couple,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 but I recall a couple years ago he was talking about he had something with thyroid

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 and staying off clear oils and he was curing liver,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 people with liver problems, say he had cirrhosis or hepatitis or something.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 What would be your question?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 What was it again?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 The--

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 What oils are you--

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 He was talking about thyroid and I'd like to know what--

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 to refurbish my memory--my mind is as to what his--

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 what was he recommending as a liver cleanse.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And I recall that it was something with thyroid medicines, no clear oils,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 coconut and butter only, and no alcohol or something, blah, blah, blah.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, did you catch that?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 Yeah, the thyroid is the essential thing for energizing the burning of any fuel.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And if your thyroid function is low, your liver is, in a way,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 the first organ to feel it because the liver stores sugar.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 And if you're wasting energy, your liver fails to store sugar

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 and becomes inefficient eventually, fibrotic and so on.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 People with thyroid--I knew a woman in New York,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 she went from really real thin to super fat, so she had her thyroid gland removed.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 And she had an awful scar on her throat, it didn't help her at all.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 But anyway, I'm not overweight or anything, it's just that I've had hepatitis in the past

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 and I'm afraid I may--I've used to drink for over 20 years, all day long.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 So I'm wondering how I can--what is this thyroid medicine called?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 It's--there are two main chemicals that are called the thyroid hormone.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 One is thyroxine and the other one is T3 or triiodothyronine.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And the traditional product was just dried thyroid gland.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 You actually take the gland itself?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Yeah, people used to eat the whole animal.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 I heard you on the radio show maybe four years ago now, and you're saying, "Take thyroid."

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 It's like, "Gee, I don't have any thyroid glands in my refrigerator.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 What is this guy talking about?"

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And you can still go to the butcher and they call them sweetbreads and they're thymus and thyroid gland.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Sweetbreads, okay, that's swell.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 But see, I haven't eaten meat since I was like 17.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 Well, you can't get them here anyways.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 It's just a factoid I thought I'd bring up.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 Okay.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Okay, so--

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 To make a long story short, what should I do here?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 The main dietary things that suppress the thyroid function are the polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And that's why I've mentioned the importance of saturated fats such as coconut oil and butter and sugar as a way to make your own fat

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 to avoid the dietary oils such as safflower, soy, corn oil, and so on, which are antithyroid.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 So those are all the--

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 So in other words, I don't really necessarily-- I'm sure my thyroid is probably functioning just fine.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 I have a sneaking suspicion.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 I mean, are you-- Dr. Rapi, are you the guy on the Internet I was trying to get ahold of where it's a photo of you and you look like you've been working out or something?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 Is that you?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 No.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 I'm like, "This could not be my guy."

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 This does not sound like Rapi to me.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 But there's another-- I spoke to you on the Internet several years ago, but I can't find you anymore on the Internet.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Well, his website is rapi.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Right. Okay. Groovy.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Yeah, so it's all the liquid oils.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 So it wasn't-- you remembered correctly everything apart from it was liquid oils, not clear oils.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 It's all liquid oils.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Oh, yeah, liquid oils.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Avoiding all liquid oils.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Liquid oils, yeah.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Only do butter and coconut oil.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 So then I have to lay off alcohol completely, any kind of drugs, crap shit stuff, pardon my language.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And--

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Adequate protein.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 My policy is if you swear on air, I take you off.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 So we have one more caller waiting now.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 What do I do about thyroid again?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Okay, one more caller.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 You're on the air.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Hello?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Hi.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 I had a question about something Dr. Petit brought up before.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 He was talking about hypothyroid and how it can be improved in, like, warm, sunny weather.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 I was just wondering, is that beneficial because it's temporarily, like, masking the symptoms,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 or if that has a long-term corrective effect on the thyroid?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Just getting warm lowers the stress hormones, and so it gives your body a chance to recover.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 But if you haven't changed your diet that was causing the problem, then cold weather or other stress will tend to bring back the hypothyroidism.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 But isn't it also that the decreased daylight hours, Dr. Petit, make your thyroid hormone less able to be picked up by your cells?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 Yeah, the mitochondria that I was talking about, the toxic effects of darkness, the thyroid is trying to keep those mitochondria functioning.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 And during the darkness, the various toxins, including carbon monoxide, interrupt the function of the mitochondrion,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 and that means it blocks the function of the thyroid.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 But if you increase your thyroid, you can compensate a little bit for that disruption during the darkness.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 In animal experiments, they found that removing a rat's thyroid gland,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 they would have to give four times as much supplement in the winter as in the summer because of the increased stress of the dark days.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 And when I tested it on myself, it was exactly four times requirement difference according to the season.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 And if you asked your doctor, they wouldn't recommend that you increase your thyroid medication four times in the winter months versus the summer.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 So, something that you have to follow your own symptoms.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Right. So, it's almost as if the thyroid is being wasted on trying to help the mitochondria when you're getting less light, I guess.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 Like, you're producing a similar amount, it's just being wasted on trying to keep your energy up with these stressors?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Yeah, it does spend more of the thyroid substance and get it thrown off.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 But if you have your tissue well saturated with the safe nutrients rather than the dangerous polyunsaturated oils,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 your mitochondria are much tougher.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 They've found that you can remove the mitochondria from an animal that hasn't had those unsaturated fats

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 and the mitochondria survive in the test tube much longer and are more vigorous.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 So, it's the polyunsaturated fats that make the mitochondria so susceptible to injury.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Do you think, Dr. Peter, this is because of the lipid membrane that the mitochondria is surrounded by is made up of saturated oils

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 that don't oxidize like polyunsaturated and that's why they last longer?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Well, the very structure, you can extract all of the fat from a cell and you still have the mitochondrial structure in shape

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 because it's mostly protein that gives the structure.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 Those proteins are tightly interacting with fat and a lot of those are unsaturated.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 So, if you get too many unsaturated ones, they oxidize and damage the proteins.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 So, it's the mixture of protein and fat.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Just to explain for our listeners who might not have heard of mitochondria before, that's what we call the powerhouse of our cell.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 It's what produces energy.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 So, without mitochondria, you'd have no energy, you wouldn't be alive.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 But it's actually the part of the cell that makes all your energy.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 Thyroid hormone helps bring oxygen to the cell and helps to activate the mitochondria.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 So, it's all linked to having a cell function properly.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 Thyroid and adequate oxygen and the mitochondria producing the energy called ATP.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 And adequate light is part of it.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 Okay.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Alright, thanks for that, Cora.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 That reminds me, we've got one more call, but let me just ask you this, Dr. Peat.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 I know you mentioned Otto Warburg in 1926 and his work on cancer and defective respiratory enzymes.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 You said that when these animals have been poisoned with carbon monoxide, the animals could recover completely if they were...

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 And you've mentioned this many times before in context of radiation and other damaging substances.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 But these animals could be restored basically by having this bright orange light in this instance.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 There's red work too, but orange light shined on them.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 They could be reactivated, if you like.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 Warburg was just using tissues isolated from animals, but Russians were the ones who used whole animals.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 They would give them a killing dose of gamma rays and if they very quickly, within an hour, flooded them with red light,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 it inactivated the effects of the radiation.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 It wasn't radiation itself, it was a cascade of chemical events that could be interrupted by the red light.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 And when you get sunburned, part of that cascade of events is the production of carbon monoxide.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 All right, so it was Otto Warburg who did tissues. He was experimenting with tissues rather than animals.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 OK, we have another caller on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Hello.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 You're on the air.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Oh, thank you.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 I wanted to go back to the topic of polyunsaturated fats and I wondered if they feed chickens, for example, even organic ones,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 lots of, say, cottonseed meal or something, even if it's organic, are we eating organic protein in a chicken or beef or anything?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Even if they've been raised on grains and everything, are we getting a secondary exposure to a lot of polyunsaturated fats?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Yeah, any animal that isn't a ruminant will express in its tissues pretty exactly the balance of fats in its food,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 and that includes people and pigs and chickens.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 And ducks and geese and turkeys.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Yeah, but sheep and cows and camels, for example, will produce milk that has almost about 98 percent of the bad fats have been destroyed by bacteria in the rumens,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 so that it's 98 percent monounsaturated or saturated or the trans-fat variations of conjugated linoleic acid, for example,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 which is actively being sold as an anti-cancer or weight loss agent, but you find it naturally in butter and milk.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 And also that would include venison, elk, antelope, mule deer, moose.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 And all those animals have fats that congeal at room temperature.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 They have ruminant processes working in their digestion.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Yeah, because they have more than one stomach to digest and to convert the fats.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 And the chickens, they have such soft, almost runny fat these days.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Right, because it's very polyunsaturated because they're eating corn and soy meal.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 It's the same with pig fat.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 When my grandmother used it, it was a solid like butter.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 Even most researchers have been calling it a saturated fat now for 50 years.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 A couple of years ago, someone bothered to analyze it and found that it was 30 percent FUFA.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 Wow.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 We had some friends who butchered a pig that was fed mostly apples.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 And vegetables from the farm.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 And vegetables, green waste from their farm.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 And they had a 70-pound pig, and 30 pounds of it was fat and 40 pounds of it was meat, and it was all solid.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 So that would be like good quality lard.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Yeah, exactly. That's where your lard would come from for baking pastries and other foods.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 That's the way to make good eggs, too.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Feed them lots of vegetable matter.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Right.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 Because the sugars will cause the animals to make saturated fat.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 So if you feed your animals your excess fruit in the fall, which is what was happening with this pig,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 then they'll tend to make saturated fat out of that sugar.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Well, thank you for your answers. That's very interesting. Thank you.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 You're very welcome.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Thank you for your call. Bye.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Okay, so we have another caller on the air, so let's take this next one.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Hello?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 Yeah. You know, people -- can you hear me?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 Yes.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Okay. People tend to be really skittish about butter.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 You know, I hear all the time people saying, "Oh, I mustn't eat butter because I'm afraid of the cholesterol

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 and it's going to clog my arteries and give me a heart attack."

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 And yet you guys are always talking about how butter is good for you.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 What's with all that?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Dr. Peate, we've gone through this several times.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 It's brainwashing.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Exactly. It's just hard to overcome.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 For example --

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 They wanted to sell margarine.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 A researcher in India noticed that in his area where people eat a lot of butter,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 alcoholics didn't get hepatitis and cirrhosis.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 And so he did this study with rats and fed them butter and lots of alcohol,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 and they didn't get hepatitis and cirrhosis.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 And a group has been researching that now for about 25 years,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 showing that fish oil and unsaturated vegetable oil interact with a little bit of alcohol to activate iron,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 causing oxidative damage, liver inflammation, and fibrosis.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 But if you have practically an unsaturated fat-free diet, alcohol is really pretty harmless.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 And didn't they do that study in Chicago as well 30 years ago you told me about?

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 Yeah. Nanji is the name of the main researcher, N-A-N-J-I.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 Okay. You're listening to Ask Your Doctor on KMUD, Garboville, 91.1 FM.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 And from now until 8 o'clock at the end of the show,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to the month's topic of carbon monoxide poisoning

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 and its various ramifications.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Number, like I said, if you live here, is 923-3911.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Or if you live outside the area, 1800-KMUD-RAD.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 And we have Dr. Raymond Peat with us, and he's the person who's behind all the science.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 So if you would like to ask him any questions, now's your chance.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 We do have another caller on the air, so let's get this next caller.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 Hi, you're on the air?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 Good. Hi. Is it I that's on the air?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Yes, go ahead.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Hello?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Yeah, can you hear me?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 I'm not hearing anyone.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 Okay, we can hear you.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 You should be there. Are you there, caller?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 Yes, yes.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Yes, you're on the air.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 I am.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 Hello, caller. Can you hear us?

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Yes, I can now.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 Yes, I had a question.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 I've had quintuple bypass surgery, and I was introduced to a diet called the Dean Ornish diet.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 And in that diet, it claims that fat is good for you in limitations,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 but saturated fat itself is no good at all, and that you should steer away from any saturated fats.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 So, and again, I realize you've addressed this numerous times.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 You just mentioned that with the last caller.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 But is there something -- I'm just so confused at this point.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 You know, the Dean Ornish diet, from my understanding, is basically a vegetarian diet,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 although he does call for the fat from fish to be added to that diet.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 But beyond that, it's a no-meat, no-dairy diet.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 Dr. Peat, what would you have to say?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 That there is now a lot of stuff on the Internet.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 Chris Masterjohn, for example, has some very good review articles dealing with topics like that.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 I've got a couple of articles on cholesterol on my website.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Okay.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 So Chris Masterjohn, if the caller heard that, you should Google Chris Masterjohn.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 And then Dr. Raymond Peat's website is www.raypeat.com,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 and he has a lot of articles there that you can read that might explain some of the confusion.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 But he specifically said he has articles on cholesterol.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 Specifically.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 And basically, research has shown that if you're eating the unsaturated fatty acids,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 those go rancid in your bloodstream and damage your arteries,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 and then your body needs to stop that massive free radical reaction where it's consuming oxygen and going rancid.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 And so your body puts a cholesterol bandage over the rancid oil.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 So Japanese scientists have found when they remove that cholesterol bandage,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 they find a plaque of oxidized omega-6 oils.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 And there's lots of research showing that this is actually what causes damage to the arteries,

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 and it's not at all saturated fats because saturated fats are so stable and would not create a free radical reaction like that.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 Okay.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 I think we have two more callers on the air, so let's take the next caller.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 You're on the air.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 Yeah.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 I'm calling back because when I asked about cholesterol, you talked about alcohol and liver.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 And what I want to know is about specifically butter.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 Is butter bad for your arteries and your cholesterol or not?

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 Not at all.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 Because a lot of people are very afraid to eat butter because they think it's going to clog their arteries.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 What's the reality?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 Okay.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 Did you want to answer that, Dr. Peat?

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 Yeah, the same thing that applies to the liver applies exactly to the arteries,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 except the arteries are the first place that the unsaturated oxidized fats will injure.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 They come out of your --

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 I understand that it's bad to do this to the unsaturated fats,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 but why do people think that butter and animal fat is going to clog their arteries?

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Because of 50 years of propaganda from the seed oil industry, basically.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 So you're basically saying that unsaturated fat will clog your arteries quicker than butter.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Yeah.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Exactly.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 It's when the seed oil industry was unable to sell their oils to the paint companies,

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 and because the paint companies started buying their oils from the petroleum industry,

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 they needed to market their corn and soy oil to humans because there was no other market for it.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 And that's when Mr. Mazzola would drink a cup of corn oil and say, "It's great stuff.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 It lowers your cholesterol."

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 And he, unfortunately, died at a very young age of a heart attack.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 So it caused such an arterial blockage.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 But basically they needed to sell their oils, and they boycotted all tropical oils,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 the palm and the coconut oils, which will not cause heart attacks, and promoted corn oil.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 And there you have it.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 What about olive oil?

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 Olive oil is only 90% -- only 10% polyunsaturated and 90% monounsaturated.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 So it is not going to block your arteries like the other liquid oils.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 You wouldn't want to use it in excessive amounts because it still is 10% polyunsaturated.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 So you're saying that butter is the healthiest or coconut oil?

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Butter, coconut, palm.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 And saturated fats from animals like beef and lamb.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 Okay, thanks for your call.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 We have another caller on the air, so let's get this next one.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 Yes, hi, George from Kentucky.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Hey, George, thanks for joining us from Kentucky.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 My question is twofold.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 I've been reading about black tourmaline or organite as being helpful or effective against EMF,

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 and I was curious to know what you felt was helpful or protective in fighting against EMF.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 Are those like those beads that you can put on the end of your cable?

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 Is that what you're talking about?

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 No, black tourmaline is a stone.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 He's not talking about the antenna blockers.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 No, that's a different compound.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 That's graphene.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 Not graphene, I think it's graphite.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 It's a crystal.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 Dr. Peat, do you--

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 For a laptop, you know, with the electromagnetic field, you get the harmful electromagnetic field,

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 so I was curious if you felt the crystals were effective in--

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Blocking that.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 Blocking that, exactly.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 You know, it takes something that is basically covering the space between you and the source geometrically,

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 something that is a small area, just can't catch a broad emission coming at you.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 So it's like they have these things called block socks for your cell phone,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 so the side of your cell phone that has an antenna that radiates to get its signal,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 if you put that block sock that has this metal barrier next to your body and the phone faces out,

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 then it's not going to be penetrating you the same ways if you didn't have that block sock.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 Does that make sense?

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 So I guess just to reiterate, how do we exactly protect ourselves from EMF of the laptop computer then?

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 I'm sorry, I didn't quite follow.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 I understood the analogy for cell phones, but I didn't quite understand for a laptop.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 Think of it as light that's coming from your computer or whatever,

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 and if the light is touching some important part of your body, the rays, whatever they are,

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 microwaves are going to be following the line of sight,

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 so you need something basically as big as the object emitting to catch the radiation.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 I see. Okay.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 So would you suggest placing the laptop on a table or a surface and not obviously using it on top of your lap,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 say on a pillow or something like that?

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 Yeah, the lap is not a good place to keep a radiant source.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 Potentially, you see, you could use an external keyboard on your laptop

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 and then put the laptop underneath the table or in a slot like that to block the EMF from the laptop

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 and then use a monitor also connected to your laptop.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 You could just use your laptop as the processor.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 And you can get a little EMF monitor and you can see on your laptop it reads danger.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 Yeah, that's pretty bad.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 And six inches away it doesn't pick up any EMF.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 I mean, that's a real rough, crude monitor you can buy at the hardware store.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 So, you know, keep it as far away from your body as possible, basically.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 Okay. All right. Excellent. Well, thank you all. I appreciate your help.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 Okay. I don't know if there's anybody else waiting.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 Okay. So we're getting very close to the top of the hour anyway.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 We could make a connection between the connections about the unsaturated fat

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 and the fact that fish oil happens to be one of the very best activators of the hemoxygenase,

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 which makes carbon monoxide.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 And in proportion to how polyunsaturated the fat is, it activates the production of carbon monoxide.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 So if someone had Alzheimer's and they're taking fish oil, it's a really bad combination.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Yeah. And it's the kind of thing that I would imagine most of the industry is telling you is good for Alzheimer's

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 and good for chronic obstructive lung disease and things like atrial fibrillation

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 and other cardiovascular disorders.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 We have one quick question about horse meat. Is that good or bad?

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 It depends on what the horse is eating, but it'll reflect exactly what the horse ate.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 So it's very likely to be fairly unsaturated unless in some countries they feed them,

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 for example, dates were a major food in Iraq, and they would have a very saturated fat if they ate dates.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 Okay. So let's wrap the show up by giving people some of your contact details, Dr. Peat.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 Thanks so much for joining us again.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 Okay. Thank you.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 Okay. So Dr. Raymond Peat, he's been working on many things surrounding current,

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 what are becoming very current health topics.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 And the polyunsaturated oils are one of his mainstays,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 but he's done lots of research into things that are surrounding cancer treatment.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 So his website is www.raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 He has lots of articles there that you can go and browse. Many of them, well, they're all fully referenced.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Some are quite difficult to get into because they're very scientific,

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 but there's lots of information in there that most people will find the truth of behind.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 And we can also be contacted Monday through Friday, regular business hours.
