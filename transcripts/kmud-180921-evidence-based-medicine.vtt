00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 Well, welcome to this September 2018's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:16.000
 I should say straight off the bat here, after the engineer had mentioned the fact that we are not a government-supported radio station, KMU DeGarboville 91.1 FM,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 thank goodness we're not government-supported.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 So we're very much a free speech, free enterprise, and funded by you guys, the public.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:37.100
 If you like the show, then I would definitely encourage you to visit the website www.kmud.org and hit the red "Donate Now" button.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 And we do actually get a tiny bit of money from CPB, a little over $100,000, but they're constantly threatening to take that away and that ain't enough.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.800
 So they do actually restrict a little of what we can say, but we got freedom like no place else and God bless it.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.100
 Yeah, well, amen.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:13.700
 And that's the whole reason that we do this radio show and so many other people are out of KMUD's range of artists do their independent shows, bringing you independent news, giving you all sides, you know, both perspectives and not just a steered perspective that you might typically get from any particular radio stations that have their own agendas.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.900
 So people, please do go ahead and donate.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.300
 I want to say please donate as much as you can.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:33.600
 Don't just be stingy. Appreciate that keeping something alive takes more input than just talking about things, but actually putting some money up there really will help the radio station stay on the air.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:44.300
 I've been doing this show for 15 years now, and I've seen the pledge drives come and go, and they always do manage to reach the targets.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.800
 I think at this point in time, though, we are about 15,000 short of the target folks.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.700
 So 65 is the number right now and 8080 is the hope for.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.100
 So if you can go ahead, please, and donate as much as you can.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.600
 And let's just keep moving forward into this 20 coming up 2019.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:20.700
 So I wanted to carry on from last month's discussion on critical thinking and cover up like a separate independent program, independent radio station.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.700
 And lots of times you'll listen to people in different articles exposing different things.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:43.700
 And the large part you probably never heard of it before, and so it's very important to have free speech, and that's certainly constitutionally one of the bedrocks of the American Declaration of Independence and the Constitution enshrining first and second amendment rights, etc.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:56.300
 To keep everybody free and to enable people to be heard, whether or not they sound like they're crazy or they have crazy ideas or what they're saying sounds so far out there that you could hardly believe it.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.900
 But that's the truth of it.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.400
 Truth is stranger than fiction sometimes.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:09.700
 So last month we discussed the beginning of critical thinking and how different trials that are done.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.500
 And we're talking about medicine here at this point, but it does run into several other subjects.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:25.200
 But medicine's the subject that we speak on for our radio show and lots of clinical trials and lots of searchable publications found on the Internet.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.800
 Anyone can go to PubMed, for example.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.000
 There's the National Library databases and many other portals that will have clinical trials.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.800
 And the very fact that some of these clinical trials are done by people that have an agenda.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:54.900
 So whether or not we want to believe that the drug companies have their own vested interests first and foremost and that less than stellar results are covered up.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.800
 I think it's undeniable.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:06.800
 I think it's just a fact of life that there is something to be sold and sometimes the cost is not too high.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:17.900
 So when drugs come out and then they're pulled after a couple of years after causing heart attacks or raised blood pressure or other serious events, that does happen.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.400
 And we have plenty of evidence behind that.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:29.800
 But in the meantime, billions and billions of dollars have been made and the punitive damages in lawsuits doesn't really count for much against the billions that are made in profit.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:39.200
 So whilst the Internet is an excellent source of information, you have to be very measured in your forming opinions about things.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.300
 And for every good article, you're going to find some bad articles.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:59.400
 And so it does take a modicum of science and definite intelligent pursuit in that subject to be able to filter it out sometimes, because sometimes they're so well written that it's difficult to discern the truth from the fabrications.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.900
 Well, once again, we're going to be joined by Dr.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.200
 Raymond Peat and have his wealth of experience on the matter.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200
 And I think without further ado, Dr.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.000
 Peat, are you with us?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.500
 Yes.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.700
 Well, thanks so much for joining us again.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.400
 As always, if you would just give an outline of your academic professional background so that people can understand where you come from.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:42.600
 I was a linguistics teacher for a while before I decided to get a PhD in biology in 1968, enrolled at University of Oregon in the biology department and worked there for four years on reproductive physiology.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.500
 Largely.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:53.500
 And right after that, then I went back to my interest in linguistics, philosophy and consciousness.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:03.700
 How the brain knows the world and worked on a book on brain physiology.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:21.600
 The book title was, I can't remember right now.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:30.600
 Anyway, it was about brain physiology and reviewing a lot of Russian research.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.800
 And after I finished with that, then I got involved in doing nutrition counseling.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:51.100
 And so there has been a lot of interest in neurological, psychological effects of hormones and nutrition.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.900
 Yeah.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.900
 Okay.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:11.000
 I think in that the very pertinent application on a one to one basis in terms of counseling people and seeing people where they are when they first visit you and then taking advice and recommendations and suggestions of how better to change your lifestyle.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.400
 Probably nothing more evidence based than that.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.800
 And that's it leads me on to the evidence based medicine.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:33.200
 I know that is a phrase that's been around now for some time and I think is touted as a secure, if you like, a secure.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.800
 Yeah, rationale for what it is they're trying to tell you or sell you.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.900
 But as we've mentioned before in medicine and in trials.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:08:03.500
 I know it sounds very clear, but it's I think it's just the way it is, you know, big corporate interests have a lot to lose in getting things out of their control and steering medicine is extremely important in terms of the ideology behind it.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:09.800
 So for evidence based medicine, it depends entirely on a reliable base of evidence.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:21.200
 And this is the studies that are done and if the evidence base is tampered with and or paid for then evidence based medicine as a science is pretty useless.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:38.600
 We have things like financial conflicts of interests and then actually selling the science as a marketing initiative in terms of the outreach in terms of meeting and capturing an audience.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.600
 And then the ideology behind it.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:52.800
 I know that you've talked many times about the ideology on the ideological drive behind things, whether it's politics or whether indeed it is science and medicines.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:07.200
 You know, it's the revelation of medicine and I know you've mentioned in the past here and I know you don't really have too much stock in it because you provided other evidence to support the contrary thinking.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:15.200
 But receptor based medicine and then there's a whole cancer targeted gene cancer approach.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:35.600
 What do you what do you think about evidence based medicine in terms of what you found in the many or at least four decades that you've been looking at what you've been told or what we've been told and what you've certainly found out is contrary to it and why that's happened?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.400
 A few hundred years ago, when there was an established religion, it determined what people could believe philosophically.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:01.800
 And as science, physics and biology took over from the established religion, they became the established religion in its place.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:29.800
 And they tell the public, the people in the universities and the established research institutions under the control often of the government, they tell the public what they should believe exactly the way the medieval church used to absolutely require conforming belief.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:47.600
 They don't burn you now for descending from science, but it's almost metaphorically, they might take you out of universities and any any good social position if you really dissent.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:11:16.200
 The authoritarian aspect of medicine peaked when this idea of evidence based medicine based on these big multi million dollar multi year studies became at least a nominal standard.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:35.200
 Most of what doctors do has nothing to do with that, but it's a way of enforcing certain practices and kicking out of medicine the doctors who don't want to conform to those big practices.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:51.200
 And it has to be either a giant industry or the government working with those industries to fund these huge multi institutional multi year research projects.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:12:03.200
 And many of these major studies, for example, in AIDS drugs, the corruption has been documented.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:14.200
 Some of the institutions participating simply put in funny information to support the sale of the drugs they wanted to sell.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:27.200
 And this is the collusion and this is between such things as the government and their ability to silence opposition and the corporations that have the financial wherewithal to pull this off.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:40.200
 Yeah, the in many ways, the institutions have controlled the government and universities and that there's a long tradition of that.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:13:03.200
 At one time, the land grant colleges were a way of letting science help the farmers and the county extension agents and the Department of Agriculture and such for a time actually put out useful information to the public.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:26.200
 They were soon taken over by the industries and now, for example, over Oregon State University, which was land grant university, the insecticide and herbicide companies and the radiation industry really set the tone for what they're doing over there.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:38.200
 OK, I wanted to just bring up again, I've mentioned this several times in several previous shows that the Hippocratic Oath is something that doctors all take on graduation and swear to defend.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:14:00.200
 And the first do no harm rule I wanted to talk about several specific drugs, excuse me, and classes of drugs and just really just to bring it to the listeners attention that these things are no longer buried, no longer hidden.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:17.200
 They are public knowledge. They've become public knowledge in the last 10 years, 15 years, maybe 20. But yet they're still very much part of the medical dispensary and millions and millions of people are still using these.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:30.200
 And again, I think this I think the the mind is a very, very difficult thing to reeducate, actually, with a lot of people. I think we go through school.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:48.200
 And or college and university and we study different subjects and we, you know, with I want to say this, I sound too much like a fatalist, but the force fed information or the information that we are taught and we are reading is steered by certain interests.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:57.200
 And this is what we come to understand is the way it is. And it was very much the same with me when I was studying herbal medicine in a degree that I did there in England.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:15.200
 All of the microbiology was standard medical microbiology, the pathology, again, standard pathology, tissue pathology and medicine per se was standard medicine and the drugs that we were taught about and the class of mode of action, et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:27.200
 It was all standard medical science. And so getting good information and finding finding the truth out about certain things takes a bit of work.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:38.200
 And it's actually a level of undoing the brainwashing, because when I first got speaking to you almost 10 years ago, some of the things that you were saying at the time shocked me.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:50.200
 I couldn't actually believe I was hearing it. And it sounded so extraordinary that I had to listen to it because it was so extraordinary. But I was a little skeptical to begin with, because it sounded so different.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:16:00.200
 And I think that's the very thing that people have to understand. They have to unlearn what it is that they've been processed with in terms of schooling and education because of the way that it's driven.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:29.200
 And so looking at drugs in particular, I just wanted to cover a few of those drugs with you. And I know you've got a wealth of experience behind understanding both the drugs mode of action and you have a very different opinion about the cause, if you like, of the disease for which that drug may be prescribed and actually a good understanding of the drugs action itself and a very good way of refuting it.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:42.200
 It's its existence, you know, it's it's prescription. And so I guess let's just start by saying KMUDGov or 91.1 FM from 730 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:17:03.200
 People are invited to call in with questions either related or unrelated to this month's second part comment commentary on cover up and collusion and critical thinking. And Dr. Raymond P is our guest. And from 730 to the end of the show, people are invited to call in with questions either related or unrelated to the show's topic.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:31.200
 And so please feel free to do so. And I know we're about 15,000 short of the target at the moment. So let's just close that gap.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.200
 Engineer Mike, I think you wanted to do you want to say something or you just.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:48.200
 Oh, well, we have a thank you, but it's an anonymous. Thank you. I was just waving the money to show you. So you get a little. Oh, thank you. And honestly, I love you. He's got some greenbacks. Well, I know who it is. OK. We love you even more because I know who you are.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:18:09.200
 OK, so seven or seven nine two three three nine one one to phone in for pledging and also for people who want to ask questions. And we do get people from all over. We've had people out of the States regularly. So people go ahead, please. And do donate whatever you can. If we can make this collection around the world, I'm sure we can get this 15000 done.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:33.200
 So, Dr. Peat, I wanted just to open up the repeated example of SSRIs and these commonly prescribed antidepressants and the fact that they increase quite clearly in terms of their side effects and their label warnings, the risk of suicide, violence and homicide at all ages.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:46.200
 And I think that in 2007, the FDA admitted that SSRIs can cause madness at all ages and that the drugs are very dangerous. Otherwise, daily monitoring wouldn't be needed for them.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:19:04.200
 I was earlier on and I was I was drawn to an article actually was written in 1960 and it was a study done on cyproheptadine and how beneficial cyproheptadine was. And it's actually an anti serotonin agent.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:22.200
 I find it so strange that here we are in 2018 and have been for the last decade at least been prescribed SSRIs, which is a very drugs that would block the uptake of serotonin, making it more available when actually cyproheptadine is an anti serotonin agent.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:44.200
 And I read a 1960s article which was so positively in favor of blocking serotonin, how it gave the positive benefits of it, how the SSRIs could even stand against that. I don't. What's your view of SSRIs and how they how they are working and why on earth they are prescribed?

00:19:45.200 --> 00:20:07.200
 They talk about different generations of the antidepressants and the first generation was the amino oxidase inhibitors that increased your adrenaline along with the dopamine and serotonin.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:29.200
 And the first generation, the patents expired and they wanted to sell new products. They had to find reasons for getting people to stop those which often worked very well and to move on to a new product.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:51.200
 And after the first two generations, patents had expired. They had to come up with something really new and there were various reasons for switching serotonin from a problem.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:16.200
 The carcinoid tumor that produces lots of serotonin, usually in the intestine, sometimes in the lungs, that produced insanity, depression, mania and lots of mental symptoms that in the 50s people knew as soon as they knew about serotonin, they knew it was a dangerous substance.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:32.200
 And when following the MAO, mono amino oxidase inhibitors, which worked, they needed to come up with something to build on that.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:45.200
 And it must have been the serotonin increase produced by the first generation. And so we've got a new way to increase the serotonin.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:22:10.200
 And actually a study of one of these SSRIs, so-called, they were going to try to treat vicious dogs by increasing their serotonin supposedly, which was the serenity and peacefulness and bliss transmitter.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:24.200
 And they found that the aggressive, vicious dogs actually had high serotonin. And when they gave it the SSRI, its serotonin went down as it became a pleasant dog.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:39.200
 So something which has been sold to millions of people to increase their serotonin, it actually sometimes does have good effects, but they're most likely by lowering serotonin.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:54.200
 Because it was touted originally as a treatment for depression, but you mentioned serotonin a lot of times as an inflammatory molecule and you always advocate blocking exposure to it.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 It's known to cause blood clotting, spasms of coronary arteries, other arteries, inflammation. The latest horrible thing is that it's a major factor in osteoporosis.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:25.200
 Just the excess serotonin produced by an inflamed intestine creates osteoporosis, but that's one of the side effects of drugs that increase it.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:45.200
 Again, when I was looking at material with which to substantiate the claims here, as it were, against these well-loved drugs, a 1975 article, it was actually a Polish journal of pharmacological pharmacy,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:57.200
 had an article here that read "Antiserotonin agents (Ciprohexidine) in the treatment of migraine connects the gut to the formation of migraine" in this article.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:08.200
 And you've long mentioned serotonin in the gut as an inflammatory mediator and that the gut related to migraines and headache and spasm is well established,

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:18.200
 but I think these days most people don't even really associate their gut and their bowel movement with their headache or with their mental processes.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:25.200
 That's been a major project of the medical industry in the 19th century and earlier.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:34.200
 The intestine was a central part of medical understanding of the body, right at the core of how the body works.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:48.200
 And again, with the beginning of organized so-called scientific medicine, there was a campaign to wean doctors away from the use of laxatives and enemas.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.200
 Claiming that...

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.200
 It seems too primitive, huh?

00:24:53.200 --> 00:25:08.200
 And they taught doctors that they were dangerous, addictive, all kinds of ways to incriminate and just move doctors into more mechanical treatment.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:23.200
 But in fact, if you start up in the middle of the 19th century to the more recent endotoxin studies starting 20 or 30 years ago,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.200
 you see that they were on the right track in the 19th century.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:40.200
 Now it's turning out that endotoxin, serotonin, histamine are major things in everything that goes wrong in the organism.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.200
 It's interesting you mention that about cascara.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:56.200
 I just wanted to mention that to substantiate that, cascara and cassia, both the anthraquinone-containing herbs that have laxative properties,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.200
 that help with bowel movement, relieve constipation, and by doing so, benefit the person using it,

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:07.200
 because endotoxin formation from constipation has such negative sequelae,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:15.200
 that there's almost a campaign against manufacturers that produce these products,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:22.200
 because they've gotten such a bad press, and they are casting such a bad light.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.200
 Well, that's actually an FDA conspiracy.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.200
 Right, well that's the very people, you've hit the nail on the head.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:36.200
 I won't go any further than that, but that was very much two of the plants that were in question.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:45.200
 They've gone through a series of natural substances, killing the general access to them as far as possible,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:53.200
 and assigning all rights to one company, which then increases the price a third fold,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:27:00.200
 and basically making it impossible to use the cheap natural herbal form.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.200
 It's not a conspiracy at all, it's actually the truth, folks.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.200
 But like I said, truth is always stranger than fiction.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:13.200
 Let me put you on pause there for a minute, Dr. Peat, because we have two people here lined up here to ask questions.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.200
 So let's take this first call away from, and what's your question?

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:24.200
 I'm from New York State, and my question, it's actually a follow-up question from a previous show.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.200
 I had a skin rash, and a couple of things Dr. Peat mentioned was one, the dry CO2,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.200
 but the Assault Baths 2, which I've been doing, it's gotten a lot better.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.200
 But there's two things I added that I just wanted to get your commentary on.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.200
 One, probiotics. I've been doing the cane, the carrots,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.200
 and I just don't know that that does enough to build the right bacteria,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:50.200
 given that theoretically, even if no bacteria is ideal, I don't think it's practical.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.200
 And I think from reading one of your papers, Meshnikoff,

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.200
 about Meshnikoff, he said inflammation is an exaggeration of the aging process,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.200
 or maybe those are your words, and that he consumed fermented food

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.200
 and believed that proper bacteria was the key to longevity.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.200
 So in light of that, I mean, I think the probiotics actually has been helpful to me.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.200
 It took about 15 strains, and maybe you haven't had the,

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.200
 maybe there hasn't been enough science done on it, but it seems to me that it's a positive.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:25.200
 So that's one. And the second thing I added was thymus gland and adrenal gland

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.200
 and hypothalamus, desiccated, low-heat, grass-fed animals.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.200
 And I think that's helped too, because I think you mentioned the first thing that happens

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.200
 if you have a cortisol spike on a regular basis is, you know,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.200
 your thymus gland goes first, then your muscles go.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.200
 And if you're older, over 50, you know, that to me seems like

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.200
 you never know whether your thymus gland's gone, but I figured why not take that?

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.200
 So I've added those two things. The other thing topically, the third one is

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:01.200
 vitamin E from a capsule and COQ10 squeezed out of a capsule onto the skin area,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.200
 sort of around it. Don't really think those are good ideas,

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.200
 or whether you'd have anything else to try to clear the thing up completely.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.200
 Okay, well let's get around to those three questions. Thanks for asking the questions.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.200
 So Dr. Peat, probiotics first. Let's get your take on probiotics

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.200
 and then move through the glandulars and the vitamin E, COQ10.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.200
 And we do have three more callers queued up here, so let's get started with this.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:32.200
 Yeah, getting the ideal intestinal flora would be extremely important.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.200
 It's very hard to do, though, and so it takes a lot of trial and error.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:44.200
 Yogurt works for lots of people, but sometimes it takes other bacteria.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:55.200
 My experience is that the antibiotic substances produced by Bacillus subtilis

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:03.200
 and the echiniformis, I think it is, or licheniformis, I guess,

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:10.200
 but anyway, the bacteria that produce antibiotic substances are very helpful.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:16.200
 And the bacteriophage virus that kills specific bacteria,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:21.200
 including some of them kill E. coli and some of the others that can be toxic.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.200
 And these bacteriophages are available?

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:31.200
 Yeah, a few of them are available in Life Extension Foundation, for example,

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.200
 and there are other companies making a bigger variety of them now available,

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:43.200
 but most of the work for the last 70 years has been in Eastern Europe,

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.200
 and it's just now catching on in the US.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.200
 Okay, and then what about glandulars?

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:56.200
 They are at least good nutrition, and some of them do have some active agents,

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.200
 but the glandular cortex contains a fair amount of pregnenolone.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.200
 There you go. Okay, I know you're a good supporter of pregnenolone.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.200
 And then I know you do support vitamin E's use,

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.200
 and what do you have to say about vitamin E and CoQ10 as a cutaneous treatment?

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:20.200
 Very good. They're poorly absorbed, but if you do absorb them, it's very helpful.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 Okay, all right, well there's that one. Let's take the next caller.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.200
 Caller, where are you from, and what's your question?

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.200
 I've got a comment and a question.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.200
 You were saying something about migraine headaches and pertaining to the gut.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.200
 Yeah.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:41.200
 So was there a suggestion there to keep the bowels, like enemas and that sort of thing,

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.200
 would help with migraine headaches?

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.200
 Yeah, definitely. The whole endotoxin issue surrounding poor gut motility

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.200
 is responsible for inflammation, and that inflammation is picked up in the intestine,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:02.200
 and that actually causes a reflex action for migraine,

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.200
 triggering migraines in terms of vasoconstriction.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.200
 Dr. Peat, let me just clarify your understanding of migraines

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.200
 in relation to serotonin and endotoxin.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.200
 When your blood sugar is low, your intestine is very touchy

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:24.200
 and has exaggerated reflexes, so that stretching it or bulging it with gas

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:31.200
 or with constipation or chemical inflammation from the endotoxin

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.200
 and other chemicals produced by the bacteria, any of those irritations

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.200
 is exaggerated when your blood sugar is low.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:47.200
 And a good diet, making sure your thyroid function is good to stabilize your blood sugar,

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:54.200
 can greatly reduce the incidence of migraines because your intestine

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.200
 loses that hypersensitivity when your blood sugar is good.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.200
 Okay, and then, Carla, did you have a question specifically for...

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200
 I have a comment regarding...

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200
 Comment, sorry.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.200
 You guys were saying, you were talking about psychotropic drugs or antidepressants and violence,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.200
 and my comment to you is, I had a radio program about 2 or 3 years ago,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.200
 they listed 75 people that did mass murders, and they listed the drugs that they were on

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.200
 or had just come off of or had just started.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:34.200
 There's the psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, and mass shootings,

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:40.200
 whether it be Knives, Legend, or whatever, they named all the people

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:45.200
 that did the drugs that they were on, and the Alphabet Channel, news channels,

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.200
 briefly said something about it, but then probably pushed it under the carpet,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.200
 mainly because of the pharmaceutical companies probably put pressure on people not to...

00:33:54.200 --> 00:34:00.200
 I'm guessing, I don't even know, but there is obviously a correlation with

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.200
 antidepressants and violence, is what you guys are saying.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.200
 Yeah, that's like I mentioned, the FDA is actually making a statement about it,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.200
 a public statement in 2007.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.200
 That's interesting that they said it, and it's not...

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:19.200
 My point is, they're blaming the gun, but it's not the gun, it's the person behind the gun.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.200
 Yeah, not at all, exactly.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.200
 Thank you.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.200
 Okay, you're welcome. Okay, so we do have one more call on the air.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.200
 Hang on a second, I just wanted to say that we're on the air live,

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.200
 and this is AskYourAbDoctor, so if you want to call KMED Garboville,

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:41.200
 our number here is 707-923-3911, and Dr. Peat is our long-term guest,

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.200
 and so either questions surrounding or even unrelated to this month's show,

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:50.200
 go ahead and call, and please do donate.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.200
 It's a very independent radio station, there really aren't too many like this,

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.200
 especially across the States.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.200
 In the days when I was a teenager, there was a radio station called Radio Caroline,

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.200
 and they were in the English Channel, and they were a very independent radio station,

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.200
 they were just floating out there on their boat, and they had a big transmitter.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.200
 And these kind of people, you know what, you've got to give them space,

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.200
 and free speech is very important, let's not quash it, let's keep it alive,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.200
 because there's always more than one side to an argument,

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.200
 and sometimes hearing that other side might just save your life.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.200
 So that's the reason for having Dr. Peat on the show and running the monthly shows that we do,

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.200
 so please visit the website kmud.org and donate some money now,

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:36.200
 we're still about 15,000 short on the shows, it closes at 8 o'clock,

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.200
 and that's when the pledge drive closes, so please do donate some money, keep us going.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.200
 So Dr. Peat, we do have another caller on the line,

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.200
 so let me just get the engineer back in.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.200
 Hello.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.200
 Hi, you there, good.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.200
 Where are you from, caller, and what's your question?

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.200
 I'm from London, Ontario, Canada.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.200
 I've been a listener for a little while,

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.200
 and I've heard you talk about various government agencies,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.200
 such as the CIA, FBI, and some other ones,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.200
 and I've also seen some interesting threads on the Ray Peat forum,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:14.200
 and I was wondering who you feel, or what group,

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:18.200
 is at the top of the pyramid of world power?

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.200
 Interesting.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.200
 Well, Dr. Peat, do you want to say anything to that?

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.200
 Do you have any kind of opinion who might be on top,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.200
 or is it just a generalized mania for control?

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:41.200
 Yeah, generally, people with poor judgment and bad information are in control.

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:43.200
 Yeah.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.200
 Well, there you go, let's leave it at that,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.200
 and in terms of not wanting to name names,

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.200
 the whole thing is such an embroiled soup of just deceit and dishonesty

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.200
 and poor judgment, like you say, and it's unfortunate.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.200
 It's a mixture of greed and money and power,

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.200
 and it's always been told that it's going to be the problem that we live with,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.200
 and so there's no surprise, ever since Adam and Eve.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.200
 Okay, but the bells are ringing, and the light's flashing, so...

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.200
 All right, thanks.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.200
 Okay, no, you're welcome, thanks for calling in.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.200
 Okay, so we have another caller.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.200
 Caller, you're on the air, where are you from, what's your question?

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:31.200
 Okay, that caller's out there somewhere in the...

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.200
 Engineer, can you...

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.200
 Okay, please call back.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.200
 Yeah, go ahead and call back.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.200
 Okay, so just to wrap up the whole SSRI thing,

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:46.200
 which had a lot of press and massive amounts of sales

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.200
 and lots of people being prescribed it,

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.200
 the very fact that serotonin is an inflammatory molecule

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.200
 involved with dysbiosis and poor bowel function, etc., etc.,

00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.200
 responsible for things like migraine headaches, amongst many other things,

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:05.200
 the fact that they produce an SSRI is kind of madness right there,

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.200
 so all you have to do is look at serotonin,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.200
 look at the negative effects of serotonin,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.200
 and get over the fact that they're painting it in this blissful,

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.200
 peaceful, hormone-type light,

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.200
 which is not the way serotonin is,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.200
 but that's just misinformation again, you see,

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.200
 so you have to be very careful where you get your information from

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.200
 and see who's selling it, because you'll sometimes find

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.200
 there's a very biased approach that they're taking.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.200
 Okay, so moving on from SSRIs,

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.200
 let's just talk about some other compounds,

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.200
 which I think we're all force-fed and advertised

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.200
 and are big money makers, but unfortunately,

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.200
 they're around for a long time before they've become discontinued

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.200
 or withdrawn from the market because of their side effects.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.200
 I think some of these things that I think about

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.200
 are going to be...

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.200
 I know we've mentioned the estrogens

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.200
 and the xenoestrogens that are in the environment

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.200
 that have been linked to cancers

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:06.200
 and other inflammatory degenerative processes,

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.200
 but what would you quickly say,

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.200
 because I know we've got other things to cover here,

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.200
 what would you quickly say about estrogens

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200
 and their role in cancer?

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.200
 That they synergize with radiation

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.200
 and stress,

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:28.200
 that estrogen is sort of an ultimate stress-related hormone

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.200
 like histamine and serotonin,

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.200
 and they have their place in tissue renewal,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.200
 but that place should be limited to a few hours

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:43.200
 following any trauma or tissue injury.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.200
 Right.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.200
 You've always said that really estrogens' main function,

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.200
 I think, is from an inflammatory point of view

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.200
 for implantation during...

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.200
 Yeah.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.200
 And the same thing when any tissue is injured,

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.200
 it helps to activate the cell renewal process,

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.200
 but if that continues,

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.200
 then the cell renewal turns into a tumor or...

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.200
 Right.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.200
 And there's lots of estrogen-dependent

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.200
 or estrogen-promoted tumors.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.200
 What would you quickly say,

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.200
 because we do have another couple of callers here,

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.200
 I looked at an advert, if you like,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.200
 for a product called DEL Estrogen.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:25.200
 This was a prescribing information as of November 2017,

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.200
 and I was quite pleased and shocked to see

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.200
 that it said in pretty big, bold capital letters,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.200
 "Estrogens increase the risk of endometrial cancer."

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.200
 It wasn't just that.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.200
 There was a big list of other issues associated with it,

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.200
 but they are advertising this product

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.200
 and quite blatantly telling you that it is actually

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.200
 a fairly big promoter of endometrial cancer.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.200
 And the publications in the medical journals over the years

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.200
 have claimed that estrogen is good for more than 200

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.200
 different disease conditions, all of which were proved false.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.200
 Yeah. It's almost like you tell the biggest lie

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.200
 and you have the greatest chance of getting away from it,

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.200
 or rather be the most blatant.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.200
 And people, I think, unfortunately,

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.200
 are just in a state at this point in time

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.200
 where they just don't really want to hear too much more,

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200
 because it's just too shocking.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:23.200
 And so when they freely tell you that these things cause cancer

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.200
 or they cause heart attack or stroke or increased risk of death,

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.200
 I think, unfortunately, most people are not really serious enough

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.200
 about being critically thinking about it.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.200
 Anyway, let's get the next caller.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200
 Caller, you're on the airwave from.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.200
 And what's your question?

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.200
 I'm from Long Island, and my question is

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.200
 the B vitamins.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.200
 Most B vitamins, when you take them separately,

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.200
 they're not in the right ratio and they're all synthetic.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.200
 I was thinking that, like you mentioned brewer's yeast in the past,

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.200
 that nutritional yeast, which I think has less estrogen,

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.200
 has the B vitamins in sort of a natural ratio

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.200
 and relationship plus selenium in bioavailable form.

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:10.200
 And being in the proper proportion, it would be,

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.200
 it may not be as large a dosage,

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.200
 but it seems like it would be a much better way to go

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.200
 for the body to absorb them and help with digestion

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.200
 and all other aspects when in the right form.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.200
 I would say this right off the bat.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.200
 Dr. Peat does not, he really is not a very big advocate

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.200
 for vitamins per se, and he's much more based on his food.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.200
 But if you have to take any kind of vitamins, Dr. Peat,

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.200
 knowing what you know about their manufacturing process, etc.,

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.200
 what would you have to say about vitamins that we think

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.200
 might be okay for you, and/or what do you have to say

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.200
 about nutritional yeast?

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:50.200
 Nutritional yeast does have a good range of the B vitamins.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:56.200
 The drawbacks besides the small amount of estrogen

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:02.200
 is indigestible starch and the high phosphate content

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.200
 so if you use it for a supplement, using it for several days

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.200
 is okay, but you don't want to use it as a major part

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.200
 of your diet because of that high phosphate content

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.200
 unless you take measures to balance it with calcium.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.200
 And then what about good, are there any good vitamins out there?

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.200
 Actually, how good?

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.200
 I stopped using oral vitamins in the 1970s

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:33.200
 because I had some extreme allergic reactions to vitamin B2

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:41.200
 and folic acid, which being yellow-colored,

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:45.200
 they're absorbers of even visible light,

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.200
 causing chemical reactions to happen,

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:53.200
 and that means that before you get them into your mouth,

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.200
 you're likely to have been exposed to oxygen and radiation

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.200
 that has activated free radical processes,

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:07.200
 making a pretty bad risk for allergy.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:11.200
 Okay, I think we have three people kind of queued up.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.200
 One other question about vitamins,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.200
 you mentioned magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.200
 but if they're less bioavailable,

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.200
 wouldn't your body treat them as toxins too,

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.200
 if they're not as bioavailable?

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.200
 In fact, the magnesium supplements very often cause migraines

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:34.200
 and asthma symptoms because of probably some contaminant in them,

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.200
 but in your stomach, the stomach acid generally

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.200
 will turn much of the supplement,

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:47.200
 such as magnesium carbonate, into magnesium chloride,

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.200
 which is instantly absorbed.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.200
 Gotcha.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.200
 Oh, by the way, are you blood type B?

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.200
 What was that?

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.200
 Is your blood type blood type B?

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.200
 I don't know my blood type.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.200
 All right, thanks for your question.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.200
 Let's get this next caller.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.200
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.200
 Hi, I'm from Northern California.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:13.200
 I'm 77 and I'm a sustaining member of KMUD,

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.200
 and I love it and I listen to it almost exclusively,

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.200
 and your show sounds great.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.200
 I've had some high thyroid issues and been taking my own,

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.200
 you know, my own whatever you call it, every day, twice a day,

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:31.200
 and it goes, you know, between 170 and 144,

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.200
 and then it goes down to 113,

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.200
 and I was wondering what you think of,

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.200
 what your approach is to high blood pressure.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.200
 Do you, how do you feel about, for instance,

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.200
 lisinopril, is that how you pronounce it?

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.200
 That's how you pronounce it.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.200
 I haven't taken it yet, but I've been,

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.200
 you know, I have a bottle of it here,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.200
 and I'm wondering whether I should do it or not.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.200
 So don't be, high blood pressure,

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.200
 and I know specifically the person's asking about lisinopril, but...

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:07.200
 Big doses of vitamin K often cure it in just a week or two,

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.200
 but getting enough calcium in your diet,

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.200
 especially in relation to phosphate,

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.200
 calcium and vitamin D are extremely important,

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:25.200
 and then if you can't do it with good nutrition,

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:31.200
 then of all the medical approaches that I know of,

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:38.200
 the angiotensin blockers and the ACE inhibitors

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.200
 are the safest medical approaches that I know of.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.200
 And how much vitamin K, thank you, would you recommend?

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.200
 I know people who, Lord,

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:54.200
 they're chronically extremely high blood pressure,

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.200
 over 200, over 100.

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:02.200
 Lord, their pressure within a week or two,

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.200
 down to the normal range,

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.200
 by taking 30 to 50 milligrams a day,

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.200
 and then stopping.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.200
 30 to 50?

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.200
 Yeah, milligrams of vitamin K.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.200
 And that's a vitamin pill, you're saying?

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.200
 No, it's generally a liquid, but I know you can get a pill.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.200
 Oh, it's a liquid, okay.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.200
 The liquid form is what I use,

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.200
 but there are obviously tableted versions of it,

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.200
 but Thorne Research does a good one milligram per drop.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.200
 Actually, now I think there's actually 10 milligrams per drop,

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.200
 but they do a liquid vitamin K2,

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.200
 which is a supplement that I would recommend most people go find.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.200
 And you take it on an empty stomach?

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.200
 Yeah, it doesn't really matter,

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.200
 it's only a drop or two drops or whatever,

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.200
 but even if you're taking more than that,

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.200
 20 or 30 drops, it wouldn't be a problem, regardless.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.200
 Can you eat vitamin K in something, also?

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.200
 Well, it's generated by your gut,

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.200
 but in your gut flora, generally produce vitamin K.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.200
 Oh, I see.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.200
 And then you said calcium also, and D?

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.200
 Calcium and vitamin D, yeah, they're both...

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.200
 Oh, vitamin D.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.200
 Yeah, they're intimately related.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200
 D3?

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.200
 Yeah.

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.200
 And how much of that would you suggest?

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.200
 Well, you want about 4,000 to 6,000, 8,000 IU.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.200
 It's very different from person to person,

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:22.200
 if you get your blood drawn,

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.200
 and I think the reference range is above 30 nanograms per milliliter,

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.200
 or nanograms per deciliter.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.200
 Somewhere in the range of 50 is probably better.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.200
 I think the upper limit is 70 or 75,

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.200
 and I find people that take 2 or 4,000 a day,

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.200
 sometimes they have very low vitamin D labs,

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.200
 and some people that can take 8 or 10 or 12,

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.200
 they still have normal vitamin D,

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.200
 so it's quite important to get your vitamin D tested.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.200
 It's not an expensive lab,

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.200
 but it'll give you a good idea of where it is,

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.200
 and then you can get retested in a month or two months

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.200
 and see where you are.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.200
 So take the K and the calcium and the D3,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.200
 and I also take thyroid medicine.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.200
 I had my thyroid removed.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.200
 Okay.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.200
 Thyroid supplement often lowers the blood pressure.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.200
 You want to keep your TSH fairly low,

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.200
 at the low end of the normal range,

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.200
 because TSH itself is responsible for increasing blood pressure.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.200
 Okay, terrific.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.200
 Thank you very much.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.200
 I'm looking at this medicine,

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.200
 and I'm just nervous about getting involved with Acinopril.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.200
 Try natural alternatives first and see how they work for you.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.200
 That's my advice.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.200
 And then hopefully you're supporting KMUD financially.

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.200
 I am.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.200
 I'm a sustaining member.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.200
 Excellent.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.200
 I didn't really want to put you on the spot,

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.200
 and you didn't have to answer.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.200
 No, no, no.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.200
 I believe in this station.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.200
 It's great.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.200
 Awesome.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.200
 I listen to it all the time.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.200
 Thank you so much.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.200
 You're welcome.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200
 Okay, good.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.200
 We've got people calling in.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.200
 Got it.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:12.200
 We've got eight minutes to go.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.200
 I wanted just to quickly,

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.200
 I know we're not going to get through what I had prepared here,

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.200
 and perhaps we can just carry on with it next month,

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.200
 but I like it when the calls come in thick and fast.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.200
 I know Dr. Peat feels the same way about it,

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.200
 but he's obviously very able to give plenty of information

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.200
 without really having to answer questions,

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.200
 but I know he kind of enjoys it.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:33.200
 I just wanted to mention a couple of things related to SSRIs.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.200
 Articles that are 2018, so published this year,

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.200
 and this is things like

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.200
 "Bleeding induced by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.200
 a case report and review of literature."

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.200
 That's a 2018 article.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:51.200
 Another one here in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.200
 "Gastrointestinal bleeding risk of SSRI by level of kidney function."

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.200
 So this is people with decreased kidney function

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.200
 have definite increased risk of bleeding.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.200
 Anyway, there's hundreds and thousands of articles.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.200
 So don't just accept what your doctor tells you

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.200
 as being something that's safe for you.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.200
 Question it.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.200
 It's your right to question what it is you're being told,

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.200
 just like it's your right to question what I'm telling you.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.200
 I don't expect you to go away and just believe everything I say.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.200
 Go and find it out for yourself.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.200
 That reminds me,

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.200
 just last week I've heard from two people

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:30.200
 that when their doctor prescribed a certain drug,

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.200
 immediately they started feeling terrible.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.200
 It felt like it was killing them.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.200
 And I said, "Well, why don't you stop it?"

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.200
 And they both have said,

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.200
 "My appointment isn't for two or three weeks yet,

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.200
 and I can't stop it until the doctor takes me off it."

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.200
 Oh my gosh.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.200
 So the doctor, unfortunately, is elevated to such a supernatural position.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.200
 It's so bizarre.

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.200
 It's so bizarre.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.200
 I don't know if there's anything else.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.200
 The priests are probably the only other class of people

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.200
 that people would listen to without questioning so much.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.200
 Anyway, the lights are flashing.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.200
 I guess people are calling in.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:09.200
 So hopefully people are calling in and they're donating.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.200
 The number is 707-923-3911.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.200
 And we need another probably I don't know how many thousand.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.200
 Let's say it was 15 when I came on.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.200
 Hopefully it's less than that now.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.200
 Please do donate.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200
 Visit the website, kmed.org.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.200
 Push the red donate button and please donate some money.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.200
 I also wanted to mention an article, Dr. Peat,

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.200
 that I looked at just amongst other articles

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:34.200
 supporting cyproheptadine back in the 60s.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:38.200
 And the main reason for cyproheptadine

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.200
 was because it was an antiserotonin agent.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.200
 And yet here we are in 2018.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:49.200
 And all you've kind of constantly said in the past on radio shows

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:52.200
 that there's lots of material from the 30s, 40s and 50s

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:54.200
 which has just gotten buried

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.200
 because the advent of modern "medicine"

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.200
 and the corporate interests that are driving it

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.200
 and steering the ideology behind it have buried it.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.200
 One study found that a small dose of cyproheptadine

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.200
 was effective against lymphoma.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.200
 Yeah.

00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:15.200
 Anyway, okay.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.200
 I know it's 5-2.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.200
 I don't think we're going to get time for any more callers.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.200
 But I wanted to hopefully next month question you

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.200
 about all of these things that I think people unfortunately

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.200
 just take for granted as being things that we should take.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.200
 Things like the lipid-lowering drugs.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.200
 I know we've mentioned statins in the past.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.200
 And there's plenty of very respectable people

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.200
 campaigning against them.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.200
 And then the ADD and ADHD drugs,

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.200
 which are basically the amphetamines.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.200
 And then all the other cardiovascular drugs

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.200
 that people are taking.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.200
 I mean, that last caller there

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.200
 who was being prescribed licinopril.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.200
 I'm not saying she shouldn't take it,

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.200
 but there's plenty that you can do

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.200
 that's alternative to it.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.200
 So don't just jump into the first drugs you're prescribed.

00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.200
 And then other things, Alzheimer's drugs.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.200
 And I wanted to ask you some more about

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.200
 your belief in some of the other things

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.200
 that you've researched over these last four or five decades.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.200
 Well, thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.200
 And I'll point people to your website.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.200
 Okay, thanks.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.200
 Okay, so Dr. Peat can be reached

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.200
 at www.raypeat.com

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:24.200
 and fully referenced articles,

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.200
 many different subjects.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.200
 And like I said, fully referenced.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.200
 And he's been spending a long time,

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.200
 probably 40 years here,

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.200
 doing what he's doing.

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.200
 And he's very, very purposeful.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.200
 And he's very altruistic.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.200
 And he's not doing it for money, folks.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.200
 So please take a look at his work.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.200
 And for all those people that are listening

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.200
 at this point in time

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.200
 and who have donated and have pledged,

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.200
 thank you.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:51.200
 And for those people who are thinking about it,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.200
 please get off the fence and push that button.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.200
 However much it is you decide,

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:57.200
 it's all going to add up towards

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.200
 enabling this radio station's survival

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.200
 and continuance into 2019.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.200
 We're probably never going to stop raising money.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.200
 That's just the nature of being independent.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.200
 So don't be surprised.

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:11.200
 And sometimes you just have to be careful

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.200
 about the people that you do support.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.200
 Maybe it's time for you to not support other things

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.200
 and start supporting KMAD

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.200
 in terms of what it is you hear from them.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:22.200
 So until October of this year,

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.200
 I'll say goodnight.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.200
 And we can be reached

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.200
 www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.200
 during normal business hours.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.200
 And thank you for listening.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.200
 Until October, when the clocks roll back,

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.200
 I'll see you then.
