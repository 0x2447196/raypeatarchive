WEBVTT

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.680
 My name is Guillermo Martin and I welcome you to Cooperation Paradigm.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:13.120
 We are a platform on a mission to spread the idea that cooperation beats competition.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.520
 That working together is not just nicer but also more effective and that we can transform

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.360
 our world if we agree to collaborate, to work with each other.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.800
 Today we are honored to have Dr. Raymond Peat. For those who do not know our guest today,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 Dr. Peat is a scientist, writer, teacher, and artist whose work continues to influence the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.800
 thinking of thousands of readers worldwide. Even though much of Dr. Peat's work centers around

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.680
 how our health is affected by our environment, I personally think his greatest contribution

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.840
 is to teach us all how to be free thinkers, how to question everything and be critical.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.480
 And he has done this through his example, through his personal work.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.480
 So before we start the interview I really want to thank Dr. Peat for his career and for his

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:17.280
 contributions because he really has done so much for us. Today we will talk about a few things

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.120
 intelligence in nature, artificial scarcity in our world, and how to create a healthier society

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.560
 among other things. I apologize for the sound quality is not the best

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.200
 but definitely very, very worth listening always to Dr. Peat. So here we go.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 So Dr. Peat, in your opinion, is there a guiding intelligence in the evolution of the species

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 or is it just random mutations that are selected by the environment as neo-darwinists propose?

00:01:51.760 --> 00:02:04.640
 My picture of the big picture or the cosmology grew out of reading several people.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:17.600
 Vladimir Vernadsky, for example, was one of my influences. Frederick Soddy, the physicist

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:31.040
 who is known for his idea of isotopes. I think that is his main identification. But he was

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:45.440
 a theorist about the nature of cosmic rays and cosmic energy. Looking at all of my influences,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:59.360
 especially Frederick Soddy, I think it is justifiable and reasonable to think that the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.200
 cosmos itself, the universe, is in the process of growth. The Russian astronomer,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 N.A. Kozyrev, discovered eruptions on the dark side of the moon, volcanic eruptions,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.280
 which were ridiculed at the time. But he developed a theory of stellar energy,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.440
 which would account for the internal heat of all of the cosmic bodies, including the earth and the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:44.080
 moon. He correctly predicted that the outer planets would be producing more heat than they

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:55.920
 received from the sun. Putting these ideas together with Fred Soddy's, it looks like the universe is

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:04.800
 increasing in energy and in substance. Planets are growing warmer, more energetic,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:18.000
 and substance is increasing, mass is increasing. A geologist proposed the expanding earth hypothesis,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.160
 which is just an extension of Kozyrev's and the other physicists' ideas of an actively,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:41.040
 energetically expanding, growing universe. So that's the big picture, that things are

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:49.920
 constantly in flux at every level, the microscopic as well as the macroscopic.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:04.480
 Looking at the small-scale biology and physics, with that perspective, you see

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:18.080
 everything in flux, and you realize that the doctrines that are dominating pretty much the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:28.720
 world for the last 200 years are based on some Christian, mostly Christian, theological ideas.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.920
 Kozyrev explained how the doctrine of thermodynamic

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:49.680
 directionality was an arbitrary choice, more theology than observation or science.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:11.440
 This approach, the theological, theologically based physics, had to conceive of atoms

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:23.600
 as being unchangeable, not subject to time except in the idea that there is a statistical lifespan

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:34.880
 of every particle. But other than that, no atom has a history. It's like a platonic

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:45.920
 ideal out of time. And this is where Vernadsky had a revolutionary influence,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:57.360
 seeing every atom as having a history. In high school textbooks, when I was in high school,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:11.120
 a standard experiment referred to nascent oxygen, newly born oxygen, has for several seconds

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:22.080
 chemical reactivity that's very different from quiescent old oxygen. But more than that, every

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:33.040
 atom has its history in the sense of a flow through the organism. He described an organism

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:50.800
 as a whirlwind of atoms. That's my basic approach. You have to look at the practical meaning of

00:07:50.800 --> 00:08:00.720
 intelligence and guidance is in the system, the energy flowing from the sun into the earth,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:14.960
 for example, drives this whirlwind of atoms. And in the response to this flow of energy,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:25.200
 you have the organized interaction of atoms guided by the flowing energy.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:33.040
 Right. And that was kind of like my next question because you said that cooperation is a property

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:40.800
 of matter itself. It creates order everywhere that energy flows. So obviously to have order,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:48.720
 we need energy, but order implies some kind of guidance or intelligence. Otherwise,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:58.560
 you don't have order, you have chaos, I assume. In the framework of this growing

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:07.600
 energetic universe and the flow of energy from hot spots to less hot spots,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:19.280
 every place in the universe, there is energy flowing. And every place that flows, you have the

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:30.960
 tendency in response to the flow to align, the individual aligns with the flow of energy.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:44.960
 One of my experiments years ago was to pass an electrical current through an egg, putting an

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:57.680
 electrode in each side of an egg and measuring the resistance. As the voltage rises, the flow

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:08.480
 increases, and as the voltage falls, the flow keeps going because the resistance was decreased.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:18.720
 The material of the egg white aligned itself to make the current pass more freely. And

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:27.280
 that's the sort of process that Vernadsky saw as generating more and more complex organisms.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:40.160
 He saw animals, for example, are growing bigger and bigger brains and bodies to assimilate and

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:53.040
 preserve more and more of that flow of energy. So the intelligence of the organism, as he saw it,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:04.880
 was being responsive to this flow of energy. So the more energy that flows and can be

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.440
 assimilated, the more intelligence there is. If you said that planets and objects in the

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.200
 universe are increasing in substance and the universe is increasing in matter,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.480
 so that energy, we can assume that as time goes by, there will be higher levels of

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:38.080
 organization and intelligence in a way. Towards the end of his life, Vernadsky was at the end of

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:46.000
 the World War II. He said despite all of the chaos that we're seeing, he was confident that

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.240
 the energy of the planet would gradually help us grow out of the chaotic political world situation.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:04.320
 Some scientists and philosophers speak of a universe that is able to experience,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:11.840
 to have consciousness. If this idea became accepted, how do you think our relationship

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.880
 with the world would change knowing that this world, this universe, somehow has awareness,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:32.480
 consciousness? If you see the flow of energy through matter as being what creates experience,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:42.160
 if you aren't warm and respiring, having a flow of energy through your brain,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:50.160
 you aren't conscious and experiencing. So if the flow of energy through your brain slows down,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:13:03.040
 your consciousness decreases. The dominant philosophy among my professors all the time

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:12.080
 from high school through graduate school, my professors were generally committed to the idea

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:21.680
 that animals are unconscious. Even at the extreme, they were saying that children aren't conscious

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:35.440
 until they're a year and a half or two years old and begin to talk. I think in simple societies,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:44.320
 people have an animist approach. They see everything as having a soul or a mind.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:55.200
 Some cultures have kept more of this attitude, others less. The Anglo-American

00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:04.240
 culture of the last hundred years has been very exaggerated in denying that the world is alive

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:21.760
 and that things are aware. In the medical description of autism, the brain or metabolic

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:34.400
 condition that produces the regression and the condition called autism, the outstanding feature

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:44.800
 is that they are unaware of the mind and consciousness of other people or of animals.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:53.760
 They don't understand the emotions or intentions of others. It's called mind-blindness.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:08.720
 Most of my science professors in the 1960s and 70s, I would say were mind-blind or autistic

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:20.240
 in their view of the universe. We know that the truth is coming out and more scientists are

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:26.880
 pointing to this. Even little amoeba and microorganisms have this incredible awareness

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:34.000
 of their surroundings. Speaking of their surroundings, I would like to talk about society,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.920
 in the context of our environment as humans. Do you believe that we currently have the means

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:51.200
 to provide for everyone on this planet to thrive? People over the years are calculated that the

00:15:51.200 --> 00:16:01.280
 productive capacity of the land, the amount of sunlight needed to produce a certain amount of

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:15.440
 food. The Earth is very easily able to sustain about 10 billion people in good nutrition and

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:26.720
 good living conditions if things are properly organized. There has been a very deliberate

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:34.320
 organized effort to create artificial scarcity in the depression in the United States.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:43.040
 There were huge surpluses of food that no one could afford to buy and so people were starving

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:52.080
 while these hordes of food existed. Even in the 1940s,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:01.600
 approaching 1950, there were great famines through India in particular while the U.S.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:10.960
 was having a great problem economically with gigantic over surplus of grains.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:20.320
 On a world level, the same condition existed that had existed within the United States during the

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:35.280
 Depression. One of the Nobel Prizes in that period was to Irving Langmuir. He was

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:43.840
 notable for having discovered how to make light bulbs burn out in a few weeks or months

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:52.800
 so that they could sell more light bulbs. That was a big part of American science research,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:18:04.960
 how to make products useless; how to make them wear out faster. You said something really interesting that if things were organized,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:11.280
 the planet could provide for 10 billion people. Organizing in a certain way, in a collaborative

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:17.440
 way. What we see is that society is organized purposely but not to work with each other,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:32.320
 not to collaborate to almost the opposite, to divide. That's built into the economic system that people who challenge it

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:45.920
 are excluded. Teachers who advocate too much change in the system don't get to continue teaching.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:55.920
 You talk sometimes about the ruling class. It's the ruling class that sets the tone and the

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:02.560
 expectations and anybody that is trying to change the paradigm and challenge the status quo.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.680
 You're saying that they are going to be excluded and they want to divide and conquer.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:25.520
 They control schools as well as the publication media. The internet is now being censored heavily

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:38.400
 by the ruling class interests. The ruling class is part of the same ecosystem. They are part of our society.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:47.360
 How can we make them see that it's also in their best benefit in the long term. In the short term,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.480
 sure, they have this greed and power. I'm sure that feels good. In the long term,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.800
 it's better for everyone, including them, to collaborate, to not divide and conquer,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.840
 but to actually distribute things in a rational way. How can we approach these people

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.640
 and try to convince them that that's the best way for everyone, including them?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:22.800
 About 40 or 50 years ago, I was discussing that issue. I was starting to see the offspring of the

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:30.560
 ruling class. Some of them were starting to have exactly that realization that

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:41.200
 everyone is in it together. That has been a very slow process. You can see some of the errors to

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:53.200
 big fortunes becoming interested in preserving the ecosystems, but it has to start happening a lot

00:20:53.200 --> 00:21:02.000
 faster. If you could pass a law tomorrow, a law that is going to be binding, that people need to

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.360
 enforce the authorities, what would that be? What would you do if you had that power for one day?

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:20.240
 One of the first things that occurs to a person is to equalize the money supply, but that has always

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:32.960
 been made impossible. I think maybe a better place, if you could just start at one aspect

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:45.440
 of the society, I think canceling all licenses. People are licensed to create scarcity. Very much

00:21:46.320 --> 00:22:02.800
 medical care would be economically available, and all of the prescription drugs would lose their

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:10.000
 exorbitant prices if all of the licensing functions were simply canceled.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:23.680
 I want to know if the person that is going to treat me knows something, I guess. What you're

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:29.600
 saying is that it shouldn't be illegal for somebody to treat the other person as long as

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.600
 the other person knows that that person doesn't have a certain certification, but it's okay with

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:45.680
 that. The problem is that people believe that the medical license means that they have

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:57.280
 the knowledge and capacity to cure, but the majority of medical practice as it exists now

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:06.240
 is probably counterproductive. I think it's making people sicker on balance. Longevity

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:17.360
 in the United States has been decreasing the last several years, and the number of people

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:26.400
 killed by medical accidents, even accidents recognized by the medical profession,

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:35.920
 it's several times worse than the deaths in traffic accidents. It's approaching

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:45.120
 the death rate from cancer and heart disease, simply errors that are made in hospitals.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:52.960
 Yes, I always tend to see things in a way that is cooperation versus competition.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.120
 I guess that's why we're having this conversation, but I believe that the people behind these

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.800
 corporations and even medical institutions have their mindset of collaborating and helping the

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:12.800
 ecosystem, helping humanity. They will free a lot of their resources, they will drop the prices and

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:20.960
 the margins that they make on certain medications, which are really extremely high and necessary to

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:32.320
 do. I see what you're saying, and I agree. The universities are set up to exclude people.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:42.160
 I was an English teacher for a while, and the department head told us that we had to

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:51.120
 fail about half of our students, half of the freshmen students. That would indicate that

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:58.160
 their standards were high, but it really meant a failure to teach them adequately.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:08.480
 Speaking of education, you've written a lot about helping individuals to become healthier

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:15.440
 and having more energy, but it seems that we are always fighting against a stressful environment,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.720
 competitive environment, and obviously this makes things difficult for us to thrive.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:28.480
 How can we create a healthier society, like a healthier lake, so that the

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.840
 fish are healthier, stronger in terms of our context? How can we do that?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:45.360
 The whole economy is set up in ways that are poisoning our health. People have to commute

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:55.760
 to work and spend hours at work. Usually a big part of that is in meaningless activity just being present.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:16.640
 I don't think it's possible to maintain the present work environment. Many of the problems that I hear is about the meaninglessness

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:26.640
 of the work that they're doing, seeing the world as having meaning. Your own life doesn't really

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:34.720
 have meaning if you see the world as a meaningless competition for status.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:46.000
 It always comes back to this. For me and every person that I talk to, the quickest way to make

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.800
 our society healthier is to change the way the economy runs. It's just making people sick,

00:26:53.360 --> 00:27:01.520
 really. When I hear about robots replacing people, to me that's always good news,

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:08.480
 because I think that's wonderful. That's why we invent the tractors, so that we don't have to do

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.480
 the job. But most people in the news, they say, "No, it's a bad thing. Unemployment!" I think it's

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:25.440
 wonderful. 75 years ago and more, I was hearing people talking about automation and how it would

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:35.200
 make it possible for people to have to work only two days a week. In the 1940s, that was the

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:44.880
 calculation that robots would ease everyone's workload. But what it did was make fewer people

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:53.760
 have jobs and increase the unemployed and increase the poverty.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:01.600
 They are energy productive materials. You talk about a lot of these, like pregnenolone and

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:08.640
 progesterone, things like that, hormones. How about those energy protective thoughts that we can

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.760
 entertain in our minds? What effect do they have in our health and which ones are important in

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:28.880
 education to foster? I think from first grade through graduate school, there should be a curriculum

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:42.320
 assuming that the whole world has meaning and that the individual being educated should be

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:58.480
 helped to relate to this world of meaning. As it exists, all of these levels are being funneled

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:10.800
 into serving the industry as it exists, making them better competitors rather than better

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:24.000
 cooperators. That starts early in grade school and you can see it competition to get into medical

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:33.440
 school, for example. The whole college undergraduate experience for people who want to get into medical

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:47.680
 school is invalidated by this competitive focus on getting a good future job. Yeah. I heard that they don't share notes. They don't share notes and things like that.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:30:06.320
 The whole culture and language are being deformed by this competitive

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:15.840
 attitude towards education. I taught linguistics for a while, the theory and structure of language.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:27.120
 My emphasis was on how is communication possible through these

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:38.880
 structures of language. When you have to make up a sentence which has never been spoken before,

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:54.480
 how is a person able to discover your meaning? I think it reduces to the fact that your intention

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:08.640
 to invent and express a new meaning has to elicit an inventive response to invent an understanding

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:21.200
 of your novel, innovative expression. I think you can see communication through language

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:29.440
 as an extension of the actual communication that exists in all animal species.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:39.520
 Ants and bees, for example, have been studied somewhat for the way they intelligently understand

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:45.440
 novel environments and how they communicate that to other members of the group.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:01.760
 People at present, in the educational system geared towards competition, people aren't behaving

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:13.040
 as intelligently as ants and bees because they don't realize that expression is always

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:33.920
 inventive and innovative, and delivering something intrinsically useful. So a language reflects our behavior and I'm assuming it works in both ways. If we

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:41.600
 change our language, that could also affect our behavior in my opinion. That's why I'm always

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.960
 trying to change the mindset of people when they say, oh, we need to be more competitive.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:53.840
 I say, no, we need to be more competent if you want, but we don't need to be more competitive.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:01.440
 We need to be more collaborative. If we make a trendy topic, a trendy word, and we change the

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:11.120
 language, do you agree that these will also change behavior and work in both ways? Yeah, the idea of

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:21.520
 competition in education extends to attitudes towards novel ideas. If you invent something

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:32.240
 useful, the pressure is to copyright it or pass it. Instead of communicating it and getting it into

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:45.200
 work, the artificial scarcity pressures people. Even in university departments, they have

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:56.960
 classified research that they can't talk about -- business... But when you put out ideas,

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:09.920
 you're actually going to have a return with an advantage you get back more than you've put out.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:20.880
 You shared this quote with me and I really love it, by Bertrand Russell. "The only thing that will

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:27.840
 redeem mankind is cooperation." How do you see this redemption happening in the near future?

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:43.440
 I doubt that it is happening in the near future, but it's something that is always possibly

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:55.040
 only a moment away. It's something that could be instantly started, but there are forces that are

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:10.240
 turning it off faster than it can be started. I think individuals have to see themselves

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:26.240
 as autonomous creators who are going to be enriched by sharing with other autonomous creative

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:40.160
 individuals. I think that's the only kind of process that can't be stopped if people try to

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:50.320
 establish an organized structure in opposition to the ruling class's interests.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.520
 The ruling class always has the means to disrupt that organization.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:08.560
 So if people see themselves as creative individuals, cooperating organizations will

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:20.800
 be spontaneously come into existence as appropriate. I think that's how intelligence works in the

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:31.040
 animal and plant world. When there's a problem, the organism spontaneously has the intelligence

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:41.440
 to solve the problem appropriately. I think that's how the survival of society is going to

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:48.320
 have to come about. If we understand the laws of physics and the way energy flows and everything,

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:56.080
 it's only a matter of time that we will create enough organization and we will have enough

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:04.720
 intelligence to overcome these issues and overcome the power over control of the ruling class. We

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:14.240
 will succeed as having a thriving civilization. That's the idea that the planet is actually

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:24.720
 increasing in its potential and energy flow. The increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:34.560
 for Vernadsky in 1945, that was a very promising thing. He said the metabolic rate of the world is

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:44.400
 increasing. So planetary warming is a constructive thing, increasing the intelligence of all of the

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:54.320
 components of the ecosystems and hopefully of society. Yes, and I agree with that. I tell

00:37:54.320 --> 00:38:00.080
 people sometimes that actually warmer planet is better because where do we see more life

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.840
 in the tropics. It's not in the North Pole that we see life. Now, I agree that we should get there

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:10.800
 in a natural way, not using any fossil fuels and things like that. We should let

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:16.480
 a natural world take care of things. Any closing thoughts, Dr. Peat, today?

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:31.360
 No, just that things are not as hopeless as they look from the official perspectives.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:41.360
 When you see the organism, the planet and the cosmos as an organism advancing,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.680
 I think there's reason to have confidence that appropriate intelligence will arise as needed.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:00.640
 Dr. Peat, we all would like to support your work. I know you keep researching and writing.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.600
 I believe there is a newsletter that you share with people. How can we

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.160
 connect with that and support your work through this newsletter?

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:19.760
 The newsletter address and email is raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:27.600
 Do we send you a way to sign up for the newsletter?

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:35.680
 Yes, by PayPal. It's $28 for 12 bi-monthly issues. That's two years.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:43.200
 I will leave the information in the description of this video. Again, Dr. Peat, thank you so much

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.360
 for your time today. I really appreciate it. Okay, thank you. I hope you liked that interview.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:57.760
 We all need to listen to a few times. Dr. Peat definitely points out to critical things in our

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:05.520
 world to move forward, to improve, and please support him. We are lucky that he is still

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.120
 doing research and sharing with all of us, so let's just support Dr. Raymond Peat and also support

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:18.400
 this channel and click subscribe, share with your friends, spread the word cooperation. It's the way

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:26.800
 forward cooperation beats competition. Thank you so much and I'll see you on the next.
