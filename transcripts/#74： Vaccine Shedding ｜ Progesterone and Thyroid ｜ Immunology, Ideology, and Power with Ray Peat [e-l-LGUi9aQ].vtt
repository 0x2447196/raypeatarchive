00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 One, and we're live, Georgie Dinkov, Ray Peat.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 Ray, how are you? It's been two months, feels like forever.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Catch us up on everything that's going on with you.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Yeah, I'm good. My voice is pretty much recovered from the laryngitis.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 I mean, do you think it's just the stress of everything and the winter?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 I mean, I'm in a pretty cold house right now, and I've had to make a lot of adjustments

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 just because of how cold it is.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 I think what started it was eating some bacon that was cured with celery juice powder.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 It's a very allergenic material, and I think I gradually built up into a generalized allergic reaction

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 that was like an intense cold as far as my voice was concerned.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 And you're really somebody, the only person I know talking about how really terrible the food supply is

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 and how so many allergens that people think might be benign or not that harmful

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 can cause serious symptoms like you're describing.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 Yeah, the market is full of good solutions to problems that never existed.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Just very intense salt, sodium chloride, is fine for curing pork, making bacon.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 You just have to then soak some of the salt out of it to make it ready to eat.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 But many years ago, they found that a little bit of the sodium or potassium nitrate or nitrate

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 would give it a pink color and suppress bacteria growth.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 And so that became the rule. But then when someone discovered that it could be carcinogenic in very large amounts,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 some crops, I forget which the worst ones are, but if there's a heavy nitrogen fertilizer in commercial vegetable crops,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 the vegetable becomes carcinogenic because of the extreme amount of nitrate and nitrite it contains.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 So to create an alternative market, someone took the powder, the juice of these toxic industrial crops

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 and dehydrated the powder, found that the vegetable juice contained enough nitrate and nitrite to produce the pink color

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 that people wanted in ham and bacon.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 And so that has become very popular now as supposedly a safe bacon,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 but it has exactly as much nitrate and nitrite as the bacon and ham made with the pure chemicals.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 But it also contains the complex, extreme allergens that some of these plants have.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Celery juice happens to be on the edge of toxic ordinarily, even if you aren't allergic to it.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 But if you're allergic to it, then it can become extremely harmful.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Well, the great news is we don't have to worry about the additives they're putting in the meat

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 because nobody will be eating meat anymore soon.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 Yeah.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 So, Ray, everybody's just dying to hear your current thoughts.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 I know we talk about it every single time, but that's the primary question everybody's always asking me.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 What is new? What is happening?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Maybe we can even back up a little bit.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 What is going on, if somebody was clueless as to what was happening?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 What is going on right now?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 In the winter and spring of 2020, I was saying essentially nothing is going on at that time.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Nothing unusual was happening in the world.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Health condition.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 But the only thing that was happening was a gigantic, highly organized scheme to convince people,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 to scare people that some deadly new pathogen was circulating.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 And I forget which newsletter it was, but fairly early in 2020, I described my interpretation of part of the background.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 What is that for all through 2019, the germ warfare lab at Fort Detrick kept announcing that it was having spills leaking designer viruses into the environment.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 And finally, the parent agency, I guess it was the Department of Health, whatever,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 that shut down what had been known for decades as the germ warfare laboratory.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 And for them to have all of these little stories put into the press over a period of a few months,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 and then to take the step of closing the whole germ warfare laboratory, I took that to be very significant.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 Ordinarily, they completely covered those up, don't have press releases that viruses might be leaking into the environment around Fort Detrick.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 And then that summer, there were cases of novel pneumonia that were blamed on the chemical cigarette substitutes,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 but they resembled in some ways the virus that later was known as COVID.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And then the military, the annual military games between nations was taking place in Wuhan.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Early fall, I think it was, September or October, and the athletes, ordinarily the army or military athletes,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 are made up of people training as Olympic competitors who use the military as a way to keep their amateur status.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 And this year, 2019, the Americans were ridiculously incompetent athletes,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 the historical worst showing of American military athletes since the games had been done.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 And someone who had worked at Fort Detrick interpreted that the same way that I did,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 that following a string of highly publicized leaks from the U.S. germ warfare lab,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 then having the military circulate among the Chinese in the military competitions,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 and that just happened to be before the supposed leak from Wuhan.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 So to anyone who knows the history of American germ warfare,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 that being so open and public about the connections seemed like any sensible potential enemy

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 would have to consider the possibility that the U.S. was actually preparing a release in China

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 of their engineered viruses from Fort Detrick.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 The Chinese, I imagine, would have interpreted that about the same way I and many others did,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 that this was an ambiguous announcement that there could be a germ release in China,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 but it was so clumsily publicized that the enemy wouldn't want to take a chance

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 that maybe it was going to be a real release.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 They should take some precautions, assuming that it was more than a propaganda scare.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 So that would account for China being ready, having months of announcements,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 ambiguously making them think there could be a release.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 So they were highly organized in the way they responded,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 but their response was extreme, more than anything they had ever done.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 So although it on the surface looked probably like it was a test,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 an activation to see what China would do, and maybe if China was extreme in their lockdown,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 then China would be something to copy around the world.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 I think it was within a few weeks of the Wuhan military games that there was a worldwide meeting

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 in New York sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, Johns Hopkins University,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 and many other world powers, philanthropists and so on.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 And in that meeting they worked out a model of how governments should respond

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 to the release of something like a COVID virus coming in from, in this case,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 they suggested that South America, pigs had spread it through Africa to the United States.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 But it was a detailed program to reorganize the world, and the Rockefeller Foundation

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 had I think the earliest explicit outline of the things that would have to be done in such a case.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 And one of the articles was on lockstep, but basically all three of their scenarios

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 showed that the only prevention of the world catastrophe that they had imagined in this event 201,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 the New York meeting, that all three of their proposals involved destroying the old economy

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 to be replaced by an artificial intelligence economy.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 And that was expressed by Eric Schmidt formerly of Google and related corporations,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 but at the time working for an artificial intelligence anticipation committee of the Pentagon.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 And early in 2019 he gave this talk, basically saying that the only way to save the world economy

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 was to destroy all of the existing or legacy economies,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 and to prepare for basically the monopoly giant corporations to take over the world economy,

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 to save it as the old economy was being destroyed.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 So the same thing is with the Vietnamese village, the captain who had to destroy it to save it from the Viet Cong?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 Yeah, and this was being delivered from all directions.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 Universities, the Pentagon, all of the big foundations had exactly the same story,

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 and it was all coming out in the five years before the actual event, which was no event at all.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 The preparations were becoming explicit five years, no, ten years actually.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 The Rockefeller Foundation scenarios were in 2011, I think it was.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 Go ahead.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 You're on mute?

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 Oh no, I thought you were going to say something.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 Were you going to say something?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 I was going to say that at this point, at least in the United States, it seems like the narrative is done.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 They try to push the mandates, but currently they're on hold.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 So everybody around me, even in DC, which is probably the city that was most behind the mandates,

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 and they were for the lockdowns and everything else, and the vaccines,

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 and now nobody's even wearing masks anymore on the street.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 So where do you think this is going?

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Luckily, we're not going there as fast as all of the ruling class had hoped.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 Klaus Schwab, the founder and president of the World Economic Forum,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 at the very beginning of the pandemic, he said we were having a lot of success changing the world through the fear of global warming.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 But he said that was promising to take at least another five or ten years to replace the old economy because it had to go through legislatures.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 But he said now this health crisis gives us the great opportunity to move directly into the reset using the authoritarian powers of government health boards

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 so that you don't have to convince the public to elect representatives who will shut down the economy to prevent so-called global warming.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 He said now we can do it in just a year or two because of the direct controlling power of the health agencies.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 What is that new artificial intelligence economy that Schmidt was babbling about?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 I mean, I know what he said, but I work in that industry, continue to work in industry,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 and the whole premise of AI, at least their vision for it, taking over and replacing these workers, it's nowhere near what is being advertised.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 I mean, at best, it can do maybe 10% of what's been promised.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 Yeah, they're still hoping that it will quickly come along according to their plans.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 But you can see within weeks, Amazon, for example, was making billions of dollars more than previously

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 just because if you close down local businesses all over the country, then people have to shop online.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 And in Eric Schmidt's talk early in 2019, he said shopping online is a valid recreation. You'll love it.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Before it had happened, he was saying aesthetically it's wonderful and you'll enjoy the new world.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 Well, Klaus Schwab, it sort of backfired, but for a while, their slogan at World Economic Forum was,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 "You will own nothing and you'll be happy."

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 Yeah, except them, right? They will own their jets and fly around, but not us.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 Yeah, they didn't say who was going to own everything if you aren't.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 One of their giant plans worked to some degree because so many people are vaccinated now.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 So how does what you just said tie into everybody getting vaccinated?

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 Well, the layers and layers of since the vaccine doesn't work at all as a vaccine and reduces antibodies for maybe six months,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 then you have to get new injections. First, you need a third injection, but since that lasts only six months,

00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 you need a fourth and a fifth. Meanwhile, the taxpayers are paying many billions of dollars to the people who are selling these toxic injections.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 And so far, since the law was passed in 1986, the providers of vaccines can't be held liable for anything that happens to the vaccinated person.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 They're happy to keep receiving tens of billions of dollars from the government to keep producing their vaccines, and that will go on.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 It will become an annual or even more often than annual affair to update your vaccine.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 So we're moving towards a model of mandated consumption of services and products, basically?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 Yes, the same idea that they've been doing for years in regard to transportation.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 You are legally required to insure yourself if you have a car license. And with the insurance, health insurance,

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 the Obama Act mandated that everyone had to buy insurance or else pay a fine to the government.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:12.000
 So it was a very small version of the government supporting an industry by simply requiring everyone to buy car and health insurance.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 Do you think if the mandate for the vaccination fails, they may turn around and say, you know what, we couldn't make it mandatory.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 But here's the thing. If you don't vaccinate, we'll cancel your health insurance. We'll force the employer to cancel your health insurance.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 I didn't hear.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 I mean, I said because Biden's mandate is now at least temporarily suspended.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:42.000
 Two courts have ruled that basically there's grave constitutional concerns, there are multiple practical concerns, etc.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:51.000
 And if, let's say, this mandate through OSHA fails, do you think another option for the government would be,

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 OK, if we can force the companies to vaccinate people, well, basically, because now there is the Obama Care Act

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 and the government is kind of standing behind the whole insurance business,

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 they will basically tell everybody who is not vaccinated, you can no longer, we'll cancel your insurance plan.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
 Yeah, things like that.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:27.000
 I think moving quickly towards more and more direct control of digital currency is one of their goals

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:36.000
 so that there is no business going on without the authorization of the banks and the government.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
 Ray, what kind of emails are you getting from people being injured by the vaccine?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:55.000
 Oh, that's now probably 10 to 1 more often than what can we do to protect against a viral infection?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:06.000
 What to do after you've been poisoned by the vaccine and listing the kind of symptoms you're experiencing.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.000
 And those symptoms just being the result of the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, do you think?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 Yes, sometimes directly following the vaccine, other times things such as bleeding episodes,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 sudden series of nosebleeds or dysmenorrhea in women, babies even starting to have vaginal bleeding.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:54.000
 Just the benefits apparently are being produced by the shedding of the vaccine material,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:05.000
 putting the spike protein into unvaccinated people from vaccinated people.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:13.000
 How big of a concern do you think that is? Would that effectively make staying unvaccinated almost pointless?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 Because if everybody around you is, then they'll shed it on top of you too?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:42.000
 The worst shedding fades out after the first few weeks, so hopefully that amplification through shedding shouldn't get out of control.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:54.000
 But it's enough to make a person want to avoid crowds for a long time.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 So basically since they're now planning for this to be a booster every six months, maybe every six months the unvaccinated should self-quarantine?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:13.000
 No, I think we should get together and insist on quarantining the vaccinated people for at least a month.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
 Yeah, let's see how this happens. I would love for this to happen, but I don't see it happening.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 Ray, what if your significant other was vaccinated?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:32.000
 Would you think the companionship and love would be worth inhaling the spike protein?

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
 I think I would keep my distance for a few weeks.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:47.000
 Do you suspect they might have a placebo? This is a big, gigantic experiment. Do you think not everybody is getting the same vaccine?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:08.000
 No, I think the more or less insiders, you don't want to have famous people disappearing, dying, or having a stroke after getting vaccinated.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:29.000
 So I think they are very selective in avoiding giving anything but a pure water injection to the great majority of the prominent public figures.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 Wasn't there some kind of a ruling, I don't know if it was a presidential order, but something about presidents of the United States are never to receive medical procedures live on air in front of the entire public,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:54.000
 just because of no matter how minute the chance is, if the president croaks or gets an anaphylactic reaction or whatnot, that would have devastating consequences and could trigger a collapse, right?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 So I would take it with a big grain of salt if a president of the United States is taking the vaccine live on TV. Would you say that's a fair assessment?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:17.000
 Yeah, not just the president, but probably something like 80 or 90% of people who are very public.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:30.000
 And it feels like at the beginning of the year we're talking about, should pregnant women get vaccinated and now it's 5 to 10 year olds or whatever, and then Fauci just said babies and newborns should get it.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
 Did I just make this up? Does it take 30 to 50 years to figure out the side effects of any given drug or vaccine?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:59.000
 Yeah, at least 50 years because it can be transgenerational. Cancers take 20 to 40 years generally to develop, but like the DES babies of the 1950s,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:18.000
 their children, three and four generations after the DES exposure, are still developing that range of unique cancers, reproductive system cancers.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.000
 And do you have any theories on how they'll cover up kids getting myocarditis and dying after being vaccinated?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:39.000
 Oh, by not investigating them at all. People like Fauci just say the vaccine is perfectly safe, nothing's happened.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:07:00.000
 They don't do autopsies, they don't do official investigations while the VAERS report of harmful effects from vaccinations.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 While those reports, which are even more time consuming to do so that most doctors don't want to waste hours filling out the reports,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 even as difficult as it is to file a vaccine injury report, the graph showing all of the deaths from the major vaccines going back 10 years or more

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:52.000
 are minimal compared to the last two years since the vaccine. It's at least a hundred fold increase in these reports,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:02.000
 but they are not happening according to the government because no one is investigating and doing statistics on them.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:21.000
 A few individuals, a businessman named Kersh has a good video showing you how to go into the VAERS system and look at their data.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 The graph he prepared is ridiculous. It's a flat line in preceding 10 or more years. Suddenly the line zooms up very vertically.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000
 So it's a hundred times as much per year or more than a hundred times.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
 So what do you think is next in store for the US?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000
 Because again, what I'm seeing around me, and I don't want to even mention more Republican states, I don't think the COVID narrative works anymore.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:13.000
 So something must replace it because people are not afraid of it anymore enough for them to accept further encroachment of their so-called rights, whatever remains of them.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:34.000
 I think they're working on many alternatives. They're talking about the things that could happen to the economy apart from a pandemic.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:43.000
 But a lot of ideas are waiting that could be sprung on us anytime.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000
 Do you think a possibility will be, I mean, they'll basically crash the economy, literally the stock market and everything else, and they'll say,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000
 "Hey, look, it was because of the virus, but now the damage is so severe, no amount of bailouts will help.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 So you'll just have to accept this new model that we have or we're all toast."

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 They'll just basically tell you the direct story, but the excuse will be different.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:24.000
 Yeah. That's their business, making up scenarios through which they can take over absolute power.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:35.000
 Speaking of scenarios, the event 201 that you mentioned, I didn't know that Avril Haines was there and she was like the director of the CIA.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:44.000
 And that was in, Ray, I know you mentioned him very frequently, but Robert Kennedy's, I think his new book, he mentioned that.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:54.000
 I've read about a quarter of the book. It's a very, very fat book with extremely small types, so it's slow reading.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:05.000
 But he does a good job of tying together all of the things that are behind the virus conspiracy.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:18.000
 It goes very deep into the military as well as economic and education.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 How is his book still being sold on Amazon? That seemed a little bit odd that they wouldn't just immediately take it off.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:45.000
 Yeah. I'm hoping that enough people are buying the book to eventually even get it under the New York Times bestselling list.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
 Is there any part of... Go ahead, Georgie.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
 So let's say enough people are already aware of what's going on. Let's say at least half the country knows, right?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
 I mean, we'll see what happens in Europe. I mean, I think the people there also know.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:05.000
 And now they're starting to riot and the police is starting to use live bullets on people like in Netherlands and potentially now in Austria and in Germany.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
 I mean, do you think that's basically the only way out?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:18.000
 I mean, people will rise up and we'll have to accept that not all of us will make it, but basically it's at a breaking point and going through courts, political systems, et cetera.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
 It's really pointless, it seems.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 Yeah. That's been the situation with any fundamental change.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:55.000
 The establishment will always come up with something that looks like a change, but isn't at all, to distract the voting public from putting real change into effect.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:05.000
 The Antitrust Acts early in the century were given so much publicity.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:25.000
 Many people in the public believed that the government was on their side and was fixing the damage done to the public by the monopoly organizations.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:48.000
 So when they broke them up, that calmed the population for decades, but it turned out that they didn't reduce the profits made by the monopolists and didn't decrease the ripoffs paid by the consumers.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:56.000
 So the Antitrust Acts were a show.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
 Wasn't that true with Standard Oil as well?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:06.000
 Yeah. The same people owned it, but they just had different companies.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
 Completely off topic, but have you ever seen "Everything a Rich Man's Trick," the documentary?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
 What was the name?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000
 "Everything a Rich Man's Trick."

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
 Is what a rich man's trick?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.000
 The documentary is called "Everything a Rich Man's Trick."

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 Yeah, basically that was what I was saying.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 Sorry, go ahead, Ray.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 The government is run by the ruling class ultra-rich, and so instead of doing anything to harm the ruling class, periodically the government is used to put on a show that they're going to knock down the ruling class.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:10.000
 But that's exactly a scheme of the ruling class to preserve its position.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 Roosevelt said his economic reforms were the only thing that would save his class.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
 I'm totally blanking on the family's name, but it was a Russian family.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:32.000
 There were people that overthrew this family in Russia, and they took them in late at night into a room and basically killed the whole family.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 That was a message to these ruling class families.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 They were like, "We should subdue the population because we never want this to happen to us."

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
 Does any of that ring any bell at all?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
 It was like some famous thing that sent a message to various ruling classes in different places.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:11.000
 Yeah, Paul Potts, for example, his idea of the ruling class went far beyond reality. He was ready to kill everyone.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:21.000
 Apparently it was Tsar Nicholas. Did that ring any bells? Or the Romanovs?

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:29.000
 That's what the revolutionaries did, right? They rounded up the Tsar family and killed them all except the youngest son.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
 Yeah, this movie starts off with that killing being this big point in time.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:44.000
 Anyway, Ray, with your newsletter, is there anything we didn't touch on that you think is critical? I think we just talked about what your last newsletter was about.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
 Which newsletter?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
 What was it called? "Immunology, Ideology, and Power"?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 Oh, pretty much that's what we've been talking about. The power of creating a phony concept of immunity.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:21.000
 And we talked about the role the antibody theory of immunity has played in creating big pharma.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
 Touch on that because I know you mentioned it in the newsletter.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:47.000
 Yeah, the German chemical industry supported Paul Ehrlich's experiments using dyes, first heavy metals, arsenic, mercury, and bismuth to kill pathogens.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:18:04.000
 But when he showed that dyes had some of the specialized toxic properties of the heavy metal poisons, he used that.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:16.000
 A mere harmless dye supposedly would have these specific staining properties.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:31.000
 You could see under the microscope that the pathogen would change color under the dye and the host tissue wouldn't be stained or killed.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:47.000
 So he used the chemical dye industry and his argument of specificity, the magic bullet doctrine,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:19:10.000
 that a chemical drug medication should have the ability of the magic bullet to seek out, attach itself to the pathogen and not harm the host healthy tissue.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.000
 It became very dominant in the cancer industry.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:41.000
 But it really created big pharma when the dye industry took over with derivatives of dyes following the staining specificity idea of Paul Ehrlich.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:20:02.000
 For them, the perfect definition of a magic bullet was antibodies which had a fairly good ability to stick only to certain things,

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 hopefully external pathogens, and to inactivate them. But this was blended with the pharmaceutical ideal that every disease has its chemical treatment of an absolute specificity.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:49.000
 The reality of it was that yes, you can create specific antibodies that are very protective and specific against the specific antigen that evoked the antibody.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:06.000
 But it was a general idea of individualized specific attack against the pathogen ignoring the healthy tissues.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:34.000
 The fact that he shared the 1908 Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff, Ehrlich used the opportunity of giving the Nobel lecture to sell the idea of drug specificity.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:42.000
 The essential basis for supporting a huge drug industry.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:22:01.000
 In Metchnikoff's talk, the only chemical treatment he mentioned that he knew of that really helped control or cure disease was quinine.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:26.000
 Quinine as a natural substance, it happened to have a broad spectrum of benefit acting somewhat as a tonic to the host as well as an inhibiting action on a variety of organisms.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:39.000
 The Metchnikoff Nobel lecture didn't form the basis for creating any kind of industry.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:23:02.000
 So everyone just forgot about the facts that he described from the things involved in making phagocytosis possible all the way to the other end of the involvement of antibodies.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:26.000
 But since there was no industry yet able to deal with the extreme complexity of the actual immune system, the actual immune system was dropped out of science after the Nobel 1908 lectures.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:54.000
 By 1920 and 1930, vaccination and the development of antibodies became a staple of medicine and it was analogous to all the rest of medicine provided by the growing pharmaceutical industry.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:21.000
 Everything having to have a unique one chemical, one disease treatment so that in effect as you could identify something as a sickness, it increased the market constantly for drugs that were specific for that sickness.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:43.000
 Rather than something like quinine with an extremely broad spectrum of effectiveness, they were creating thousands of specific drugs, most of which turned out to be more toxic than beneficial.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:25:02.000
 There was a British writer, I'm blanking on his name, who basically wrote once that the British Empire conquered the tropical nations not because of its military acumen or its power or even money but because of its incredibly healthy tonic water which was made with a lot more quinine than the one nowadays.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 I think the strongest of the tonic waters available have 70 or 80 milligrams per liter.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:23.000
 Just to wrap up this thought, the quinine is an electron withdrawing agent helping to stabilize the flow of electrons?

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:43.000
 I think that's a basic part of it. It turns out that almost anything bitter tasting has an activating effect on our immune system.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
 Do you have any hypotheses on why that is?

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000
 I didn't hear that.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
 Do you have any theories on why that is?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:06.000
 Oh, I think it's the organism's recognition of chemical generality in the world.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:27.000
 We develop tastes that usually cause us to eat high carbohydrate foods, for example, depending on our needs, our appetites change.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:52.000
 But I think when sickness is developing, the tastes change and people start getting more interested in bitters, digestive bitters, for example, are a very old general treatment for everything.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:27:02.000
 In Eastern European folk medicine, bitter compounds are used for infectious disease and as anabolic agents.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:16.000
 Before the athletes had access to isolated steroids, some of the earliest weightlifting athletes in Eastern Europe and Russia were using local herbs like tribulus terrestris, which is extremely bitter in taste.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:22.000
 They didn't even know what it contained.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.000
 There are some articles, older articles that are written in Russia that say that the bitter tasting herbs tend to have anabolic effect.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
 Do you think there's some truth to that?

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 I haven't seen that older stuff, but there's a lot going on now with the biological meaning of the receptors for bitter tasting substances.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.000
 So they tend to stimulate some sort of a detox system in the body?

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
 Yeah, apparently.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
 Fantastic stuff. So let me just do a quick advertisement here.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:08.000
 The newsletter is available by email now. It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal at raypeatsnewsletter at gmail.com.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.000
 And then they can also purchase your books there in digital and then physical copies as well, right?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000
 Yeah, as long as there are physical copies.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
 Which ones are not available right now?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000
 I don't remember.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
 So email Catherine to figure it out.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.000
 Also email Catherine at keenogen@gmail.com.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:38.000
 Each bottle of Progesterone is 3,400 mg.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:49.000
 I'm interested in these substances having a quick positive effect, but I'm also interested in them having a person needing to trial and error different aspects of them.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:01.000
 So Ray, if somebody responds negatively to Progesterone, like they have breast pain with it or something, what could things come to mind as a possibility for that happening?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:12.000
 Very low thyroid functioning people are the ones who have that kind of reaction.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:36.000
 If your thyroid is pretty low, even at one teaspoonful of the vitamin E solution, a teaspoonful of it isn't enough to achieve a Progesterone effect.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:52.000
 The first thing is to make sure your temperature and heart rate are in a good range because of having adequate calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.000
 Then you're sensitive to smaller amounts of Progesterone.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:07.000
 The Progesterone is kicking the estrogen out of the cells and it's deactivated, but it can be reactivated if it passes through an inflamed tissue, is that right?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
 Yeah.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:20.000
 All of those circulating things are picked up in proportion to the inflammation.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:40.000
 For example, one of the early detoxifying systems involves the liver's attachment of glucuronic acid to the substance to be excreted.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:31:07.000
 It turns out that if you stress a tissue, I tried many different kinds of stresses, low temperature, hyposmolality, various kinds of irritants and so on.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:20.000
 Everything I could come up with, especially the tissue, caused a tremendous increase in the enzyme that removes glucuronic acid from the substance.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:46.000
 So your liver can be working very efficiently to detoxify it, but if something is locally irritated and inflamed, the blood passing through there will be subject to modification by the glucuronidase enzymes.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
 Very interesting. Georgie, do you have any other questions before I move on to Q&A?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
 Sulfatase as well. Basically, estrogen has been turned into estrone sulfate.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:05.000
 Now they've been showing that estrone sulfate is the primary estrogen in menopausal women, even though all the others are low.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:16.000
 For a while, they thought that this is just a metabolic waste byproduct of estrogen that is being quickly excreted, but it turns out that it's not.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:31.000
 It's just like DHEA sulfate. Estrone sulfate is like a long-term storage form of estrogen that circulates and gets converted into estradiol in any tissue that is stressed or inflamed or de-energized.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:41.000
 Okay, here's the first question. Who is the healthiest person Ray has ever known, and what does he think made them that way?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:33:03.000
 I've known lots of healthy old people who were hardly aware that they had a stomach or digestive organs.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 They just ate what was available. A lot of it is the momentum that you inherit.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:24.000
 There are fewer people like that now than there were 50 or 60 years ago.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:35.000
 Before COVID, when you'd go to the grocery store and stuff, would you notice the millennial and Gen X and Zoomer, how poor the health was of everybody?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:55.000
 Oh yeah. Just walking around town, you can see hormonal defects seem to be the rule rather than the exception.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:02.000
 Great stuff, thank you for that. Okay, does Ray have any thoughts on people's names influencing their behavior and personality?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:15.000
 E.g. Raymond comes from Frankish Raganmund, meaning "council protection," and Peat is a moss that was once an important fuel. So Ray's name more or less means "protection of fuel."

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:36.000
 Over the years, I've noticed probably more than 100 famous researchers whose names obviously connected.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:59.000
 Like Birdfishel, the nonverbal communication researcher, or Dr. Drips, the menopause specialist, Bacon Child, the nutritionist.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
 Do you think this is synchronicity, or there's some other influence going on here?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:13.000
 No, I think it puts it in their mind, arouses their interest eventually.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.000
 They got teased as a child saying, "Are you going to be a doctor?" and then kind of stuck with them?

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
 Yeah.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 Very interesting. Okay, here's one from James. He says, "Is having a good sense of humor a sign that a person has a healthy metabolism, and are there health benefits to a sense of humor in humans and perhaps some other animals?"

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:56.000
 Well, everything except the cultural influences are very similar between humans and animals in general.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:11.000
 Do you think a sense of humor comes from having a good metabolism? You're very playful, Ray. I think you're hilarious. Does that stem from your metabolism or the culture that you were brought up in?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:32.000
 I think a little bit of either. With animals, you can see that simply the amount of well-being and energy drives the playing instinct.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:53.000
 Cats, dogs, sheep, simply the sheep take a break from being normal and passive and just spend the afternoon dancing and frolicking and being silly.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:58.000
 Especially the lambs. Have you seen how they throw their legs in the air?

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
 I didn't hear that.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:06.000
 Especially the lambs. Have you seen how they throw their legs in the air out of pure joy?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.000
 Yeah, sometimes adults do that too.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
 Really?

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:20.000
 Yeah. They're pretending they're antelope.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:36.000
 Great stuff. Okay, Orion says, "Does Ray have any thoughts on about handedness and its effects on personality and health? I'm reading that left-handed people have a higher incidence of chronic disease, autism, intelligence, etc. What is the nature of handedness?"

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:53.000
 I think the high energy metabolism is pretty much the whole thing as long as you have some fingers to work with.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:13.000
 I imagine cats often envy a person for having such good fingers. They can see that a person can do something because of their anatomy that they would like to do.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:42.000
 But apart from our physical shape limitations, I think the whole thing is the vitality that supports a big, hot brain and the excess knowledge that goes far beyond necessity.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:52.000
 It leaves this huge area for playful exploration.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:00.000
 If a person was functioning at an extremely high level, would they be ambidextrous?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
 I didn't hear that.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:13.000
 If a person, not on this planet right now, had a really high rate of metabolism, would they be ambidextrous and handedness wouldn't really be a thing?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:40.000
 To a great extent, yeah. The Russian experimenters found that handedness became extreme when neurosis was developed along with energy metabolism failing.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:59.000
 The healthiest in the sense of a big brain, females in particular, who have bigger brains in proportion to their bodies than males,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:14.000
 these excess brain conditions are where human-ness primarily exists.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:24.000
 Great stuff. Okay, this one is, "What does Ray do to maintain a sense of novelty and wonder in his daily life?"

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:35.000
 Looking for it. Looking for novelty is probably the best way to find it.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
 And you do that by reading or watching nature or what?

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.000
 Always possible.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
 Except watching TV, right?

01:40:49.000 --> 01:41:05.000
 Yeah, our TV burned out many years ago right after the last of the so-called liberal programs.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:26.000
 The guy who was Johnson's press secretary or assistant, he was the last token progressive or liberal on NPR.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:35.000
 And the night they cancelled his program, our TV burned out.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:41.000
 We just haven't thought of TV since.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.000
 Speaking of liberal, I caught up with some of my family in Thanksgiving over the phone.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:55.000
 The strong liberals in my family, they hadn't even considered that the vaccine would be deleterious to lower socioeconomic types.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
 That wasn't even on their radar.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:15.000
 A vaccine passport would exclude blacks that they apparently care so much about, but they didn't ever intertwine the vaccine passport with what it would do to them.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:24.000
 Yeah, there are all levels of awareness about vaccines.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:44.000
 Usually the believers that people should be vaccinated are the ones who know absolutely nothing about immunity or innate immunity.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:54.000
 Even the descending virologists, I've been listening to a lot of them.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:11.000
 They have the best knowledge being discussed, but they're really heavily indoctrinated by the vaccine culture and the antibody culture.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:18.000
 But in another way, BLM could be a great movement if they were actually against vaccination and inactivated.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:24.000
 You know what I mean?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
 Say that again.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000
 The liberal people I know, they're very pro-BLM.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:40.000
 What I meant is if BLM protested against vaccines, they could actually be useful.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
 Oh yeah.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:52.000
 But the motivation of the group seems to be very mixed.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:44:05.000
 A lot of unprogressive, undemocratic people have kind of infiltrated the group.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.000
 How do you get your news, Ray?

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
 I mean, presumably mostly online.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:20.000
 If the TV burned down, I'm guessing the radio followed similar footsteps.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
 And now what, only computer or word of mouth?

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:50.000
 Occasional rumors and books and things that the situation with newspapers used to be that if you looked for the contrary of what the current government position was,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
 that would be where the truth was.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
 So you would look for the opposite.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:08.000
 And pretty much that's the situation with especially Google, for example.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:24.000
 The Google system has been arranged to make it almost impossible to use ordinary search techniques to find anything useful.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:36.000
 There was a Hollywood movie back in 2012, I'm blanking on his name right now, but a Nazi officer was interrogating a young Jewish girl.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
 He didn't know it was Jewish and he was asking where all the Jews are.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
 In Glorious Bastards.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
 He was in Glorious Bastards?

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:49.000
 He was interviewing the father, a French guy who was hiding the Jews in the basement.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:56.000
 And the Nazi said, so tell me, you know, where are all the Jews?

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
 And the guy said, well, all I have is rumors.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
 I don't have any facts.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
 And the Nazi said, oh, I don't care about facts.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
 They can be easily manufactured.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
 But rumors can actually be quite revealing.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:17.000
 So he seems to be agreeing with what you said, that you can kind of gauge the attitude and the direction of events just by listening to the rumors that the population is spreading around.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000
 Yeah.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:30.000
 You still have to interpret the meaning, who is spreading the rumor.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
 Great stuff.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
 We'll let you go really soon here, Ray.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
 Just a few more questions.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
 And so this one's from Jan.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.000
 They say, Ray once said incidents of neurotic fatigue, anxiety and depression increased along with IQ.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
 Is it only related to energy and nutrient requirements or is there more to it?

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:54.000
 E.g., culture, social subordination, isolation?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:12.000
 Yeah, the culture has what it will accept as the level of general intelligence and the behavior that follows.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:34.000
 So going back decades, studies have found that the IQ of big organizations, the top IQ tends to be in the 100, 120s.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:42.000
 My favorite study was at Oregon State University.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:53.000
 In the psychology department, this person looked at the aptitude scores.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:09.000
 They used the Miller analogy test, which at that time was given to all entering graduate students.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:32.000
 The median raw score out of 100 for graduate students was usually in the 40% to 65% errors.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:47.000
 That was the average graduate student score, except at Harvard it was more like 60 out of 100.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:54.000
 At state universities, more like 40 out of 100.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:08.000
 This researcher then looked at their academic record compiled over the years after being admitted

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:21.000
 and saw that the median score on the Miller analogy test was the peak academic success.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:31.000
 The straight A's, successful academic career and receiving a degree.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:51.000
 But exactly as the scores deviated upward from the mean or downward in proportion to the distance from the mean,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:01.000
 the median score declined.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:22.000
 So in other words, the very smart and very dumb are unlikely to succeed in life?

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:39.000
 Yes, there are lots of variations on that.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:55.000
 The original IQ guy at Stanford, I forget his name, did one of the studies showing that the people in the 130s

01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:03.000
 had very good academic careers for the rest of their lives.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:17.000
 Those with 170 or 180 IQ were the ones constantly under pressure and sensing that they didn't belong.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:35.000
 As a person's health improves, do they become more sensitive to stressors such as toxic smells, EMS, or bad food?

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:42.000
 One big difference is between men and women.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:55.000
 The protective defense against toxins that would affect babies, for example,

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:03.000
 women are many times more sensitive than men.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:16.000
 Estrogen is the sensitizer there. With the high estrogen of pregnancy, their sense of smell,

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:27.000
 nausea, and repugnance increases.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000
 If you do all these things, you eat well for a period of years, and you take thyroid and aspirin and progesterone, etc.,

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:41.000
 if your brain got physically bigger and you were not providing it with everything that it needed,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
 would you notice more deviations over time?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:53.000
 You might notice little nuances about your body that somebody running at a way lower rate wouldn't notice?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:59.000
 Yes, and there's been a heavy bias.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
 You know the idea that the brain stops growing at the age of...

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:17.000
 When I was in graduate school, it was 11 months from conception that the brain absolutely stopped growing.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:32.000
 It simply underwent some maturing changes like increased white matter in proportion to gray.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:52.000
 The people who have bothered to check a population over the years doing detailed studies every 10 years,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:08.000
 one study went on for 60 years and ended up when there were technologies making it possible to identify

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:24.000
 the amount of DNA per brain and so on that found that in almost everyone, the brain substance was enlarging steadily with aging,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:35.000
 and the skull shape changes predictably with aging.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:42.000
 Apparently growing a slightly bigger capacity of the cranium.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
 Thanks for that. And Ray, absolute last question.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.000
 I get emails from people every day saying, "Mexico, Mexico. What about Mexico? Is it safe?" etc.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
 And so I know we've talked about it multiple times, but can you maybe reiterate your opinion on Mexico

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
 and it being possibly semi-immune from all the things that are happening?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:10.000
 Yeah, I was just reading about AMLO's challenge to his judicial system.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:24.000
 A judge had ordered the vaccine be made available to children a few weeks ago and set, I think, a five-day deadline.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:36.000
 He definitely opposed that and there are still conflicts going on in the government,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:44.000
 but it looks like he's getting away with saying that the vaccine is too dangerous for children,

01:55:44.000 --> 01:56:01.000
 but it's now available to children over 12 who have a chronic disease and are arguing that they need extra protection.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:08.000
 But for the general population, he's not letting it become available.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:21.000
 So I think that he personally is constantly judging how much he can get away with,

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:34.000
 and a lot of that depends on the foundations and the giant corporations and the U.S. government.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:46.000
 If they become more focused in opposing him, he won't be able to keep doing it.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:57:01.000
 But so far he has been going out of compromise well enough so that even Trump didn't try to invade.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:08.000
 And if AMLO was killed tomorrow, you said something maybe on the call a few months ago that Mexico would retain its spirit.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:11.000
 Can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit?

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:24.000
 Yeah, the people who elected him, there are really a majority of Mexicans who are very progressive

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:38.000
 and who are conscious that the reason they haven't been able to go ahead is that the U.S. has intervened over and over,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:54.000
 including the murder of President Maduro and probably other candidates and presidents like Colosio.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:06.000
 The U.S. is probably behind the direct intervention short of a military invasion.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:20.000
 And so a big part of the population knows that they can't get away with fixing the economy quickly.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
 And then that's it for me. Ray, what are you working on right now?

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:42.000
 The next newsletter is going to be around the idea of the menopause and that relating to the failure of energy with aging

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:52.000
 and what things are involved in the failure of energy, especially as it shows up during the menopause.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000
 And Georgi, any final words?

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.000
 Well, one last question that was actually asked by the people in the list I saw,

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:06.000
 whether Ray thinks there's any value to self-discipline and forming any sort of like useful habits,

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.000
 or do you think a person's best life would be lived spontaneously/intuitively?

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:25.000
 Definitely spontaneity. You've done your own energy if you force yourself to work.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:32.000
 Okay. So do you think there's any circumstance in life where basically one needs to sort of exercise their will,

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
 feeling that they don't like this, but they kind of have to do it? Or do you think it would be always detrimental?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:48.000
 Oh, yeah. Sometimes you have to do something until you can survive without doing it.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:56.000
 So if it has a survival benefit, then it's worth self-disciplining about it, but anything beyond that is self-torture?

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:05.000
 Yeah. You should only do unpleasant things if you're really forced to do them.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:10.000
 Amazing. Ray, thank you so much. Georgi Yedinkov, thank you. Thank you so much to our audience.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
 These are always extremely fun to do. And thanks, Ray, thank you for donating two hours of your time here.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
 Sincerely appreciate it. Stay on the line and everybody have an amazing weekend and we'll talk to you guys soon.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
 And thank you for all the support of this show. Thank you guys so much. Have a safe weekend. Talk to you soon.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
 Okay. Bye, everyone.
