00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 [Thunder]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "It's Rainmaking Time." This is Kim Greenhouse.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 And I have invited Ray Peat, Ph.D., who has a background in biology from the University of Oregon,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 who specializes in physiology. He's also taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Montana State University, the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, and in Mexico as well.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 He's written many, many papers on physiological chemistry and physics.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 His key idea is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 He is known for his views on progesterone, on balancing the female hormones, on understanding them.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 And he's written a lot about radiation and growth, on cholesterol, on natural estrogens, and about pregnenolone and memory.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 He's written hundreds and hundreds of articles, and he has some very, very helpful and very robust views on human health,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 including some that will defy some of the beliefs you may have about fish oils and saturated fats

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 and understanding natural and bioidentical hormones.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, welcome Ray Peat to "It's Rainmaking Time." Good afternoon.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Thank you.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Thank you so much for being here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 You've been one of the big proponents, it seems, early on of natural progesterone.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And I wondered if you could speak about it and your findings early on about natural progesterone.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Yeah. In 1968, I decided to go back to graduate school in biology.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 I had been working in linguistics and other areas, and I decided that to understand anything,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 it would help to understand how the brain works.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 But then I found that the brain researchers were just as dogmatic as the people in linguistics.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And I found the least dogmatic area in biology was reproductive physiology and aging research

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 because there were so few people getting big money to do it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 So they were relatively free.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 And my thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, had studied the effects of vitamin E on reproductive aging.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And I was going to specialize on how the oxidative process changes during aging

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 and whether that affects reproductive efficiency and so on, decreases with aging.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And it turned out that it was looking as if estrogen increased with aging

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 while progesterone decreased just about the time infertility sets in.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And that was contrary to all of the textbooks, but being an actual scientist,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Soderwall said, "If it's repeatable, go ahead and do it."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And in any of the other areas of biology, like in nerve biology,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 if I would observe something that seemed to violate the textbook description of what a cell is,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 the professor would just pretend he hadn't seen it because they were getting their funding

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 to develop a certain line of thinking.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 But since there was so little money put into reproduction and aging,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 actual science was allowed to go ahead.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And other people working in the same lab eventually did the same kind of tests

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 and found that in various situations, the tissues of other animals

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 actually increased their estrogen content with aging.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 But since progesterone is decreasing,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 progesterone happens to be what inhibits the formation of estrogen inside cells

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 all through the body.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 And if you don't have very much progesterone, the estrogen goes on being synthesized,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 but it can't escape from the cell into the bloodstream where it could be excreted from the body.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So while the body is actually loading up inside the cells with estrogen,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 when there's a progesterone deficiency,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 the blood shows a very low level of estrogen because it can't leave the cell.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 It needs things such as progesterone to loosen it from the binding proteins called receptors in the cells.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So seeing that the estrogen excess causes a wasting of oxygen in the tissues

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 that basically suffocates the embryo that's trying to implant and grow,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 so it prevents pregnancy.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 And that explains how the birth control pill works.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 It creates an excess of estrogen in the tissues, suffocating the fertilized egg

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 and preventing its implantation and growth.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 And when you look at stress, malnutrition and various stressors

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 that decrease your thyroid and progesterone production have that same effect as aging

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 or taking an estrogen supplement.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 It leads to the progressive increase of estrogen inside cells

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 along with all of the associated things caused by high estrogen.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And that creates effectively an oxygen deficiency,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 which leads to progressive loss of all of the differentiated functions.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 I imagine that during the time at which you were talking about this and writing about it,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 that when Dr. John Lee came around, that you got a lot of confirmation.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 Yeah, I used to give talks to medical groups.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 There were organizations of orthomolecular doctors all up and down the West Coast.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 And I think it was the second time that I talked to his group in--

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 I think it was the San Francisco area.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 I noticed one of the doctors actually seemed to wake up and pay attention,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 and that was John Lee.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 The others just couldn't hear anything that said estrogen wasn't the female hormone

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 that decreases at menopause.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 He got heavily attacked when he came out with what you were proposing

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and what you saw as an observation with that kind of discovery.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 And I think he kind of front-runned it in the public domain,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 even though you were out there for years talking about it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Oddly enough, we lost him at a very young age.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 My question to you is, the orthomolecular focus, the anti-aging focus,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 the optimization focus now, like the Life Extension Foundation,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 which tests for a lot of different things--

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 I'm a member of their organization, and I like it that you can order your own blood tests

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 and that you can be more in charge of your health.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 But DHEA has been around forever.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 It's in our bodies, and a lot of women are supplementing with progesterone now

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 and also adding a little bit of DHEA.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 And even though DHEA can convert to testosterone and to estrogen,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 on low levels women are using it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 What do you think about it?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 I think it was a 1971 article I wrote, I mentioned DHEA as being one of the basic protective hormones like progesterone.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Progesterone happens to be the main thing that protects against the conversion of DHEA into estrogen.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Testosterone is really just as much a female hormone as a male hormone.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Estrogen is somewhat more a male hormone.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 It's what is responsible for differentiating the male brain.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 So if I had to call it a gender hormone, I would say it's probably more a male hormone.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 How interesting.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 I don't think most of us would associate it with that.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 That's very interesting.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Progesterone is the real feminizing hormone.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 It protects against excess of anything, including excess estrogen, excess testosterone, or cortisone, or aldosterone.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 All of the major types of steroid hormone are either...

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Progesterone makes up for deficiency of any of those, but it also protects against a toxic excess of any of them.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 So if someone is taking a low level of DHEA and progesterone, it's kind of a nice combination?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Yeah, as long as you're watching your general diet and thyroid function,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 it's possible to override the protective effect of progesterone if you eat a lot of unsaturated fat and not enough protein and calcium, for example.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 And unsaturated fat for the public would mean what?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Corn oil, soy oil, canola.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 How about grapeseed oil?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Yeah, everything that's liquid has a lot of polyunsaturated fat.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Olive oil, which will harden at refrigerator temperatures, still has about 10% of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 I don't think a person should eat more than maybe an average of a teaspoonful or two of olive oil per day.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Butter and coconut oil are really the only very safe fat.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Bee fat, lamb fat, butter, and coconut oil have only maybe 2% polyunsaturated.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Or olive oil and I think macadamia is another one that has a moderate amount,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 but they still have several times as much unsaturated as coconut and butter.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 You've been talking about the benefits of coconut oil way before Bruce Fyfe produced his books on the coconut oil miracle.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 Yeah, in the 1970s, I saw a study in which I think it was 15 groups of several rats in each group were put on a lifetime diet of low-fat diet, high-fat diet, and medium fat.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 And in each of those, there was the low-fat diet that was only, I think it was corn oil or some highly unsaturated oil, as well as only a saturated fat.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 The high-fat animals, the same thing.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 They were given either pure unsaturated fat, pure saturated fat, or different blends of the mixture.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And at the end of their life, their tissues were analyzed and the obese animals were the ones which had the high ratio of unsaturated to saturated fat.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Isn't that interesting? Wow.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 It wasn't at all the quantity of fat they ate.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 So the low-fat eaters who got the corn oil were overweight, high body fat content.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 The high-fat eaters, which had only the saturated fat, were lean.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 I just think that's so interesting because so many people are learning about the benefit of saturated fats now, but it's taken years for this to come forward.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Yeah, I think it was 1996. In the early 90s, some millionaire in Nebraska started buying full-page newspaper ads saying that Oreo cookies and many other traditional good products were killing people because they had coconut oil in them.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 And we had been using some very nice products, for example, tortilla chips that were fried in coconut oil.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And we ate huge amounts of those, and the more we ate, the leaner we got.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And after his national campaign against tropical saturated fats, all of these products across the country disappeared.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 And that really annoyed me, so I wrote that article in 1996 on coconut oil.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 And I think that was what started a lot of the people selling it and talking about its benefits.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 The most recent thing that is happening with coconut oil is it's being used to treat Alzheimer's patients.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 There's a very good website. A woman is now using MCT, medium-chain triglycerides, which are extracted from coconut oil combined with coconut oil.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 It makes it less irritating to the intestine, but a lot of people are getting good results in treating Alzheimer's.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 Previously, high saturated fat diets had been used to treat epilepsy, brain cancer, and degenerative liver diseases, hepatitis and cirrhosis.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 My mom died in 2008 of Alzheimer's, and I wish I had put it together about the coconut oil and some of the other things that you write about with that and found out about with that.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 But at least the information is out there now for others who have family members, friends or associates who are stricken with the disease.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 My website has an article on, two articles I think it is on Alzheimer's.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And it gives a lot of attention to the role of polyunsaturated fats in causing the brain degeneration.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And there's another article that covers the role of polyunsaturated fats in scrapier bovine spongiform encephalitis, mad cow disease.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 The polyunsaturated fats, I think, have a major role in all of the degenerative brain diseases, including Huntington's, Lou Gehrig's disease and other special types of degeneration.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 I know that you have a very different view about taking flaxseed oil and DHA.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 And I'd like you to talk about it because in the anti-aging industry, it is heavily touted and also by Dr. Oz and even Suzanne Somers in her book, Knockout, and a lot of her investigative work,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 talk to people in the orthomolecular field that are proposing flaxseed oil use and ingestion and fish oils.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 I want you to share your perspective about them for the public to have a rethinking about it.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 The way a lot of these people are reasoning is to identify the fish oils, DHA and EPA as essential fatty acids or the omega minus three oils as essential fatty acids.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And then say, since they are essential nutrients, they can't be toxic. Some of the articles on my website deal first with that issue of essentiality and show that the basic studies that are still being cited were done in 1929 by George Burr and his wife.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 And at the time they published their results, they neglected to mention several very well-known articles were published in the same journal they published in.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Studies showing that those very fats that the Burrs were claiming to be essential nutrients were actually life-shortening ingredients in the diet that animals lived longer.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 One study two years before they published showed that a fat-free diet eliminated almost all cancers in their experimental animals as well as slowing the aging process.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 But they just ignored the contrary evidence and pronounced that linoleic and linoleic acid were essential to prevent a certain disease in rats, scaly tail disease and bloody urine and such.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 It was about 16, 17 years later that Roger Williams' lab in Texas, they had been studying the B vitamins and they recognized the Burr's rat disease as a vitamin B6 deficiency disease.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 And vitamin B6 wasn't even known at the time the Burrs were giving their rats the specialized diet.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 So Roger Williams' lab gave exactly the same diet the Burrs had used and created the deficiency disease, essential fatty acid deficiency symptoms.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 And then without adding any fats at all, they gave the rats vitamin B6 and cured the Burr's deficiency disease.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 You know that the FDA took B6 off the market that most people can't sell it anymore individually?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 No, I didn't know that but no one talks about the disproof of the Burr's evidence and how they try to bring the issue up to date claiming that there is such a thing as an essential fatty acid is to cite two or three individuals, babies and old people who have been on intravenous feeding.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And at the time these human studies were done with intravenous feeding, intravenous nutrition didn't include zinc which is absolutely, it's been known for 70 years to be an essential nutrient but it wasn't in the intravenous feeding preparations even for babies until sometime in the late 1970s it came to be used.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 So again what they're doing is confirming the work of Roger Williams' group that other deficiencies are created when you give them a very limited diet.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 George Burr himself demonstrated he put some of his fatty acid deficient rats under a bell jar to measure their oxygen consumption and he saw that they were burning fuel and consuming oxygen at a rate 50% higher than the rats on his supposedly adequate diet.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 And he didn't seem to understand that what the fats were doing was lowering the metabolic rate so drastically suppressing thyroid function that they could get along on a much lower calorie intake and so they didn't need vitamins so crucially as when the metabolic rate was running as it should.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 And what does that mean to us?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 That if you poison your thyroid gland, you don't need very many calories.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 For example, they've put women in closed wards where they could absolutely control the amount of food they ate and found that lots of fat women are burning only 700, they can even gain weight on 700 calories a day where the textbooks used to say that everyone has to lose weight if they eat less than 1700 calories a day.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Many women, even this was about 30 years ago that they did the test, they found that many overweight women were burning probably about 35% as much fuel as they should at a normal metabolic rate.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 That means that if you do anything to poison your thyroid function that you won't need as many calories and you also won't need as many vitamins and minerals to prevent specific deficiencies.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 And polyunsaturated fats happen to be very general and effective blockers of thyroid function.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 A whole series of papers was published in French Annals of Endocrinology showing that the secretion of the thyroid gland is inhibited by the polyunsaturated fats.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 The ability of transport proteins in the blood to carry thyroid hormone was blocked by these same unsaturated fats and the more unsaturated, the more perfect the blocking so that if they had three or four double bonds, they almost completely blocked the ability of the protein to carry thyroid.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 And also at the various levels inside the cell, if the cell managed to receive some thyroid hormone, the polyunsaturated fats would block the ability of the cell to respond to it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So at every conceivable level of thyroid function, polyunsaturated fats are lowering the ability of the thyroid to maintain normal respiratory rate thus leading to all the consequences of increasing estrogen, decreasing progesterone, accumulating fat and the fat cells become a major factory for making more estrogen.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 All of the degenerative processes increase as the oxidative metabolism decreases. Production of free radicals from the unsaturated fat increases when good energy isn't being produced.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Why do you think it is that the orthomolecular specialists and much of the industry is touting black seed oil and fish oils as brain food then? What's the misfire here?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 Oh, well, if you grind up someone's brain, you find that it's full of chicken fat and fish oil like stuff. It reflects exactly what we've been eating.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 So if you feed pigs a good diet of cheese and apples and whey and so on, their fats will be pretty much like butter fat. Cows can eat a lot of unsaturated fats because they have a rumen that detoxifies it.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 And so a calf's brain when it's born, all of its tissues are deficient so-called in the essential fatty acids because the rumen is destroying the essential fatty acids before they get to the tissues.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 But animals like pigs and chickens and fish, everyone who doesn't have a rumen, their tissues will reflect pretty much exactly the composition of the fats in what they eat.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 So it turns out that the brain being composed more of fat than of any other substance, it will have a very high concentration of these unsaturated fats that the person has been eating.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 But why do they call it brain food? I don't mean lodged in the brain, but why do they call it like it's really good for your brain? Why?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 Well, a group in France that believes that just about three years ago, I think it was, decided to put electrodes on pregnant women to measure the fetuses' response to various sounds that they could detect.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 And so they found that they could train the baby before it was born to respond to different sounds.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 And so they said, "We'll demonstrate that DHA and EPA are brain food, improving the quality of the brain by doing measurements of the ability to learn of the fetus."

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And they found exactly what they hadn't expected, that the brain learning response was retarded in proportion to the mother's consumption of the fish fat type of highly unsaturated fats.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And after the babies were born, in fact, they were underdeveloped, including the brain, which was exactly what animal experimenters had demonstrated way back in the 1970s, that when pregnant mice were put on a diet of either highly unsaturated vegetable oil or saturated fat with mice,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 they could grind up their brains and weigh them and so on.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And the babies that were exposed to the high prenatal diet of unsaturated fats had smaller brains and they didn't learn as well as the babies that had been exposed to saturated fats.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 So both in the recent studies in humans and the old studies in animals show that the polyunsaturated fats retard brain development, both in function and in actual size.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Studies back in the 1960s and 70s also showed that sugar and progesterone are factors that increase brain growth, development, and learning ability.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Did you say sugar and progesterone?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Yeah.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 For example, Zamenhof was the person who found that a chicken's brain, the embryo's brain, grew rapidly as long as there was still glucose present inside the egg.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 And he found that the brain stopped growing as soon as the supply of glucose in the egg ran out.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Even though there was still a lot of energy food, the polyunsaturated fat or saturated fat, there was still enough for the body to keep growing, but the brain stopped when the glucose ran out.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 So at that number of days of development, he would open the egg shell and inject a little bit of glucose or other food that was equivalent to glucose and showed that it didn't affect the body size very much because all chickens had enough fat in the egg for their body to grow.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 But the brains kept growing because of the added glucose to the egg and the chickens were born with uniquely large brains for a chicken and they were smarter than ordinary chickens.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 How do we process what you just said? Because it can be confusing for us.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Obstetricians, as recently as old people that I knew, old doctors in the 1970s, were still aware of the fact that their so-called diabetic mothers very often had extremely precocious babies.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 I talked to one woman who was told to go on a reducing diet because her previous pregnancy she had had very high blood sugar and I asked her how that baby had turned out.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 She said, "Oh, he taught himself to read when he was two years old."

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 And she said when he was four, he was already wearing adult hat sizes, which is basically an extension of what Zamenhof demonstrated with chicken embryo development.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Sugar is the limiting factor usually in brain development.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 But in the 1970s, doctors were looking for new diseases to treat and diabetes was extended to include the very completely new concept of gestational diabetes.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 And where 130 blood sugar had been considered very healthy for a pregnant woman, they now wanted to restrain the level of blood sugar during pregnancy and they started calling it a disease, gestational diabetes, that really it was just a healthy pregnancy in most cases.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 So what is your take about, I'm trying to get to I guess your final take on flaxseed oil and DHA, which is that these "essential fatty acids" are not necessary and are not useful, is that what you're saying?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 I've been asking people for I guess about 40 years now for what the evidence is for the essentiality of any of these fats and those very odd few studies are the only things anyone has ever mentioned to me.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 So essential fatty acids are unsaturated oils, correct?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 That's what they say, but I've never seen any evidence that convinced me that they had proved that they are essential.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 For example, they say you need them to make membranes, but you can grow cells in a culture dish in a completely fat-free mixture.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 And so the cells divide and act like normal cells, but there's no fat being added, so it can't be essential for making membranes.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 So obviously it was miscategorized or misnamed or misrepresented.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Well, the BRRS, I think it was basic incompetence that they didn't deal with the contrary evidence.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 They just simply ignored several very good and important studies and announced that their study had defined the essentiality of a nutrient, which other studies had denied and presented very good contradictory evidence.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 So when you look at the particular studies that are used as the basis for saying that they are essential, those studies definitely don't do it.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So I'm still waiting for someone to show me evidence that these fats are essential.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 I take it you have your coconut oil every day, right?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Not every day, but when I think of it.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Are there certain things that you take every day?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Yeah, milk. I try to keep my calcium intake high.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Calcium and thyroid are very closely connected.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 The thyroid and the parathyroid hormone not only live in the same part of your body, but they're very closely interacting.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 A hypothyroid person tends to have hyperactive parathyroid function.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 And the parathyroid dissolves the bones and tends to put calcium in places where it doesn't belong.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 When you aren't eating enough calcium to suppress the parathyroid hormone, then your body draws calcium out of the bones to make up for it.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And so chronic low intake of calcium or low thyroid function will eventually make your bones weaker and weaker as you age.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 What do you eat to get your calcium? How do you get your calcium?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 Milk and cheese mostly.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Any particular amount?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Yeah, I used to, I think, average about a gallon of milk a day.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 But over the decades, I think I'm now averaging maybe just a little over two quarts with some cheese.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Yeah, the milk is really pasteurized now and homogenized and really changed.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Let alone what's happening with the cows and what they're doing to the cows to get the milk now.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 It's a whole new world, isn't it?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Yeah, but when you look at all of the other changes in food supply in the United States,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 the other things are, I think, almost invariably, they're riskier than the processed milk.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 What are you thinking about, the radiation?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 Yeah, and even with organic foods, you have the natural toxicants in the foods,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 and the average supermarket food has been exposed to a lot of processing chemicals.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 For example, I advocate having a lot of gelatin if you're a meat eater.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 In the Orient and Latin America, chicken foot soup is a way people get extra gelatin.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 But it turns out in the United States, the chickens have to be processed with a chlorine-based antiseptic foot bath before they're slaughtered.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 So the American supply of chicken feet is almost always contaminated with chemical solution.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 A lot of chemicals show up in the food supply that don't have to be listed on the label as processing agents somewhere along the line.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 So how do we get gelatin? What's another way we can get gelatin? Is there a certain type of gelatin?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Yeah, if you buy the tough and bony cuts, like a lamb shoulder chop will have a lot more gelatin

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 than a regular lamb roast or lamb chop of the more expensive kind.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 And oxtail soup is extremely rich in gelatin.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Does it have to be from an animal?

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Yeah, gelatin only comes from an animal.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 And if you are not going to eat the meat, then the egg and milk, they don't have the virtues of gelatin,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 but they do have such a high concentration of other nutrients that you can get a balance of nutrients

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 if you combine fruits and vegetables with the milk, eggs and cheese.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Let's talk a little bit about pregnenolone.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 This is a really important supplement that you've been talking about, writing about for years,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 and it's also part of the orthomolecular array of supplements that people can take.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 You've been talking about it for so many years. I want you to share with the audience about pregnenolone.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 I just sort of accidentally discovered its value, and that started me reading about it.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 I had been experimenting how best to assimilate a supplement of progesterone and DHEA,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 and so I was trying all of the steroids that I had at hand in different solvents,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 and vitamin E worked very well for DHEA and progesterone, but it didn't seem to dissolve very much of the pregnenolone.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 And so I had a bottle of vitamin E that I was using just to use it up as a supplement.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 And during a trip of a few weeks, I started getting sick and went back and was so sick

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 I was staying in bed for, I guess, a few weeks before it occurred to me that the only thing different on that trip

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 was that I had not had my little bottle of vitamin E with me, and I thought,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 "Could it be that that E had retained some of the pregnenolone that I had stirred into it?"

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 And so I got up and took just a pinch of plain pregnenolone powder,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 and in about 30 or 40 minutes, all of my symptoms had disappeared.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 That was 1984, and since then, the symptoms have never returned.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 For several years, I took--every 10 days, I would take a good fat pinch of pregnenolone, maybe 300 milligrams,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 and one dose of it, for me, would last 10 days before the symptoms would return.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 And I bought a kilogram of it to experiment with it, and to see what a big dose did,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 I would take 3,000 or 4,000 milligrams at a time.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 Wow.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 It didn't feel any different to me than 30 milligrams at a time,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 but just to be sure it wasn't having any side effects that I could see.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 The main side effects were that it tightened up skin that had been loose,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 and made me look younger, and prevented all of the other migraine-like symptoms I had been having.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 But I ate the whole kilogram in just about a year, around 3 grams a day on average.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 What else does it do?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Well, after I saw that it was harmless, I started giving it to my friends.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 One friend who was 82 or so at the time was purple when I visited him at high altitude, town in Mexico,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 and all of his functions were slow.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 He had trouble even standing up, and was panting from emphysema,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 professionally diagnosed emphysema, and all of his tissues were starved for oxygen.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 I gave him probably an average of 500 milligrams a day for a week or two.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 When I came back, I think it was just two weeks later, his skin color was normal.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 His office was upstairs, a very steep climb on the stairs to get to his office every day.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 He took me to his office and then insisted on walking around the city,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 showing me various projects that he had, where he had hardly been able to stand up two weeks before.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 He was now making me pant with the exertion.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 So for audiences that are listening to you, talk about it, if you can, now much more directly.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 What does it do? What does it offer?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 I saw it doing things like that, just immediately curing emphysema in his case,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 and several other very quick things like bulgy eyeballs from so-called Graves' disease

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 that retracted so the person could close her eyelids in just a couple of hours.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 Those changes were so fast, I started trying to understand what was happening.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 It definitely wasn't an ordinary hormone effect.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 It seemed to be, in effect, causing swollen tissues, waterlogged tissues,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 to be able to release the water that was causing the lining of the lung to be thickened and closed up

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 and cause the tissue behind the eyeballs to be waterlogged and swollen,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 so that just like squeezing a sponge, they could release the water that was causing the malfunction.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 The slack skin that I saw in myself and a few other people,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 one man said when he had a heaping teaspoon of pregnenolone,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 he woke up the next morning looking like he had had a facelift.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 That, I think, is the same thing as the connective tissues of the body,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 whether in the lungs or the tissue around the eye socket

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 or the fascia that keeps the skin together.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 All of those tissues tend to become inert and waterlogged

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 when they're deprived of energy and nutrients

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 and they are under the influence of estrogen.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 Sometimes they're producing estrogen, but they're unable to use oxygen efficiently.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 The cells actually develop a smooth muscle-like function where they had been

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 apparently nothing but a fibroblast connective tissue cell.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 They now contract and return to their normal conformation.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 What do you suggest if women are on progesterone already?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Can they also take pregnenolone and can men take pregnenolone as well

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 or does it depend what other hormones you're taking or does it convert to anything else?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 How does it work?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 I tested a large amount of progesterone, various amounts on myself

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 and found that just like Hans Selye had accidentally found out

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 that a large dose of progesterone is an anesthetic.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 It has an effect sort of like alcohol. It can completely anesthetize you.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 You're talking about progesterone.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 Progesterone, yes.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 I don't want to overdose on that, but it does have many of the same protective effects

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 for example in emphysema and any edematous tissue.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Progesterone is one of the factors that will restore function to the tissues,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 but since pregnenolone doesn't have any of those anesthetic actions,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 you can take any amount of pregnenolone without any harmful side effects

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 and you should limit your progesterone, dosing it gradually just until the symptoms disappear.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 I take 200 milligrams of progesterone before I sleep.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Yes, that's the sedative effect.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 It's fantastico.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Now pregnenolone is also known as being really good for your brain.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Studies during the Second World War showed that when people were working in a bayonet factory,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 they were getting paid per bayonet.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 One group was given just a moderate supplement of pregnenolone every day.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 The others had a placebo.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 Then they would switch the groups.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 They found that the groups who were getting the supplement without knowing it,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 they simply produced more pieces per day and made more money.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 It made them able to cope with boring, repetitive work and work more efficiently.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 A couple of times I saw men who were not quite suicidal but extremely depressed,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 talking about quitting their job and just giving up.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 They both happened to be sitting in a dark corner of the room with a glass of wine,

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 wanting to retreat even within the room as well as from life in general.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 Thinking about the old bayonet studies and such, I put a pinch of pregnenolone on their wine.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Within about 15 minutes in both cases, they were grinning and talking about projects

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 and went back to work and were just as happy as they could ever be.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 So it must do something to the brain too. It's supposed to be very good for the brain.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 Yeah, but progesterone has those same effects.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 So why isn't pregnenolone and progesterone considered kind of a mother load of hormones?

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Well, they're the basic protective steroid hormones when everything is going well,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 when you haven't been poisoned with fish oil and chicken fat and so on.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 You make those at a high rate. By the time a person is 35 or 40,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 the body is becoming pretty soaked in those unsaturated fats.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 In animal studies, if you look what happens to various animals when they're fed a diet

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 lacking linoleic acid and DHA and EPA, for example, they make more progesterone, more testosterone.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 How interesting.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 It's like they stay in the puberty stage just for being deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 It's the direct opposite of what we're being told. How fascinating.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 Do you want to speak at all about memory?

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Yeah, progesterone and pregnenolone, obviously, since they improve mood and all of the body functions,

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 there have been a lot of studies showing that they improve all mental functions, including memory.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 Katharina Dalton, in her early book on premenstrual syndrome,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 showed that high estrogen impaired brain functions and progesterone prevented those and restored brain functions

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 so that women could do math, for example, as well as men,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 and didn't have mental problems that commonly come with both menopause and premenstrual syndrome.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 The effect of estrogen on the brain is to excite it very much the way cocaine does.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 It activates some of the same enzymes.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 And if you increase that, just like overdosing on cocaine,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 overdosing on estrogen causes epileptic seizures and mania and other processes of excess excitation.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 Progesterone, at one extreme, is anesthetic, but in its normal range of functioning,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 it produces calmness and prevents those extremes of excitation.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 And that's the sort of mental process that is good for calm, long-range memory.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 The thyroid, by raising the body temperature and increasing progesterone,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 the two of them work together to stabilize the body temperature at a high point

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 where estrogen lowers the body temperature.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Thyroid and progesterone reinforce each other.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 Each one increases the other if they aren't poisoned with unsaturated fats, for example.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 And raising the body temperature and the available energy to brain cells,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 they improve all kinds of mental functioning.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 That's why you can see demented people in just a matter of days become completely normal.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 With pregnenolone?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 Well, thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone, all of them or any of them, I've seen it happen.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 A woman who had been epileptic for 18 years,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 every year her neurologist would give her an IQ test

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 and tell her how far towards complete dementia she had progressed.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 She spent almost all of her day in bed.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 When she was up, she wasn't allowed out of the house by herself because she would get lost.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 With just progesterone in her case, even though she needed thyroid,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 in I think it was five days she came back to my house all by herself,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 completely normal and was able to work doing normal things.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 And she went back to graduate school where she had been considered to be basically an idiot.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 She went back to graduate school, got straight A's,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 got her master's degree the next year after 18 years of dementia.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 How impressive.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Let's talk a little bit about T3, T4 and free T3, free T4 and about the way we test for thyroid.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 What's your take on this, Ray?

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 Well, first the whole idea of a free hormone, it means something,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 but when you start applying it as if it was really a physical reality,

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 people get confused and start thinking about membranes and barriers

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 and things that don't really have anything to do with reality.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 But the test that they call the free T3 test does correspond fairly well to functions,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 but I just don't pay much attention to it because the function is what you should be attending to

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 rather than a blood test that even though it's right 90% of the time,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 sometimes it isn't right because other things are interfering.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 To interpret the free T3, you still have to really know what the reverse T3 is

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 because that can interfere with it.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 And high T4 in itself can interfere at a certain point with the T3.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 They can compete for the same functions.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 And of the blood tests that people ordinarily do, I think the TSH is useful.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 I pretty much go by a study that found that a population that had the lowest incidence of thyroid cancer

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 had a TSH of 0.4 and below,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 where people are often still claiming that if you have a 2.0 TSH, you're normal.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 But I think there is good evidence that health improves when you lower the TSH

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 down to somewhere in that range less than 0.4.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 And what do you think about the thyroid medication that's out there,

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 Armour versus the synthetics, Cytomel, what's your take on that?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 The first time I ran into problems with thyroid supplements was when I was teaching at the Nature Path College.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 A woman went to the university hospital in a coma and her history had been that she was somewhat hypothyroid.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 And so they gave her a T4 thyroxine supplement, one grain, and she got worse.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 So they gave her two grains equivalent, which I think was 200 micrograms.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 And they kept increasing it as she got worse.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 And at the point of 500 micrograms of thyroxine, she was in a coma and in the hospital.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 I'm sorry, it's not funny, but it makes me laugh.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 They gave her intravenous T3 and she came right out of the coma.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 And that started me paying attention to women who were, most of them were getting Synthroid,

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 just a pure thyroxine supplement.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 That's what my mother got.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 Several of them described their symptoms getting worse as they increased the dose.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 Some of them described strange noises in their heads or strange body sensations

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 that sometimes happen in hypothyroid people.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 So I read pretty thoroughly the animal research on T3 and saw that the brain,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 regardless of what is happening in your bloodstream,

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 the brain usually keeps a ratio of one to one, T4 to T3,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 even though the bloodstream might have 40 or 50 times more T4 than T3.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 The brain requires practically equal amounts to function.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 And an experimenter took slices of brain tissue in a dish measuring their oxygen consumption

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 and showed that when thyroxine was added to the slice, the oxygen consumption decreased,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 which is exactly the opposite of what T3 does when it's added to a tissue.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 So this is apparently what happens when someone goes into a coma while taking huge doses of thyroxine

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 or starts hallucinating when they're increasing their plain T4 dose.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 It's reaching such a concentration that the brain can no longer maintain its one to one ratio of T4 to T3.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 And so it's actually displacing the T3 and causing hypothyroid symptoms because T3 is the active hormone.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 What does that mean that most of us who are hypothyroid should be looking at something like,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 instead of armor thyroid, like a Cytomel or what?

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 Well, the trouble with Cytomel is that it's very fast acting.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 For example, if I'm writing and I can't remember someone's name, I'll pick up a five microgram chip of Cytomel and chew it up.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 And in about three or four or five minutes, I can remember anyone's name that I want to.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Almost instantaneous when you chew it.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 It peaks after an hour and a half and starts down. When I took my whole day's allotment of, I think, was 25 micrograms of Cytomel in the morning by sunset.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 After doing that for a few weeks by sunset, I was having hypothyroid arrhythmia.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 My heart would stop every six seconds or so for about a second or two too long.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 And when it would start doing that, it reminded me of several old people that I knew who had that kind of arrhythmia, a pause of a few seconds every several seconds.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 I found that just by chewing up a 10 microgram Cytomel, my heart rhythm would immediately be restored.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 A thyroid supplement had the same effect in some of my old friends.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 Within an hour, their pauses would quit. They would have a perfectly regular heartbeat.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 And if they kept that up, that would cure their circulatory problems for foot gangrene and various other problems that simply resulted from hypothyroid for circulation.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 What do you think of Armour thyroid?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 Well, I once bought a barrel of the powder and it was very good stuff.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 It was the standard for all of the definitions of how thyroid works from about 1910 on.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 But in the late 80s or early 90s, I think it was Revlon Company that bought the company from Armour.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 And then it went through a couple of sales each time increasing the price.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 But with the final owner, they decided to process the material more than the Armour Company had ever done.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 The Armour Company tested every batch, whether it was beef or pork, glandular or a mixture.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 They would test the batches on mice to make sure that it was the same potency.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 And then it would just add more or less glucose to reach the same potency.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 But the new company decided to market calcitonin, extracting it from the material.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 So now they kept selling it as Armour thyroid, but it was Armour thyroid minus thyrocalcitonin.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 And then they started adding different binders.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 At one point, they were using a polymer. I think they called it Explotab.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 It was supposed to make the tablet dissolve instantly when it hit water.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 And that was how the FDA had them demonstrate that in the presence of water, the polymer would basically puff up and release the glandular material immediately.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 But at the acidic pH of the stomach, the polymer failed to expand.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 And I talked to several people who found the pills weren't having any effect on them.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 And they found the undigested pills had passed through their intestine unharmed.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 But they've gone through so many changes. I haven't kept up with the changes, so I don't know.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 Several people have remarked that for about a year it tasted like rotten meat.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 So what do you suggest people do now? What kind of thyroid should they be taking?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 If you mix Cytomel and a thyroxine product, for example, according to your own needs,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 a doctor can prescribe whatever is convenient.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 And some people find that a two-to-one ratio is practical because if you took only Cytomel,

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 you would have to take a little bit several times during the day to avoid that effect of the short lifetime of the T3.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 And to get the right mixture sometimes takes quite a while.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 But usually anything in the range of four-to-one to two-to-one is practical.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 If you take the T4 mainly at bedtime, it helps to hold your TSH down

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 and reduce some of the nighttime stress symptoms.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 If you get your ratio, whatever the doctor prescribes, T4 to T3 in a ratio of maybe four-to-one or two-to-one.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 Four-to-one or two-to-one, meaning Cytomel?

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 No, Cytomel is the smaller number.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 Okay, very good.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 For example, each dose shouldn't contain much more than maybe 10 micrograms of Cytomel.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 So if you're going to take, say, 10 micrograms of Cytomel and 40 micrograms of T4,

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 then you should break it so that each dose doesn't give you much more than 10 micrograms of T3.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 I'm sure the audience is severely confused now,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 but at least I wanted you to share a little bit about your take on thyroid medication and dosages

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 and the understanding about it.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 Can we finish with a talk about coffee?

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 Okay.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 It used to be that for years we were told, "Don't drink coffee. It's bad for you.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 It activates your nervous system. You shouldn't have it."

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 And now we're learning it's good for you in moderation. Talk about it.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 Big monograph on caffeine was published, I think, around 1970 that I read,

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 and they described its anti-cancer effects, among other things.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 It was known at that time to protect against carcinogenesis caused by radiation

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 or by chemical carcinogens or even viral carcinogens.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 Other effects such as protecting against heart disease and many other degenerative problems have accumulated,

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:34.000
 but it's just the last several years that it's getting into the public media a bit at a time.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 But that one monograph 40 years ago really defined the safety and protective qualities of caffeine.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 And coffee in itself, even without the caffeine, is very rich in nutrients.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.000
 Dietitians, textbooks usually say that coffee has no nutritional value,

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 but the British Journal of Nutrition did some studies showing that in the British diet,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:09.000
 coffee provided about 20% of the vitamin mineral intake for several of the essential nutrients.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:19.000
 B vitamins, for example, the amount of coffee I drink in a day provides me something like 30 to 40 milligrams of niacin.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
 It's probably the most concentrated source of magnesium that we can get safely.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:34.000
 So for some of the B vitamins, especially niacin, and minerals, especially magnesium,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
 even decaffeinated coffee is a great nutritional supplement.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.000
 This is good news. I drink two cups a day in the morning, and I just love my coffee.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000
 Several studies find that more than five cups a day, people who drink the most have the least Alzheimer's disease,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000
 and Parkinson's disease, and thyroid cancer, and liver disease, and so on.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 I probably couldn't do five cups a day. I would have the jitters.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
 I think I'd be jumping up and down and running around and not quite as productive, but maybe I would be.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
 But two is good for me. Do you drink five cups a day?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
 I try to.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
 See, you do practice what you preach.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
 You're an artist. Tell us a little bit about your work in art, what you've been doing.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
 You spend a lot of time on your artwork.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.000
 Yeah, I found years ago that reading affects the mind in some not beneficial ways,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 and I found that if I would take a break from reading and talking and writing,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 and do sculpture or painting, that it would prevent the brain damage from too much verbalization.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
 And alternating between painting and sculpture is good,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 because you have different approaches to dimensional thinking,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 and using the verbal part of your brain too much tends to deepen the ruts,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
 and you can sort of jump out of old ruts if you paint or sculpt for a while.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
 Well, I never knew myself to be a painter or a sculptress,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
 but I will certainly try to get out of the verbal mode,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
 at least for purposes of this show and other communication.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
 I think I'm okay with that, but I'd like to learn how to paint.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
 I know it's relaxing, and it stimulates your imagination, doesn't it?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
 Yeah. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a portrait painter,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
 and I actually did that for several months,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
 and I found that the only people who could afford to have their portrait painted

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.000
 wanted you to represent their social status rather than the truth about them.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.000
 So when I would paint cute kids, the parents loved it,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
 but when I would paint piggish-looking kids, parents hated it.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 You spend a lot of time in Mexico still?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
 Yeah.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
 For rejuvenation or...?

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
 The high altitude.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
 One of my areas of study for the last 15 years or so has been carbon dioxide,

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000
 and high altitude cures everything if you can get high enough.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
 For example, I used to notice that every time I went up to about 8,000 feet altitude,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
 my myopia would quickly improve.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
 I had been using 12-diopter negative correction for nearsightedness,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
 and after a summer in Mexico, it had gone down to 9 diopters,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
 just a tremendous improvement in a few months.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
 And people going on just ski vacations for a few days,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 they've measured that the myopia will improve by a diopter or so almost immediately.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
 Do you think it has to do with oxygen, or you're saying it has to do with CO2?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
 CO2, as the oxygen gets thinner,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
 the carbon dioxide is retained in your tissues instead of being displaced.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
 We're all being slightly oxygen-poisoned chronically at sea level,

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
 and in hospitals that was demonstrated in the 1930s and '40s,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 that you should never give a sick person pure oxygen.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
 You should have 6% or 7% carbon dioxide added.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
 But just in the last few years, that information is being recovered,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
 but still most hospitals are killing patients by giving them pure oxygen

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
 when they really should have always about 5% or 6% carbon dioxide.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
 Well, don't forget that our EPA has now called carbon dioxide a toxin,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 even though it's food for plants and has created it as a boogeyman.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 So I would imagine there would be a distance from it

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 since there's so much misinformation about it.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 The medical culture after 1950 forgot the research that had been done

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
 showing that, for example, you can cure mountain sickness

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
 supplementing carbon dioxide instead of oxygen.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 I don't remember the Italian's name, but he was the first one around 1900

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
 to cure altitude sickness with a carbon dioxide supplement.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
 And then on one of the Everest expeditions

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
 where they'd been putting people in a plastic bag full of oxygen

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
 when they couldn't take them to a lower altitude,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
 it turned out that breathing inside the plastic bag,

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 they were providing their own carbon dioxide therapy.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
 After that was discovered, a few people would,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
 when they would go to a high altitude for a ski vacation,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
 they would take a little pressure canister of carbon dioxide with them

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
 instead of a big tank of oxygen.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
 How interesting.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 I actually interviewed the founder of the Everest Peace Project

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
 and I think I'm going to pass that on to him.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
 Yeah, there are a few publications available now on the internet

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
 describing that.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
 I have friends who have found that it's a very quick and convenient way

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
 to prevent or cure altitude sickness.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
 I also noticed you wrote an article about the eyes.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 I understand that you're talking about CO2 being a remedy

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 and getting to higher altitudes being a remedy for myopia.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
 Is there anything else about the eyes that you can share with us?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
 Ultraviolet light is damaging, so is blue light.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
 And the reason they damage the tissues of the eye,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
 especially in old age,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000
 is that the tissues have become increasingly unsaturated in the fats.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 The long chain polyunsaturated fats are damaged even by blue light,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000
 which does get to the retina where ultraviolet mostly is stopped

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
 in the cornea and lens.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
 And the ultraviolet will accelerate the formation of cataracts in the lens.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
 But even the blue light, if it's very bright

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
 and the person has become saturated with unsaturated fats,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
 then the blue light is going to contribute to damage of the retina.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 You know, you're a very interesting man to listen to and to talk with.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
 And I want to really invite you back at a later time

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.000
 to talk about some more of your research.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
 And I want to thank you for taking your time to be with us today and to share.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
 I know that you don't spend a lot of your time with people from the media,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
 understandably, but I wanted to tell the public

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
 that if you would like to read Ray Peat's articles or books,

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
 you can go to raypeat.com,

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 raypeat.com, and read about his background and research.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 Ray, I just want to thank you again for your gracious time today.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
 Thank you so much.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:08:12.000

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:37.000
