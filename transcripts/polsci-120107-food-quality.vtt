00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 This interview with Dr. Raymond Peat was recorded on January 7th, 2012.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Well, welcome to Politics and Science. I'm your host, John Barkasin, and this week I'm once again very pleased to have on my show Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 who has a PhD in biology and also has studied extensively in the fields of physiology and endocrinology and, in my opinion, is a very learned science historian.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Now, Ray, do you want to add anything to that bio or fix it?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Oh, no, that's okay.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 This show is inspired by two letters that Ray Peat wrote. It's on his website, raypeat.com. I think both articles are up there.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 One is called "Milk and Context, Allergy, Ecology, and Some Myths," and the other is "Vegetables, etc. Who Defines Food?"

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And both of them take on the issue of the quality of our food and how it's evolved or devolved over the years.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 And in this show today, I'd like to discuss various foods and how they've changed or been changed and how our culture and food production processes and our environment have influenced the changes.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Many of us feel that if we eat the basic food groups, we'll get the nutrition we need to be healthy.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 But, Ray, you write in these newsletters at one point that good nutrition involves much more than essential nutrients.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 So I'd just like to maybe back up a little bit and start at the beginning.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 How do we decide what is nutritious for us and how are these decisions traditionally made as opposed to now?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Well, traditionally, people just would eat something that tasted good.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And if they survived and stayed healthy, their families and descendants would keep eating it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 So each area evolved pretty safe mixtures of foods.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 But as soon as organization got involved, pharaohs or kings and dukes and so on, and eventually corporations,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 they decided people should eat what gave them the best profit.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 And so the health of the people varied according to the convenience of who was in charge of the economy.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 And since World War II, well, I guess the Germans really started it when they were blockaded in the first World War.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 They had a good advanced chemical industry, and so they started learning how to make substitute foods,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 substitute materials for war and so on.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And so they used it for civilian survival.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And by the second World War, they had developed pretty good imitation foods.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 For example, they fed their Russian prisoners of war on sawdust bread that resembled bread but had no nutritional value.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And the FDA saw the success of that, I guess, and decided, even though in the 1940s,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 they had said that gums weren't decent for human consumption.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 They produced some kind of biological damage generally.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 But they finally agreed with the corporations that it was okay to add fillers like sawdust, cellulose, seaweed gum,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 various tree gums and so on.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 So that now a baker recently said that he hadn't realized he could make a good loaf of bread with 18% sawdust.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 That's astounding.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 I remember when the fiber craze sort of hit the general culture, there were breads in our supermarket here,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 I think maybe Arnold or I'm not too sure about that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 But one of the brands definitely was advertising extra fiber in the ingredients was sawdust.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Yeah, now I think they have a more diplomatic way of saying that.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 I think they say nutritional fiber.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 And that can be, when they say that, that can be sawdust, you believe?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Yeah.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Anytime there's a pleasant sounding unfamiliar ingredient in the food,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 it's probably a waste product from industry.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 The chitin, various waste products from the shrimp industry are now used in food as well as health foods.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 If you look at each industry and see what they had the problem getting rid of,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 then you'll see the food technologists learning how to make people eat it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 That's very interesting.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 So the food waste just comes around again, gets recycled into the system again.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Yeah, for example, the EPA was having complaints from insect infestation and such,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 and mountains of pulp waste from the orange juice industry.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And they told the industry to do something with their horrendous quantities of pulp.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 And by using microbial enzymes, they found that they could make it water soluble

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 and have creamy orange juice, pulpy, fibrous orange juice.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 But it happens to be a chemical that would never occur in the natural fruit.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 And it has very unpredictable health results in the intestine

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 because it's something people would never have been exposed to naturally.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 The fish industry had a similar interaction with the Environmental Protection Agency.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 They were either dumping their fish processing waste into the ocean where they were processing

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 or hauling it inland for landfill.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 But it was so stinky, the EPA told them to find other ways to dispose of it.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And that's where they came up with the fish protein powders for sending to famine areas

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 or using as a food additive in the U.S. and fish oil.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 So the fat and protein found health food uses.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Yeah, the solution to pollution is distribution is a saying I've heard.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Well, that doesn't sound very appetizing, I must say.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 But I guess if you can sell it, this brings us back to convincing people to eat things as food

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 when they otherwise might not think it is food.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 It is interesting that one culture will eat something that's completely abhorrent to another culture.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 Like they do eat insects in Africa, I believe, and consider them a delicacy.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Whereas in this country, that's not considered to be a normal thing to do or even appetizing.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Yeah, once when I was visiting friends in Mexico, I ate with them

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 and there was a nice little thing that was sort of like a salmon cake, a patty,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 a mildly fishy tasting thing.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And I asked what it was and they said, "We'll tell you after you've finished."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Yikes.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 They said it was a mosquito cake.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Wow.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Mosquito larvae.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 You're kidding.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 Skimmed off a pond, I guess.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And they can skim off enough larvae to make a cake.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Yeah, they have very fine nets especially for that.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 They get some minnows, but that happened to be the very little mosquito wigglers.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 And that's a traditional food of Mexico?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Yeah, that particular area. It was over on the eastern side, somewhere near Jalapa.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 And how did that sit in your stomach after you learned what it was?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 Very well. It tasted just like eating a salmon patty.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Yeah, well that's interesting.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 So how do we decide what food is?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 It sounds like you're saying that basically we're told at this point what's food and what isn't

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 and our instincts aren't really working?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Oh yeah. I think it's the thought process.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 One of the ugliest Mexican food products I think is the fungus-infected corn kernel.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 It makes a big blue swelling on the corn cob.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It's a mushroom growing in the corn, but it stimulates a tumor in the corn.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 So it's somewhere between a tumor and a fungus.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 But it makes a very pleasant -- you can buy them canned in the U.S. --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 but it's a very pleasant semi-mushroom tasting material.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 And that's something that isn't a traditional food, but is something that has been adapted for modern use?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Yeah, it is a traditional food, a very old source.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 It just occurs spontaneously in the corn, but I guess they can infect corn to make it industrially.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Do you feel like most of the -- or a lot of the foods that we eat now are basically influenced by industrial marketing?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Yeah, almost entirely.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 About 40 or 50 years ago I read that the food industry had been testing various things against their panel of experts.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 And they found that the public taste preferred artificial flavors over real flavors in things like ice cream.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 They had been so trained.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 It's hard to know where to go.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 This is such a huge topic.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 But since you mentioned ice cream, I know that at one time -- and maybe it's still true --

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 that they were actually exempt from revealing what their ingredients are.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 The ice cream lobby somehow obtained an exemption from the law by which people have to declare what's in the foods.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 So they can say artificial flavors and it's a bunch of chemicals, basically.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Yeah, that's still the general practice.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 And worse than that, they don't even have to mention on the label something which is actually present.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 It was mostly removed.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 They call it a processing aid or incidental ingredient.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 And even though it's really there, even though they intended to remove the bulk of it,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 some of it's there and can cause allergic or toxic reactions.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 But they don't have to say it on the label.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 So that's a bunch of chemicals or one chemical or anything they want to use.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Anything, yeah.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Yeah.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 And even if everyone is following those extremely useless rules of the FDA,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 apparently the industry doesn't take the FDA very seriously

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 because I've bought ice cream from companies that said all natural ingredients.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 And I would generally intend to buy just the vanilla because I didn't really trust them.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 But sometimes I bought vanilla pure white ice cream from the company that used only natural ingredients,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 but it would have a very intense strawberry flavor.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 And other times from the same company I bought what was labeled vanilla ice cream

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 and it tasted just like vanilla ice cream,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 but it didn't have the black flecks that vanilla normally did.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Instead it was dark brown chocolate colored, but absolutely vanilla tasting.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 From those two or three times that someone at the factory messed up,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 it proved that the use of brown coloring and a pink coloring and artificial flavoring

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 instead of the three natural ingredients that they claim.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 Might as well just cut to the chase here.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 And one of the things I wanted to talk about today since we're on the subject of ice cream,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 and that is that a lot of times ice cream makers use thickeners.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 The gums you were speaking of, carrageenan and locust bean gum,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 and there's another one too I can't think of, guar gum.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 And in fact I think everybody thinks those might actually be good for you,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 but maybe you can explain to people, and a lot of people out there have allergic reactions to foods,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 why these gums may actually be the thing that's causing the allergic reaction

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 and not the milk that the ice cream is made with.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 Oh, well the FDA recognized that problem 60 years ago,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 and the literature is full of published reactions to all of those gums.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Carrageenan and alginate from seaweed are probably the worst of them.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Carrageenan is recognized to be carcinogenic to the intestine and liver and to produce inflammation.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 It's a standard lab method for producing arthritis or inflammation of any organ that they want to study.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 But the assumption I guess is that if it only irritates the intestine and causes cancer in the liver,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 that is tolerable.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 But what they're neglecting is that these particles or fibers,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 even much bigger than the molecules that have the gum function,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 the particles of that size are fairly massively passed through the intestine.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 If you imagine that when a person is under stress, even bacteria and larger particles,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 up to the size of a red blood cell or larger, can go right from the intestine into the bloodstream,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 where then the immune system has direct interaction with them.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 And if the particle is big enough, it can stop the flow through a capillary or arteriole.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 So small additives aren't going to stay entirely in the intestine.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 The particles of silicon dioxide, people say, "Oh, that's just harmless, fen-like material."

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 When it's produced by vaporization or precipitation,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 they might call it fumed silica or colloidal silica.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 What's it used for?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Almost everything.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 They can use it to create a viscous consistency in cosmetics and soaps

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 and any food that needs a new texture.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Almost all vitamins and drugs are now using that or something like it

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 to make the powder flow nicely when they're running it through the machine.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 And it's basically a very finely powdered glass.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 But the powder, it's much smaller than the particles of starch, for example,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 that can be preserved across into the bloodstream.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And at a certain size, they very easily go from the blood into tissue cells.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 And at a certain size range, they are very able to cause sensitization

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 so that something like silicosis, even though it's supposedly being amorphous rather than crystalline,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 supposedly they aren't going to cause the silicosis-like reaction,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 the things that people get from the silicon implants and so on.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 But there is an actual immunological similarity and overlap when the particles are of a certain size.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And there are various names for that, but silicon dioxide or silica is the basic description.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Yeah.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 And so that gets into your tissues and causes--

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Chronic inflammation.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Okay.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 Degenerative inflammatory changes.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 I see.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 Such as lupus-like symptoms.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Scleroderma is probably the most common thing caused by the silica reaction.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Now, it's actually hard to buy any processed food now that doesn't have some of these things.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Carrageenan, I was very interested in your newsletter that we're talking about today.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 I think it was in Milk in Context, Allergies, Ecology, and Some Myths.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 That's available on your website, rapeheat.com.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 You were saying carrageenan is some kind of a pseudo--causes a pseudo-latex allergy reaction.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 And I was wondering if you could talk about that because a lot of people are allergic to latex.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Yeah, well, the carrageenan is--one of the arguments is that in its unbroken down form,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 fresh out of the seaweed, it doesn't cause cancer, even though it might cause horrible inflammation.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 But when you eat it, it passes through the intestine where bacteria break it down.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 And the broken down form of carrageenan is recognized as carcinogenic.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 But try to communicate the logic of that to any of the regulatory agencies.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And they all just reveal that they're serving industry and convenience rather than protecting the public.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Well, that seems sort of odd because a lot of things are fairly harmless when they're outside your body,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 but when you eat them, they're poisonous.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 So I don't see why that would be hard for them to understand.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Well, they specifically say that undegraded--the fiber undegraded isn't carcinogenic,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 but degraded it is carcinogenic.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 But they neglect to point out that your intestine has bacteria that can degrade it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 And the reaction to latex is really a general phenomenon that plants all have some kind of defense reaction.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 And even under the best conditions, they'll produce some of these.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 But they are able to adapt so that when they're injured, they increase their defensive material.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 So if a bug bites a plant, it expresses the enzyme that can break down the fibrous material of the bug, the chitin.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And so chitinase is a general defensive enzyme that is intended to dissolve bugs and any pest that invades the plant.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 But when you stress a plant in any way, it defends itself and increases all of these defensive toxic chemicals.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 And simply mistreating a plant by growing it in a monoculture, forcing it with not well-balanced fertilizers and so on,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 the plant is intensely stressed and so produces increased amounts of these defensive toxins and enzymes.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And so a plant that's growing in the wild might not be allergenic or toxic.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 But once you've cultivated it under extreme conditions for generations,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 it will produce things such as toxic latex that will kill people who are sensitized to it.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 But lots of stressed plants can produce exactly the same kind of enzymes.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 So it isn't just literal latex, but it's any stressed plant that is able to produce similar enzymes.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 So you're saying that people are allergic to latex because the plant is purposely producing a toxic chemical to protect itself when it's wounded.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Yeah.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And like latex comes from a rubber tree, is that right?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 Yeah, bananas and rubber trees are the first ones to identify the same kind of allergic response

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 across reaction between natural latex rubber, for example, surgical gloves or other surgical materials.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 And bananas, people who have a dangerous reaction to one will usually have it to the other.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 But those people will also react to many other kinds of fruit.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 I think kiwis are a major overlap.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 But probably almost any plant that is industrialized and forced into production

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 will increase their production of these things.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 So recognizing that a person who is allergic to bananas is likely to be allergic to six or eight or ten other similar fruits,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 not even similar fruits, but industrialized fruits.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 And not all people are affected that way.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Maybe this is too big a question, but why are some people affected by those plant toxins and others not?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 The person who is under stress is, I think in that newsletter I mentioned that estrogen induces a similar protein in humans.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 And things like estrogen, which intensify the stress reaction,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 are probably increasing throughout especially the industrialized populations.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 And the biological function of estrogen is to stress and activate tissues to get them growing quickly.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 But it should only act for 12 or 24 hours per month to activate and make the tissues take up water, swell up, start growing and so on.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 But when we're chronically exposed to industrial estrogens in the environment, that activates our stress reactions.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 In the intestine, for example, it makes the intestine more permeable and will simply take up more things.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 But it also activates particular patterns of enzymes.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 It activates enzymes in the intestine that overlap with the gluten molecule.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 And our immune systems, reacting to overdose of estrogen effect, don't distinguish that from gluten.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 And so the gluten interacts with chronic estrogen exposure to produce very serious chronic inflammatory symptoms.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 And that enzyme happens to be a cross-linker that estrogen activates in the skin, for example.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 It ties protein molecules together.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 And when this enzyme is extracted from microorganisms, bacteria make a similar enzyme,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 it can be used to tie any protein together that contains, I think it's lysine and glutamic acid, which is basically any protein.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And the food industry is widely using that enzyme to make artificial fish and meat products.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 So if you go to a fast food restaurant and order a fish patty,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 you're probably getting a mixture of seaweed gum and a fish waste fragment glued together with this enzyme,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 which cross-reacts with estrogen effects and gluten.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And you would never expect that sort of enzyme to exist in a fish patty, but it's industrially useful.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 So that lunch meat, even things that are sold as, I guess, lamb chops,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 are imitated by gluing meat fragments together.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 They call it restructured meat.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 We had been eating squid patties for years,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 and there was something in the meat case that looked like the usual product.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 And I cooked two of them, and they shrank down to about the size of a silver dollar

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 from having been about four or five inches across.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 And we recognized something was wrong, but since that was what we had fixed for supper,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 we went ahead and ate them and got really sick.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 I was sick for over a week after eating it, and so I looked up what was happening to squid patties,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 and they use seaweed jelly like alginate or carrageenan to make a jelly,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 and then they sweep up all of the waste products that didn't have the right shape

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 and grind them into a mush and add the cross-linking enzyme so that the mush coagulates.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 But it's intermixed with the seaweed jelly, so it contains a huge amount of water,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 much more water than the normal squid, so you get terrific shrinkage,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 as well as this weird chemical composition,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 cross-linking the fish proteins, the squid proteins, with the seaweed jelly.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 I don't think that would sell well on the menu at a restaurant.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 No, but you get it very often, fast food places especially.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 They used to have textured soy protein that looked like chicken or ham.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 They were very skillful at making a fibrous meaty appearance in soybean protein,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 but now they don't even have to use that much of a natural product.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 It can be seaweed and waste meat scraps that are reshaped entirely.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Well, I always, you do wonder when you go by the deli in the supermarket

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 and you see all those hams and roast beefs and other cold cuts,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 and they're also uniform and perfect, a turkey loaf,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 and I suspect what you're talking about is how they achieve that uniform look.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Yeah, and all the studies that I've seen comparing various foods,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 one of the most carcinogenic is processed meats, just as a big category, anything processed,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 but that mostly includes those loafy materials.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 So, I mean, those meats are also full of a lot of additives and preservatives

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 and strange-looking acronyms that represent chemicals.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 I suppose it's a combination of all that that is making them carcinogenic.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Yeah, and the aging process, they add deodorants and things to change the smell of aged meat,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 but just the practice of aging meat probably makes it more carcinogenic

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 because when meat starts to rot, the odor chemicals are polyamines,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 cadaverine and putrescine are the chemical names of two of the things that aging produces,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 and those stimulate cell growth, and there are techniques being developed

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 to block the production of those in tissues to stop cancer growth,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 so their connection with cancer is well-known,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 and just storage of the meat too long will produce those things,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 and then on top of that, they add the various preservatives

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 and even the harmless-sounding things like citric acid

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 because they're produced by microorganisms from waste byproducts.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 You get some of the chemicals from the industrial waste material that you started with

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 and then some microbial additions to the mix,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 no matter how careful they are trying to refine out a pure citric acid,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 it always has traces of where it came from.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 So even the nice-sounding ingredients aren't really so nice when you might be sensitized to them.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Yeah, that sounds rather discouraging.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Oh, I did want to ask you about aging meats because a lot of people around here

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 raise their own cattle and sheep and things, and it's just common knowledge

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 that it doesn't taste good unless you age, you know, hang them for a few days

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 or I think it's maybe five days at 40 degrees.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 The meat gets more tender and gets more flavor.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 It definitely gets more flavor, but that's mostly advertising.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 The people who are in the habit of doing it that way insist it tastes better,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 but the reason I eat more meat when I'm in Mexico is that it tastes better because it's fresh.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Because in the small towns where they don't have refrigerators,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 they just sell it off the carcass,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 so they have to sell it within the first two or three or four days.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 And it always tastes really fresh.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 It's very rare to find fresh tasting meat in the U.S.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 I mean, up here the people I know who do it hang it for maybe four days

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 at a very cold temperature like 40 degrees,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 which would be difficult to do in Mexico, I imagine.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Yeah, but four or five days at 40 degrees, it still can taste very fresh.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 But in the supermarket, the food technology people have said

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 that it gets tender after two weeks, so you shouldn't sell it before two weeks.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 But it also develops putrescine and spermidine and cadaverine

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 that are mildly toxic, possibly carcinogenic.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 Yeah, I've got to say putrescine doesn't sound too good to me.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 And the FDA has never been very enthusiastic, or the Agriculture Department,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 about enforcing laws against chemical treatment of the animals while they're alive.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 There is some pressure to make them not inject chemicals in the last day or so

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 before they kill the animal.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 But in Europe, recently there's been evidence that they're treating their living animals

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 with big doses of glucocorticoid steroids to break down the fiber while they're alive

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 to tenderize the meat.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 Now, I thought Europe was averse to that.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 Yeah, they are, but they, I guess, aren't spending enough enforcement money,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 and so the industry is getting away with breaking the rules.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 You were going to say something else when I interrupted there.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Oh, just that even though the rules are in place, you can't trust anything

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 that comes from a big corporation because the FDA is doing its best to look the other way.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Yeah, I think that's--we've discussed this before on various shows,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 and it does seem that the regulatory agencies are really there to just absorb the liability

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 of the corporation and be a buffer between them and the public.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 We haven't discussed at all in detail growing practices.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 You said that growing crops in monoculture makes plants produce a lot more toxic chemicals,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 the chemicals we've been talking about somewhat.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Is there a way of growing things that isn't so stressful?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Yeah, if the plant grows more slowly, the soil will more naturally release chemicals

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 that the plant can select from, but when they're adding chemicals that they know

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 that the grower knows will stimulate the fastest maturation and production

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 or whatever they're interested in, the plant isn't absorbing exactly the ideal combination of nutrients,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 and so it distorts the actual structure and physiology of the plant.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 There have been experiments in which corn was fertilized heavily with potassium in one case

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 and with phosphate in the other group, and they found that--I forget which way it went.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 I think it was the potassium fertilizer caused the plants to emphasize their tassels,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 the male pollen-producing component, and I think it was the phosphate fertilizer

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 that made them overproduce the female cob part of the reproductive material.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 So you can almost change the sex ratio, the balance between the male and female parts of the plant

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 by pushing one or the other kind of fertilizer just for those two ingredients,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 and when they're designing a fertilizer to produce the most fruit or seed or whatever they're after,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 the plant isn't going to be as happy being forced in that direction,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 so since it's having its physiology warped, that's usually enough for it to also produce

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 some of the toxic chemicals defensively.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 And one of the things that people have known for many years is that the roots of plants

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 generally have less of the defensive toxic chemicals that affect animals like us

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 because they're defending against fungus and bacteria that live in the ground,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 where the upper part of the plant, the leaves and stems and seeds,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 are defending against grazing animals and insects and people that pluck off the easiest parts to get at.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 So the worst toxins are in the leaves and seeds, and in many cases the plants want to spread their seeds,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 which are defended by internal toxins, but they want to spread them by having birds

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 or other animals eat the fruit and pass the seeds through to propagate them elsewhere.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 And so the fruits are evolved in many cases to be delicious, nutritious and non-toxic.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 So if you look at the plant's defense system, the fruits are almost always the safest part

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 and the roots would come in next as the second safest.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 Seeds are the very worst for the plant's toxins and leaves are intermediate for toxicity.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 And is that in part why so many people have an intolerance of gluten and flour products?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Yeah, all of the storage proteins have the multiple function not only to pack a lot of nitrogen

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 into a small space in the seed so that when water is available,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 enzymes can rearrange the stored energy material with the nitrogen

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 and double or triple the amount of protein because it basically just packs nitrogen

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 into a specialized protein for storage.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 And those proteins also have the added benefit to the plant of being irritating,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 indigestible or toxic to lots of predators.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 I see. Somebody pointed out recently, I think it was on a show with you,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 that the gluten that a lot of people seem to be allergic to these days

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 is considerably worse than it used to be because they've been actually breeding wheat plants

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 to develop more gluten because it's useful industrially for producing food products.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 And that's actually made it easier for them to produce bread but harder for people to digest it.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 And that sort of brings up the subject of the agricultural practice of breeding

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 and its new form of genetic engineering.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 A lot of food products are being bred, I think, more and more not for delightful eating

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 but for marketing, meaning that they ship well and that they'll store well

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 but they don't necessarily taste well.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 Yeah. In the 1940s, tomatoes often had a very intense, nice, aromatic flavor.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 And I haven't seen a tomato like that for about 50 years

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 because they're all the commercial seeds.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 Even people who buy seeds at a seed store are going to get non-traditional fruits.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 Every farmer used to have their own variety of vegetables

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 and those heirloom vegetables have largely been lost.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 Some people are storing the seeds but they aren't being widely propagated.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Around here people are always buying, they are available, the heirloom tomatoes.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 We've been plagued by blight these last few years

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 so I don't think many people have gotten great ones.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 What's your take on the effect of genetic engineering on food quality?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Is there any benefit?

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 We're mostly talking about the harmful effects of industrial practices on food

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 but perhaps there's a silver lining somewhere?

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 No, the genetic engineering, the most common thing is to put an insecticide protein into the plant

00:44:48.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 and people or animals are known to react allergically to a strange protein that wasn't there before

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 and other insects, they're seeing butterflies killed by the insecticides that were put there

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 to defend the plant or make it more profitable to produce.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 I think allergies are the main thing to worry about with meddling with genetic composition of plants.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Well, allergies certainly seem to be on the rise from my observations.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 What's your take on people's allergy?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 I think all of the major allergic symptoms are increasing

00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 but some studies show that unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in a woman's diet when she's pregnant

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 seriously increase the allergies of the baby.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 So it isn't just the food supply is changing but the human supply is being sensitized by the stressful things in our national diet.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Can you explain what that is, Ray?

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Well, the omega-3 fats are...

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 Grass, for example, has more than the grain seed product.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 The seeds have more of the omega-6 fats and they're a little more stable.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 The minus 3, I think, are in the leaves because they don't have to be stable for so long.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 And the cold temperature resistance corresponds to the highly unsaturated, especially N-3 fats.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 So the algae in the ocean at a low temperature will produce highly unsaturated N-3 fats

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 that are known as fish oils when the fish elongate them.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 They're being highly promoted starting, I guess, with the waste from the fish industry

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 and the discovery that the linoleic acid that was popularized as the essential fatty acid,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 they discovered that was pretty carcinogenic.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 So there was a shift in marketing from the cotton seed oil or safflower oil type of fat

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 over to the fish oil type.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 All kinds of arguments have been advanced to encourage people to eat more of those.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 A French group decided that since the brain of an adult contains lots of the fish oil-like fats

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 on the diets that we've been exposed to, and babies, any mammal before it's born,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 synthesizes mostly saturated fats out of the glucose and fructose absorbed from the mother's blood.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 So this French group said, "The baby's brains aren't getting enough fish oil."

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 So they set up an apparatus to make a sound and record the fetus's response to the sound

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 so they could tell how alert the fetus's nervous system was.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 They were going to demonstrate that they could make the fetus learn faster by feeding the mother fish oil.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 What they found was that the nervous function was impaired in the women who ate the fish oil.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Other studies showed that the babies would be more allergic too.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 But in the study of the learning ability, they also found that the babies were smaller,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 implying that their brains and bodies altogether grew less under the influence of the fish oil,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 probably because of the anti-progesterone effect,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 keeping the bias in the uterus towards estrogen against progesterone,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 progesterone being the brain growth factor,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 and lowering thyroid in proportion to the unsaturation of the fats.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 So the population which has its progesterone and thyroid suppressed

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 is going to be the more allergic stressed population.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 And you're saying the fish oil is also included in the same category as vegetable oils

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 like safflower oil and cotton oil and corn oil, all the unsaturated oils.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 The big difference is that the seed oils are highly unsaturated,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 but N-6 means that they have a tail of five carbon atoms that are saturated,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 like stearic acid and palmitic acid are things that we can synthesize in our bodies out of sugar,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 and those are all saturated and very stable.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 At least the seed oils have this chain of five completely saturated carbons at the tail end.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 The fish oils, N-3, have only two stable carbons at the end, so they oxidize much more easily.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 I get you. So in the few minutes we have left, Ray,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 perhaps we should try to strike some kind of a positive note.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 There is food out there to eat,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 and what in your opinion is the food that people should be focusing on both for pleasure and for health?

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Well, fruits, if you know that they're grown in a safe, unchemically treated environment,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 it's fairly hard to find really ripe fruit in the stores,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 but if you can find ripe oranges or tangerines, those are very safe for juicing, for example.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 And eggs, if you can find eggs that weren't fed linseed oil or soy oil

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 or something that gives them a fishy taste, just go by the taste.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 Sweet oranges, eggs that taste like eggs and not like fish meal,

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 and meats that taste fresh.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 Milk, it's important to judge the taste of the milk too,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 because there are so many different feeds that the cows get.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 If they feed a natural pasture that's full of allergenic weeds, organic milk,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 it can be allergenic just because the cow is eating a weird mixture of vegetables.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 Yeah, I just... go ahead, sir.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 Well, those foods are really the only ones I trust at all,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 and I'm suspicious of them in the American stores.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 Eggs, milk, some cheeses, you have to be very cautious with cheeses,

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 because they're putting seaweed and other gums in them to increase their water content.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Eggs and meat are among the safest.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 And just to go back to the dark side, they're increasing the water content,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 for what reason? To get more money for the cheese? To add to the weight?

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 Oh, yeah, they can add 30% to the weight just by putting more jelly in it.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 There was a Wisconsin parmesan that I ate for years,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 and suddenly it got soft and moist and caused bowel inflammation in me.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 So I stopped that and found the real parmesan called Reggiano is the only one that I eat now,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 and a couple of other strange ethnic cheeses from Greece or Italy still have the traditional methods.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 And you said that... I thought I've heard you say that fresh cheeses are safer to eat than aged cheeses,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 but it sounds like you're eating some aged cheeses.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 Yeah, because I can't find any fresh cheeses in the US that don't have additives.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 And what's the difference between... in terms of benefit, what's the difference between fresh and aged?

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 They should be chemically and nutritionally very similar in value,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 but the aging process typically involves the growth of a fungus that improves the taste for giving them aromatic qualities,

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 but it is also a risk if they use a different fungus than one you're accustomed to.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 So for security, cottage cheese, if they haven't added anything, is very safe.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 But I don't use any cottage cheese now without washing it,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 because the ones that I have access to add lactic acid and what they call dressing.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 So by rinsing it, I lose about 30% of the weight of the material, but it comes out to be a clean milk curd.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 So milk, eggs, and some meats, if you can find some that are... I guess any of these foods,

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 if you can find them, that they're raised without pesticides.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 Yeah, and fruits.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 Some of the very specialty things that you only see once or twice a year, even in very adventurous stores,

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 cury moyas and sapotas.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 I think California and Florida grow some good sapotes.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 And some of those very sweet, mushy papas are available in parts of the South especially.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 Occasionally they come out to the coast.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 But the southern states, they're a traditional fall fruit.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 I've never had any of them.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 They all sound very exotic.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 Well, they were.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Like George Washington, I think, said the papa was his favorite dessert.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 Is that right?

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 They're a very common native dessert, but it's the industrialization.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 They're tender and fragile, and so they aren't good fruit of commerce.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 Like a real peach, which I actually had one of those fairly recently.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 It's unbelievable when you get a real peach.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Hey, you know one dairy product that we found recently that we think is pretty good is called Faya.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 It's a Greek strained yogurt.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 Yeah, it seems that they've got most of the lactic acid out of it.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 There's no extra ingredients listed on it, so it just seems to be milk, maybe some salt.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 Yeah, the main thing wrong with ordinary yogurt is that it's got lots of lactic acid in it.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 So it's basically the same as cottage cheese for safety.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 I think it's good.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 Yeah.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 So if you can strain the lactic acid, which we've covered in other shows,

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 but you don't think it's a good idea to eat extra lactic acid, then it's a good food.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 It should be minimized.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 That's why I don't advocate aerobic exercise.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 People should do everything they can to minimize lactic acid.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 I think I'm going to do a newsletter on cancer and the role of lactic acid in cancerization.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 But it also promotes inflammation and fibrosis and degenerative diseases.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 It's good to avoid it in the foods as well as produced by stress.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 Well, I look forward to that newsletter, Ray.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 And now we are actually out of time, so I should tell everybody that we've been talking to Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 He has a Ph.D. in biology and extensive studies under his belt in the fields of physiology and biology

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 and endocrinology and knows a lot about science history.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 So you can visit his website at raypeat.com,

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 where you'll find the articles we were discussing today in part and many, many others.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 Ray, thanks so much for coming on Politics and Science today.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:08.000
 The interview you just heard with Dr. Raymond Peat was recorded on the 7th of January, 2012.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 Much more information can be found about Dr. Peat's work at raypeat.com.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 And podcasts of this show are sometimes, and hopefully will all be available at Politics and Science on radio4all.net.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 Radio4all.net and search for Politics and Science.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
 I've been your host, John Barkhausen.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 Thanks for listening and tune in again next week for another edition of Politics and Science.
