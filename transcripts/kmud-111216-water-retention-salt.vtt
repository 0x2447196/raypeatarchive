00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 I think it's bigger than my bedroom.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 However, I have to say that I'm not wild about the car's color, which the catalog calls "Grigio Caldo."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Huh? I learned from an Italian dictionary that this means "warm drab," which doesn't exactly like my fire.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 But maybe the dull color is why these Ferraris are priced at only $395,000 each.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 And what the hey, you can always take the car to an Earl Scheib paint shop and have the color juiced up.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 What makes the FF worth the price, though, is its exclusiveness.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Neiman's made only ten of them available, and get this, each one comes with a numbered plaque,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 thus certifying that you're one of the ten most special humans on Earth.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 This is Jim Hightower saying, "But alas, I called too late to get mine."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Neiman said that it sold out within 50 minutes of the sales date.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 It just shows how tough it is out there for us luxury shoppers.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 And you thought you had it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 If you sold what you had to sell or found what you're looking for, be sure to call KMUD so we can take your ad off the air.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Also, you can find our class ads on our website at kmud.org.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Well, it is 7 o'clock in the Humble O'Nation, and time for the Herb Doctor.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 I just want to remind you, lest we forget, what rocking is all about.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 You are tuned to KMUD Garberville, the voice of the free.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 That means we are on the World Wide Web at kmud.org.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And rock me on the water at 99 1/2 on your FM dial out in Shelter Cove.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 I think that's it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 We've got a theme song.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 It's great to be here tonight with the Herb Doctor and his wife.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And we'll be joining them in Studio B in just a moment.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 [Music]

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 My name's Sarah Jo Hennepin Murray.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 and graduated there with a Master's Degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 about a wide range of conditions,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 and we offer alternative medicine and nutritional counseling.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Now, this month we want to explore the misconceptions surrounding

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 water retention and the medical advice to avoid salt,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 as well as the overprescription of diuretics,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 with special reference to toxemia of late pregnancy

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 and the role of inflammation and poor energy reserves as a cause for concern.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 We're going to be joined here by Dr. Raymond Peat here in a couple of minutes.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 But you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of salt, inflammation and diuretics.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-568-3723.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 So that's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 And this is the last show for this year, for 2011,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 and we'll be with you back again in 2012.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 OK, so hopefully Dr. Peat will be with us.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 I think actually it looks like they're still trying to get him on the line here.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 So this month's show, again, as I said,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 is going to be mainly looking at the topics of salt avoidance with respect to water retention

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 and opening up that misconception with facts and science supporting the use of salt

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 rather than the avoidance of salt for decreasing water retention.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And also look at Dr. Tom Brewer's pioneering research work on toxemia of late pregnancy.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 So for those women that are listening,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 probably a very noteworthy part of the show will be based on that toxemia.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And the things that Dr. Brewer has proved to reduce swelling

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 and actually reduce the actual occurrence of toxemia completely.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 His diet was very instrumental in making that a new way of looking at toxemia

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 because pretty much the medical advice for women with toxemia was actually counterintuitive in many cases.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 So hopefully Dr. Peat is with us on the show.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 I do have Dr. Peat, but I just wanted Sarah to reintroduce herself

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 because I kind of mangled that introduction.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 So if she could do that and then we could get on with the program.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Thank you. I was wondering if I could hear my own voice in my ears there.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 My name is Sarah Johanneson and I'm joining Andrew Murray.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Sarah Johanneson Murray and I'm joining Andrew Murray and we have Dr. Raymond Peat on the line.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Thank you. And we do have Dr. Peat and here he is.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Thank you.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Hi, Dr. Peat.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Hi.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 So once again Dr. Peat is joining us to illuminate the way as it were

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 then through the misconceptions that we so often repeat as truth.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 So thank you for joining us Dr. Peat.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Again, would you please describe your academic and professional background

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 for listeners maybe new to the show who perhaps have never heard your name?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 I studied biology, physiology at the University of Oregon and have taught various hormone and nutrition related courses

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 as well as in other fields, psychology and philosophy included.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Okay. So your main interests I know have been around looking into hormones

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 and much of your research has given you new insights into the treatment of many situations and conditions

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 with hormones like progesterone, pregnenolone and others.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 In terms of the, I think perhaps we should start with something like modern diuretics.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 We come into contact with people that for one reason or another are using diuretics to decrease water retention

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 whether it's ankles, fingers or cardiac water retention.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Is there any safe diuretics that you know of that are prescription medications in terms of the way that they act?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Yeah, there are some that are relatively safe but it's the whole theory behind why they exist that is the problem.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Mercury compounds used to be used.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Basically they just kill the kidney cells and let stuff leak out

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 and they were the common diuretics for a very long time until the 1950s.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 New compounds came on the market that had a variety of effects on the kidneys

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 and it was really the promotion of those that created an ideology that diuretics are really key to treating heart disease

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 and several other problems such as toxemia of pregnancy.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 But really I think it's mostly a marketing strategy to orient physiology around making the kidneys leak out more water.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 The real problem is what causes the water retention and almost anything that seriously injures the organism causes water retention.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Like a problem following surgery very often is that the person stops forming urine and shock.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 Any very serious sickness is going to in many ways cause the reduced ability to form urine properly

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 and it's sort of a plumber's approach to physiology to think of just opening up the kidneys and letting the liquid out faster.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 So from a herbal perspective dandelion leaf is a little bit less effective than the dandelion leaf

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 but it works as a diuretic and that's what I thought they had created furosemide from.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Although then with furosemide I know you have to have a prescription of potassium along with it

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 and dandelion leaf or most green leaves have a lot of potassium so it just kind of works out that you don't need to take potassium

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 if you use dandelion leaf as a diuretic.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 But would you consider furosemide as a safe diuretic?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 It's got a long history of use and it probably does have an actual beneficial effect on survival

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 but with almost any leaf extract the potassium and magnesium are going to have a diuretic effect

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 so it's probably safer than the actual function on the kidneys.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 Oh that's interesting.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Okay so the inflammation in the first place is the main cause in many cases for the cessation of diuresis

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 and the increase in water retention in the cells through damage.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 So you're saying that it's much more important to look at what's causing that inflammation

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 and trying to get to the root of the problem rather than just prescribe a diuretic.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Yeah even before the inflammation there's the energy problem

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 and something as simple as drinking too much water in relation to the energy your body is producing

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 for example a low thyroid person who can't produce much metabolic energy

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 is very susceptible to drinking too much water and getting a very general disruption of their physiology.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 A pint or so of water passing suddenly through your stomach to your intestine

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 is a surge of serotonin release and that's simply a model of stress or shock in general.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 Anything that shocks you or stresses you tends to start the same process

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 but just a surge of water hitting the intestine is enough to increase serotonin

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 which then stimulates the production of prolactin and prolactin is associated with water retention.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Serotonin itself is in a direct way and serotonin increases the production of aldosterone

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 which produces water retention and inflammation and sets off a chain of reactions

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 that lead to such things as heart failure.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 And the unfortunate thing is when someone is low thyroid they're usually very thirsty all the time anyway

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 so they crave that water and they think they have to have that water in order

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 because they say their body is really craving it.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Yeah, it causes the tissues to retain water even though it's passing through them

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 through the kidneys mostly and they aren't producing much evaporation through their lungs or skin

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 but it tends to leak out of their blood stream into the tissues and produce edema

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 and edema is harmful to all of the tissues in a direct way.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 It turns on a whole anabolic system shifting away from oxidative metabolism

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 activating lipolysis, the release of fatty acids,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 shifting cell metabolism towards burning fat rather than sugar, imitating diabetes and aging.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 So it's a generalized shock physiology that's involved when cells get waterlogged.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 It can start with low thyroid but it feeds back and makes the low thyroid problem worse.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 So that's why you said that even any kind of leaf extract or tea made from a leaf of a plant

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 is going to have minerals in it that help prevent this from happening.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Yeah.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 And if you made a cup of tea you'd sip on it slowly.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 You wouldn't just drink it down like a pint of water.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Yeah, and the minerals, it isn't essential that it be magnesium and potassium,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 calcium and sodium have many of the same functions

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 even though each thing has its place in the mechanisms.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 If you're in shock you can relieve the symptoms pretty much by taking more of any one of the alkaline minerals,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 potassium, sodium, magnesium, or calcium.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 In heart failure and lung inflammation,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 many of the things that happen with shock or aging or any serious disease,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 the lungs and the heart tend to get waterlogged and lose function.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 So just giving a very concentrated salt solution intravenously will relieve the symptoms very often.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 They've doubled the survival or cut the mortality rate in half by just giving extra sodium intravenously.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Now, it's a very interesting point that you've just opened up there

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 because that begs the question, why is it so often that doctors tell people to avoid salt?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 And why is salt so maligned heavily as a problem element?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Especially when they are swelling and then here they're using it in surgery.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 It really, I think, got its big boost around 1950 when the diuretics came on the market.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 They found the diuretics took sodium out at the same time they took water out.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 And so they said you should get the same effect by restricting the sodium intake.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And they applied that to pregnant women.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And Tom Brewer and some other people wrote about the horrible effects of sodium restriction in pregnancy

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 plus using diuretics.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 If you combine the two, you get more serious effects.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 After I had been reading Tom Brewer's work for a long time,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 I was seeing similarities between premenstrual syndrome and the toxemia of pregnancy that he had worked on.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And I finally decided to suggest to young women who were having premenstrual water retention

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 and not having any good results just by stopping their salt intake,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 I suggested that they follow Brewer's prescription to increase their salt intake

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 when they were having edema water retention problems

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 and to go according to their craving for salt rather than avoiding the craving.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 The first person that tried it just had a total avoidance of premenstrual water retention.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 The very first month she tried it.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 And how much salt did she?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 Quite a lot.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 What, like a teaspoon a couple of times a day or a quarter teaspoon?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 She just shook it on even if the food was already salted.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 She would just add more, lots more onto it.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 And it just absolutely stopped right from then on.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Never had a water retention problem again.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 I wonder, do you know why or where the mechanism for which doctors will tell you that salt is,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 you know, it causes, it can increase the risk of stroke, heart attack,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 and just generally very bad for your cardiovascular system

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 and so people should avoid salt at all costs.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Where do you think that mistaken ideology has come from?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Yeah, David McCarron 30 or 40 years ago was studying the issue

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 and he looked at the figures that the government published that that recommendation was based on

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 and he thought that if you look at the figures carefully,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 the people who eat the least salt had the highest blood pressure

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 and the people who ate the most salt had the lowest blood pressure.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 And he saw what the figures really showed that led to this interpretation

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 was that low calcium intake was associated with hypertension

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 and the sodium was really there sort of as an innocent bystander

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 associated with the calcium deficiency.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 So you're saying that that calcium deficiency is more responsible for hypertension?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Yeah, David McCarron I think has probably written maybe 150 articles on the subject.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 I think he was at Stanford or some California university when he started saying it's not high sodium,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 it's low calcium that causes hypertension and I think that university invited him to leave.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Oh, now isn't this, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 but am I thinking right when you've mentioned in the past that low calcium intakes

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 cause calcium to leak out of the bones and into the blood

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 and that causes the calcification of the arteries eventually which gives you the hypertension?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 Is that part of the mechanism?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Yeah, that's the essential idea.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 The low calcium intake among other things

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 increases your parathyroid hormone which pulls calcium out of your bones

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 and favors its movement into cells of all kinds

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 and when calcium is taken up by cells it stimulates them and tends to make them contract

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 and that's one of the places that thyroid and the energy production comes into the question

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 because carbon dioxide produced by the action of thyroid,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 carbon dioxide keeps calcium out of cells

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 even if you breathe in a bag and increase your carbon dioxide

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 or take baking soda or whatever,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 the carbon dioxide will relax your blood vessels

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 by helping the calcium to move out of the blood vessels and back into the bones.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Okay, so are you thinking along the lines of even relatively short term exposure

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 to higher blood levels of calcium and/or tissues,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 endothelia picking up the calcium can contribute to that lack of elasticity

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 that will be more characteristic of high blood pressure and hypertension?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Yeah, each of these things sets in motion a whole sequence of events.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 The low carbon dioxide which lets calcium get into cells and excite them

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 and tighten up the blood vessels for example,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 low carbon dioxide also lets the platelets release their serotonin

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 and the serotonin besides adding to the tension of the blood vessels

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 makes them permeable and leaky so that the water isn't retained in the blood stream

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 but leaks through into the cells

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 and the cells that are taking up calcium are also taking up water.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 So basically 2,000 milligrams of calcium is a really important thing

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 for somebody with hypertension to start implementing into their regime.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Yeah, and supporting it with the other minerals.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 The fact that David McCarran looked at showed that this inverse connection

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 between salt and blood pressure, the high salt eaters actually had lower blood pressure.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And one of the things that is involved there is that sodium helps the cell,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 stimulates the cell to expel calcium.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Sodium activates the thyroid function

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 and the thyroid function pushes calcium out of the cell and lets the cell relax.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Right, because you mentioned the relaxation effect from thyroid so that's also indirect.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 I know it's a little bit confusing probably for our listeners

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 with this talking about calcium inside and outside of cells

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 but basically the salt helps to put the calcium where it should be

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 and not being deposited in your arteries, in the cells in your arteries.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 So I'm just trying to make that a little bit more understood there.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Okay, well you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD, Garberville, 91.1 FM.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of salt, inflammation and diuretics.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 or if you live outside the area the toll free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 And we're pleased once again to have Dr. Raymond Peat to join us

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 and to bring out some of the misconceptions that we all have passed.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 And one of those misconceptions is that salt is bad for you

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 and that salt will increase your heart attack or give you stroke

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 and that salt is not what you need if you've got swelling and edema

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 but actually as we're finding out salt is very important to decrease edema.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Now we're going to ask the doctor if he can call back at 923 3911.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Area code 707.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Area code 707 and I will just put him directly on while I'm reading our underwriters at the bottom of the hour.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 Doctor if you could call us back at that number I think we can lose the hiss that we've got behind you.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Would that be okay?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 What was the number?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 Area code 707 923 3911.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Okay.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Okay give us a call and I'm just going to put you directly on

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 and just wait until I'm done reading and then the herb doctors will be back on.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Okay.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 All right thank you.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 All right everybody.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 I just want to read our underwriters for partial underwriters for our last hour.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Support for Redwood Community Radio comes from listeners like you

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000

 and by phone at 707-223-1569.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 And I do believe we should have Dr. Ray back on the line here.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Dr. Ray, are you with us?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Yes, I'm here.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 All right, so it is 728.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 You are tuned to KMED Garberville, the only place where you can hear the herb doctor,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 on one Friday a month here.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 And let's get back with the program.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Hi, Dr. Peat. Thanks for doing that.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 I think there was a pretty bad hiss on the line, so hopefully it's going to be clearer now.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Yeah, no, that sounds much better. Thank you.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Yeah, okay, good.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Okay, so getting back to the diet that Tom Brewer brought about for the treatment of toxemia of late pregnancy

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 and a diet which actually resulted in none of his hundreds, if not thousands, of clients or patients who were pregnant ever getting toxemia.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 He was very big on drinking quite a bit of milk.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 It was part of his diet.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Well, there's the calcium.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And there's the calcium, yeah.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Also salt and lots of protein, right?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Those are the main things that he was suggesting?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 Yeah, he was talking about the protein and adding salt to your food.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 But the milk has other things besides the protein.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 The calcium has its direct effect on blood pressure.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 And the sugar of milk has its diuretic-like action.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 So the calcium and sugar add to the quality of the protein.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Now, we've talked a little bit about the--we've mentioned furosemide as a diuretic.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Are there any safer, effective diuretics that we wouldn't perhaps think of diuretics,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 perhaps?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 If you think of the sequence of stress effects that I mentioned, too much water leading to too much serotonin and aldosterone and prolactin--

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Which are all inflammatory.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 Sorry to interrupt, but those are all inflammatory compounds.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Yeah, and cause water retention.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 And if you choose your substances with reference to inhibiting any or all of those, that's going to be an anti-edema,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 anti-inflammatory diet or treatment.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Thyroid and progesterone, for example, lower all of these things.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Progesterone is a very powerful antagonist to aldosterone.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 And drugs are being developed to be very similar to progesterone but to be patentable so they can seldom treat heart failure

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 and water retention and inflammation and so on.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Do they not have the same effect as the progesterone?

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Enough that they all cure heart failure and such, but they have their own side effects.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 They're just trying to make them as similar to progesterone as they can to minimize the side effects.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 But using any of the natural steroids derived from pregnenolone, either progesterone or DHEA,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 will help with water retention and edema and heart failure and so on.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 And that's because they're antagonizing the effects of aldosterone.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Yeah.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And aldosterone is causing the inflammation and the water retention.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Yeah, and aldosterone increases.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Besides inflammation, it leads to fibrosis and prolonged heart failure and vascular and kidney disease and so on

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 that lead to fibrosis, lung disease.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 Everywhere that water retention and inflammation start, they tend to end up with fibrosis.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 So 60 or 70 years ago, a researcher, Lipschutz, called pregnenolone and progesterone

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 the anti-fibromatogenic steroids, they start out inhibiting fibrous overproduction

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 and end up protecting against tumors.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Wow.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 We do actually have two callers on the line, Dr. Peat, for you.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 So let's take the callers and I think we'll take the first caller now.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 The engineer's put his hands in the air as if he's lost them.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 I lost Dr. Peat.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 If he can call back, let the caller ask their question, but he won't hear it.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 Oh, darn it.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 I'm going to have to call him.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 All right, but the caller is on.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Okay, we'll try calling Dr. Peat back.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Hello.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Hi, Cole.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 You're on the air.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Yeah, this is Topical.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 You're discussing on calcium.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I don't know if you want to go to specifics, but I'll give you a short story.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 About nine months ago, I was in ICU for a week and a half because my calcium went crazy.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 I was later diagnosed with sarcoidosis, and my doctor wants me to get down on my calcium level.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 So you're saying that your calcium level was high when you--

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Yes, very high.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 And you're low.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 And it shut down my kidneys, et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Yeah.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 That was nine, ten months ago.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 Okay.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Once a month, I do a calcium level check, blood test.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 Do you know what your calcium is?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Huh?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 Do you know what your calcium value is?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Doggone, I wish I knew the number.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 But the problem is he's got me on 15 milligrams of prednisone.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Oh, dear.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 To keep my calcium level down, and I love milk.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Yeah, well, the prednisone, I'm sure, is because the--

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 I know I hate prednisone.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 Yeah, it's an anti-inflammatory steroid, so because of sarcoids and inflammatory--

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 So I know that caused the issue, but I think he's using a prednisone to keep the calcium levels down.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 But the way you talk, it sounds like calcium levels are a pretty good idea.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Well, calcium, not in the blood, but in the bones, which is where the calcium should be.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Consuming adequate dietary calcium in the form of powdered eggshells or consuming dairy in the form of milk,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 getting about 2,000 milligrams of calcium a day will actually let you store the calcium in your bones--

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 That's what I do.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 --and prevent it from being in your bloodstream, which is what happens when you don't take up enough dietary calcium.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 So when you said your blood levels were high, that's because your bones were allowing the calcium that was in the bones to leak out into your blood supply.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 And that's caused more of the problem.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 But the best way to lower your blood calcium would be to intake in enough dietary calcium.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Okay.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 And that does help-- blood pressure is affected that way as well?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Yeah, but that would also cause-- what Dr. Peat was talking about with calcium is that calcium in the endothelia,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 which is the tissue within the lining of the arterioles, the vascular supply that's under high pressure,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 that is actually made more stretchy and elastic by not having calcium taken up into it,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 which happens when there's too much calcium in the blood and not enough in the bones.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 Your body, through parathyroid, starts to pull out calcium from the bone and bring it into the blood.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Yeah, we want to do the reverse.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Exactly.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 So making sure you have a high enough dietary intake of calcium will be the best--

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Which would be a lot of dairy products.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Well, it doesn't have to be dairy products.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Dairy products are very good, and we do recommend milk intake.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 Protein?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 No, four to six-- dealing with dairy, four to six glasses of whole milk if you're not overweight,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 or 2% if you don't want the fat so much.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Right, I do.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 But then one of the other best ways of achieving high calcium in your dietary intake will be capsules of powdered eggshell.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Oh, really?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Yeah.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 I mean, what Dr. Peat's always talked about in the past is taking your eggshells and just washing them out,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 washing that membrane out from the inside, storing them until you have ten or a dozen or so,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 and then putting them in the oven at about 350 on a baking sheet, a cookie sheet.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 And then they just--

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 And then put them into a coffee grinder, an electric coffee grinder.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Got it. Okay.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 And then that resulting powder, you can take about half a teaspoon a day will give you--

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 Yeah, about a quarter teaspoon three times a day is just over 2,000 milligrams.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 So that 2,000 milligrams of calcium there will be very beneficial in terms of decreasing your blood calcium

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 but increasing your uptake of calcium into your bones.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 And we've seen this with our clients.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 We've seen that they have a high calcium level in their blood.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 Hold on one second.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 Yeah, maybe I won't.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Okay, so just one last thing I'll tell you and then we'll move on to the next caller.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 What we've seen is when people have high calcium in their blood,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 it's because they're not getting enough in their diet.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 And when they start supplementing their diet with a higher calcium level, like closer to 2,000 milligrams,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 2,000 milligrams is about two quarts of milk,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 or we told you about the eggshell, a quarter teaspoon three times a day is about 2,000 milligrams,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 or you can do some of both.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 But then you'll see the blood calcium--

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Okay, you're on hold? Okay.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 --the blood calcium level come down to a normal range, which is around nine.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 All right.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 I'll definitely try the eggshells.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 I'm 75 years old.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 I'm a sarcoidosis, whatever it is.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Definitely puts me on the fritz.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 The other thing that you should do in conjunction with that is actually supplement with a vitamin D supplement.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 All right, I've got that.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Yeah, the calcium and vitamin D work fairly synergistically.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Yeah, I had kind of a reverse opinion.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 I thought less was best.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 No, because you want to bring your blood levels down by making sure you're dietary intake--

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Right, give it back to the bone.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 --give it back to the bone.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Right, exactly, yeah.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 All right, so thank you very much.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 I'll let the next caller go.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Thank you. Bye-bye.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Hi, you're on the air?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Hello.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 Hi, it's your normal engineer.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Hi.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 How are you doing?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 So I got chicken pox, which is going around.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Oh, dear.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 And I was wondering if, you know, some anti--or, you know,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 I was wondering what your recommendation would be,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 and also I had learned from you guys that coconut fat is antiviral.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Yes.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 So I'm actually using that as a solve on my sores,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 and I was wondering if you thought that was a good idea.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 Yeah, and internal would be good, too.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Oh, yeah, I'm drinking a ton of coconut milk, too.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Yeah, internally.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 So you've never had chicken pox before, then?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 No.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 Okay, so now's your first time.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 How bad is it?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 I think I've been told it's going to get worse.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 I've only had it for a day.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 Right, because in adults it's generally more severe, they say, than in children.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Yeah, from a point of view of anti-infectives at this point,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 being a viral situation, I don't know how much can be done that quickly.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 I think your own body will certainly get on top of it.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 I don't think there's anything per se that's going to really knock it back

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 now that you're coming out with it.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 In terms of your skin and the lesions there,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 there will be things that you can do to kind of minimize the itching,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 which is probably one of the main symptoms.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Not yet, but that's what I've heard.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Yeah, well, when the vesicles burst, they're kind of fluid-filled,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 and when they burst, they'll then become quite itchy because that's a condition.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 It's just like shingles and herpes, the same kind of --

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 varicella zoster is the same kind of family,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 so they all have this kind of weeping characteristic

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 where the fluid-filled vesicles burst, and then they get very itchy.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 So in England, I know that calamine lotion is not exactly herbal,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 but calamine lotion was a fairly good, soothing, calming, topical application.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 What is calamine lotion?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 I'm not sure what calamine is.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 You could probably look it up.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 You could Google it, I'm sure.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 But it's basically a liquid that you will put on with cotton, cotton wool,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 damp cotton wool, and dab it on the skin in those areas that are particularly itchy.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 I'm trying to think if there would be anything else that would be more systemic

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 that you could use as an antipyretic to stop the itch.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 Maybe if we get Dr. Peat back on, he'll have some suggestions.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 But I'm afraid the engineer is wrestling with the phone,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 and Dr. Peat is still out of action at this point in time,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 so I don't quite know what's happened.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Well, I'll keep listening.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Thank you very much.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Yeah, I feel bad for you.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 I hope you have a happy Christmas, anyway, despite this,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 because it's probably going to be another 7 to 10 days, I think,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 before it's kind of getting resolved.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Yeah, that's what I hear.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 I'll ask Dr. Peat, as and when we get him back on the air,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 to see what his advice would be.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 But I'm sure calamine lotion could be something that you could look up,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 and I think that as a topical application that would be pretty good.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 I know that he'll probably mention other things that would probably be better,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 so let's just see if we can get him back with us.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Thank you.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 And happy New Year and happy Christmas.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Thanks.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, have we managed to--

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 have we got Dr. Peat back on the line yet?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 We don't have Dr. Peat back on the line.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 Okay, I'm not sure what's going on.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Do we have any more callers on the line?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Yes, I had a question.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 You were talking about the CO2 levels,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 and I have been studying a little bit the Guteko method,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 which is an exercise which will actually increase the CO2 levels.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Okay, good.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 And, you know, as you mentioned, it can increase the relaxation,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 and for me it helps with things like insomnia.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 And I'm curious in relation to what you're talking about,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 I didn't quite get the full picture of what the CO2 levels,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 like raising those CO2 levels, what impact that might have.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Right.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Okay, well, Dr. Peat's talked fairly extensively about the benefits of CO2.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 I think most of us always associate CO2 as a poisonous gas

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 that we need to get rid of by exhaling.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 When actually I think the truth in the science is that oxygen itself

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 is probably more poisonous than CO2.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 And CO2 in its own right is actually very anti-inflammatory

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 and actually associated with greater longevity.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Peoples and cultures that live at high altitudes, like the Tibetans

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 and the people in the Peruvian Andes,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 have actually much, much greater health records.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 They actually have much less inflammatory disease.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 They have way less cancer incidences.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 And generally the inflammation is much less amongst the communities

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 at high elevation because of the beneficial effects of CO2.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Dr. Peat has mentioned several times the method by which you can just bag breathe.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 You get a brown paper bag and sit down in a chair and relax

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 and just breathe in and out, re-breathing your own CO2.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Now this is also a very good way of increasing CO2 levels.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 So I think the main effects were the anti-inflammatory,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 anti-stress effects of breathing in CO2

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 and also the longevity effects that do come with it are well documented.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Okay. Thank you very much.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 You're very welcome.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 Okay. Are there any more calls on the line?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Hi.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 Hi, Yonia.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Hello. I just had a recommendation for the--

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 Hello.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 There was a caller there but they suddenly disappeared.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Dr. Peat, are you on the line?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Okay. I'm not sure what's going on until someone tells me what's going on.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 I'm not sure. The call has been cut off and we've lost Dr. Peat.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 That's not a very good evening.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 But anyway, the engineer is going to do what he can.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 He's doing his best frantically to get Dr. Peat back on the air.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Well, we should start anything new or see what comes of his frantic attempts.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Okay. I think there's another caller on the air.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Hi, Yonia.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 Hello.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 No, I don't think the caller is there.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Okay. Well, Sarah, how about you?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 I think this is Dr. Peat.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Hello.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 Oh, no. This is our caller.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Hi, caller. I think you were cut off a moment ago.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 Where did Dr. Peat go?

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Hi, my caller.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 So I was suggesting for if you thought--

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Okay. One minute. Our engineer is also on the line.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 So, engineer, you're on the line, too, so we can hear you talking.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 Okay. Hang with us, caller, until we get his microphone off the air.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 Baking soda and vinegar at--

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Okay. You've taken the caller off the air again.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Hello.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Do you want to tell the engineer that he's taken the caller off the air?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 I have both callers on, so she can talk. I haven't cut her off.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 But we were also hearing you.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 Well, I guess we can't hear her. I think maybe you turned her volume down to us.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 It's a meltdown in the studio.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 You're doing a good job there, engineer.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 There's a bit of a problem here.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 We had a fuzzy connection to start with with Dr. Peat on the line, and then--

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 Then we cut him off.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Okay.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Well, bag breathing is another way that you can help to lower--

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 Since we've been talking about high blood pressure,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 bag breathing is also very good to help lower someone's blood pressure

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 because it helps with that CO2 and putting calcium in the right place.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 So that's another use for that.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 And we talked about the anti-stress effects and the anti-edema effects of increased CO2 as well.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 And that's the high elevation civilizations also have way less stress

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 and way less inflammatory diseases.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 So I wonder if they have less heart disease.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 That would be an interesting epidemiological study.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Okay. Well, the engineer is still shaking his head.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Okay.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 I'd rather just kind of wait and see if we can get Dr. Peat back to us because it's--

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Well, you're listening to Ask Your Ab Doctor on KMED Galbaville 91.1 FM.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 And from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 people are invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of salt,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 inflammation and diuretics.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923-3911.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 Or if you live outside the area, the number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 So if there are any people that have been listening to the show,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 we'd like to call in with any questions.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 Please feel free to do so now.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 Otherwise, we're going to still see if we can get Dr. Peat back on the air.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 [Pause for response]

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 Hello?

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 Yeah.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 So I've been listening to the show today.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 And it all sounded very interesting to me.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 But I'm curious how it could pertain to athletes.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 It seems like diuretics, salt, calcium, all very critical in sports.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 I don't know if you've been able to get the doctor back on.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 I think they're still working on it.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 But what was your main question in relation to the topic in sport?

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Well, yeah, I always have to calculate things like sweat loss

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 to then calculate how much I need to intake during sport.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 I particularly practice a lot of running and cycling sports.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And I was curious how to calculate salt, how much salt intake I should be taking.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 Okay.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 How much do you take in general?

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 Well, all my supplements, usually they're sports supplements,

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 have a certain amount of sodium in them.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 And I take the recommended dosages of those,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 whether they're two scoops of the product to 20 ounces of water per hour.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 But, again, I don't know if that's the adequate amount

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 or if the doctor is saying that maybe we should be taking higher levels of sodium.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 Well, I do know that there's been a study that's been done with baking soda

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 showing that athletes performed better when they took up to a tablespoon of baking soda in one day,

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 spread out, obviously, because you don't want to be diluting your stomach acid

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 when you're trying to digest some proteins with a meal.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 But that's because it increases their CO2,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 and as an athlete you're blowing off a lot of CO2 when you're exercising,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 especially with all that heavy aerobic exercise.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 And it would be very good for you to have constant,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 almost like you want an IV of glucose while you're exercising,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 an IV of glucose and all these minerals so that you don't put your body into a stressed state

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 and you'll actually cope better with the endurance exercise.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 Okay.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 So in reference to CO2, am I actually looking to put my body in a slightly more hypoxic state?

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 Yeah, because--well, no, you are putting--yeah, you're over-oxygenating yourself

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 when you're doing aerobic exercise because you're blowing off so much CO2.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Right.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Which is actually a very negative thing to do.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 In effect, the carbon dioxide is pulling more oxygen through your cell system.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Did the caller hear that?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Have we got the caller on you on the line?

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 I'm still on the line.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 Good.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Could you hear Dr. Peat?

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 I didn't hear what he said, no.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 You didn't?

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 Okay, sorry, Dr. Peat, can you repeat that?

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 Yeah, the carbon dioxide acts as if it's pulling more oxygen into the cell system.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 It activates the electron transport chain to use oxygen more quickly and effectively.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 So that is what would happen when this athlete would take baking soda?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 Yeah, they've done it with endurance races,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 giving them a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of the race.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 And you would think that it would make them more alkaline.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 Alkaline is not necessarily a good state.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 The carbon dioxide actually enters the cell and becomes an acidic form from the baking soda bicarbonate,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 which momentarily makes your blood more alkaline.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 But the absorbed carbon dioxide becomes acidic inside the cell,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 and the intracellular state should be slightly on the acid side when the oxygen is really working.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 They call it oxygen because it means acid former.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 And the acid that it makes is carbon dioxide.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 And in that slightly acidic state, oxygen is having its full action for producing energy.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 And it's that same energy production which takes the calcium out of the cell

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 and lets the cell relax and recuperate properly.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 If you aren't producing or retaining enough carbon dioxide, the cell will begin making lactic acid,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 and the lactic acid leaves the cell in an alkaline stressed condition.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 Even though it's acidifying the blood, it's leaving the cell in a stressed alkaline condition that causes inflammation.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 So too much aerobic exercise becomes catabolic and inflammatory.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Right. Caller, are you there? Caller, did you hear what Dr. Peat had said?

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 Yes, yes I did.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 Perfect.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Very good information. Thank you.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 Do you have anything else you wanted to say?

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 No, no. Thank you very much for answering my question.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 Okay, you're very welcome.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 All right, so I think we have two more callers here,

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 so let's take them one at a time and see if we can get through them before we get close to the top of the hour.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 You're on the air, caller.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 Hello, am I on?

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 Yes, you're on.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 Okay, I have a suggestion and also a question for Dr. Peat.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 I live in Leightonville, and last year I discovered a product down in Willits at Mariposa

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 that is incredible for itching, and I got it for poison oak.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 And it's called Manzanita Magic, and it comes in a three-ounce bottle.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 It is wild-crafted manzanita, grape root, plantain, chickweed, organic sage, thyme, and cayenne.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 And it's a dark liquid, and I'm just wondering if that would work for chicken pox.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 Yeah, I wonder.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 And that's just my suggestion.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 My question is --

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Well, let me just say one thing quickly about that.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 That's a wonderful product, and I know the lady who makes it, and that's a really good idea.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 So thanks for calling in and letting us know that.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 And, Michael, if you're still listening, get yourself some Manzanita Magic.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 Terry makes it.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 Did you mention aspirin for chicken pox?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 No, we didn't.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 So I would like you to talk about that, if you would.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 Let's let the caller finish.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 Can I ask my question, and then I'll get off the line?

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 It's about calcium and getting it back into your bones.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 I've been dealing with breast cancer since 2005

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 and had to really pay attention to trying to keep calcium in my bones.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 And I would like to know -- my understanding is that it's specifically vitamin D3

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 that assists with calcium going into the bones.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 And I'd like Dr. Peat to comment on that

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 and also on the ratio of calcium and magnesium that he might recommend.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 And I'll take my answer off the air.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Thank you.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that question?

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 Yeah.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 The ratio isn't as big an issue as a lot of books say.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 If you're getting a little excess sodium and calcium, it spares the magnesium.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 The sodium and calcium activate cell respiration,

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 and cell respiration is needed for cells to retain magnesium.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
 So if you're low in sodium and calcium,

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 you depend on a good thyroid function to retain magnesium.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 So any stress that increases albosterone, for example, is going to make you lose magnesium.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 So keeping your albosterone and inflammation down,

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 your thyroid calcium and sodium up is going to make you retain magnesium much more efficiently.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 All right.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 We've got three callers and five minutes.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 We won't get that done in five minutes, but first let's go back.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 Dr. Peat, would you first give some more suggestions for Michael,

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 our engineer who's got a chicken box at the moment?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 Okay.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 Aspirin has been found to have a mild antiviral effect against several types of virus.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 Someone with AIDS sent me an old publication

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 that they had begun a trial of aspirin for HIV-infected people,

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 and they were getting good results when they discontinued the study.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 But it has been proven somewhat effective for several different kinds of virus,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 including the herpes or chickenpox type.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 And, Michael, call us.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 We'll give our number out at the end of the show in case you don't have it,

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 and we'll help direct you with the amount of vitamin K you need to take in order to use aspirin safely.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 And also another thing, Dr. Peat, can you please comment about vitamin D?

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 For that lady with the calcium, she wanted to know why vitamin D was so important.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 If you're having blood tests, it's good to have your vitamin D3 in the upper part of the normal range,

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 and it would also be good to have the parathyroid hormone checked.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 When you're getting enough vitamin D and calcium, you will inhibit the parathyroid hormone,

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 and the parathyroid hormone, although it has its place, you don't want it to be chronically elevated.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 Because it's a cancer promoter.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 Yeah.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 And we have another three callers on the line.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 Let's at least take one.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 We've got two minutes left here.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 Hi. So my suggestion for the itch from chickenpox is a vinegar baking soda mix.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 I've got enough money to get through Christmas.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 Oh, actually, I'm working, too.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
 Okay. I'm sorry.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 Listen, we're getting lots of stress here in the studio, and it's one minute to itch.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 No, it's hilarious.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000
 So I'm sorry, caller, to have cut you short with that recommendation.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 For everybody's sanity, we need to make sure that we close the show at 8 o'clock, pronto.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 And thank you so much for all those people that have called in,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000
 and thank you, Engineer, for dealing with the stress associated with losing callers.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
 And our beloved Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 Okay.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 And we're just going to give out some contact details.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 Yeah, contact details for Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 Visit his website, please, www.raypeat.com.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
 That's raypeat.com.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 Lots of scholarly articles, fully referenced scientific literature.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 Open your eyes, folks, and go and take a look at what he's got on the website.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
 That will refute a lot of the misconceptions.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
 Thank you to all those people that have phoned in.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 And we can be reached.
