WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 also at K258BQ 99.5 on your FM dial.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Worldwide, we're on the web, kmud.org.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.280
 And let's get to a little music.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.440
 It's seven o'clock straight up.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.880
 Therab Doctor's next.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:28.340
 (upbeat music)

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.920
 (upbeat music)

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.140
 All right, we didn't have any luck on the third CD player.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.560
 Doc, can we just go live to the program?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.100
 All right, The Herb Doctor is in the house

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.980
 and prepared to bring us another transformative

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 life-enhancing program.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 Let's go to Studio B for certainly one

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.100
 of my favorite programs on the Mudd.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.100
 Ask The Herb Doctor.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 Doctor, take it away.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.860
 - Okay, all right, I guess first things first,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.660
 I just wanna make sure that Dr. Peat

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.980
 is gonna be contacted, good, okay.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.460
 All right, well, sorry about that, folks.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.900
 I normally have the intro/outro music playing,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.460
 but for some reason, the disc's unreadable.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.540
 Okay, anyway, thanks so much for joining us.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.540
 This is Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Galbaville 91.1 FM.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.600
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.580
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.900
 to the shows, which run every third Friday of the month

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.620
 from seven till eight p.m., my wife and I

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.860
 were both licensed medical herbalists.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.260
 We trained in England, graduated there

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.580
 with a master's degree in herbal medicine,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.020
 and we run a clinic in Galbaville

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.900
 where we consult with clients about a wide range

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.360
 of conditions and recommend herbal medicines

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.300
 as well as dietary advice and other nutrition advice.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.220
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.300
 on KMUD Galbaville 91.1 FM.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.420
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show tonight

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.540
 at eight o'clock, you're invited to call in

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.900
 with any questions either related or unrelated

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.900
 to this month's subject of memory, cognition, and nutrition.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.540
 So if you live in the area, the number's 923-3911,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.900
 or as is often the case, so many listeners

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.140
 across different states are calling in on the 800 number.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.140
 So that 800 number, folks, is 1-800-568-3723,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.220
 which translates as 1-800-KMUD-RAD, R-A-D.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.580
 Okay, so we have Dr. Peat with us.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.360
 - I do have Dr. Peat, and I neglected to thank

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.860
 our underwriter for Ask the Herb Doctor,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.700
 and that would be Jade Dragon Acupuncture.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.180
 Came to thank Jessica Baker of Jade Dragon Acupuncture

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.860
 for her support of Redwood Community Radio,

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.740
 practicing and teaching Chinese medicine,

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.660
 herbalism, and aromatherapy.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.880
 Jessica's available for conferences, workshops,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.500
 and private consultations.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.100
 Located at 607 F Street, Arcata,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.260
 Jade Dragon Acupuncture can be reached at 822-4300.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.300
 Online at jadedragonacupuncture.com,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.380
 and that's all one long word, jadedragonacupuncture.com,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.340
 all lowercase.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.640
 Let's return to Studio B and the Herb Doctor,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.220
 and we do have Dr. Peat on the line.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.020
 - Okay, hi, Dr. Peat, you are with us?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.540
 Okay, I guess I just want to begin tonight's show,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.460
 as always, just by asking you to give us

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.540
 a synopsis of your academic professional background

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.380
 so that when people hear you,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.380
 not only will they hear that you know what you're saying,

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.320
 but they'll also know that you've had a long time

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.500
 doing what you do.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.100
 So go ahead and just let us know what it is

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.660
 that you've done with the last 40 years of your life.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.340
 - Well, in the last 40 years,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.340
 I've just been studying independently by myself,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.100
 but before that, 1968 to '72,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.940
 I was a graduate student in biology

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.940
 at the University of Oregon for a PhD in biology,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.140
 specializing in physiology.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.140
 Before that, in the '50s, '56 to the end of the decade,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.220
 I was working on a master's degree

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.040
 at the University of Oregon,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.980
 and during that time, I took courses

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.140
 in philosophy and psychology, among other things.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.140
 And also '59 to '60, I took some philosophy courses

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.980
 at Ohio State University.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.540
 The phone is clicking.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.220
 Is the line still there?

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.060
 - I'm not sure.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.180
 Yeah, you're on the, I can hear you, so.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.740
 - Okay.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 - Okay, so you basically started

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.540
 with philosophy, psychology,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.540
 and I know that your main interests,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.220
 although you have many,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.020
 your main interests are hormone, physiology,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.020
 reproductive biology, aging, and that kind of subjects.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.300
 - Yeah, the reason I decided to study biology

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.940
 was that I didn't think people were working

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.860
 on consciousness in the right way.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.740
 I thought I could get at it biologically.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.380
 - Okay, excellent.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.660
 Well, I know this evening's topic

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.220
 is gonna be hopefully not too heady

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.060
 and too unreachable.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.520
 I think, hopefully, what I'm hoping

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.300
 is that it will stir the imagination

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.100
 of people listening to see that,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.500
 as I've always tried to explain,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.500
 the world is a lot more than we see with our eyes.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.300
 So the subject tonight of cognition, memory,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.300
 and nutrition that supports successful memory forming

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.900
 and recapitulation and memory retention

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.300
 is gonna be tonight's subject.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.340
 Just want to mention that it seems strange,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.740
 but when I was looking at the people,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.940
 the pioneers of this subject in the last 100 years,

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.220
 there's a lot of Russians involved in it.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.780
 And Dr. Peat, you mentioned a chap called Dostoyevsky

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.340
 and Fyodor Dostoyevsky,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.720
 and gave an anecdote about a piece of the history

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.720
 that you related to his change in his perception,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.660
 his cognition, as a result of imprisonment.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.020
 So perhaps if we can start just by you recounting that,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.940
 that might be enough to stir.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.980
 - In the biography written by Jim Rice,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.740
 a professor at the University of Oregon,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.740
 he tells the story about his nervous problems,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.660
 whatever they were that Dostoyevsky had improved

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.500
 while he was in prison in Siberia.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.500
 And one of the odd things was that he began eating

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.140
 chopped meat because that was available in the prison.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.940
 I guess in the winter they didn't have vegetables available

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.380
 and so they had to hunt them.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.820
 Had meat available and his consciousness improved.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.780
 So the professor thought there might have been

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.500
 a nutritional aspect to his change of consciousness

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.480
 at different times in his life.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.980
 - Okay, so are you, we'll get into the subject

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.380
 in more detail, but are you supporting

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.700
 the necessary protein requirement in a diet?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.700
 I know that's something I don't want to offend

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.900
 the vegetarians. - Yeah, that was, yeah.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.900
 If you're really seriously deficient in protein,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.920
 it absolutely affects your consciousness.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.900
 A professor friend of mine in Mexico said that

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.460
 when some of his students at the university

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.740
 couldn't memorize things, he encouraged them

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.740
 to eat some protein and would invite them to dinner,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.300
 feed them some protein.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.300
 And when I was teaching language classes in Mexico City,

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.140
 some of my students absolutely couldn't remember

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.020
 anything that we went over.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.820
 And so I would start my classes with,

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.820
 I made funny little cookies out of eggs,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.380
 sugar, and wheat germ, and I would serve those

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.780
 with a cup of coffee at the start of the class.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.860
 Everyone was able to learn their lessons

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.460
 just with that little extra boost of protein,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.780
 carbohydrate, and coffee.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.260
 - Okay, 'cause I know we're gonna mention

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.860
 some of those dietary supplements, stroke nutrients,

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.300
 of which caffeine is one of them.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.300
 Let's go on to explore the, gosh,

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.460
 the philosophy behind the current thinking

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.140
 based on some of these pioneering characters

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.060
 like Dostoyevsky and Chomsky, and there's several others

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.500
 that we'll hopefully get into a little bit later.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:19.140
 In terms of the development of the understanding

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.340
 in which people remember things,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.340
 and the conscious versus the unconscious in everyday life,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.140
 as well as the subject of gestalt

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.780
 or the deja vu experience,

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.980
 how do you and how have you seen this development occur

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.740
 from a linguistic background?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:48.860
 - In the 19th century, what Dostoyevsky was reacting to,

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.780
 for example, in his story,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.300
 the dream of a strange fellow

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.060
 in which the hero of the story is suicidal

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.060
 because he sees the world as full of robots,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.580
 people operating according to cause and effect,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:16.500
 doing nothing other than what they're determined to do,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.860
 and he's driven to suicide by that,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.860
 but then has a dream that interrupts his suicide plan

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.860
 and he comes back and becomes an advocate

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.580
 of the position of free will.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.220
 At the time he was writing that,

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.180
 Europe, including Russia,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.180
 was being swept by the mechanistic idea

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.180
 of Huxley, a friend of Charles Darwin,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.380
 advocated the idea that molecules in the brain

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:01.180
 selected by evolution are absolutely in control

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.660
 of our thoughts and our mind is simply a shadow

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:11.940
 of this determined mechanism.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.940
 And Darwin said that he appreciated

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.740
 having such a nice robot friend.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:27.380
 Darwin didn't approve of that mechanistic idea

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.620
 of consciousness, but he sort of joked

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.060
 about Huxley's mechanical belief.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.780
 But that idea has persisted

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.780
 and in my generation and subsequently,

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:51.460
 the outstanding figures have been Noam Chomsky

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:56.460
 with his idea that genes determine what he called rules,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:04.100
 transformational rules that limit or determine

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:10.340
 what language, the form that language takes

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.700
 and the reason we can speak is because our genes

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.460
 specify these rules.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.140
 But 30 years later, he said,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.500
 well, rules can't explain anything,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.180
 but lots of people didn't notice

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:31.180
 that he said it was all a mistake

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.900
 because in fact, he still is sort of committed

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.900
 to all of that academic work

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.420
 publication on genetic determinism.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:50.020
 And the so-called cognitive science

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.780
 and artificial intelligence are closely related

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.780
 to the Chomsky position using the digital computer

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:06.620
 as a model for understanding human intelligence.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.620
 And since computers, since the late 1940s

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:19.460
 have been digital computers rather than analog computers,

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:24.820
 that has led to a digitalization

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.140
 of their consciousness theories.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.540
 But it's definitely not something

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.540
 that grew out of biological understanding necessarily,

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.580
 except through that robot philosophy

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.580
 of Huxley and others.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.420
 - Now, I just want to interrupt a little bit.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.220
 When you say Huxley, I think of Aldous Huxley, but--

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.060
 - No.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.500
 I can't think of his first name.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.420
 - No problem.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.060
 - The grandfather of Aldous.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.900
 - Oh, okay.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.740
 I was related then.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.300
 'Cause he was a gentleman that wrote

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.580
 "The Doors of Perception."

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.020
 - That was Aldous, the grandson.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.940
 - Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.940
 All right, carry on.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.860
 Okay, so you're saying that Chomsky

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.420
 did have a position that was,

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.220
 I think you're trying to say that he didn't have

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.860
 the position that was allied to the digital

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.980
 or the digitized--

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.940
 - Yeah, the rules were determined by genes

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.340
 so that they were developed simultaneously

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.860
 with the modeling of the brain

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.620
 in terms of the digital analog computer.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.580
 And the idea that the brain cells communicate

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:47.460
 according to an on/off, all or nothing signaling

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:53.660
 was derived from that same kind of quantizing philosophy

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.220
 that the switch of a digital computer,

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.340
 each bit of information is just on or off.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.940
 And that was taken up by biology

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.940
 with the idea that when a nerve fires and is active

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.580
 and then becomes quiet,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.740
 that's all the information that was sent,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.900
 one impulse, one bit of information.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.900
 But P.K. Anokhin in Russia,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:32.260
 who grew up with thinking such as Fyodor Dostoevsky's,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:38.500
 was critical of that idea.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.860
 And many other people have noticed

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.820
 that you can't explain hearing

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.740
 and the full range of volume, of frequency,

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.060
 and tonal quality and such transmitted on nerves

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.660
 which are only on/off switches.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.980
 And so P.K. Anokhin followed through

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.940
 many types of experiment and showed

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.940
 that it's probably impossible to explain brain function

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.620
 on the analogy of a computer using binary digit

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.940
 types of information.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.420
 - Right, right, being either on or off.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.420
 I mean, I think we'd probably all want to imagine,

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.340
 certainly with the greatest of hope,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:34.340
 that the digital on/off is definitely not what we are

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.540
 as people and that there's so much more

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.340
 to biological living systems

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.540
 than what science would readily explain by the on/off.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.380
 And that's how these kind of breakthroughs

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.060
 in quantum physics are occurring

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.540
 and how Einstein's theories are being challenged

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:56.060
 in terms of the latest thoughts on physics

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.980
 and how matter is interacting and space and time

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.900
 all interact to produce this other dimension

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.100
 that I think we all like to imagine

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.580
 that we are living in, in a biological way,

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.580
 that we are influenced far more acutely by our environment

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.700
 and that there's so much more to us than is going on

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.020
 that could otherwise be explained by nerve firing,

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.420
 as you say, the example of electrical impulses

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.220
 being generated, traveling down a nerve axon,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.180
 crossing the synaptic cleft, reaching the receptor,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:35.100
 having an effect, and then triggering a chemical impulse

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.060
 in the brain, say, or a secretion of a hormone

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.740
 or a neurotransmitter.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.820
 There certainly is much more to thinking

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.100
 and cognition than just straight on/off.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.940
 So-

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.420
 - Yeah, in Anokin's view,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.220
 it would be more like a picture traveling down each nerve,

00:17:53.220 --> 00:18:00.620
 but not necessarily traveling at the time of the impulse,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.140
 but that each nerve would be transmitting

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.820
 complex information, not just a bit.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.820
 And these quantum-related ideas,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.860
 the essential ideas there are resonance and coherence,

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:26.900
 the interrelatedness of things separated in space and time.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:35.220
 And those were part of biology back when quantum,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.500
 when Gestalt psychology was current in the '30s,

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.900
 '40s, and even into the '50s,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.900
 people were still arguing in favor of the Gestalt

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:56.340
 as being an image having a space-filling function

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:03.300
 in the brain in some way reflecting the spatial

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.500
 and temporal arrangement in the real world.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.340
 And that was developed at the same time

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.540
 that the field concept in embryology

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.820
 was the main line of thinking.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.820
 And all of those ideas were replaced by a digitalization

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:32.140
 and a mechanization of biological causality

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.460
 around between 1945 and 1950.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:41.740
 And in that pre-computer time,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.220
 quite a few people were talking about the resonance

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.740
 from sensory interactions, for example,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.220
 in the nose would be a molecule vibrating,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:01.140
 stimulating some kind of an analogous vibration

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.220
 so that in effect, the actual aroma of a molecule

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:11.660
 would be reproduced along the nerve and in the brain.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.660
 So that the brain itself would contain the smell in effect.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.700
 Or when an image, when light is absorbed

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.340
 by vitamin A molecule in the retina,

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:33.220
 it would excite a resonance of a similar luminous quality

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.660
 that would travel down the nerve

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.060
 and be reproduced in the brain

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.900
 so that in the gestalt view,

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.900
 you would actually have something like a luminous event

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.460
 in the brain when you saw light in the world.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.580
 - What makes me think at this point in time,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.700
 I'm thinking of those, not for the sake

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.500
 that it was found to be a little bogus in the end,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.980
 but the Uri Geller type effect where he was shown,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.460
 or if someone was shown a picture, an image of a star,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.780
 and they were gonna transmit this to Uri by thought,

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:19.340
 that kind of thing, I'm sure does exist.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.940
 And that is something that can be either learned

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.940
 or can be exercised in terms of thoughts

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.100
 traveling across space from one place to another,

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.500
 and how that can be incorporated

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.780
 into the kind of growing brain, if you like,

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.860
 through exercise or through, yeah,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.900
 through exercise of that kind of behavior.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.420
 Is that resonance or that coherence,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.580
 anything similar to that kind of model

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.980
 where it's an extra sensory perception

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.540
 is transmitted across space from one person to another

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.140
 without actually the other person seeing the object?

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:03.140
 - Yeah, there are several experiments currently going on.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.460
 The Noetic Institute, I think, has one

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.500
 with random number generators,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.820
 but on the internet, you can see several

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.940
 very interesting experiments.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.260
 Michael Persinger, a neurologist,

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.540
 has some interesting publications and videos

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.300
 in which he is arguing for a resonance

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.260
 between everyone's brain

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.180
 and the electromagnetic resonance frequencies

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.380
 of the Earth environment and the Earth resonating

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:47.260
 as a unit which can be sort of a medium

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:51.860
 through which individuals can resonate.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.540
 - Okay, let me hold it,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.660
 just get you to hold it there for a moment.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.060
 You're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor,

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.340
 on KMU DeGalbaville, 91.1 FM,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.140
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at eight o'clock,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.380
 you're invited to call in with any questions

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.740
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.460
 of cognition, memory, and nutrition.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.340
 Once again, we have guest speaker, Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.940
 bringing his 40 plus years of study

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.780
 on top of his academic background to bear on the subject.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.860
 We are gonna get into the subject of brain nutrition

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.060
 in a while, but just to let people know

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.140
 that from 7.30 on, calls are welcome.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.980
 Dr. Peat, that reminds me, anxiety.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:39.060
 And you mentioned the Noetic Institute.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:44.060
 So I was gonna bring up the subject of the noosphere,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:48.980
 and that was proposed by a Russian, Vladimir Vernadsky.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.620
 But is this Noetic Institute, it's the same thing,

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.940
 it's an institute for the study of the noosphere,

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.780
 perhaps, is it?

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.820
 (laughing)

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.060
 - Of consciousness?

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.140
 - Yeah, didn't you mention Michael Persinger

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.260
 and the Noetic Institute?

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.580
 - Oh, yeah, I don't know who's in charge

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.500
 of the Noetic Institute right now, but it's--

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.220
 - But there is an institute that's studying

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.740
 that the world of the mind, as it were,

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.780
 the world of conscious thought.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.580
 - Yeah, yeah, that's included.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.100
 - The priest, Teilhard de Chardin,

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:33.020
 followed Vernadsky's idea of the world

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.940
 becoming more and more conscious

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.940
 with supporting the growth of more and more

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:47.700
 conscious organisms, specifically people.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.460
 - Yeah, okay, and you know what, we actually have a caller.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.780
 So let's take this first caller

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.540
 and see what direction we're going in.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.100
 Okay, caller, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.500
 - Hi, I'm calling from Mendocino.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.140
 This is Jeff Wright on Mendocino Coast,

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.260
 and it's a beautiful day in paradise, as we say here.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.100
 Yeah, I got a question for you, Dr. Peat,

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.540
 and I always appreciate your brilliant enlightenment

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.140
 to us all here, and you're taking the time to do this.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.140
 I have heard of several cases where music is used

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.580
 for therapy for people who end up comatose

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.380
 and with spinal injuries, and it has led me

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.380
 to make the statement about magical, mystical, medicinal,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.100
 musical moments, and those cumulatively

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.980
 can help people come back.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.260
 It helps us on a daily basis by releasing endorphins,

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.860
 which insurance companies haven't figured out a way

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.820
 to get from us yet.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.060
 No suggestions allowed on that one.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.980
 But good music always brings those spinal chills

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.460
 and good feelings to the body,

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.780
 and in going with the resonance of the universe,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.660
 since everything is vibrating, including string theory,

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.460
 strings vibrate on musical instruments,

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.140
 I'd just like to kind of put that out,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.940
 and I'll leave the line to see how you respond to that,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.620
 and thanks again for all you do, man.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.940
 - Okay, thanks for your call.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:12.460
 So, Dr. Peat, how about music therapy?

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.980
 - Yeah, I think it's something much more subtle,

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:19.300
 but more powerful than endorphins.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.980
 I think the very structure of nerves

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:27.700
 is a kind of resonance,

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.700
 and carries possibly as a semiconducting system,

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:38.460
 but it carries a function that's analogous

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.660
 to the objective music outside the body.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.660
 And so when you give the organism a chance

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:55.460
 to relax and begin to respond to the music,

00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:01.100
 you're reinforcing or enabling a process

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:06.540
 that is very basic to the life of the brain cells

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.340
 and all of the living organism.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.220
 If you believed in the mechanistic cognitive science,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.380
 artificial intelligence interpretation of consciousness,

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:27.060
 you would see the present moment

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.340
 as an infinitesimally thin division

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.100
 between past and future that's moving along

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.940
 like a line on the graph,

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.940
 analogous to a certain measurement of depth,

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.220
 width, and height, except moving along the timeline.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.380
 But the unreality of that,

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.700
 the complete nonsensicalness of it, in fact,

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.580
 you can see when you whistle a tune,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.860
 or listen to music,

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:08.860
 or see a performer who is doing a performance

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.940
 in an intricately whole and organized way

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:19.620
 of song or other performance,

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.620
 a director who can organize everything in the orchestra

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:32.260
 to produce the desired effect

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:37.260
 is having to see where the particular moment is going

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.620
 and where it has been.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:44.660
 The pace of the music and all of the qualities

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.420
 that are developing in each moment

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:54.140
 depend on what you're perceiving to come

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.980
 and as recently past.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.980
 So the brain is like a musical composition.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.060
 It doesn't exist only in the present.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.140
 The moment of consciousness spans time

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:17.140
 so that you're simultaneously present

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:23.900
 in an infinity of these infinitesimally thin presences.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.940
 - Interesting, okay.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.100
 I just, another thought process has gone off in my mind

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.100
 of the Buddhistic kind of teachings of stilling the mind

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.620
 as being a way to enlightenment.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.580
 And I wanted to bring up the other subject of,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.700
 you mentioned that there was some test that was done

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.060
 and it took groups of people,

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.340
 some of who were lying down to perform the test

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.540
 and some of which were standing up to perform a test

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:53.900
 and how measurably better they did

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.780
 when they were lying down.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.580
 So how do you see that stilling the mind

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.220
 and releasing yourself from anxiety as a mechanism

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.740
 to which your brain would be more active,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.340
 more effective?

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.700
 - I think it's a matter of the breadth of time

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.780
 that your consciousness, when you're standing up,

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.740
 you're ready to react quickly,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.500
 but to a short-term influence.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:29.500
 When you're lying down, you refer your reference of meaning

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.820
 goes out farther in all directions

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.580
 what you're going to do and what you've been doing

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.820
 come into the picture.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:44.820
 And that allows you to achieve a better product

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:50.020
 in whatever you're thinking about

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:53.620
 than if you're under the pressure

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.620
 of meeting an immediate result.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.020
 And when you're standing up,

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.260
 you're ready to move quickly when you're lying down,

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:10.260
 you're relaxed and your mind can go out in time and space.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:14.540
 - That's probably some of the reason

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.940
 why the psychologists want you lying on the couch

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:22.220
 whilst they conduct their inquiry.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:25.460
 - Yeah, and when you're under stress,

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:32.060
 glucose is the immediate source of energy.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:38.860
 Well, electrons probably are the immediate source

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:42.580
 of the carbon dioxide produced from the glucose

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:47.580
 acts to modify the electronic properties of your cell

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:53.380
 so that it can perform these resonant,

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:55.740
 coherent interactions.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.580
 But glucose is the material

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.500
 that keeps that conscious process possible.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.020
 And if you're under stress

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.740
 and they're using your glucose too fast

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.900
 or don't have enough of it available,

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.780
 then your nervous processes go into an emergency state

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:21.700
 where only the here and now,

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:28.100
 the immediate present and location are relevant.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:33.820
 And so anxiety associated with hypoglycemia or stress

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:40.500
 will flatten the way your consciousness works.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.940
 And it might give you quick reactions,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.220
 but they aren't necessarily going to be

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.700
 the most interesting reactions.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.300
 - Again, so once again, we've,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:57.540
 touting glucose as positive, helpful, creative, energetic

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.740
 when constantly, I can't believe the amount of times

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.580
 I see adverts for low sugar this, low sugar that,

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.220
 and hear people talking about how bad sugar is

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.980
 and it does this and it does that and it causes cancer.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.380
 It's completely the opposite.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.020
 I don't know how people can be so brainwashed.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.940
 - If a person has been under stress

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:27.020
 and not eating very well, besides protein,

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.620
 vitamin B1 is sometimes the thing

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.780
 that can make the biggest difference most quickly.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.620
 When it's absorbed, if you've been deficient in it,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.700
 well, a great deficiency can cause psychosis

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.220
 and hallucinations and so on,

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:47.060
 but a mild deficiency can just make you feel sluggish

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.060
 and depressed and not have a very good short-term memory,

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:57.220
 not able to remember what you want

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:02.220
 or function as acutely as you should.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:07.100
 When you take that in a deficient condition,

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:12.100
 suddenly your whole mood and world seems to change.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.260
 - What kind of dose would you say,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.460
 physiologically, is sufficient?

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.460
 - Oh, I've experienced it with as little as 10 milligrams,

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:26.260
 but if it's just for an emergency,

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.620
 100 milligrams is okay.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.380
 - All right, we actually have another caller on the air,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:34.180
 so before we lose the thread of that B1 deficiency,

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.260
 let's take this next caller.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.660
 You're on the air, and where are you from?

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:39.100
 - Hello, is that me?

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.940
 - Yeah, you're on the air.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:40.780
 Where are you calling from?

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.060
 - Hi, I'm from New Jersey.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.140
 - New Jersey, hi.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.060
 - I've been on before,

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.780
 and I thank you so much for what you do.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.420
 This is just a fascinating show.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.780
 Dr. Peat, I was reading, and I'm so sorry,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.460
 this shows you where my sort of brain fog is.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.620
 I deleted this beautiful quote

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.020
 about how neurogenesis can take place in the hippocampus,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.460
 but also in the olfactory bulb.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.580
 And he went on to describe how,

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.820
 if I'm remembering, the hippocampus

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.980
 could be stimulated by exercise,

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.740
 but I think we are hearing that from so many quarters

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.820
 that maybe we don't need to explore that.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.220
 I would like to explore the olfactory aspect.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.860
 Can one go around smelling things

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.620
 and start firing neurons or creating new neurons?

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.020
 - Yeah, Luca Turin, a perfume specialist,

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.300
 has some very good videos on the internet,

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.180
 one on pharmacology,

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:51.180
 but he's talking about antidepressant drugs in that case,

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.500
 but really his main interest is in olfaction.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:01.020
 And I think that along with Heraclitus,

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.020
 who talked about the nose essences

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:12.060
 as being at the center of consciousness,

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:20.060
 really the olfactory system is very closely connected

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:25.460
 with our highest and best conceptual work.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:28.140
 - Wow.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.700
 Pardon me, you said Luca Turin,

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.140
 and the second name was who?

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.260
 - First name is L-U-C-A, Luca,

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.540
 and Turin, T-U-R-I-N, last name.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.140
 - Okay, and then you mentioned another individual.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:45.980
 Am I right?

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.940
 - Another?

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.780
 - Another name? - A different person.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:57.620
 - I don't recall.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.540
 - Okay, all right.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.020
 Well, I'll listen to the archived version.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:06.460
 And would we have to, I mean, I guess what you're saying

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.580
 is that, you know, I'm gonna explore this,

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.780
 I'm gonna look into this,

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.340
 but in your understanding, is there,

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.260
 would we perhaps have to surround ourselves

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.580
 with a particular kind of smell?

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.660
 I mean, if you know, I mean, would it have to be acrid

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.540
 or as opposed to sweet or, do you understand me?

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.940
 - Oh, no, just the becoming conscious

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.140
 of the smells around you.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:37.340
 And each type of smell has its inclination

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:44.660
 to reinforce certain types of function.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.540
 But the whole process of becoming conscious

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:53.020
 of odors in your environment,

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.900
 that's very closely connected

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.780
 with the higher parts of the brain.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:05.820
 And conceptually, you can use odors to stimulate memory.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:18.780
 The way they connect to the rest of the brain,

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:23.060
 you can sometimes, with a thought,

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.900
 you can associate the memory of a smell,

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.740
 and sometimes the smell can bring back

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:30.100
 certain types of thought.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:35.740
 And the stimulation of the hippocampus,

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:41.940
 any type of experience helps to stimulate that.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:47.220
 For example, taxi drivers in a big city

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.220
 who have learned all the streets have a bigger hippocampus.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:58.100
 But stimulation works everywhere in the brain.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.540
 Nerve cells are maintaining each other

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.460
 so that anything you do consciously

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.620
 is tending to enliven the rest of your brain.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.340
 It just happens that vision and smell

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:18.660
 are among the very powerful things.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:24.580
 Music has the function of extending us through the moment,

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:29.900
 expanding our moment that we feel present.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:35.740
 But the mechanists proposed an idea of memory

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:41.620
 that was sort of like a computer

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:47.180
 in which you could, in one type of computer,

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:51.700
 you could say that memory was punching a hole

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.500
 in a piece of paper or putting a signal on a tape,

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.100
 some definite thing that you could find later,

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:05.100
 go back to that card or that tape and repeat that signal.

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:10.220
 And so they said, well, there's some kind

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.580
 of a signaling process in the brain

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.300
 in which we might make a specific protein

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.340
 or RNA molecule and sort of drop it

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:24.700
 in a certain location for later use.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.340
 But if you think about the type of process

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.100
 that you would have to go through

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.740
 to find the right memory molecule when you needed it,

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:40.620
 the process and apparatus with which you would find

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.460
 that molecule already explains

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:49.180
 that you know where it is that you have the memory.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.820
 So you already have the memory in effect

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.340
 if you can go to find the molecule.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:41:00.340
 Otherwise, molecules would just be jumping at you randomly

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.060
 and your memory would be like a computer

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.300
 that spews out things at random.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.340
 - And I think you indicated,

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.180
 I know sometimes I've smelled something

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.500
 and it has evoked memories

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.820
 that I thought were forgotten.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.820
 - Yeah, that's, oh, Heraclitus was the person I mentioned,

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.100
 the Greek philosopher.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:31.260
 Simply, so many people have noticed that,

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:36.260
 that an odor can recall a whole situation

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:41.580
 that you thought you had forgotten.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.100
 Many things, much fun.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.260
 I'm gonna say bye-bye for now.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:48.100
 Bye. - Okay.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.580
 Thank you for your call, Carla.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.340
 Okay, so we've got Dr. Ray P on the show with us tonight.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.460
 We're exploring cognition, memory,

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.940
 and nutritional factors

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.940
 that will support cognition and memory.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.740
 Number here, if you live in the areas, 923-3911,

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.340
 or if you're outside the area,

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.340
 there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.620
 Okay, so until eight o'clock,

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.060
 people are invited to call in.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.260
 Dr. Peat, getting back to nutrition,

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.060
 you talked about B1 deficiency

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.740
 as a cause of a poor cognition

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.180
 and using as little as 10 milligrams.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.420
 And I know that those foods

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.060
 that typically people might associate the B1

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.460
 will be things like sunflower seeds and bread,

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.820
 but there are other things.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:39.500
 I heard that macadamia nuts have some B1 in them.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.060
 Are there any other sources of B1

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.740
 that you say would be a good quality source of B1?

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:50.380
 - Oh, all of the animal foods.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.060
 Eggs, milk, cheese.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.820
 - Yeah, okay, all right.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.340
 Okay, and I wanted to question you

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.540
 a little more about vitamin A.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.460
 I know you said, and link this with anxiety.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.820
 When you're very keen to stress that anxiety

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.100
 puts us in a very bad position

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.380
 to be able to remember things, to learn things,

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.300
 to have our brain working properly,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.300
 and the whole anti-anxiety supplements

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.180
 that would reduce anxiety.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:25.620
 - Yeah, vitamin A, besides being a matter of sensitivity

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:31.900
 to electronic excitation, such as in the eye

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.780
 and acting sort of as an antenna

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.340
 for interacting with electromagnetic energy,

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:45.220
 the other region of vitamin A activity

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:50.900
 is in activating the enzymes that make steroids,

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.820
 and especially brain steroids,

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.100
 so that if your vitamin A is deficient,

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:03.100
 you not only have poor vision and skin problems and so on,

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:08.100
 but your ability to make pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA,

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:12.500
 and their derivatives is limited,

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:17.500
 and the brain is the major steroid-forming organ.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:24.020
 The skin, the gonads, adrenals, and the brain.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.300
 The brain is probably the most powerful

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.860
 steroid-forming organ when it's working right,

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.380
 and vitamin A is essential for making those.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:39.900
 - Okay, I got a thought about the misplaced belief

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.300
 that fish oils are good for you,

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.560
 although there is a lot of vitamin A in halibut liver oil,

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.700
 and I think in the past,

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.140
 when we've discussed vitamin A and its sources,

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.060
 that halibut oil has such a concentrated form of vitamin A

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:02.260
 and so little PUFA, which is the whole point

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:07.260
 of avoiding the fish oils, that it's relatively safe.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.100
 I know little will contain it too,

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.300
 but what else would you say about

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.840
 the amount of vitamin A in liver, for example,

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.540
 as a good nutritional food source

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.580
 versus halibut liver oil?

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:25.300
 - Well, the halibut liver oil gives you a lot of vitamin A

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.300
 and some vitamin D and probably traces of vitamin E as well,

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:37.020
 and not too much of the PUFA, so it's a good source.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:37.860
 - Okay.

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.300
 - The liver itself, fish liver or chicken liver,

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.540
 beef liver, any kind of liver is a great source of vitamin A.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.780
 - Yeah, and then eggs, I guess, are another.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.700
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:52.980
 - And milk and cheese. - Of course, dairy, okay.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:57.980
 - And vitamin B12 happens to be crucial

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:02.060
 for turning carotene into vitamin A.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.420
 - Okay, okay, all right.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.140
 So there's three things there then

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.300
 that can be definitely, yeah,

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.900
 relegated to the brain food section.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.540
 So vitamin A, B1, and then B12,

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.660
 because of its help converting carotene,

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.540
 beta-carotene to vitamin A.

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.620
 What kind of things would use up someone's,

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.140
 apart from somebody not consuming enough vitamin A

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.780
 in their diet, there are definitely things

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:36.020
 that will consume vitamin A, so that even if you do eat some

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:37.580
 of those vitamin A-containing foods,

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.340
 you may actually be deficient.

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:46.660
 - Ultraviolet exposure destroys it very easily in your skin,

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:51.740
 and that's one of the things involved in sunburn.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.020
 Vitamin A reacts with the ultraviolet

00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:01.020
 and then spreads the damage to any unsaturated fats

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.660
 that are in your skin.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.260
 - Huh, interesting.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.500
 So in this sense, then sunlight exposure

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.060
 is not particularly good for you,

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.340
 although you have to weigh up the pros and cons

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.500
 of adequate vitamin D from sunlight,

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.940
 and/or the other beneficial effects of red light

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.860
 and electron quenching.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.100
 - And vitamin E protects against that breakdown

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.820
 and destruction of vitamin A.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:26.660
 - Is that right?

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.740
 Okay, so if you were to supplement with vitamin E,

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.540
 and again, a vitamin E supplementation would be coming

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:36.540
 from something like wheat germ oil, but any other--

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:42.340
 - Yeah, liver and milk and butter all have some vitamin E.

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:47.060
 - Okay, so there are other factors, then,

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.340
 that would increase someone's ability to retain information

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.860
 and/or develop, for want of a better word, new connections.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:00.180
 And energetically, that's an important consideration.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.340
 If you don't have sufficient energy in the system

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.700
 to drive those things,

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.460
 then it's not gonna be possible to work efficiently.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:11.620
 And I know that you would suggest thyroid

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.740
 and other, maybe pregnenolone or progesterone

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.900
 as anti-estrogen substances that would also work

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:19.740
 towards that.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:26.060
 - Yeah, and serotonin is, when you're under stress

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:32.020
 or are eating irritating foods,

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:37.260
 your intestine gets inflamed and releases extra serotonin,

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:43.180
 which some of it can get to the brain

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:47.580
 and signal the stress system.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.380
 And then signaling the stress system

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.780
 can activate other serotonin-producing systems

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.980
 that can create a vicious circle.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:03.900
 - Would this be part of an endotoxin-type scenario?

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:08.900
 - Yeah, endotoxin triggers nitric oxide and serotonin

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:14.380
 and various types of stress and depression

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:20.340
 tend to slow nerve function in many ways.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:26.020
 And people experience it as a feeling of need to withdraw,

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.660
 being depressed or anxious,

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.260
 sometimes defensive and aggressive.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:39.820
 If you feed rats beans, for example,

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.580
 containing the soluble fibers that can feed bacteria

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:50.980
 that create irritation and increase the serotonin,

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:55.260
 the rats become both anxious and aggressive,

00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:00.820
 fearful but defensive and quick to attack.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.420
 - Okay, 'cause what I'm getting from this

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:08.620
 is that anxiety is probably one of the main

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:14.620
 things to avoid in terms of having a competent memory

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:20.020
 and a competent cognition.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:24.500
 The whole physiological effect of stress and anxiety

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:28.900
 are all working against having that kind of stillness

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.940
 that would enable one to recapitulate events

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.820
 or to remember even simple facts.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.700
 - And hyperventilation, for example,

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.300
 when you're feeling anxious,

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:46.380
 it's common to breathe harder and deeper

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.340
 and lose carbon dioxide.

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.320
 Carbon dioxide seems to be a nerve stabilizer,

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:56.660
 protects nerves against many types of stress

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:59.420
 and inflammation.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.060
 And as the carbon dioxide goes down,

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.820
 your platelets release more serotonin

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.840
 and probably other inflammatory things.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.380
 And so just hyperventilating is enough to trigger

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.140
 a process that tends to slow you down,

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.200
 make you retreat and not think very clearly.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:27.060
 So interestingly, anything that will increase

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.660
 your ability to retain carbon dioxide

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.660
 tends to help you think calmly and clearly.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.180
 - And you say that thyroid does that.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.420
 It helps you retain CO2?

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.620
 - Yeah, thyroid and progesterone and pregnenolone,

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.300
 all of the anti-stress things.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:54.220
 - That reminds me about magnesium carbonate.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:58.020
 I was thinking about that earlier as a,

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.020
 not a laxative, but definitely as a product

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:07.020
 which will produce a relatively smooth bowel movement.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:11.500
 And not to joke too much about it,

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:14.980
 but in itself, magnesium carbonate would liberate

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.700
 some CO2 in that sense, wouldn't it?

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:22.700
 - Yeah, and thyroid lets your cells retain the magnesium.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:26.420
 So magnesium carbonate is in a way

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:31.420
 a short-term thyroid supporter.

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:37.420
 Keeping your brain warm is another thing

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:40.820
 that just running at a higher temperature,

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.020
 your brain produces more CO2

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:49.020
 and generally will retain the magnesium more efficiently

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:53.300
 as if it's under the influence of thyroid.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:55.580
 - Right, so the thyroid hormone itself,

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:58.540
 in a healthy individual with adequate thyroid function,

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.740
 that would happen anyway.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.460
 So you'd be running at an adequately warm enough temperature

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:06.780
 for your brain to be doing that.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.300
 - Yeah, I've known many people who complained

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:15.300
 about memory problems and a foggy consciousness,

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:19.420
 sense of being in a fog.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:23.340
 And they often had a temperature,

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:27.500
 oral temperature of 96 or under 97 degrees

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.980
 and getting their brain temperature up

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:35.580
 towards 98 or 99 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.620
 their memory improves tremendously.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:44.540
 I've noticed when I was in school,

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.420
 if I had neglected the study for a test,

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:53.260
 if I would take some vitamin B1 the night before,

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.140
 and then read the book,

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.340
 and then take some just before the test,

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:01.900
 I mentioned that to a couple of other people

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:06.660
 and it has worked for everyone I know who has tried it.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:10.460
 They always got perfect A's on their tests.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:12.180
 - Wow, you've let your secret out.

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:18.220
 Okay, so let me just think.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.780
 Okay, yeah, I was just kind of go back

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.380
 to sodium, I know you've mentioned that sodium itself.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.460
 And again, this is another controversial subject,

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.220
 but that's what this show is all about, I think.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.220
 It's not so much controversy, but it's actually the truth.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.660
 And it sounds so shocking that it seems to be controversial,

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:39.660
 but sodium in the form of regular table salt.

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.700
 And I know we've done lots of different shows

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.900
 or interjected shows with mentioning how good

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.860
 and positive and healthful and beneficial salt is for you,

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.820
 even though that most of the advertising media

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.940
 wants to tell you how bad it is, just like sugar.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.820
 That salt itself is very important

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.820
 in terms of retaining the magnesium that you're saying.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:03.460
 - Stress and aging tend to make it harder

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.620
 to retain the sodium.

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:11.940
 Hyponatremia is a big problem for sick old people,

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.620
 but occasionally it happens in hypothyroid younger people

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.420
 because the thyroid making carbon dioxide

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:24.420
 is an important factor in retaining sodium

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.100
 so it doesn't get lost in the urine.

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:33.100
 And when your body is sensing too much loss of sodium,

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:38.820
 the adrenals produce aldosterone to save the sodium

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:43.540
 and aldosterone tells the kidneys to lose magnesium.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.980
 And so if you take enough sodium

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:52.660
 to keep your adrenals from making aldosterone,

00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.180
 your kidneys are gonna save magnesium.

00:55:56.180 --> 00:56:01.180
 So in that situation, eating extra salt

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.540
 is going to be equivalent to having more magnesium

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:08.260
 in your diet because you'll lose it less quickly.

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:11.980
 - I mean, you're an advocate of salting your food

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:16.980
 and using salt in recipes and yeah.

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.220
 - Salt, protein, progesterone and thyroid

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.660
 are the main things for keeping your brain temperature up

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:27.340
 and functioning well.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:30.100
 - Okay, well, unfortunately it's coming up

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.540
 for three minutes to eight o'clock.

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:33.980
 So in order to let people know more about you,

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:35.460
 I'll have to cut the show short there,

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.740
 but thank you so much for joining us again

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.780
 and sharing your wisdom with us.

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.700
 - Okay, thank you.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.940
 - Thank you.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:45.500
 Okay, so for those people who've been listening,

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:48.420
 if you wanna find out more about Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:50.580
 you can visit his website.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:55.500
 That website address is www.raypeat.com,

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.060
 R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.020
 There's lots of articles there.

00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:01.980
 He's not selling anything.

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:05.460
 He's just so into what he's doing

00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:06.940
 that he's passionate enough about it

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.700
 to put it all on his website and it's fully referenced.

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.460
 So if you want to learn more about some of those things

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:15.660
 that you think of controversial that we've mentioned,

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:18.860
 like salt is good for you or sugar is good for you,

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.380
 please take a look at his website

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.820
 and you'll find out for those people

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:25.820
 that have any need to know the science behind it,

00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:27.020
 it's the best place to go.

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.820
 For those people who are perhaps not so interested

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.660
 about the science,

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:31.740
 but just want to understand it a little more,

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.620
 it may seem a little heady,

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.180
 but it's all fully referenced and his work is pioneering.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:39.900
 I can't say anything less than that.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:42.740
 A lot of what he's said and espoused

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.060
 has certainly been taken up by even the mainstream.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:49.260
 And I know recently in this last 12 months at least,

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:54.060
 polyunsaturated fats are now being looked at as the bad,

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:56.500
 the bad guys, which is what he's always said,

00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.140
 polyunsaturates, the liquid oils, the fish oil,

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.140
 it's all the bad stuff.

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:02.660
 And that salt and sugar is actually very beneficial for you.

00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.660
 There's many different reasons why.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.740
 Okay, so rayPeat.com.

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.500
 And for those people who want to contact us

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.660
 Monday through Friday,

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:16.660
 we can be reached at 1-888-WBM-HERB.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.420
 So every third Friday of the month,

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.860
 it's the show, "Ask Your Herb Doctor."

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:24.020
 So until June of next June,

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.500
 here we go in the middle of summer already,

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.980
 gosh, it's only a few weeks away from the solstice.

00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:31.180
 Until June, we wish you all good night.

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.020
 Good night.

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:41.420
 - All right, I want to thank the Herb Doctor and Dr. Peat.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.660
 For another great program.

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.700
 And I want to let you know about an important event

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:47.020
 coming up tomorrow.

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:52.020
 And it doubles as underwriting here on the mud.

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:54.220
 And that's really a good thing.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:55.580
 Support for KMUD comes from

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.180
 Humboldt Waste Management Authority,

00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:00.620
 hosting a household hazardous waste collection day

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:03.020
 at the Caltrans Yard in Garberville,

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.900
 tomorrow, Saturday, May 17th, from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.540
 So you can get rid of your household hazardous waste

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.220
 and still get to the block party.

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.780
 Households can bring up to 15 gallon containers

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:16.620
 or 125 pounds.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.820
 Materials accepted include liquid paint,

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.180
 auto and garden products, cleaners, aerosols,

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:24.740
 pharmaceuticals, medical sharps, and a red biohazard box.

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.460
 And up to 10 fluorescent and three HIDs.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.700
 No ammunition, electronics, or appliances at this event.

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:35.700
 More info is at 707-441-2005 or hwma.net.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:41.060
 It is 6.59 and 38 seconds.

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.900
 And I'm kind of waiting for someone to come in here

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.900
 for Funked Up with Cousin Mark.

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.620
 If no one shows up, I've got a couple things queued up

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.300
 and we'll take it from there.

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.380
 And we'll keep it funky right up to the 10 o'clock hour

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:55.180
 when Madman Mike gets here.

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.580
 Came with thanks Jessica Baker of J Dragon Acupuncture

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.340
 for her support of Redwood Community Radio, practicing.
