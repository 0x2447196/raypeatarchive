 Alrighty, welcome guys back to a great show with Ray P.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.000
 Today, we're going to give you a question and answer.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 I know a lot of you guys are really, uh, have been awaiting this type of show.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.200
 Um, Jeanne's not going to be on the call today, she's going to be me.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.400
 Um, once again, like we always do, I'm going to introduce ourselves and then Ray,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.200
 and then we'll get to it, because I know a lot of people have been emailing me with tons of questions.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.600
 Um, don't forget you can call in this time.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.800
 I'm going to try to take as many callers as I can.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.000
 Be patient.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.400
 Um, but be, uh, pay attention to yourself on the phone,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.800
 so when I call you in, you can ask your question or two.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.200
 Uh, the number to call in is 347-426-3546.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 347-426-3546.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.800
 Don't forget to check out our website at eastwesthealing.com.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 It's being completely overhauled right now, and it's really looking great.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.600
 The new site's not up, it'll be up in another month or two, but it's looking great.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.400
 Uh, but just stay tuned, there's a lot of great stuff on our site, from articles to YouTubes to our blog,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 our Facebook, all that great stuff.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.800
 So take a look at that, look us up, and feel free to give us a call if you want to set up a free consultation.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 Uh, we consult with people all over the world.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 So enough about that.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200
 Let's get back to Ray P.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.400
 He's, uh, been very nice this year in joining our show every month,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.800
 and, um, I know a lot of people have greatly appreciated it, including myself and my wife.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.000
 Um, you know, Ray, uh, basically has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 with a specialization in physiology.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 He's taught at many schools from the University of Oregon to Montana State University,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 to other naturopathic schools, um, and other schools in Mexico.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.600
 You can take a look at his website at raypeat.com, r-a-y-p-e-a-t.com,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.600
 to learn more about him and his background.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.800
 He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
 so he's been doing this for a long time.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.200
 Um, and if you look at his website, he's got umpteen amounts of articles.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.600
 You could probably spend the next 20 years reading them,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 and another 20 years re-reading them, to really get the gist of what's going on.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.200
 But, um, really love his work.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.000
 It's cutting edge, things outside the box, and, um, I know a lot of you guys feel the same way.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 So check out his website.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 I know Ray's on the call. You're there, right?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Yes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 I think the first question, everyone keeps emailing me and wants to know,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 do you have a timeline when you're going to start releasing or taking new subscribers to the newsletter?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Yeah, we, I think we changed that notice, and they're available now.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Okay. There you go, everybody.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 So you can stop emailing me. He will start taking new subscribers to his newsletter.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Um, definitely, you know, if you want to sign up, go to his website, RayP.com.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 You can sign up for the newsletter, send him your information to check,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 and you can sign up by mailing in your information.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Um, we have some callers on the line I'm going to take, but we can get right to it.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 I have some questions from, uh, people that email me.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Um, I'm just going to ask one of them to start, if you don't mind, before I take some callers.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Um, the first one is, a lot of people out there are so gung-ho crazy about probiotics.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I mean, that's all you hear.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 People love gas, take probiotics.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 You know, anything wrong, take probiotics.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And you don't really talk too much about probiotics.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Can you elaborate for the listeners on your thoughts about it

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 and maybe some of the pros and cons of taking it?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Um, specifically, are you thinking about the, um, Bifido --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Yeah.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 -- or the Lactobacillus or Bifidobacter?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Or Lactobacillus and Bifidobacter separately or a combination type of probiotic?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Um, they are probably okay to try.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Um, one thing that has made me skeptical about them was an article published in Nature about,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 I think, probably 35 or 40 years ago showed that there are antigenic regions on these Lactobacilli

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 that are exactly matching for proteins that are associated with female reproductive action

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 so that from puberty to menopause, roughly, there's the risk of having an autoimmune

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 or immunological interaction between intestinal bacteria and body tissues.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And there hasn't been much follow-up on that,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 but that is the period when autoimmune-type problems show up in women,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 and estrogen is probably the main factor that is involved in that,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 but it just happens that there is this antigen parallel between the bacteria and the person.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 And the bacteria do have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the membranes of the intestine,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 but one problem is that they do produce lactic acid,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 and so if you provide them with enough fuel, they can produce lactic acid,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 which is a potential toxin.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 It stimulates inflammation and formation of fiber collagen stimulation.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Right. I think that's the biggest thing for everyone to understand is that Lactolobacillus,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 they're lactate-producing, so if you take it and you don't need it,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 you're actually causing more of a problem than helping yourself, so think about that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Another question from a caller -- I kind of know the answer to this because you talk about this a lot,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 but, you know, taking questions -- so she wanted to know, from a health perspective,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 is there any time you ever would recommend fasting in regards to helping someone with their health?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 There have been studies in which rheumatoid arthritis and similar things

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 just are completely relieved during a week-long fast,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 and then it would come back as soon as the person eats again,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 and that's partly because your cortisol increases tremendously when you're not eating,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 and what the cortisol is doing is converting your muscle tissue mostly into fuel to live on,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 and at the same time it's having an anti-inflammatory effect,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 and the bowel is really the basic cause of most of the degenerative inflammatory diseases,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 and so there's a tremendous good reason for thinking that fasting is therapeutic,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 and we've seen animals with huge tumors that just refuse to eat,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 and if their owners just let them sit around not eating, they would recover and live for years.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 So the lack of appetite during sickness is a natural opportunity to fast,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 and sometimes it has a therapeutic effect,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 but since the reason the bowel is so connected to the inflammatory diseases is that the --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 well, besides the bacteria that produce things such as lactic acid and endotoxin,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 each of which has its range of harmful toxic effects,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 the intestine itself produces a tremendous amount of serotonin,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 and the serotonin, if it isn't detoxified right away,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 it has -- promotes not only fibrosis and inflammation,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 but multiplication of cells in the blood vessels,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 thickening them and promoting tumor growth and just about every degenerative condition you can think of.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 So if you can lighten the inflammation load in the intestine,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 you can achieve the same thing as fasting,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 even though you can still keep absorbing nutrients if you just do it in a way

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 that you don't either produce endotoxin, lactic acid, or serotonin excess.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And partly that means using a very easily digested diet,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 avoiding the undercooked vegetable matter, for example,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 that can't be digested by human enzymes and provides good food for bacteria,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 and having other easily digested or slightly antimicrobial foods, raw carrots

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 or boiled bamboo shoots, for example, have germicides that prevent bacterial growth.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So I hope that answers the questions for -- I think it was Judy -- in regards to fasting.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 I'm going to take one of the callers. Someone's been on hold for about 10 minutes.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 I'm going to take a caller from Aricode 360. Aricode 360, you are on the air.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Hello.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Hello.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Hi. Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't sure if you had me. Hi. Hi, Dr. Peat, Josh.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Thank you so much for bringing us these shows. They're really, truly informative.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 I've listened to all of them like 10 times a piece.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 So I actually use the power of Facebook to collect a couple of questions

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 from a couple of different people.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 So if I'm allowed to throw a couple of questions at you, that would be great.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Go. It's up to him, not me. Go for it.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Okay. Okay.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 So my first question is it's really popular these days to approach eating and dieting,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 sort of restricting certain foods and advocating the use of other foods

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 based on what we evolve to eat, things like the blood type diet and the paleo diet and those things.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 And so a couple of people and I were wondering what you, Dr. Peat, think about this approach to eating.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Well, that whole approach assumes that we really know what the species ate while evolving.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 And there are a lot of fantasy theories that whatever people enjoy eating,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 they tend to read into the history of people and the essential evolution from ape-like animals to human-like animals.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 No one is really sure what people were eating.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 I'm inclined to think that there's direct, present experimental evidence that supports it,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 I think, better than some of the currently popular ideas such as Canaan's about fish eating and so on.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 I think fruit eating was a good candidate for supporting evolution to be more human than ape-like,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 supporting a big brain and the kind of digestive system we have.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 Great. Thank you so much.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And so my next question real quick is actually feeds into that one really nicely,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 even though it's not that they weren't related,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 but personally I've noticed in some people that I know who are sort of really cerebral or creative

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 or have jobs that they kind of have to use their brains a lot.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 I've noticed that these folks sometimes have a little bit of a lower sort of tolerance for stress,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 in particular if they're, say, really active or exercising or God forbid, doing some sort of low-carb regimen.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So do you have any thoughts about people who sort of place a lot of demands on themselves mentally?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Do they have more or different nutritional needs than, I don't want to say average people,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 but just people who maybe don't have as many demands in that way?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 Yes. Some people have commented that the brain of the average person might weigh 2% of their body weight,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 but it uses 40% or 50% of their metabolic energy.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And if that's the average and a person, say, has a bigger than average brain,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 and human brains vary tremendously in size and in metabolic requirements,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 and if they spend a great amount of mental energy compared to the average,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 then you can see what a tremendous metabolic difference that can make.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Great. Truly. And then real quickly, and even so, despite everything maybe that you might say about sort of exercising,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 especially exercising intensely, it's really popular now for people to exercise

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 or to recommend exercising in such a way that is high-intensity intervals,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 that sort of thing, maybe really heavy weight lifting,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 definitely inducing some sort of a lactate threshold type of thing.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Are there ways in which you might see that one could, even if they still insisted on exercising in this way,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 could maybe attenuate some of the ill effects of that exercise?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 There was an experiment 30 years ago in which they had people walk on a treadmill,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 and they didn't let their heart rate go over 120 beats per minute,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 and they measured their active thyroid hormone, T3, at the beginning and then after 40 minutes,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 and the average person's T3 had gone to zero in just 40 minutes of just very moderate exercise.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 And normally, as soon as you have some sugar, if your liver had a lot of glycogen,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 it would replenish the sugar and T3 quickly,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 or the next meal that you have some sugar and replenish your glycogen, your T3 would snap right back.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 But the longer the stress is and the more inhibitors there are in your tissues or in your diet or surroundings,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 for example, if your body is loaded up on polyunsaturated fats or if you have bad bacteria in your intestine,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 those things will tend to delay the recovery of your liver and T3 production.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 And so with some people in some settings, it just takes a little extra stress,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 and it sticks you down in that low T3 condition.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 And there were other studies in which a person or a group of people with low thyroid were given just sort of a tentative trial dose

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 of a thyroid supplement, and a lot of them, with just two or three days of a supplement,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 I think, would snap back and recover normal thyroid function,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 meaning that they had just been temporarily stuck in that stress condition.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 And with a little extra thyroid, they could break out of it and their own gland would take over.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Wow. Great.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 And this is my final question, and it might seem a little off the wall,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 but I am particularly fond of comedy and funny things to sort of attenuate stresses in life.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 And so I had a friend of mine who was curious about what perhaps your favorite joke might be.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 And if you can't think of one, barring that, I was wondering if you could tell us what you ate yesterday.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 What I ate yesterday would be easier than remembering a joke. I never remember jokes.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Steak, by chance, happened to be rib steak day, and eggs and lots of milk and coffee, orange juice and Coke.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 Nice. I love you, Ray. Great stuff, man.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Thank you very much. I really appreciate you guys. Thank you.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Thank you for the call.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 You know, Ray, when you're this popular on the Web and everyone's interested,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 it's amazing the questions people want to know.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 But I appreciate your honesty, because not a lot of people would say what you just said.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 So that's great stuff there.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 I'm going to take another caller. I'm going to take a caller from Erico 201.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 201, you're on the air.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Hello?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Hello?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 Do you have a question for Ray?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Hi, Josh Rubin. Hi, Dr. Peat.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Hello?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Can you hear me?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Yes, hello.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Go ahead.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Hi, Josh. Hi, Dr. Peat. It's Sandy Soto.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Oh, hi.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 How are you?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Good.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 I'm calling to know your thoughts on the connection between schizophrenia and hypothyroidism,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 as well as nutritional deficiencies like niacin and copper.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 And also I wanted to know how much gluten intolerance has to do with that as well.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Oh, gluten intolerance is -- since the intestine is involved in everything,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 gluten is one of the basic things that will cause problems once you get sensitized to it.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 High estrogen is one of the things that sensitizes the intestine and system to gluten.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And the transglutaminase enzyme that is activated by estrogen

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 and activates the immune reactions that can cause celiac disease to cause psoriasis and arthritis,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 it is now known to be involved in causing cancer and brain conditions, including schizophrenia.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 So the ramifications of intestinal irritation, gluten intolerance,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 go off in all directions from scaly skin and sore joints to craziness and senile dementia and so on.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 And stopping the inflammatory process is the basic thing.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 And I think that was behind the orthomolecular approach to treating schizophrenia.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 The niacin approach I think was basically working on protecting cells energetically and against inflammation.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And so I'm not specifically a follower of Hopper's treatment,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 but I think he was opening up a whole area of science that's valid,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 that you can treat schizophrenia metabolically.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 And I think it has just ramifications off in every direction.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 For example, one of the basic effects of niacin is to inhibit the release of free fatty acids from our tissue stores.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 And free fatty acids poison our energy apparatus.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 And niacin is not only immediately involved in energy processes,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 but you've probably noticed how schizophrenics almost always are heavy smokers.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 And nicotine happens to have an actual brain protective and therapeutic effect

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 against a lot of the degenerative inflammatory diseases.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 But I think that's because it's overlapping with the niacin pathways

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 that are natural energy producers and anti-inflammatory nerve protective systems.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 I don't have any particular therapeutic ideas for schizophrenia,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 but keeping the thyroid function up so that the energy is supported

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 and keeping the toxins down, avoiding the polyunsaturated fats

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 and anything irritating to the intestines such as gluten and indigestible starches and fibers and so on.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 I think all those will help.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Wonderful. Thank you. Would you say that hypothyroidism will be the greatest factor in schizophrenia?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Yeah, I would guess that the conditions under which it comes on,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 puberty is a major time for schizophrenia.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 That's when the rising hormones very often interfere with thyroid function.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 That's when they get diagnosed mostly, right? Is like late teens, early 20s?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 Yeah.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 Great. Thank you, Dr. Peat. It was nice finally speaking with you.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Thanks, Jenny.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 All right, bye.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Bye.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 I'm going to give another caller. I'm going to take them in a whole 15 minutes.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 I want to get to them. Harry, code 917.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Hi, Doug.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 How's it going?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Good. How are you? Thank you so much for this Q&A show. I'm learning a ton.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 Great.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 I have two questions for Dr. Peat.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 The first one being, what about coconut sugar from the coconut tree?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Is that an okay sugar?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Oh, I've never tried it, but if it's extracted from the sap or the core of the tree --

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 Yes, yeah, from the sap.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Well, I think some of it might just be made from the starch chemically,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 and I would have to know what the chemical process is if they convert it from starch,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 but if it's made from the sap, there are lots of palm products that are very sugary,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 and I think in general if it starts with a natural sugar extract, then it's going to be fine.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 But if it's processed heavily, heat and chemical catalysts can leave irritating residues in the sugar,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 so I would want to know just how they make it.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Okay. Maybe I'll have to send you a little can of coconut sugar.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 I also was wondering about parasites and parasite overgrowth

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 and what your approach would be to somebody who might have them.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 It depends on the kind, but the old timers 100 years ago,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 it was very common to use a spoonful of flowers of sulfur maybe once a year,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 and a huge dose of sulfur like that will pretty much clean out any kind of parasite,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 but I've experimented a lot with very small amounts of flowers of sulfur,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 and it has a fungicidal effect, so if there's just a mild yeast infection in two or three days,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 a pinch a day of flowers of sulfur will clear that out,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 and sometimes that is enough to discourage amoebas and worms,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 but flowers of sulfur is very safe to people in small amounts like that,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 but it can get a very wide range of nuisances.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Some of the organisms have exoenzymes that act on the sulfur in their environment,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 causing it to oxidize to sulfuric acid, and it's just the pH change that eliminates them.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Interesting.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Is it possible too that parasites could contribute to some sort of autoimmune functions in our bodies?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Yeah, some people think they even have a beneficial effect on the immune system,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 and some people advocate catching worms once in a while to prevent autoimmune diseases,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 but I'm not very convinced of that.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Yeah, there's a guy, I forget his name, he uses helmet therapy for MS,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 and he actually uses worms.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 I'll put it on his website if you get the website, but he actually uses worms to treat MS.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 I'm inclined in the direction that since our immune system probably isn't what it has been thought of

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 following the German tradition of immune theory, I'm on the Metchnikoff side,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 which is seeing cells as the central activity and seeing it as a developmental process

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 rather than a specific chemotherapy of our bodies against organisms from the environment.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 If you think of it as chemotherapy, then anything that activates your immune system is potentially good for you,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 but I think of it as developmental, and every time we affect our developmental system,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 we're taking our whole self off in a different direction.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 I think in Africa, for example, a lot of the so-called AIDS is really just from being exposed to too many stimulants

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 of our immune system.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Interesting. Thank you so much.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 Thank you.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 We have a question from someone that just emailed me, and they want to know,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 of course it could be being in a catabolic state,

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 but what could it mean if someone is just sweating all the time, even from an early age?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Sometimes it's a developmental overbalance of the parasympathetic nervous system or sympathetic.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 Either way can activate your sweat glands,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 and sometimes people can remedy it with just an herbal thing that influences the balance of the sympathetic

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 or parasympathetic nervous systems.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Sometimes hypothyroid people compensate with extremely high adrenaline production,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 and that can cause sweating even when they're not hot.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Interesting. Cool.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 I'm going to take another caller, and then I'll hold for 15 minutes.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Aricode 301, you're on the air.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Hi. Thank you for taking my call.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 I believe that I picked up parasites about in 2006.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 I was swimming and kayaking in a river,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 and I got a bug bite on my arm that gave me a raised rash that kind of returned for the next couple years

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 and has finally subsided, but it was about -- I had a lot of symptoms that were very similar to low thyroid,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 and in fact I tested positive for Hashimoto's and low thyroid,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 but I had never had those troubles before the swimming incident,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 and four years after swimming I finally did a warm water enema just to move some gas out,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 and there was a two-foot tapeworm in the toilet bowl.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 So I probably had had parasites for that whole time without being diagnosed or tested for them,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 and even now a year and a half later I'm still having a lot of digestion and energy problems.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 I've put on 45 pounds.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Life is really tough, and I can't seem to get myself balanced.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 What kind of climate do you live in?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 I live in the Washington, D.C. area.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 There are a lot of tropical parasites that you can catch by bites,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 but have you had tests specifically looking for various parasites?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Well, I would be very interested in what kind of tests I should have run.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 None of my doctors initially were looking for parasites at all,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 so they tested and treated me for a whole lot of things that didn't have any impact.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 The first tapeworm, round of tapeworm tests that I did all came back negative,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 even though I was putting segments of worms in the stool samples.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 So I would be very interested in what kind of testing should I pursue.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 There are doctors that specialize in that.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 I don't know who in your area would be best,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 but I'm sure there are parasite specialists in all of these,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 especially the coastal tropical areas in the United States.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 There are doctors who see parasite cases.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 I would recommend -- I mean, I like to test for metametrics.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Just call the GIFX.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 You can call them, or you can work through -- just call them,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 and you can probably get hooked up with a physician there.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Okay.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 I'm sorry.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Is it G-A-F-X?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 G-I-F-X for metametrics.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 G-I-F-X.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Great.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Yes.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Okay.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Anything to look at restoring digestive function if I do get rid of the parasites?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Oh, the diet to keep your immune system so-called and your metabolic rate up where it should be,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 and if necessary, a thyroid supplement if your metabolic rate is low.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 You'll tend to -- for example, fungal infections really tend to specialize in hypothyroid people,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 and I think it's the same with a lot of intestinal parasites that -- for example,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 the IGA antibodies on membranes and intestine are deficient in people who are low thyroid,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 and so all the membranes are susceptible to attack.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Oh, I had not heard that before.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Thank you.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Interesting.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Thank you very much.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 Thank you for calling in.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Thank you.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Have a great day.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 You too.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Ray, I got a question for you.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 A lot of people ask, you know, and I explain it to them, but I know a lot of listeners probably want to know this.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 So much in our industry about fungal infections, and you got Doug Coffin promoting the fungal diet,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 and you got people just diagnosing themselves left and right because they have dandruff or bloating,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 and, you know, a lot of people think it's about, you know, because Doug Coffin says mycotoxins feed on sugar,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 so take out sugar and you starve the mycotoxins.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 I know you have a different view on this.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 Can you elaborate a little bit on -- you just did a little bit -- maybe why you get the overgrowth in the GI system

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 and why we actually -- we have Candida in our GI system?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Yeah.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 I used to read periodically in the newspapers about someone -- I think the first one that was reported around the world

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 was a Japanese man who everyone thought he was a drunk, but when doctors examined him carefully,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 they found that when he ate sugar, he would start emitting alcohol fumes,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 and they found that yeast were growing in his stomach even.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 His digestive enzymes were so weak that the organisms weren't killed by stomach acid and enzymes.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 And usually on average, there's one case or so somewhere in the world actually getting drunk when they eat sugar

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 from so many yeasts living high up in their intestine.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 But getting drunk is really the only major harm done by that.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 The real problem is that their digestion is so poor from being low thyroid

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 that probably all they need is to take some thyroid and activate their digestive enzymes.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 That would probably spontaneously get rid of the yeast and bacteria problem.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 But I think it was Rene Dubose who did some experiments showing that with a given yeast in the intestine,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 when it's starved for the sugar that it needs to thrive, it sends out --

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 I think they're called pseudohyphae filaments -- several times their diameter in length,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 but long enough to reach through the intestine wall where they can get sugar from the bloodstream.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 And so they actually become invasive when they're starved for sugar.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 But if you feed them sugar, they don't put out those adhesive invasive filaments,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 and they just are happy living on sugar.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 So a sugarless diet is really a dangerous thing for someone to do if they have a yeast problem.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And besides its direct effect on the yeast, when you avoid sugar,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 you're having the risk of not giving your liver the sugar it needs to activate the thyroid hormone,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 and so you're tending to make the hypothyroid problem worse,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 especially if you eat foods that are rich in the polyunsaturated fats.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 It happens that fungus loves unsaturated fat but can be killed by saturated fats.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Right.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Great.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 I know a lot of people wanted to know the gist of that, and I know a lot of people out there promote --

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 I mean, we get tons of people that come to us and say, "Oh, I've done the fungal diet for a year

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 and been supplementing and I'm still suffering."

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 So it's good to get this information out there.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 I've got another caller I want to take.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 He's been on hold, or she, for almost 17 minutes.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 Caller from area code 516, you're on the air.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 How are you doing, guys?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 I'm doing great.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 I think we're all doing great.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 Great to hear.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 So I've got a couple of questions that I wanted to sort of ask.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 What is your feeling on things like liver flush and general cleansing that is sort of popular now in certain circles?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 There were experiments on cattle that were being sent in for slaughter.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 They measured their blood and urine and found that I think it was 30 to 35 percent of them showed chemical toxins

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 that they had been exposed to either in their feed or insecticides sprayed on them and such.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 When they were slaughtered, they found that that same proportion, 30, 35 percent,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 had muscle and fat evidence of those same poisons,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 but only 6 or 7 percent of them had any of those toxins in their liver.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 The liver has the equipment for gradually excreting the toxins that are stored in the fat and muscles,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 and so the liver is the cleanest organ of the animal.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 If you slow down the liver's activity, which happens in a fast, for example,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 then your brain and other organs are going to be exposed to the chemicals that otherwise would have been excreted in the urine

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 as they're diffusing out of your fat and muscles.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 I think the best cleansing diet is one that increases your liver's action.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Just tasty food is one of the things that will stimulate your liver's action.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 Sugar and thyroid are the other main things that activate the liver.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 When you say sugar, do you mean any kind of sugar,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 or are you talking about some natural sugar, honey, agave, as opposed to high fructose corn syrup,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 when you say sugar, or it doesn't matter?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Well, the manufactured sugars such as made from cornstarch,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 the risk is that they have undeclared substances in them.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 For example, high fructose corn syrup, a group in California analyzed it,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 and they saw that it contained the amount of fructose and glucose the label said,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 but they found that about 80% of its calories consisted of other stuff,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 sort of intermediate between sugar and starch, which really can be very harmful

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 and calorie rich compared to the sugars.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 And with a very highly cooked sugar such as maple sugar or agave sugar,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 you have to watch out that it didn't reach a temperature that produced irritants and allergens.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 But otherwise, all the natural sugars, white sugar isn't chemically changed,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 it's just it has the products of extracting and heating pretty much washed out of it.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 So as far as allergens go, the white sugar is safe,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 but nutritionally fruit is the best way to get sugar because it's not only unprocessed,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 but it comes with a lot of the minerals needed to process the sugar such as potassium and magnesium.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 So when I say sugar, I'm thinking mostly of fruit.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Okay. And two more questions if I can be so bold.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Swollen feet, you know, and a relatively young person,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 if they're working hard at a desk most of the day, their diet is pretty okay,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 but they tend to have a problem with swollen feet.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 Yeah, they probably will also tend to have puffy eyelids and faces when they wake up as the water redistributes.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 And that's from excess permeability of their blood vessels.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 The water just leaks out of their blood into the tissues.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 And sometimes all it takes is eating enough salt to make your albumin function to bind water

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 and keep it back in your blood vessels.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Wow. People on a low salt diet are very susceptible to that movement of water out of their blood vessels.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 And especially in pregnancy or premenstrually,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 there were studies of women with toxemia or preeclampsia during pregnancy

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 who were having high blood pressure.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 And what happens is that the high estrogen and especially low thyroid,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 high serotonin balance during pregnancy makes the blood vessels permeable

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 and the albumin can't retain enough sodium of the low thyroid, high estrogen.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 And so the albumin is unable to hold the water in the blood vessels.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 And they gave these people in one experiment, I think they gave some what,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 over 20 grams of salt extra per day and almost immediately cured their toxemia symptoms.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Wow. So it may be too less salt as opposed to too much salt and not enough water.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Wow.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 Man, this definitely turns a lot of things around and it definitely answers a lot of questions.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 And I appreciate you guys.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 Tom Brewer, he and his wife Gail wrote some books on nutrition for pregnant women.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 And they cited some of the research that was collected in another book on prenatal nutrition,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 maternal nutrition and prenatal health by Shanklin and Hoden.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:09.000
 And they have a tremendous amount of information that's relevant to everyone,

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 but premenstrual women with a high estrogen balance are next in line after women with toxemia of pregnancy

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 to benefit from increased protein and salt in their diet.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 And old people in general often have the same difficulty retaining enough sodium.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 The sicker an old person is, the more likely they are to have an inappropriate loss of sodium from their blood.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 Right. Wow.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 FYI, the book he goes over a lot of that in is called "What Every Pregnant Woman Should Know."

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 And he talks about a little bit more with studies in metabolic toxemia of late pregnancy.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Just for the listeners.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 That's great. I hope you guys someday soon come out.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 I know it's such a personable thing.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 I think that's what I'm learning mostly from you guys is that, you know,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 if some of the conventional things are not working for you,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 there may be some very, you know, things that are going on that the average person just does not know.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 Because it seems like most diets want to hit -- you know, they want to make a, you know -- everything, you know,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 it sells better if people think that all their needs will be met with one thing, you know.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Yeah. Well, I appreciate you calling in and tuning in to Ray.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 Thanks, man.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 Thank you.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 Thanks, Ray.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Ray, I got a question from someone on fructose.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 You know, there's a lot of bad hype out there on fructose

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 and how it's processed by the liver and turned into fat and triglycerides and on and on and on.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 And they wanted to know, because you recommend utilizing a lot of fruits and tropical fruits,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 and, you know, how come you recommend really utilizing fruits when a lot of people are saying that

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 fructose in excess is actually a little bit dangerous?

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 Yeah.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 The ideal amount of fructose seems to be maybe a third as much as glucose.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 And so a person can eat a fair amount of starch if they have glucose along with it.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 But what the glucose -- what the fructose does in the cell is to raise the metabolic rate,

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 increase the production of carbon dioxide, among other things,

00:50:49.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 and catalyze the ability to burn glucose wherever the glucose came from, sucrose or starch.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 And so it's a catalyst that increases cell activity in very constructive ways.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 And, for example, there have been experiments.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 One of them compared either sugar or a Coke-type drink -- Coca-Cola, I think, was what they used --

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 found that it improved calcium assimilation, increased their metabolic rate, decreased obesity.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 I think it was something like a 50 percent increase in their ability to burn calories

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 when they had a sucrose-based diet rather than a starch-based diet.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 And a couple of other experiments showed that the calcium assimilation and retention was better.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 And in a vitamin D-deficient experiment,

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 animals on a starch-based diet had very weak bones that you would expect from the vitamin D-deficient diet.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 But the ones which had sucrose, despite the vitamin D deficiency,

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 they built strong bones because of that effect on calcium assimilation.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 And that calcium-sparing effect of sucrose or fructose is that metabolic stimulating effect

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 which imitates the active thyroid hormone, which produces carbon dioxide.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 And carbon dioxide is involved in the way we handle calcium and sodium both in the kidneys and in the cell,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 keeping calcium out of the cells where it shouldn't be and putting it in the bones where it should be.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 So you reduce your need for vitamin D, which is a very important nutrient in all kinds of systems,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 but you decrease your dependency on that if you shift your calories away from starch to some extent,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 at least towards sucrose and/or fructose.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 But it's very hard to find a natural source of fructose.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 It's almost always in balance with glucose.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 Right. Great. Thanks for that.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 I'm going to take another call. I'm going to hold for a little bit.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 Eric Code, 308, you're on the air.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 Hello, Josh and Dr. Peat. How are you guys doing?

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 Hi.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 I'm doing great.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 I've got a few questions that are not really related with each other,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 but first I wanted to ask Dr. Peat, in one of your articles you write about how the majority of the tryptophan

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 is actually converted to niacin if the person is healthy.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 And I was just wondering if a person that's healthy and has a proper working thyroid,

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 if they would be able to tolerate eating more muscle meat,

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 or if there are other components in the muscle meat that inhibit the thyroid function.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 Well, the high phosphorus content is probably just about as important for the average person.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 The ratio of calcium to phosphorus should be very high.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 If you're under stress, the phosphate becomes more of a problem and adds to the stress,

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 and meat and whole grains are major sources of phosphates.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 So you have to be more concerned with your calcium intake if you have a meat or grain-based diet.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 Tryptophan can be handled pretty well if you otherwise have a good diet,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 because, for example, women are much more susceptible to getting pellagra than men,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 because estrogen, partly because it makes you waste your vitamin B6,

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 estrogen greatly decreases the production of tryptophan and sends the tryptophan --

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 the production of niacin and sends the tryptophan down the pathway into serotonin.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 So is that probably one of your reasons -- I guess it's assumed that that's one of your reasons

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 why you recommend milk, because even though it has a pretty high tryptophan content,

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 because of its high calcium to phosphate ratio,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 most of the tryptophan will be converted to niacin in the body then?

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 Yes.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 Okay. Another question, Dr. Peat. I was hoping to get your opinion on some spices,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 like if there's some spices that you don't recommend,

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 because either they're estrogenic-promoting or maybe they inhibit the thyroid.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 And more specifically, also, my girlfriend's been craving garlic,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 and I was just wondering what your opinion is also on garlic and just in general spices, I guess.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Well, I think the main problem with onion and garlic is if you're allergic to them,

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 people -- low thyroid people very often have symptoms like gallbladder spasms when they're --

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 especially if the garlic and onion are cooked,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 something happens to the active ingredients that make them more of a trigger to problems.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 I'm not sure if that's low thyroid people, but as just foods, garlic and onions are fine.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Are there any spices that you'd completely recommend to stay away from in terms of how they affect the thyroid

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 or anything, or are they all person-dependent on how they -- if they have like some kind of allergic response to them?

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 Yes, I think the main thing is that so many of them are allergens.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 Okay. I have a couple more questions, if that's okay, Josh or Dr. Peat.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 I was just wondering, in one of your interviews with Kim Greenhouse from "It's Rainmaking Time," Dr. Peat,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 you talked about the proper way to take Cytomel and Thyroxin, but it was -- I don't know.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 I didn't really completely understand it, so I was hoping maybe you could elaborate a little bit more on the dosage,

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 because it seemed like you were talking about like if you're going to take 10 micrograms of Cytomel to split it throughout the day,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 or did you mean take 10 micrograms in the morning and at lunch or to actually split the dosage?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 Well, sometimes if you're just in a temporary stress state, sometimes 10 micrograms will break the whole stress.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 But if you're not that lucky and are going to need it for a longer time,

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 then the body normally, ideally, should make four or five micrograms per hour of T3.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 And if you take all at once, very much more than 10 micrograms,

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 your liver activates enzymes for destroying it or excreting it.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 And so it goes away quickly when you skip taking it.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 I experimented on myself taking 25 micrograms at a time,

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 and after two or three weeks of doing that, 12 hours later, if I didn't take another dose,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:24.000
 I would go into a very intense hypothyroid state with my heart stopping every six seconds or so.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 And that would, 30 seconds after I took more T3, that would get regular again.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:43.000
 But if you take your 10 micrograms with a meal, the food is going to delay its absorption,

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 so you get maybe two or three micrograms each hour.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:57.000
 And so 10 with each meal is a pretty smooth way to take it.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:05.000
 And does it always have to be taken along with thyroxine, or is it better to just take Cytomel by itself?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:13.000
 Just occasionally a person has some peculiar need where they want to quickly,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:21.000
 in just a week or so, get to complete normal functioning.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 For example, people who had cholesterol levels of 450 or 500 or so

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 wanted to get their cholesterol down in a week.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 And the only way you can do that is with frequent five-microgram doses of Cytomel

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.000
 to get your thyroid function up to full normal very quickly.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
 But for example, someone who has had a heart attack

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:00.000
 and doesn't want to put a lot of workload on their heart by energizing their system suddenly,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
 they don't want to take more than one microgram at a time.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:13.000
 And when you take a big typical dose of, say, 50 or 100 micrograms of thyroxine,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.000
 which is a typical tablet size for the thyroxine,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 that depends on your liver for activating it.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000
 And so it's sort of unpredictable what's going to happen when you take a big dose of thyroxine.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.000
 But the one you have to be very careful about taking in small amounts is the T3

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
 if you aren't backing it up with the T4.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:54.000
 The T4 is preferred by most doctors because your liver will seldom make more than it needs.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000
 The trouble with relying on thyroxine is that in women,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 very often the estrogen keeps the liver from making as much T3 as you need from the thyroxine.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:16.000
 So lots of women go around taking fully normal doses of thyroxine

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 while not having enough active thyroid function.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
 Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 I just got one final question since I don't want to take over your whole show, Josh.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:34.000
 I would like your opinion, Dr. Peat, on raw versus cooked foods in terms of, like, digestion and absorption

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000
 and which a general opinion is on, yeah, just raw versus cooked food.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:53.000
 With all kinds of animal products, the main issue is whether there are microorganisms or parasites in them.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:04.000
 So the reason for cooking meat or oysters or fish or whatever is to make sure that you've killed the parasites

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 and microorganisms.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 There's no nutritional benefit at all from cooking them.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:28.000
 But with, say, an apple, the typical apple that people buy is likely to be unripened or partly ripened

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:34.000
 and to contain a huge amount of pectin with a little bit of sugar

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
 and some minerals mixed in with this large amount of pectin.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000
 And the pectin isn't digestible by the person, but it is digestible by bacteria.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:57.000
 And so typically when you eat a fruit such as an apple or a pear or a poorly ripened peach, for example,

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
 what you're doing is to a great extent feeding bacteria.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 And so if you have nice bacteria, you won't have trouble, but those foods can cause great problems

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 if you have the wrong bacteria.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000
 So there's really not that much of a loss of, like, nutrients and minerals in cooking certain fruits or meats?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000
 No, there was an experiment in the 1940s when nutritionists worried about that,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
 saw that so many people were eating mostly canned foods.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:41.000
 They put one batch of rats on a diet of purely canned vegetables,

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.000
 and another batch they took identical vegetables but fed them raw.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:57.000
 And the animals eating the canned vegetables thrived, and the ones eating the raw vegetables didn't.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
 Yeah, that's very interesting.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.000
 Because the major thing in a lot of the raw food circles is they talk about the proteolytic enzymes

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 in like a papaya or a pineapple.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
 And the whole theory is that if you eat those types of fruits,

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
 your body doesn't have to go through the stress of producing the digestive enzymes,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
 and it's because you're getting it from the fruit, supposedly.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
 And I was just wondering what you thought about all that, and if it was just hogwash or if there's something...

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:34.000
 Well, those enzymes are biologically active, and you can buy the enzymes as products.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:42.000
 For example, the pineapple enzyme actually can be absorbed into the bloodstream

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
 where it has a systemic anti-inflammatory effect.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 I think it was -- I'm not sure whether it was approved by the FDA 30 or 40 years ago for --

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:05.000
 I think it was accepted for use in horses because it was so effective at curing lameness.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:15.000
 But the production of pancreatic digestive enzymes isn't a stress.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 It's just one of our natural functions.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:31.000
 So I don't think there's any benefit in -- as far as the pancreas goes to supplementing extra enzymes.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 Okay, so basically I guess if you're a healthy person that's producing proper oxidative energy,

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000
 the pancreas is probably able to produce all those enzymes without necessarily having to get them from the food,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
 then I guess it's kind of like what I'm understanding.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:57.000
 Yeah, and when you haven't been eating a particular kind of food, like if you're avoiding starches,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 when you do start eating that food, your intestine takes a few days to adapt to it.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:16.000
 So changing radically from one type of food to another will cause gas or diarrhea or something for the first couple of days

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.000
 if you do it too suddenly because your intestine has to sense what it's getting

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.000
 instead of just producing the right enzymes for the right food.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 Okay, well thank you very much, Dr. T, for all your work and training.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
 Thank you for calling in.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
 Josh, for having the show.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 Thank you.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 Bye.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 I'm going to take another call.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
 He's been on hold for a while, so I wanted to get him on here.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
 Eerie Code 626, you're on the air.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
 Oh, they're on hold for a long time.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 Here we go, 626, are you there?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
 Yes, I'm here.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000
 Can you hear me?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 Okay.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 Yeah, go ahead.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 Okay.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 Okay, I wanted to get your input in regards to a low carbon dioxide level for a 4-year-old.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
 He had leukemia and AML, so he went through the whole treatment.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
 And we're about two years out, and his doctors are pretty concerned at this point,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:32.000
 and they said they wanted to put him on a bicarbonate supplement to see if it would help him

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
 to bring him up to, I guess, normal levels.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000
 Yeah, I've seen a lot of adults with very low levels of bicarbonate supplement.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:51.000
 A lot of adults with very low CO2, sometimes as a result of taking drugs.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 And the bicarbonate baking soda is very helpful in a lot of ways.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 Diabetics and people with other problems can see really quick benefits sometimes from it,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
 sometimes even digestive problems.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:22.000
 The bicarbonate helps to adjust the acid production in the digestive system and so on,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000
 and it helps to regulate the balance of minerals in the bloodstream,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.000
 and it can, to some extent, bring up the systemic CO2.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 But I think the most effective thing is to check the thyroid function

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.000
 that's in control of producing the CO2.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:58.000
 Do you know if his lactate is high or whether some other organic acid is above average?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
 Let me check.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
 I don't think so.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 No, I don't see that on here.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
 I'm not sure if they didn't test it or it was just within normal range.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000
 But I can definitely ask them about testing his thyroid.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
 How low was the CO2?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000
 I'm not a loster.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
 Still there, 66?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 Sorry, yes, I'm here.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
 I'm sorry.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:44.000
 He runs anywhere between 16 and 19.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
 That's too low, but it's not as low as some people I've seen

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.000
 who within a couple of months got it up to 29 or so.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
 Oh, wow.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
 Okay.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 It's good to check his thyroid and read some articles on alternative views

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
 of how to interpret the thyroid.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:16.000
 For example, the AACE, I think it's the American Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
 has a range of TSH from 0.3 to 3.0,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.000
 which is quite a bit lower than most doctors currently are going by.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 But I think the ideal number is towards the low end of that, 0.3 or 4,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
 I think is probably the best for most functions.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
 Okay.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000
 Have you seen Mary Shulman's thyroid site on the Internet?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
 No, I have not.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.000
 There's a lot of good information on thyroid on there.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
 My next question would be -- it's also about my son.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:13.000
 He has chronic diarrhea, and it's been going on for like the past three or four months,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
 and he's been through all the testing, even allergy testing,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
 and everything keeps coming up negative.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
 What does he eat?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:32.000
 Well, we try to feed him just clean food all the time,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:41.000
 and we try to cut out all the junk food or any juices, so we're not sure.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
 We've tried every kind of thing out there.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
 We've gone gluten-free.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000
 Again, we tried cutting out juices, even eggs, meat,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
 but it seems to just come back regardless of what we give him.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
 And we try the diet, like we'll change it up every three weeks to four weeks,

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
 and it just keeps coming back.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
 We're at the point now where the doctors are just like,

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000
 "Well, it's probably just the way he -- that's just the way he works."

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
 What kind of vegetables does he eat?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000
 We give him squash, spinach.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
 We try to stay away from the broccoli and those kind of things,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
 but we do try to give him the green leafy vegetables.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
 Are all of the vegetables very well cooked?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
 Yes.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
 Salads are a problem for lots of people.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:53.000
 They'll cause either diarrhea or constipation in quite a few people.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 That sounds good.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
 We'll definitely try and follow that then.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
 I think that was it for my questions.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
 Thank you so much.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
 Thanks for calling in.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 Bye-bye.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 Bye.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
 Got some good questions.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000
 I got another caller.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 Caller from area code 760.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
 You're on the air.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
 Hello?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
 Hello?

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
 Hello?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
 Hello, you're on the air.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
 Can you hear me?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 Yes, we can.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
 Okay, great.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
 Well, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis about eight years ago,

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
 and I do get -- well, right now, as a matter of fact,

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 what I think is probably fungal infections.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.000
 My throat is full of little white spots, and I thought I had a UTI.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
 I did go to the doctor.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 They tell me they find zero bacteria as far as a strep throat or UTI,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000
 so I mean the only other thing is I must have a yeast infection somewhere

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 all over my body.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 I do get itchy skin often, and I just -- you know, my eyes itch,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
 and it's just really ugly feeling.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 So I'm thinking that's -- you know what, I must have a problem, you know, fungal.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 Hello?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 What were the symptoms of the sclerosis?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
 My symptoms -- I was constantly getting sick.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:51.000
 I was constantly having -- my throat was either infected or my ears, you know,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 I did have -- at one point I had lost peripheral vision,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
 and that was pretty much, you know, the start of it.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
 Did they check your hormones at that time?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
 They did, and I did start gaining a lot of weight at that time.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
 I don't recall what the hormone level were.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
 I really don't.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 Right now they tell me everything's in range is what, you know, I've been told.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
 What happened with the peripheral vision change?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
 Did that come back?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
 It came back within three weeks.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 I had it back.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:44.000
 The reason I ask is that most of the -- I think it was the first five or six people that I saw

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:52.000
 who had a diagnosis of MS recovered instantly when they took thyroid,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:00.000
 and one of the common symptoms of low thyroid is enlargement of the pituitary

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 because of a prolactin-secreting tumor, and that can cause pressure on the optic nerve,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.000
 and it's often misdiagnosed as a brain disease.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
 So it's good to check your prolactin and thyroid,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:26.000
 and it happens that those can often go with the other symptoms.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:33.000
 The low thyroid makes you susceptible to urinary tract infections.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000
 I wrote Barnes' books on the thyroid.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 I tell many stories about chronic urinary and oral infections that clear up as soon as they take thyroid,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 and the --

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
 I do recall initially way back then they did check that.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
 They did do like ultrasounds of the pituitary glands.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
 They wanted to check everything to do with my adrenal glands, all of that stuff,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
 and I think it kept coming back at a normal range,

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000
 and then until the two years afterwards I was able to get the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:29.000
 but still having to every so often deal with what I think is fungal infections,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000
 if it's not a bacterial infection that they do the lab works on, and it comes back as negative.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
 I don't know where to go now.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:53.000
 I want to try the holistic way of healing versus taking antibiotics and all that stuff.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 I think it's good to keep investigating because so many things are called MS that aren't really.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
 There was a study in which people had their heads x-rayed,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:20.000
 and many of the people diagnosed as MS had visible plaques in their brains,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
 but when they used a group of healthy medical students as controls,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
 just as many had plaques in their heads.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000
 Even finding the plaques doesn't absolutely confirm the diagnosis,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:42.000
 so it's good to keep your eyes open for other explanations.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
 Right. Right.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 So as far as holistic way, I mean, what can I do to check if I have a higher elevation right now

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
 of the bad bacteria versus my good bacteria in my body?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
 Where can I go to check that out? What do I do?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:08.000
 Well, you can get doctors to do it, but just in case there's something in your diet,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
 you might try eating a raw carrot every day.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:20.000
 For example, shredding a carrot and putting some olive oil, vinegar, and salt on it to make it tasty.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 That has a germicidal action and stimulates the intestine.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 Oh, wow.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 In the well-diagnosed multiple sclerosis,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:48.000
 they know that endotoxin is a very important factor in causing blood vessels in the head to be too permeable,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
 letting stuff leak out of the bloodstream into the brain.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 And endotoxin can be drastically reduced just by eating a good-sized raw carrot every day.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 You know, it's funny that you're telling me this,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
 because I've been craving carrot today is what I woke up craving, was a carrot.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 And I bought myself some organic carrot juice, Evolution, and that's what I've been drinking.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000
 It tastes so good and it's so refreshing.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
 My body is talking to me.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000
 Getting enough protein is very important, too.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:35.000
 Milk, cheese, and eggs, shellfish, you should try to get around 80 grams of protein at least.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:45.000
 I've known probably maybe 30 or 40 people over the years who were convinced that they had MS,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000
 who just basically had an intestinal problem.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
 And as soon as they cleared out their intestinal problem,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 all of their very strange visual and auditory and tactile symptoms disappeared.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
 Well, that's what I'm looking forward to.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 I hope that's what my case will turn out to be,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
 because really in these past eight years there is no other medication that can give me,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.000
 because either my liver didn't tolerate it or I was allergic.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
 And the new stuff they're coming up with, I am not willing to try.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
 The side effects are too risky for me.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
 So, yeah.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000
 I think I've got some articles on MS on my website.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 I'm not sure if they're all there, but if there aren't,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:43.000
 you can e-mail me from the website and I'll send you some more articles on MS.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
 Oh, that'll be great.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
 What is your website?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
 Raypeat.com.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
 Okay.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 My friend that was on earlier actually called me to tell me you were online.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000
 So the 626 person you just talked to earlier got me hooked right now.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
 So that's good.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
 That's really good.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
 Check out his website.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
 I will do.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
 Okay.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
 Thank you so much.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
 Thank you for calling in.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
 Okay.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
 Bye-bye.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
 Bye.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:27.000
 Ray, I got an e-mail from someone wondering about kind of starting a pro-thyroid-like diet

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 in regards to kind of what you recommend.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
 And just a couple questions in relation to that.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
 Does the body go through a detox when you begin that?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
 And what does it look like?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
 Would you see increased cholesterol?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:53.000
 No, if a person has low cholesterol, they shouldn't start a thyroid supplement at full force

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:03.000
 because the thyroid is going to make you convert cholesterol into the liver bile acids

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
 and progesterone, pregnenolone, DHEA, and so on.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:15.000
 So very low cholesterol has to be fixed before you take very much thyroid.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000
 And the fruit is the best way to raise your cholesterol up to normal.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 But if a person has at least normal cholesterol, then they tolerate a thyroid supplement very well.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:37.000
 And if you're just starting out with a diet change,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:45.000
 the improvement of your thyroid function is going to be very gradual usually.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000
 And the first thing is to lower the production of toxins in your intestine,

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:01.000
 for example, cutting out undercooked starches, salad leaves and such that can't be digested,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:11.000
 and maybe using a fiber such as bamboo shoots or carrots that will have a germicidal action,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 and then avoiding all kinds of polyunsaturated fats

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 because at every stage of thyroid function, the polyunsaturated fats block the production of the thyroid hormone,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:36.000
 transport and stimulation of the energy production inside cells.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 And in a short period such as two or three hours after you eat saturated fat or coconut oil,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:58.000
 or sugar can do it sometimes, you can get a momentary activation of your thyroid that fades away

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:06.000
 as soon as you start drawing out the unsaturated fats from your tissues.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:14.000
 But to have a complete conversion from a thyroid-suppressed state to a completely normal state

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:23.000
 can take two or three years if you've got a lot of fat stored in your tissues.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:31.000
 And thin people can get their thyroid going much more quickly just with a diet.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
 If they start to diet and they see their cholesterol go up, will it eventually go down,

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
 or does that mean they have a deficiency in like selenium, glucose or T3?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:50.000
 Well, the rising cholesterol usually means that their liver is getting enough energy to make it.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 The toxins have gone down.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:08.000
 And the cholesterol is a protective, adaptive substance that is making up for deficient pregnenolone, progesterone and DHEA.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:18.000
 If your thyroid is low, you won't be converting it, and so it will adaptively protect you by being high.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:28.000
 There were studies -- a Framingham study found that people over 50 who had cholesterol under 200

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000
 were more likely to have dementia than people with higher cholesterol.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:47.000
 And in a nursing home study, they found that the longest-lived people averaged up around 270 or 280 cholesterol.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:28:01.000
 And all kinds of animal experiments show that you protect cells, brain cells, all kinds of cells, by having plenty of cholesterol.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000
 It's really a protective factor against all kinds of disease.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
 Great. Great.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
 I'm going to take another call.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
 We've got one more caller on here.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
 This is Dr. Code 847. You're on the air.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
 Oh, hello.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
 Dr. Peata, I wanted to ask you -- I had read your article on language

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000
 and was kind of interested to see someone else who found Chomsky's ideas a little bit unintelligible.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000
 But what I really wanted to ask you is if you had any advice as far as someone trying to learn a second language,

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000
 and particularly a language that has a basis with English,

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
 something that's less about the visual, about learning new characters and everything,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
 just how you'd go about this.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
 Are there any things you can take to help, like such as pregnant alone?

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 Oh, yeah.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000
 Vitamin B1 and coffee can make a tremendous difference in --

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:11.000
 like if you just want to sit down and memorize -- the way I learned French to pass my graduate school exam,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:20.000
 I did it over a weekend with just plenty of coffee and a few hundred milligrams of vitamin B1.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000
 I just sat down and memorized 4,000 words, I think it was.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.000
 And also you had this idea of children learning language in a way where they might have a limited vocabulary,

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
 but they can still be very fluent.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.000
 How would you approach this to start out with vocabulary and memorization?

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:51.000
 No, I think if you want to speak it, you should memorize the paradigms of the verb forms and pronouns especially.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:59.000
 And just get maybe 600 words you can memorize.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:05.000
 If you get a list of the words, you can find cognates, and then just -- if there aren't cognates,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
 you can just sit and memorize until you have 600 or 800 words,

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:20.000
 and then you can make your own sentences if you have the paradigms and that basic vocabulary.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:27.000
 If you have to learn to read it in a hurry, then you want to take a vocabulary list of 4,000 or 5,000 words

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:34.000
 and cover that quickly so that you recognize a good portion of the words you run across.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:42.000
 And a kid, typically by first grade, a kid will have several thousand words of vocabulary.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:49.000
 And do you particularly know what the B1 is doing when you take it, or is it enhancing specifically your memory?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:58.000
 It makes you produce energy faster, more carbon dioxide that increases circulation to your brain.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 Oh, sorry. I never thought of that.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:07.000
 One other quick question was in regards to how much I should worry about these small amounts of these plant estrogens.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
 I drink a lot of tea rather than coffee, but I've even heard coffee has some of these compounds,

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:19.000
 and also maybe like the hops in beer. Are these things to worry about?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:30.000
 Well, yeah, the hops in beer are estrogenic. There are a lot of good things in coffee more than in tea.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:37.000
 Coffee is a major dietary source of niacin and magnesium,

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:45.000
 and a couple of studies in England showed that the average English person gets, I think it was 20 percent,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:50.000
 of six or eight nutrients from coffee or tea.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
 So they are a major part of the diet for people who use them.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
 Okay. Well, thank you.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
 Thanks for calling in.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
 You're welcome. Goodbye.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000
 Bye.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
 We're out of callers, but I have an email question from someone, Ray, if you don't mind answering it.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000
 Okay.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
 He wanted to know two things.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000
 What do you recommend is the upper limit of eating raw liver per day or per week, you know,

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:29.000
 and also what your take is on eating raw eggs in regards to, you know,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:35.000
 what's in them in regards to proteins and fats feeding up the precursors to our steroidal hormone pathway?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000
 If it's healthy to eat them raw, should we cook them? Things like that.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:50.000
 It's just you're less likely to catch some fairly uncommon infection if they're cooked,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
 but they should be lightly cooked.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:05.000
 Just the exposure to oxygen is going to break down the polyunsaturated fats the hotter they are.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:11.000
 Eating them raw doesn't really protect you because once you've assimilated polyunsaturated fats,

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:17.000
 they're going to eventually cause free radical damage in your tissues,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:25.000
 but they're a little better if they're not overcooked.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
 And the same with liver.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:39.000
 The less cooking the better, but even moderately well-cooked is still very -- liver is still very nutritious.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 Now, how much would you say you recommend eating?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
 I know you recommend eating liver once a week, right?

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
 Yeah, six ounces is enough.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
 Okay.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
 And I guess at the same time, it could be person-specific, just like you recommend taking in gelatin

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
 and the amount of gelatin that someone's going to take in is person-specific.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
 Because I've had people actually who -- the most common side effect that I get from it with people

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
 is more bloating and gas or even diarrhea.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:17.000
 If you eat it undissolved, it's very likely to do that because it takes time to dissolve

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
 and become accessible to digestion, and that means that it's going to feed bacteria

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
 and cause gas if it isn't completely dissolved.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
 So same thing with the liver.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000
 It's just all person-specific because some people might be able to -- go ahead.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:41.000
 If I eat six or eight ounces of liver and just ordinary other foods,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:48.000
 I often will wake up with low blood sugar or some symptom during the night,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:56.000
 and so I've learned to cook it in a very large amount of butter and/or coconut oil.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
 There's something about the absence of fat in liver.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:07.000
 It's so high in protein that it tends to disturb your blood sugar

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:13.000
 if you don't have a lot of both fat and sugar with it.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
 Good stuff.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
 And then, you know, it's been a great show.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
 We've got about 25 minutes left, but, you know, we can end early.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
 I just got one last email from someone, and I know you wrote a newsletter on this,

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
 and some of this stuff is a little bit over my head,

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.000
 but he wanted to know what you think about the therapeutic potential of tryptamine drugs

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
 like psilocybin and LSD.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
 He's read a lot of research from the '60s

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:45.000
 and then come across a trial that used LSD in sub-hallucinogenic doses.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.000
 Yeah.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
 But you indicated in the past that you consider hallucinogen doses.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
 You can elaborate on it.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
 He wants to know just your take on it.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
 Okay.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:11.000
 In the early studies, one of the first things they found -- I think it was Groff, the psychiatrist,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.000
 some of his patients reported that besides the thing he was thinking about,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
 they reported that their headaches had disappeared.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:30.000
 People with chronic migraines just stopped having them after a couple of sessions of LSD.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:41.000
 In the late '50s and early '60s, migraines were pretty well identified as an excess serotonin problem,

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:53.000
 and LSD turned out to be counteracting the serotonin and curing the headaches.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:03.000
 Because of the ideology, the government demonizing the hallucinogens,

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:12.000
 which were identified as anti-serotonin drugs,

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:21.000
 the pharmacy interests in antidepressants, for example,

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:33.000
 started to emphasize that they were not going in the direction of the hallucinogenic drugs.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:43.000
 So they emphasized that serotonin was a beneficial thing psychologically

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 and people went crazy because they were destroying their brain serotonin

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:55.000
 by taking the hallucinogenic drugs.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:06.000
 They pretty much fabricated an alternative explanation for the hallucinogens

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:18.000
 for their own drugs and submerged the therapeutic uses, such as curing headaches.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:23.000
 They were being used experimentally against breast cancer

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:31.000
 and several very serious diseases lost their funding

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:39.000
 and they couldn't get the materials anymore to experiment with because of the demonizing of the drugs.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:53.000
 But the mechanism seems to be that the LSD-type drug does, in a few situations, imitate serotonin.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:04.000
 Serotonin has a feedback system in the brain in which it turns off the nerves that make serotonin.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:11.000
 This is the serotonin-like action of the hallucinogens.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
 They turn off the serotonin-producing drugs in the brain.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:25.000
 And so even though they do act on that serotonin receptor, imitating serotonin in that case,

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.000
 their basic function is still anti-serotonergic.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000
 Just as in 1953 they were found to act as antagonists to the muscle-tightening effect

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:49.000
 on blood vessels or uterine tissues and so on, they were identified as antagonistic to serotonin.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:58.000
 And because of the pharmaceutical industry wanting to avoid any association

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:12.000
 with the anti-serotonin hallucinogens, they created the myth that serotonin is something you want to increase,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:20.000
 that it's the happy drug, but actually it's pretty much the misery drug.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:40.000
 Any excess of it produces nausea, diarrhea, high blood pressure, tumor growth, fibrosis, arthritis,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:53.000
 dementia, and so on. So the scope for new research using these drugs is extremely broad.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:06.000
 Just recently both a bromo-LSD and psilocybin studies came out showing treatment of either cluster headaches

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:16.000
 or other organic-type diseases. So it looks like research might be starting up again.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:32.000
 One of the early LSD-like drugs was called lizuride, which is called the non-hallucinogenic equivalent of LSD,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:42.000
 but it's just less in ordinary doses. It's not hallucinogenic, so it's just a weaker form of LSD.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:53.000
 It's been used against diabetes and cancer and all of the serious degenerative diseases.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:02.000
 And bromocriptine is another ergot-derived drug that cures pituitary tumors.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:19.000
 And there's a family treating Cushing's disease and other pituitary-related problems.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:29.000
 So I think the research, after skipping 40 years, I think it's about to get back where it was in the 1960s,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:41.000
 recognizing that these antiserotonin drugs are in fact antiserotonin and that that's how they produce their beneficial effects.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:51.000
 There you go. You got time for one more question? Ray?

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
 Did I lose him?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:03.000
 Hello? What? Hello? Oh, I thought I lost you.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:08.000
 Hello? Yeah, I'm here.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000
 I wonder if we're still on the air. I can't tell. I don't think we lost people.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
 Do you have time for one more question? Sure.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
 Call her from the 308. You're on the air.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:27.000
 All right. Hi, Dr. Peat. Hi, Josh. Thank you for taking this call.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
 I have three questions, if that's okay.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
 Yeah, we've got about 15 minutes. I might have to cut you off just because it's timed.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
 I'll let you know. Okay.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:45.000
 First, I have a question. I was wondering if, Dr. Peat, could you give your perspective on sunscreens

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:53.000
 and how so many doctors tell people to avoid being in the sun without it because they say it can cause skin cancer?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.000
 Would you say that that's accurate or have you found -- sunlight usually?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
 Sunblocks, you have to put sunscreen.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:12.000
 Sunblocks, yeah, they are -- some of them at least are directly carcinogenic in contact with the skin.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.000
 And there's a big phobia about ultraviolet.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:30.000
 It will age your skin, but it's best to get plenty of sunlight but avoid the sunburn.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
 You can do that.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:40.000
 There were experiments on rabbits a long time ago in which they put rabbits on a saturated fat diet

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:47.000
 or an unsaturated fat diet, and then they shaved them and exposed them to sunlight.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:57.000
 And the animals on the unsaturated fat diet got wrinkly, sun-damaged skin.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
 The animals on the saturated fat diet weren't hurt by the sunlight.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:10.000
 The polyunsaturated fats in your skin are the target for the ultraviolet light producing damage.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:21.000
 There are other targets, but if, for example, vitamin B2 is locally destroyed by ultraviolet light,

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:29.000
 if the cells contain a lot of polyunsaturated fats, they act like an amplifier for the damage

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:37.000
 and cause the damage that accumulates with fibrosis and shrinkage of the skin and such.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:45.000
 And other things, you can apply coconut oil to your skin and get some protection

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:55.000
 because it absorbs and interrupts that amplification effect from the fats in your skin.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:04.000
 And caffeine and aspirin are other things that are antioxidants and stop the free radical effects.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:13.000
 So you can spread a solution of aspirin on your skin without the dangers of some of the chemicals

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.000
 that are sold as sunblockers.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
 Okay, so that answers my question. Thank you.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:28.000
 I was also wondering, because I've been told that you recommend Great Lakes gelatin

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:35.000
 if you're going to buy gelatin, I was wondering how you take that gelatin if you use that.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:42.000
 Because I know you do your oxtail broth and everything, so I was wondering how you use that gelatin.

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:55.000
 Yeah, mostly I make oxtail soup or lamb shank soup, but when I'm using the pure gelatin powder,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:08.000
 one way is to mix some sugar with it and moisten it and then heat it in the microwave until it gets clear

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:19.000
 and then add something like orange juice concentrate or lime juice and make sort of gummy bear candies

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:30.000
 out of it as snacks. It makes a chewy, sweet snack that is, since it's been melted,

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.000
 it's more digestible than taking the powder in a plain form.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:46.000
 Or I use it for adding to recipes to make things like mousses and cheesecake equivalents.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:48:00.000
 Or sometimes just add it to other foods as long as it's dissolved until there are no particles visible

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000
 and it's digestible. Marshmallows are another way to get some.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:15.000
 Okay. All right, and one last question, because my boyfriend was very curious about this.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:23.000
 He was wondering if wireless internet is a source of small-dose radiation.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.000
 Of what kind of radiation?

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:30.000
 Small-dose radiation.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
 I can't understand what that word is. What kind?

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
 If wireless internet is a source of small-dose radiation.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:48.000
 Oh, small. No, not that I know of. I don't use the wireless things.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:59.000
 I have wire connections for everything because you can get a field meter and find that some of the appliances

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.000
 have a pretty intense field a couple feet away from them.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:17.000
 And cell phones, for example, are a serious dose of radiation that definitely does affect your nerve function

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000
 and probably increases the brain cancer incidence.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:30.000
 And that's why I avoid any of the wireless devices that I can.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:39.000
 Okay. So I think that answers all my questions. Thank you very much.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
 Okay.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
 Thanks for calling in.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
 Yep. Thanks. Bye.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
 Bye.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
 All right, guys. Well, I think that just about does it.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
 Unless you have anything else you want to add in there, Ray?

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
 Nope.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
 We had a lot of good questions.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:05.000
 I knew a lot of people wanted to ask you a lot of personal questions and scientific questions.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
 I'm glad we did this.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
 And anything else you want to add in there?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000
 Anything new going on that you want to kind of let everyone know about?

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:28.000
 Had we talked about Luca Turin's lectures on the Internet about the way molecules and cells interact?

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:34.000
 If we did, I don't remember.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:46.000
 My recent email talks about some of the biological processes that have been excluded from science.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:54.000
 And a few people are starting up on some of these old approaches to how a cell works,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:03.000
 that they're along the same lines of Gilbert Ling and Albert Sant'Giorgi,

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
 a researcher at the University of Washington, Gerald Pollack,

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:17.000
 has some lectures on the Internet describing his work with water, the structure of water.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:30.000
 And Luca Turin has lectures on the basic ways that drugs or other chemicals interact with cell systems.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:42.000
 It's bringing connection to stuff that was pretty much suppressed after the 1950s in favor of molecular biology.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:48.000
 In the 1950s and early '60s, they were calling it quantum biology,

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:56.000
 but it doesn't necessarily involve the whole metaphysical thing of quantum physics.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:08.000
 But it's just the idea that the interactions of hormones and drugs and cells can be understood on the electronic level

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:18.000
 rather than the lock and key mechanical conception that is current the last 40 years.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.000
 This is a newsletter article.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:30.000
 My July newsletter is talking about the history of the structure of water.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:38.000
 But on the Internet, you can see these two people have good lectures.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
 Awesome. Looking forward to it.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
 Well, I think that was a great show.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.000
 I know, as I said before, in Omer, Norwegian, your shows get a lot of live listeners,

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.000
 a lot of archive listeners, a lot of questions.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:53:01.000
 And your work is really getting people to think outside the box.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
 For you, it's probably maybe a little simple.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:10.000
 For a lot of people, it's very enlightening, and it's changing a lot of people's lives.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
 So I know everyone appreciates you taking the time out.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000
 We appreciate you taking the time out. So thanks.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
 Okay. Thank you.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
 You have a good day.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
 Okay. Bye.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
 Bye.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
 But there you go, guys.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
 Great show.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000
 Questions and answers, I know, is long awaited.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:34.000
 We'll probably be doing another show in August, doing the Endotoxin Serotonin Show.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
 Stay tuned to our Facebook.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
 You can look me up at Josh Rubin, California.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:45.000
