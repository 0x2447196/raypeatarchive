00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to late p.m.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 graduating there with a degree in herbal medicine,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 and we run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 about a wide range of conditions and recommend supplements and nutritional counselling.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville, 91.1 FM,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 to this month's subject of antioxidant theory and the continued war on cancer.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 and there's an 800 number, which is 1-800-568-3723 for those outside the area

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 and also for those people listening on the web.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 So www.kmed.org, and this show is streaming live,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 so I think many of our people that come from the Midwest and the East Coast

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 are probably listening to this on the web.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 We can be reached, incidentally, toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 for consultations or any further information at the end of the show

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 and/or Monday through Friday, 9-5.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 So I wanted to open up with a little repeat or a paraphrase

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 of some of our previous discussions with Dr. Peat, both in July and in May.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 So U.S. Vice President Joe Biden addresses the session "Cancer Moonshot, a Call to Action"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 January 19, 2016.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Biden, whose son Beau died last year at the age of 46 from brain cancer,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 has helped fuel Biden's sense of urgency about the project,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 which was first announced by President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address in January.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 In July's program we discussed your newsletter, Dr. Peat,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 entitled "100 Years of Cancer Metabolism,"

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 which outlined the stark contrast between the objective and scientific inquiry-based approach to disease

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 exemplified by early 20th century biologists like Otto Warburg, Albert St. Georgi, William F. Koch,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 and the mechanistic, cancercidal approaches of the multibillion-dollar cancer industry,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 which has failed spectacularly to find a cure for cancer,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 and whose funding continues to grow disproportionate to any other industry,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 whose ability to prove "good" on their research funding would normally cause their exit from the marketplace.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 It is more a matter of continuing the war and the money generated in cancer's feared diagnosis,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 which perpetuates the industry.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Cures are really not very profitable, nor self-perpetuating.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Thus, misled strategies to conquer cancer prevail against the truly objective and scientific discourses of yesteryear,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 with the emergence of globalistic monopolies with different objectives to truly curing anything,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 but continuing to play both sides of the war,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 not unlike real wars, so waged by corrupt governments and corrupt politicians alike.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 The free radical theory of aging was conceived by Denham Harmon in the 50s,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 when a prevailing scientific opinion held that free radicals were too unstable to exist in biological systems.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Two sources inspired Harmon.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 One was the rate-of-living theory, which holds that the lifespan is an inverse function of metabolic rate,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 which in turn is proportional to oxygen consumption,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 and to Rebecca Gershman's observation that hyperbaric oxygen toxicity and radiation toxicity

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 could be explained by the same underlying phenomena, i.e. oxygen-free radicals.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 Now, Harmon's hypothesis has been seriously challenged by recent studies showing that reactive oxygen species

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 actually evoke metabolic health and longevity, and as for Rebecca Gershman's observation,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 it's interesting that Joseph Priestley, the English chemist who discovered oxygen in 1774,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 had questioned whether the gas, which is so essential to life, might also in some way be harmful.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Modern research has revealed that oxygen is actually a very toxic material,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 and that the body has a number of antioxidant defense systems that act continuously

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 to keep tissue oxygen levels from getting too high.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 One of the built-in systems that accomplishes this is the enzyme superoxide dismutase

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 discovered by Erwin Fridowicz and Joe McCord in '67.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 It begets the question why the neurosis in the ICU of most hospitals,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 if your oxygen saturation is lower than 97%,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 they poison you with pure oxygen when it's common knowledge that increased CO2 is protective.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Like the previous show in May, where Dr. Peake's newsletter explained

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 and explored the societal paranoia versus trust-annoyer,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 referring to the government's working for our benefit to keep us safe from disease, etc.,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Dr. Peake displayed evidence contrary to this related to cancer therapies ignoring objective science,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 but rather a creasing to rank order within academia.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 And now, Dr. Peake, you've uncovered research which shows a different perspective

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 to our previous understanding of antioxidants and how they should actually be referred to as pro-oxidants

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 and how that affects the organism.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 So thank you so much for joining us again, Dr. Peake.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 You're welcome.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 For those people, as always, who may have not listened to our show,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 would you outline your academic and professional background for those people listening?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 I appreciate that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 My biology study was at the University of Oregon, 1968 to '72,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 where I worked on my thesis on reproductive aging

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 and the oxidative metabolic changes that are involved in aging.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 And at that time, I was really just bringing together information on oxidative metabolism

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 that had been developed over the preceding 50 years.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 And I thought the situation was ripe for sort of a conclusion.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 I, at the time, couldn't have imagined that 45 years later,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 it would have gone backward to the 1890s situation of the government

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 pushing a purely genetic causation of cancer and other diseases.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 Now, Harmon's hypothesis would have been relevant at that time.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 You said in the '50s, the early or mid '50s, you were doing this kind of post-grad work?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Yeah, in the 1950s, there were lots of new discoveries.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Daniel Mazia and his collaborator Katsuma Dan

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 discovered how the mitotic apparatus works, the controlled cell division,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 and they found that the reduction of the sulfur groups, sulfhydryls,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 increased at the time of cell division.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 And if you look at those as the interface between metabolic energy production

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 and cell growth and differentiation,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 it suggests a very direct course to curing the tumor-producing diseases at least

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 and the inflammatory diseases by working on metabolism.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 The genes are only in the background, don't have any role in therapy actually,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 except everyone has to have genes.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 We have to produce proteins and everything else.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Okay, we'll get into a little bit later how the gene theory has been totally discredited

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 in a lot of ways in terms of the evidence that we'll bring out in some of these abstracts.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 But in terms of what interested me when I started reading these abstracts and articles

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 was that I think a lot of people recognize the term "oxidant" and "antioxidant"

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 probably erroneously and we've always looked at antioxidants as being the things

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 we were necessarily looking for when in fact when they've done autopsies in the brain,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 they find things like glutathione, which is one of the main antioxidants in the system,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 is actually not that depleted and so they're looking at other reasons for aging and cell death, etc.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 How is your current understanding of antioxidants different?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 Because essentially what I think you're trying to say was that antioxidants really should be termed,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 sorry, antioxidants should really be termed "proxidants."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Yeah, the ones that are therapeutically useful, such as vitamin E and vitamin C,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 actually shift the balance inside the cell.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 Vitamin C is known to be in a very highly oxidized condition, so it isn't really the vitamin C we know.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 It's a dehydroascorbate when it is inside the healthy cell.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And these are maintaining, it's actually a constant flow of electrons,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 but the balance at every moment is pushed in the direction closer to oxygen and farther from the reducing electrons.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And so if you're deficient in vitamin E and vitamin C and so on,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 the electrons predominate and shift over to reducing the sulfur groups all through the cell

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 into the sulfhydryl form, promoting inflammation.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 And if you think about what happens when any kind of injury happens,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 whether it's a microbe or getting stuck with a thorn or whatever,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 you disrupt the ability of the organized tissue to deliver oxygen and sugar and other nutrients to the cell.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 And so the cell in that area is starved, can't oxidize,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 and it has an immediate shift over to basically the antioxidant side.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 The cell has a variety of enzymes that function as antioxidants, but they are only activated during injury or stress.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And what happens to the cells in that condition is the sulfhydryls are reduced,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 the mitotic apparatus is activated, the cells de-differentiate, lose their functions except to grow and divide and move.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 So they creep into the injured area and multiply to repair the area.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And then if the surrounding organism is able to deliver oxygen and sugar and other nutrients,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 then they are able to differentiate and finish the healing process.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 So this whole theory of antioxidant, that we don't want to oxidize things,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 is really we want the cell to be oxidizing and an injured cell is not using the oxygen.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 It's actually in an anti-oxygen state.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Yeah, and if you get stuck in the antioxidant state, that keeps the healing process from being completed.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 And that's where cancer is.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 It's stuck in the inflamed antioxidant state, only able to divide without knowing exactly what it should be doing.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 So how can we understand how CoQ10 and naringenin and apigenin are actually working on the inside of the cell?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 The apigenin and naringenin from like orange peel, marmalade and celery seeds.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 And apigenin from celery seeds.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Those potent antioxidants, as we're told, they're antioxidants, but how are they actually working in the cell?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Well, the coenzyme Q10 is now known to fit very specifically in certain places in the mitochondria

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 that deliver electrons to the electron transport system,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 delivering it ultimately to oxygen to complete the production of ATP and carbon dioxide.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 So it plugs right into the oxidative system.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 So it's actually oxidizing.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 It's oxidizing everything upstream to deliver those electrons into the oxidizing pigments,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 which deliver the electrons to oxygen.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 So it's a necessary link between oxygen and all of the reducing factors.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 So if you don't have that link, that's one of the essential links that you need to prevent the electrons from going into the growth cell division system.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Right, because if they don't have, if the cells don't have enough oxygen,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 then they'll start dividing and potentially becoming cancerous if they don't get that oxygen and the oxidizing process happening.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 Yeah, and where the actual antioxidant function comes in is when you have an oversupply of polyunsaturated fats, for example.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 When you don't have enough oxygen and go into that inflamed cell division state,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 the electrons that can't be taken up by oxygen are free to locate on iron atoms, for example.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 And the iron, when it's reduced, there's always some potential iron.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 But the older you are, the more free iron there is likely to be in your cells.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 The electrons activate the iron, which then attacks any of the polyunsaturated fats in the environment.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 And that sets up an oxygen-consuming system, which produces nothing of value.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 The electrons have no place proper to go, so they go to iron, which then gives its electron to the polyunsaturated fat,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 which becomes a free radical and consumes, reacts directly, then sometimes with oxygen or with more iron.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 And you get cycles of oxidation without purpose.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Right, okay, so you want the oxidation to be in the cell producing carbon dioxide using sugar and oxygen

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 and the whole proper cellular respiration to be going on, not to where you're in this reduced state

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 where your body, the PUFA, the polyunsaturated fats are so hungry for oxygen and so is the iron,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 and so those things are oxidizing and not producing. Is that a good way to understand it?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Yeah, and in the process of consuming oxygen, they are creating oxygen starvation.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 And so they're setting up the situation to spread.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 So it's a very energy-wasteful situation.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 Yeah, an oxygen-wasting system.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Is that because the polyunsaturates will attract the oxygens more strongly than the respiring cell?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Yeah, they become a trap for oxygen.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 And as they deteriorate, they interact with the iron and proteins and create imitation oxidative enzymes,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 except as a short circuit directly between NADH and oxygen,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 by way of the iron and proteins that are condensed in the form of age pigment or lipoflaskin,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 made up of polyunsaturated fats and parts of the cell which have been destroyed.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 And so those function as a very powerful oxygen sink,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 keeping the mitochondria from getting the oxygen they need.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 So that's why you don't want to eat fried foods that are fried in liquid vegetable oils,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 because you're going to create oxygen starvation for your cells that need the oxygen,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 because the vegetable oil is going to soak it all up.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Yeah, and with time, as that process accumulates, for example,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 small amounts of practically invisible of the age pigment begin accumulating

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 and keeping those cells in a state in which they take up preferentially more of the polyunsaturated fats,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 if they're available.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 And so with age, organs like the brain, which are normally very high energy users,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 become slowed down and reduced and preferentially concentrate more and more of the highly unsaturated fats,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 especially DHA, the predominant fat in fish oil,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 concentrates more and more in the brain with age

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 and makes the brain more and more susceptible to the lipid peroxidation

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 and losing function because the oxygen is being diverted.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 Yeah, and it's the byproducts of that lipid peroxidation which are themselves very damaging.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Yeah, and tends to produce more of the age pigment.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 So what is cumulative is the catalytic products of the degenerating polyunsaturates

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 and not specifically mutations in the mitochondria,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 which the Harmon free radical theory of aging insisted on.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Right. Okay, good.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 Let me hold you there. You're listening to Ask Your Doctor, KMED, Gallivaville, 91.1 FM.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us exploring the latest concepts in oxidants, antioxidants, cancer theory.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 The lines will be open from 7.30 to 8 o'clock if callers would like to call in with any questions

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 either related to this month's subject or to other relevant subjects surrounding health.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 The number here for in the area is 923 3911.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Well, there's an 800 number for those out of state, perhaps 800 568 3723.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Dr. Peat, you brought up an interesting point here, Lipofruskin.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 So I know we've mentioned it many times in the past in reference to fish oils,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 which unfortunately are still portrayed as being very healthful

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 and is still a very multi-billion dollar industry for certain corporations.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Obviously, these things take a long time before they reach the mainstream

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 and people understand that what they're doing for themselves is actually very harmful.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 So I was thinking about the link and it's a little bit of a kind of curveball,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 but the outbreak of Zika, let's just explore.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 I haven't really prepared. I know you haven't prepared for it,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 but I know you've normally got a very different perspective at which to approach a problem.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 So in terms of Zika and the prevalence of microcaffeine,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 if that indeed is a manifestation of Zika only, I was looking earlier on just at Lipofruskin in general.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 I came across the term neuronal steroid Lipofruskinosis.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Now, steroid apparently is a product that's produced as a result of the inability to remove Lipofruskin.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 And there were apparently there are eight types or so they've recognized these types or subtypes,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 genetically separate neurodegenerative disorders that result,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 as I said, from the excessive accumulation of the pigment Lipofruskin.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Now, with reference, like I said, to steroid,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 it apparently is formed when a disposal system for Lipofruskin is overloaded.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 But what caught my attention was that they had eight types and types one, two and three were associated with microcaffeine.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 And I know that without bringing up this or changing the subject of this month's show to Zika and the, you know,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 the political ramifications and or the conspiracy theories about Zika.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 In terms of microcaffeine in the infantile brain developing in utero with reference to polyunsaturates

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 and the production of Lipofruskin and or the inability to remove the waste producing Lipofruskinosis.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 How do you how do you see microcaffeine in the kind of in the overall picture for the explanation of what Zika does to infantile children?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 Well, it could be a virus like that, or it could be the insecticide that people absorb when they're spraying the mosquitoes that carry the virus.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 The insecticides are known to damage brain development.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 But 50 years ago with experiments in mice and then a little later in dogs,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 they found that in proportion to the unsaturation of the fat in the mother's diet, the brain development was retarded.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 The animal, the baby animals had smaller brains and were less able to learn in proportion to the amount of prenatal polyunsaturated fat they absorbed.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Because isn't it true that the placenta will try and filter out all of the polyunsaturated fat from the mother's diet?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Yeah, the placenta preferentially absorbs glucose and fructose.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 But if the diet if the mother happens to have low blood glucose,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 then more of the mother's circulating fats as your blood sugar goes down, you liberate into the bloodstream free fatty acids.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 So when the mother has hypoglycemia, the placenta loses the ability to screen out the fats to some extent,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 where the baby should make its own brain fats purely from glucose.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 And those would be saturated fats. Those wouldn't be polyunsaturated fats, correct?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 Primarily saturated, but then we intrinsically are able to make a series of polyunsaturated fats called the omega minus nine series.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 And those are present in any healthy baby's brain, whether it's a human or a cow or a bird or rodent.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 The developing brain turns sugar into saturated fats and the omega minus nine series.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 And the brain is predominantly lipid in its structure?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 About 50% fat, very high fat content compared to other tissues.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 OK, so another thing that came out looking at the breakdown of the different subtypes of lipofuscinosis,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 were those that were associated positively with epilepsy, either childhood epilepsy, midlife or late life epilepsy.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 How do you how do you see epilepsy in relation to polyunsaturates in the diet?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Vitamin E has been proven to reduce the incidence of seizures in lots of animal experiments.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 And the process of stress in a brain cell lowers the oxygen availability,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 triggers that reductive process causing lipid peroxidation.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 And if your tissues are well saturated with vitamin E, that's much less likely to happen.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 OK, so let's let's move on to a couple of other examples of the evidence that's been disproven

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 in terms of mitochondrial energy production, mitochondrial health, the theory of aging.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 There are instances, well not instances, it's very well documented knowledge that parrots are very long lived compared to quail, for example.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And there's a naked mole rat which lives for 32 years compared to regular mice that live for three years.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 In terms of the metabolic energy of an organism to deal with insults, essentially, by having the energy to overcome that in the system.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 What do you what do you have to say about the longevity of different species that exist even within the same species?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 So the parrots and the quail and the mole rat and the regular mouse?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Well, flamingos also long live, yeah.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 There are a few researchers who have surveyed a lot of different animals and found that the highly unsaturated animals in the given species

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 don't live as long as those less highly unsaturated.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Hulbert and Pamplona are two of the people who have done the most research.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 And they find that birds in general are much less unsaturated in all their tissues than mammals.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 And part of that is that they don't activate enzymes that extend, for example, linoleic acid in a mammal.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 It's processed to remove electrons until it can, with the addition of more carbons, can become EPA or DHA, the highly unstable polyunsaturated.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 The birds simply don't use those enzymes to the extent that mammals do.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 So they can eat a polyunsaturated and it just doesn't turn into the EPA or the DHA.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Yeah, so they have more of the unprocessed linoleic acid than the highly unstable longer ones.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 And part of that, I think, is because they live at a much higher body temperature than mammals.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Mammals are usually somewhere between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the birds generally are well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, up to as much as 110 degrees.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 And that means that they will very quickly oxidize any of the most unstable fats. If they eat something with a highly unsaturated fat, it's more likely that the fat will be used for energy rather than circulating to cause trouble.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 So how about the decreased problems with PUFA in the presence of higher temperature?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 You're saying that just purely the higher temperature could cause PUFA to be oxidized more rapidly and therefore not within the cell but actually within a GI tract or elsewhere?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 He's just saying it's not going to get stored and it will get used up for fuel right away because their metabolism is so fast.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Yeah, even in a mammal at say 98 degrees, it turns out that a very high proportion of the DHA breaks down even by the time it gets into the bloodstream.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And it's the breakdown products that act on the immune system to suppress inflammation by temporarily stopping the production of prostaglandins.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Okay, we actually have a couple of callers, so let's start in with our first caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 Okay, me already?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Yeah, I can hear you now. Where are you from, caller?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Okay, hi. Well, I'm calling you from way, way far away. I'm calling you from Finland in Europe.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Finland, excellent.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 The sun hasn't risen yet and it will not rise for another couple of hours.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Good to hear your voice from Finland. All the best. What's your question for Dr. Peat?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Well, I'd like to first thank you for the show and I'd like your opinion about two very different types of devices.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 The first one are the so-called PEMF devices like Earth Pulse, Delta Sleep.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 The goal would be to induce Delta Sleep in a 46-year-old male as myself.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 And the second type of device I'd like your opinion on is CO2 breathing machines and CO2 bath devices.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Okay, well, the CO2 question, no problem. The first one, Dr. Peat, have you heard of this device, a PEMF?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 No, I don't know what it means.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Can you, caller, can you just elaborate a little bit on the fundamentals of this?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Sure. So those are, I think, in the PEMF there must be EM, must be electromagnetic field.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 So it's EMF, right.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 They are devices that you wear on your upper chest and they're supposed to deliver some light pulsing electromagnetic signal to induce deep sleep like Delta Sleep.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Okay, interesting. Dr. Peat, what do you think about that EMF generator?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 About 40 years ago, there was research on stimulating the brain across from one temple to the other with gentle,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 just one or two volts and very few microamps of current would be enough to induce those slower rhythms of the brain and improve sleep.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 But I don't know what the present apparatus is.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Do you know, sir, do you know what the volts are of the machine you're dispensing?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 I think that we're in a 10.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Now, I'm not sure about the hertz and the micro and mega, but something around 10.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Let me check.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 So basically, the latest devices seem to be, have to be worn on some artery between the heart and one of the sides, like the arm.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 And I think it's something like 10 hertz or something like that, but I'm not sure about the, yeah,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 you can vary them from 1 to 14 hertz, but they recommend mostly around 10, 8 or 10 hertz.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 10 is a natural frequency for humans.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Okay, well, I don't know if we can expand too much on that, but definitely can with the CO2 question.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 So your main question about the CO2 was?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Yeah, so now I can see, for example, on the Ray Peat Forum, there are people doing all kinds of experiments.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 And one of them being to basically bathe, well, there are breathing machines where you can regulate how much CO2 you're getting.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 And then one gentleman even invented some kind of bath device.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 So it's like a huge plastic balloon that you wrap around yourself.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 And there's something for access to or for infusing yourself basically with CO2, and this can be worn for hours.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Yeah, we've used that with our clients with injury that they wrap their injured limb in a plastic bag that they filled up with pure carbon dioxide.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 It certainly increases the vasodilation and gives you that sense of warmth that you'd either get from CO2 gas or being in these soda waters that liberate CO2.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 I know Dr. Peat's got a lot to say about carbon dioxide.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Let me let you say what you want to say about CO2, Dr. Peat, though you're always more eloquent.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 I think it was in 1908 that someone wrote an article about the medical uses of both treating colon inflammation,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 vaginal inflammation and such with the actual application of the gas or filling a bathtub.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 Since CO2 is heavier than air, if you seal the drains on a bathtub, you can just fill the bathtub with it and get in.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 And the person said an hour in the bathtub was like a day at the beach.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 You could probably leave your clothes on as well, couldn't you?

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Yeah, you don't have to take your clothes off because it instantly goes right through the clothing.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 You can feel it as a warm sensation because it relaxes blood vessels in the skin.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 And we have used huge plastic bags that come up to the shoulders.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 And you fill the bag and then get on a chair or something so you can step in it without spilling the CO2

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 and pull it up around your body without spilling it and then tighten it around the top.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 And that will usually stay put for at least an hour and your skin gets pink and warm from the relaxing effect.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And it has a systemic effect.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 It absorbs very quickly into your bloodstream and affects your blood pressure,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 improves pumping efficiency of your heart, reducing peripheral resistance in the arteries.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Yeah, positively associated with good health.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Yeah, and the increasing your CO2 lowers all of the transmitters of inflammation

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 by shifting you out of the over-reduced electronic state.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 It suppresses lactic acid production, for example.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 It helps your mitochondria to use the oxygen quickly.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Yeah, in many different ways.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 It activates the Krebs cycle and reduces meaningless excitation, lets you produce the energy in the right way

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 rather than an inflamed, pointless way.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Out of curiosity, can you drink sparkling water and would that help?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Like internally as opposed to externally?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 You tend to burp it out and lose much of it, but the little bit you absorb is very helpful.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 I think that's one of the reasons why it's so calming on an upset stomach, right? Soda water or?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Yeah, I think Priestley was really working on carbon dioxide when he accidentally discovered oxygen.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Okay, good. Well, thank you for your call, Carla. We do have another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 Where are you from, Carla?

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 Hello?

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 Hi, where are you from?

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 Hi, near Philipsville.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Okay, hi. What's your question?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 I have a couple of questions.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 Hello? Uh-oh. I think you've cut her off. Can you get her back?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 We've lost her.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Can you hear me?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Yeah, I can hear you now.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 Okay. Yeah, I've got two basic questions about the antioxidants.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Number one, I want to get clear about what's good and what's bad.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 CoQ10, is that good or not? I've always heard that that was very good for your heart.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Is that good or is that not good?

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 It's very good.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 It is good. So it's good to take CoQ10.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 How much do you think -- I've been taking 100 milligrams a day. Is that a good amount?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 I don't think anyone really knows what the best amount is.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 You don't know the amount. Okay. Now, what about EPA?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 I've heard that EPA, as the vitamin -- not vitamin E, but the -- you know what I'm talking about.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Fish oil.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Yeah, probably unsaturated oil, yeah.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 Yeah. Is that good or bad? I heard that EPA was really good to support the heart function.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Yeah, that's exactly the wrong kind of antioxidant.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 It's the reductive kind that imitates stress and promotes degenerative processes.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 So it's okay to have CoQ10 but not to have EPA?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 That's correct.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 And it also says that it supports your mood and is better for your brain function.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Definitely.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And you don't think that is it?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 No, definitely not better for your brain function.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 No, that was what we were discussing earlier and how an aging brain will have more and more of this EPA,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 which means that your brain actually gets less oxygen and it becomes more demented and more senile.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 And what about vitamin E? Is that good or not?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Yeah, that's one of the main antioxidants Dr. Peat was outlining at the beginning of the show.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 It is a good one.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Yeah, along with vitamin C.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 And vitamin K2 functions with coenzyme Q10 to deliver energy.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 And do you think glucosamine is good for the joints?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 Which?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 Glucosamine.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 Oh, I'm doubtful about that.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 It's been associated with changes in the pancreas like diabetes.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Okay, so you're not sure about that one.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 All right, well, thank you very much.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 Thank you for your questions.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Just last month an article came out by Sue and Yin identifying EPA and DHA as brain toxic fats.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 There you go. Good.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 I mean, the evidence is just so overwhelming.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 I don't know how people that listen to this show can possibly continue eating or taking this stuff.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Anyway, it takes a long time sometimes for people to come to finally fully accept it.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 Well, there's so much mainstream media.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 It's just like with everything else.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 There's so much mainstream media telling you that EPA and DHA are good for your brain.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Okay, we have another caller on the air.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 So let's take this next caller.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Caller, where are you from?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Hi, what's your question?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 Dr. Peat, I've noticed tremendous results by being on your nutrition program.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 I consult with Andrew Murray and things have been wonderful and even better now that I'm on thyroid hormones.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 My question is why are my eyes changing colors?

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 I noticed they were brown and now they're getting lighter and lighter.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 My guess is they might become a hazel, but online a lot of people like raw vegan people on YouTube are saying that their eyes change from brown to blue,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 and I guess the lighter your eyes' color is, the healthier you are.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 So my question is why is this happening and is it true that the lighter color your eyes are,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 the healthier you are?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 I don't know about that, but I know that people who use prostaglandins, eye drops to treat glaucoma,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 very often have a darkening of the iris,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 and that I think is a directly toxic effect where the -- like ultraviolet light darkens your skin

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 because it's injuring it and the pigment is a defensive reaction to protect you against ultraviolet light.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 I think the prostaglandin, which is made from polyunsaturated fats,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 is activating a defensive formation of pigment in the iris.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 So I suspect that it's good if you reduce your polyunsaturated fat intake and have lightening of your iris.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 I suspect it's a corrective process.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 Thank you very much.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 All right.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Okay.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 We have another caller on the line, so let's take this next caller.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 Caller, where are you from?

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Yes, this is the first caller again.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Thank you for letting me jump in line again.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 No problem.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 I had another question that came to mind.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 Does MCT oil do everything, every good thing that you recommend

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 or that you say coconut oil can do from a health and metabolism point of view?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 So, Dr. Peat, medium-chain triglycerides, do they do the same thing as coconut oil?

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 Yes, essentially they're doing the same thing of bypassing your stored polyunsaturated fats

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 and letting you oxidize more safely the saturated fats.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 But one of the problems is that they are so mobile relative to the longer chains

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 that they can be irritating to your stomach and intestines.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 You have to take it in a good balance with other foods.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 And that's why a lot of times these supplements like the vitamin D is in it, MCT oil,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 or the vitamin K, they can be irritating on people's digestion,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 and therefore then they can use those vitamins topically

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 if they experience intestinal irritation from the MCTs.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 And that was another question, Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Can you please describe the relation between vitamin K and cocutin?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Is it a precursor for cocutin?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 It works at the same site in the mitochondrion,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 and it seems to just act as a stabilizer or amplifier of the effect of coenzyme Q10.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 So it's almost like if you take vitamin K,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 you're helping protect the cocutin that you have in your system?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 Yes, I think vitamin E and K both have that function of working at the cocutin site.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 So do you think it's necessary for someone to supplement with cocutin if they're using vitamin K?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Well, I wouldn't mix them even in your stomach.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 I think it's good to take them at a different time because I've seen a reaction which,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 at least in the presence of light, I think it might cause other reactions to happen

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 when the vitamin E reacts with vitamin K.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Okay, we have another caller. So let's take this next caller.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 You're on the air. Where are you from?

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 Hi, this is Sue. I'm in Albion.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Albion, okay. Hi, what's your question?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 I got some thyroid levels drawn because I do have Hashimoto's.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 It inflamed quite a bit, and I just wanted to read them out and see

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 if there's a T3 level, T4, TSH. TSH was 0.48.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Free T4, 0.97. And the T3 was 110 nanograms per deciliter.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 And the endocrinologist was saying to increase a thyroid medication

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 to kind of make that thyroid go to sleep so that the inflammation would go down.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 And I wanted to get Dr. Peat's thoughts, and I'd like to hang up unless he has a question for me.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 Sure. Dr. Peat?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Yeah, keeping the TSH, that's probably a safe level,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 but I know lots of people who keep it at 0.01 and less and feel fine.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 But the TSH is a promoter of inflammation, not only in the thyroid gland,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 but in blood vessels, bone marrow, every place it's been studied, it promotes inflammation.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 And it happens to be activated by the stress, oxygen-deprived condition of the cells.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 So it's one of the mediators of the oxygen-deficient stress condition,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 along with estrogen, prostaglandins, cortisol, and nitric oxide.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 TSH itself is an inflammation promoter.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 So if you govern your dose by things like heart rate, temperature,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 and especially your middle of the day temperature and resting heart rate,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 and your appetite and thirst and quality of sleep,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 a doctor can do the Achilles reflex relaxation test to find out how your nerves and muscles are acting.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 People have different sensitivities to the T3 and T4,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 and the tissue-specific effect of either of those is affected by how inflamed you are generally.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 So if you have a lot of polyunsaturated fat and prostaglandins circulating,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 then a given amount of T3 isn't going to have the same local effect on any of your tissues.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 So really this persistence of an inflamed thyroid where I'm feeling like I'm being strangled

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 may have more to do with my generalized inflammatory response.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 Okay, thank you so much. Bye-bye.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Also, when you're low thyroid, you produce a lot of antibodies to lots of things,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 and you can also produce antibodies to your own thyroid.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 So part of the low thyroid condition is producing extra antibodies.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 And those antibodies are part of a cleanup process.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 So when you stop the inflammation, the antibody production will stop,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 and then it will take several months for the circulating level of the antibodies to disappear.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 So basically to summarize, to try to keep your TSH as close to zero as possible,

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 and the blood levels of free T3 and free T4 are not as indicative of a--

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 well, not a good measurement or not a good guideline to assess your thyroid function,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 all those things Dr. Feet mentioned, like your heart rate, your temperature, and your appetite.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 Those things are much more accurate at diagnosing yourself.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 And George Kreil at the Cleveland Clinic in the 1970s found that even for most types of thyroid cancer,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 if you keep your TSH near zero, it keeps down almost all of the recurrences of thyroid cancer.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Okay, we have another caller, so let's take this next caller.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Caller, where are you from?

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 Miranda.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 Miranda, what's your question?

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 Okay, it's regarding magnesium supplementation.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 I take a magnesium glycinate one in the morning, and I take one in the evening,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 and I find that it helps my nervous system in general.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 But my one complaint is that whenever I do it, whenever I start supplementing with magnesium,

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 I find that my belly fat gets worse.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 And, I mean, people that see me with my clothes on would say I'm just this tall, gawky guy,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 but underneath my belly fat is very pronounced.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 And if I drop the magnesium, it doesn't seem to be quite as pronounced.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 But I had read from another source many years ago that magnesium chloride didn't stoke that problem,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 and that most others, especially magnesium oxide, would really provoke it.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 But I was just wondering if you have any thoughts on that.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about magnesium glycinate as a substance that might be good?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 I've never used that one myself, but all of the forms that I've experimented with,

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 and for quite a few other people, magnesium supplements can cause intestinal inflammation or irritation.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 And I would guess that that's happening with an increase of histamine, nitric oxide, and absorbing endotoxin and such.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 Yeah, so it's not actually an increase in belly fat and chlorine.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 It's probably more due to an increased bogginess or a water retention within the tissues that this magnesium may be causing

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 that would then push your stomach further out and might make you feel like you'd actually increase more fat.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 Is that what you're suggesting, Dr. Peat?

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 Are you suggesting that that increased inflammation could actually lay down more fat?

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 Well, the fat would increase over a period of many months or years, but the water can increase overnight.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 Okay, well, I'm taking a prostate medication because I have an enlarged prostate,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 but PSA had no indication that it was out of an abnormal range.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 So I am playing with my water a bit.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 I have to go to the bathroom quite a bit because I'm taking this herbal from New Chapter for the prostate.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 Okay, so you're finding benefit from it?

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 That's probably based on pumpkin seed extract and saw palmetto.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Right, right, yes, it does have those for sure.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 I don't know.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 You know, it's almost from not passing enough urine to passing too much, getting up too many times during the night.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 But it feels healthier than insufficient urine flow.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 Dr. Peat, a quick -- we've only got a few minutes left here at the end of the show,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 but a quick word on prostatic hypertrophy, benign prostatic hypertrophy,

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 and urination difficulties and what your approach to that would be?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 Well, the thyroid is the basic thing because it helps you make the anti-inflammatory pro-oxygen steroids,

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 pregnenolone, progesterone, DHEA, and testosterone, and keeps down the estrogen.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 When anything is irritating your intestine, increasing histamine and other anti-oxidative mediators,

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 the inflammation spreads from your intestine through your whole pelvis in particular,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 and it will cause the smooth muscle of the bladder wall to become hyperactive and oversensitive,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 and that causes frequent urination.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 And lots of people assume that there's something wrong with their prostate

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 when it's really the intestine inflaming the whole urinary system.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 I see. And so, as you were saying, if the magnesium is inflaming the irritation,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 then the magnesium might be possibly indicated?

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 I think so. You can get adequate magnesium.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 If your thyroid lets your cells retain magnesium,

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 then 400 milligrams per day is easy to get from foods, fruit, fruit juice, milk, cheese, eggs, meat, seafood.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 All of those things are very good sources of magnesium. Coffee?

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 Yeah, unfortunately, a lot of those are-- I'm definitely a committed vegetarian, so I don't have eggs.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 Okay, I don't want to butt in there, but let's put it like this. It's three minutes to eight o'clock,

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 and we're going to wrap up with the show here.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 So thank you very much for your call, caller, and all the calls we received.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Yeah, thank you very much.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 And I just want to say one more thing about magnesium and thyroid.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 Dr. Peat, you've said that when you have a thyroid deficiency, you're not able to store magnesium properly,

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 and so it almost is like you have a magnesium deficiency as well.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Yeah, and you can correct a magnesium deficiency if you go at your thyroid dosing carefully.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Over a few days, it helps you extract it from your ordinary diet.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Right, so you don't need to supplement such large doses.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 Yeah, in the first two or three days, if you're going to start a thyroid supplement,

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 sometimes magnesium helps you adapt more quickly to the thyroid.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 But usually, for a vegetarian, you can boil any kind of green leaves.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 It doesn't matter what kind, but the magnesium comes out very quickly when you boil it.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 Just make sure to drink the water you boiled in.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 Yeah.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 Okay, well, thank you so much for your time.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 I don't want to cut you off, Dr. Peat. I just want to make sure people know how to reach you.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 So once again, thanks so much for giving your time.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 You were so very generous, and we really do appreciate it.
