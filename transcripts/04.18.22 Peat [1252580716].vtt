00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Well, a very pleasant good morning to you. Well, that didn't work out right. Hold on a second.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Something, one more thing here. Oh, I see. I can do it this way and then we'll, as I'm talking, we'll figure it out here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 No problem. This is OneRadioNetwork.com. My name is Patrick Timpone and it is the third Monday of the month at around 1130 Central or a few minutes behind here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 And we have the honor of talking to a fine gentleman, Dr. Ray Peat. He's a PhD. He's been around the circus for a long time in the field of health.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 He's got his PhD from the University of Oregon, specialization in physiology and, hold on a second. Something's not working here. I got it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 In physiology, sorry, and he wrote his dissertation in 1972. He outlined all of his ideas on progesterone.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 He's got a website that we're going to tell you all about. He also has a newsletter and he has a little chat thing in there that people ask a lot of questions.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 He's just quite well respected around the world of natural healing and has been for a very long time.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 And it's such an honor to talk to him on the third Monday because he's kind of a smart guy. He knows his stuff, does a lot of research.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Dr. Peat, thanks for coming on the show. It's just such fun to talk to you. Thank you, sir.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Okay.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Yeah, thanks a lot. Well, I got to ask you because, you know, everybody in the world has seen the video, which I'm sure you have.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Did a lot of people send you "Watch the Water" video?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Oh, yeah. What did you think about it?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 He has a lot of information, both on snake venom and on the effects of the COVID virus.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 And he runs through them in parallel and shows a lot of similar reactions to each of them.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 But I couldn't quite get his central point, what point he was trying to make, except maybe that the disease spreads through the water rather than through the air.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 But I think he was missing a very essential point, which is that stress, trauma of all sorts, poisoning, anything that damages the organism activates the phospholipases.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 It isn't just an oddity of COVID virus or cobra venom that activates the phospholipases that have all of those harmful effects.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Anything harmful that excites the organism too much turns on those things.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 For example, when you activate one kind of phospholipase, you get the production of prostaglandins.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 The prostaglandins activate all sorts of inflammatory things.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 The inflammatory cascade is activated, among other things, by phospholipase. And that's what kills you from COVID. And it's one of the things that can kill you with snake bite is systemic inflammation.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 So the phospholipase that Dr. Artis was talking about, where did he say they found this?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 It exists as part of the cobra venom.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Oh, as part of the cobra venom. Right. Right.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 The thing is a bit confusing. We're going to have Dr. Artis on tomorrow. And I think one thing that happened to this whole thing, Dr. Peat, my understanding is that the people who produced this video, they are the ones that really took this whole thing into the water. Right?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Not him. He did not.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 But many people have been arguing since the video was out that if you had a venom protein, if I think I can get this right, that is a protein that you could not take this internally and be a problem anyway. Is that true?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Most likely. Your stomach digestive enzymes.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Will get it. Right? Will get it.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Yeah. Pretty much.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 The venom would have to be injected. Correct?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Yeah. For the full intensity of destruction.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Right. Do you think it's possible that there could be the venom in this remdesivir?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 No, but like anything toxic, if you mess up your nucleic acids, that causes a series of problems, among other reactions that can activate phospholipase.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 So again, phospholipase, how does this fit into this whole picture? I'm just quite sorry, I'm not a sharpest tool in the shed here on the phospholipase thing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 When you eat something bad or get a cold, anything that starts an inflammatory process in your intestine or your nose or even in your skin, that irritation activates the phospholipases.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 There are several different kinds, but the one that most people think about is the phospholipase A2 that liberates arachidonic acid from the phospholipids that are part of our structural system of lipids and proteins and water that make up the cell.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 So there's always a lot of phospholipids around to be acted on by the phospholipase, and anything that disrupts your cells will activate that.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And that liberating arachidonic acid immediately brings up your prostaglandins, which then activate many other cytokines and inflammatory processes.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 I see. And the other thing that was mentioned, the monocronium, what are these? Do you know which I'm talking about?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 No.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 I'll find the piece on it exactly.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 So after all of these, we'll talk to Dr. Artis tomorrow. We're going to see if I can just pick this apart and see if we can get some clarity on exactly what he is saying.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 So I guess there's no way of knowing if there's some kind of a venom as well, Dr. Peat, in these injections, right? There could be?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 We don't know, do we really?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 An enzyme is something very easy to test for. So if there's an actual enzyme in something, it would be quickly identified.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 So if it's in there, there could be evidence of it into the injection, right?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Yeah. And that would be one of the possible adjuvants. If you stir up the phospholipases, that starts the inflammatory process. So that would be a kind of adjuvant for the vaccine.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 So after all of these, before we get to some questions, after all of these years, what has it been? Two and a half years as you sit back and look at the big picture, would you mind giving us your opinion, just your opinion, of what you have seen and what you think much of this COVID or some of it or all of it was about?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Yeah. For just about forever, there have been colds of various varieties and they're so fast changing that probably 30 or 40 years ago, they pretty much gave up on the idea of having vaccines against the common cold.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 But the virus is extremely common for causing colds and it's somewhat different from the influenza virus and other things that can cause pneumonia.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 But the cold virus has always killed a few people. Babies that aren't very strong or especially very old people often has been nothing but a cold that it takes to kill a very old, sickly person.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 So the cold is a good virus to start modifying if you want to create a weapon, for example. And that's why it was chosen by places like the Fort Detrick Germ Warfare Lab and the North Carolina Virus Lab of Ralph Baric.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 It formed a transmissible unit for putting all kinds of other things in to modify the effects. So it isn't just a common respiratory infection type cold, but it can carry other inflammatory systems with it.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 So then you think there was something that was released into the air or is it just into these injections?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Oh, yeah, the virus is a real coronavirus, but it has these segments with special functions of making the spike protein especially transmissible to humans.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And Ralph Baric described the way he and his lab developed the transmissibility and the insertion of the spike protein and the modification of the spike protein. That's all public information, patent descriptions and so on.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 And who is this Ralph Baric? What is he?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 A professor, a researcher at the University of North Carolina, tremendously supported by the government, Fauci in particular.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Are you aware that if Coch's postulates or any autopsies were done on these COVID patients to prove Baric's assertion that there was something released in the air that people got?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 In developing them, at first they were transmitted from animal to animal by contact, but then they let them develop in ways that until they could put animals in different cages and blow the air from one into the other and spread the virus.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 So it was definitely established in the lab to be transmissible through the air.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And autopsies have been done on the natural or whatever the current COVID germ consists of.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 And you can stain the tissues and show the presence of the virus getting into the lining of blood vessels, traveling to the intestine, the lungs, and even into the blood vessels of the brain.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 So then do I hear you saying that the work of Lanca, Cowan, Coffin and all these people that say that it's just the isolated things, you don't agree with them?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 No, it doesn't matter that you can have a test tube, a picture of a certain virus, you can demonstrate its presence by multiple ways.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 You form antibodies to it and then you can detect it when it's connected to the tissues of the victim.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Have you heard of Michael Palmer, a German colleague of Sucharit Bhakti?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 I know Bhakti, not Palmer. What's his name, sir? Palmer?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 Yeah, he was taught in Canada for a long time, biochemistry, but he worked on particularly the COVID virus and vaccines.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 And in a recent video, he shows slides from the 15 autopsies that were done on vaccinated people.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Oh yeah, I did see a little bit about that. Go ahead, sorry to interrupt.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 Bhakti has talked about that, but Palmer has the crucial videos that show exactly what's happening, different between the vaccine and the actual virus infection.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 He has a slide showing the staining of the virus with immuno stains, attaching a colored material to an antibody that's specific for part of the virus.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 And then another set of stains specific for the spike protein. And he shows that those can occur together, but you can distinguish them clearly.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 And that in these 15 autopsies, there are numerous cases in which it's clearly only the vaccine dependent spike proteins that are causing the death.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 The breakdown of blood vessels, for example, and the concentration of inflammatory white blood cells around the identifiable spike protein.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 So it's the most graphically clear incrimination of the vaccine itself, distinct from the viral disease causing the myocarditis,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 breakdown of blood vessels and clotting, hemorrhaging, the whole range of things that have empirically been associated with vaccine injury.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Now this specifically shows the presence in the tissues of the spike protein itself without any of the rest of the virus.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Anything else? So do you then think that there are people over the last two and a half years that experienced some kind of a bad flu, two, three weeks?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 I know people that have, right? That it was not a detox or could have been, but they could have also somehow taken something in from the outside as well.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 So the people that poopoo pasteurized thing, he was right in some way?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Oh, sure. Yeah. But before the COVID thing started at all, the CDC had been describing how many tens of thousands of people were dying of influenza pneumonia every winter.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 That was used to herd people into getting the influenza vaccine. But then someone said, what is the evidence really that this is influenza killing them?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 The same question some people have asked about the COVID so-called virus, but when they just reported something like 60,000 deaths this season from influenza pneumonia.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 And so someone suggested that they actually check for evidence that there was an influenza virus.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 They said, oh, well, yes, there were something like 1200 deaths seasonally from influenza and the others were from COVID, were from coronaviruses was one cause, common colds probably.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Bacterial pneumonia was another set to syncytial virus pneumonia accounted for a big block of the deaths that had been called influenza and unidentifiable pathogen was a major block of people dying of pneumonia and they couldn't find bacteria or viruses at all.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 So it could have been toxins of various sorts.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 A major source of pneumonia without germs is endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide leaking out of the intestine.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And so when anyone is seriously stressed, endotoxin tends to become one of the factors in leading to pneumonia.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So even in cases like pneumonia or common flus or colds, it could in many, many cases or some cases simply be a detoxification process and not people catching something.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Well, detoxification protects you, but you can call it a retoxification.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Right. The body's retoxifying trying to get rid of it.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Right. Yeah. The endotoxin or whatever toxin is causing it.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 When you're very healthy, your liver and your brain in particular have detoxifying systems that keep you healthy.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 You don't notice the toxins being destroyed.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 You don't notice the toxins being destroyed.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 So that's why millions of people had no, didn't wear a mask or nothing happened and they just felt fine.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 And it was like any other day. Yeah. Millions. Yeah. Right.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Because the body just deals with whatever it is, stress or whatever.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Yeah. It can eat up germs, inactivate toxins and excrete them, get rid of them. Never knew it had them.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 But it is interesting that there are some people that I've known, two or three that I've known, that during this whole affair, what has it been, what, two and a half years now, that went through three weeks or so,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 taste, smell of some of the worst flu symptoms ever. I mean, they did.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 They thought they were going to die.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Yeah. A lot of it was the same causes of the flu that killed 40 to 60,000 people every winter before COVID.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 The post influenza syndrome was already defined very similar to the post COVID syndrome, leaving permanent fibrosis of the lungs and a general weakening of the organism.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 And even in those numbers, Dr. Rapit, that we see every year, there's no real evidence of how many people had comorbidities that have passed on and they claim it was because the flu or cold, right?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 No.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 I guess what artists originally argued on this show and other shows about the remdesivir, that's pretty nasty stuff, right? It's not good.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 Yeah, it's a gene-destroying material.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 The things that have been used for influenza and herpes treatments that were originated about 30 years ago, those actually had very, very horrible side effects, but they came into use anyway.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Wow. And then, so the amount of people that were actually killed by remdesivir in the ventilators, that could be a big number. We don't know.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Oh, yeah. The fact that the comparison of two hospitals near each other in Germany during the first few months of the so-called pandemic,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 one hospital was influenced by a doctor who administered only the amount of oxygen through a cannula, just free breathing.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 That was clearly beneficial. They had zero mortality from the COVID cases.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Oh, just enough oxygen, not the ventilator.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Yeah. And a nearby hospital that followed the instructions of the World Health Organization and CDC, that hospital had a 60 percent mortality.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 The difference was only that they stuck a tube into their chest and forced oxygen into their lungs. Extremely high mortality once you stick the tube into them.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 And so that in itself was known to be almost always deadly, but prescribed, ordered by the CDC. So it was mass murder for a couple of months.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Are they still doing that? Do you know?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 I'm afraid some places still do.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Are they still doing the remdesivir and the ventilator with all because they just don't get it or they're ordered by the CDC, the standard of care, right?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Yeah, there were many approaches better than remdesivir. Any approach practically was better than intubation.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 What did these alternative things have for this so-called virus, as you say, like hydrochloroquine and what's the other one?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Ivermectin.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Ivermectin and all that. Do they have similar properties? Something could be going on where people felt better?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Oh yeah, they're both somewhat anti-inflammatory. Especially Ivermectin has several anti-inflammatory effects.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 So does aspirin and antihistamines. From the very beginning, people were seeing very good effects from aspirin and antihistamines.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 So aspirin and antihistamines are just anti-inflammatory. Is that why aspirin has been around for the last hundred years or whatever?

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Yeah, but that's very closely connected to an antibiotic and antiviral effect of aspirin. A general, not very specific, but definitely existing antiviral effect.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 But it doesn't go in and kill some so-called virus, right? What does it do with the body? It just helps the body to deal with whatever's going on?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Yeah, when it's acting as an anti-inflammatory, it's preventing disruption of the immune system.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Preventing disruption.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Letting your immune system continue in a highly energized way.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Once you go over the edge into the prostaglandin and cytokine storm degree of inflammation, you've knocked out the energy system.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Instead of producing lots of heat and carbon dioxide and usable energy, you just produce lactic acid and shift away from oxidative processes.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Oxidative processes are necessary for destroying viruses.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Wow, so that's why you feel better when you take aspirin?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Yeah, many, many reasons.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 That's right.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 It, for example, activates your mitochondrial respiration the way thyroid does.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 When we were kids back in the 50s, Dr. Peat, that's really all we had was aspirin and castor oil. That was pretty much it, right?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Yeah, and laxatives use is historical and turns out to be very well based because of the endotoxin thing.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 When you've eaten something that you can't digest or you get constipated, an inflammation begins inside your intestine producing, among other things, lactic acid, histamine, serotonin,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 and those make your blood vessels that should be a barrier against toxins in your intestine, lets them absorb the endotoxin,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 and that lowers your whole systemic body energy and that can lead to death from pneumonia in a week.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Wow, so that's the whole theory behind, or not theory, but the meme behind this whole idea of the immune system and that being in the gut that we've talked about,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 people have talked about for the last 25 years, right?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 That's what's going on and why lots of bowel movements is a good thing.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Moving things out.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 About 150 years ago, pathologists and the coroners recognized bowel inflammation as a major cause of death.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Wow, and the bowel gets inflamed because these endotoxins, when we don't have a sufficient bowel movement in getting things out, it just creates a problem down there, an inflammation, and then it causes all kinds of issues.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Yeah, leading to inflammation of the lungs and brain and so on.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Wow, which is why then you take a big hit of castor oil and wake up in the morning and have a big bowel movement and you feel better.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Well, it's pretty simple.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 There was a big campaign when medicine started becoming organized and modern. There were actual organized campaigns for public relations, getting press conferences and such to convince the public that there is no such thing as a bowel toxin sickness.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Really? And when was this? In the early days, 1900s?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 1920s, early 20s.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And they tried to convince people that it didn't matter how much you pooped.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Yeah, for example, one professor of medicine said that there's no such thing as bowel toxins causing sickness and headaches. He said it's all basically in your mind.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 And to demonstrate that headaches weren't caused by toxins, supposedly, he had his medical students stuff their rectums with wads of cotton.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 And the next day, people who often had headaches reported that they had a headache. So he released the publicity that, "See, we've demonstrated that it isn't poison. It's pressure."

00:33:40.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 And that was just part of it. It didn't say anything at all about toxins in the intestine, but just that whatever the level of toxins exists in the intestine, if you have pressure as well, you're going to get a headache or other sickness.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Sure.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 Animal studies showed that just putting a balloon into the intestine, if the animal is in a good physiological state, you can blow up the balloon and no symptoms occur.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 But if you give them some insulin to lower their blood glucose and then blow up the balloon, the combination of the stress from low blood sugar combined with stretching the intestine will produce all kinds of things, not just headaches, but epileptic seizures, asthma spasms, all kinds of psychosomatic diseases.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 All kinds of psychosomatic changes of circulation and excitation.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Isn't that fascinating?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 An uncle who's long gone from this planet used to say, "Well, I just have a couple cups of coffee and I have my morning constitution to use, and I feel good."

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 You think it's detrimental that people use caffeine to go to the bathroom?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Oh, no, not at all.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 It's normal, it's kind of natural, right?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Yeah, it has lots of other beneficial effects.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 I've had some effects, even a little bit of green tea will even move things around a little bit more than interesting.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 I guess there must be some caffeine in green tea, too, right?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Yeah, a small amount, just weaker than coffee.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 You've never been adverse to coffee at all, right?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 As long as I've talked to you, you thought it was okay, coffee, caffeine?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Oh, sure, yeah.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 It happened when I was four years old.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 I just loved the smell and taste of coffee.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Did you?

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Yeah.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 I believe you've said that coffee is actually something that will get your thyroid going a little bit, too, right?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Yeah, it helps to balance everything.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 Helps to balance everything.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 You can't count on it making up for food.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 No.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 If you drink coffee on an empty stomach, it can give you the shakes and accentuate hypoglycemia.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 So that's why it would be good with food, with breakfast or something like that, right?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 With breakfast, yeah.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 So, before we do a break and get to all the questions, if you have a question for Dr. Peat Patrick on RadioNetwork.com.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 So, on to the bowel thing, do you think there's any cautionary tales with doing different things to keep the bowel movements going two, three, four times,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 however you feel more comfortable, like what is psyllium husk or other things, castor oil?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Is there any problems with getting the body addicted to this stuff?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 Not really.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Some people who have a really inflamed problem find that psyllium husk is dehydrated and can increase the plugged quality.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Yeah.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 But if it works, that's very fine.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 If it works, it works, right?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Yeah, a good bulk-forming, softening material with just a moderate degree of constipation.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Other than that, then lots of, I guess, vegetables are the best?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 I mean, it also does the same thing, vegetables?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 Yeah, as long as they're working, they're improving things.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 But if a certain kind of vegetable makes the constipation worse.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 You just got to outdo it, huh?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Yeah.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Cooked or raw, what's the difference?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 In animal experiments, many years ago, compared canned vegetables with exactly the same vegetables in a raw state and fed them to different groups of rats.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 The rats getting a mixture of canned vegetables thrived all the way through the experiment.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 The ones given exactly the same raw vegetables wasted away.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 No kidding.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 Eventually died of malnutrition.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 What was that about?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Just because so many raw vegetables are extremely indigestible.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 The heat breaks down the structure of the fibrous cellulose mixed with other, like the lignin materials, that we just can't digest.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 And so the nutrients are trapped inside this web of indigestible material.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Wow. So somewhere along the line, us humans figured out, what did we do before we figured out how to cook vegetables?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 We must have done okay?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 Yeah, if you choose the right vegetables to eat raw, you can probably do it just by chewing them thoroughly.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 What are some of the easy ones? Raw?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 I would imagine baby squash are a source of nutrition.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Tomatoes?

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Oh, sure. They're a fruit.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Oh, that's right. They're a fruit. Tomatoes are fruit.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 So that's different fruits.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Do you think we could just live on fruits like tomatoes and squash and botanical fruits and do okay?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Yeah, especially older people who have a very low protein requirement.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 They often thrive.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Someone yesterday emailed me about their father, who 10 years ago was very sick with prostate cancer,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 but he stopped eating ordinary proteins, went vegan, and is now in good health 10 years later.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 No kidding? Really? That's funny.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 It's just that once your metabolism has slowed down, the proteins, you don't need very much at all.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 You just don't need as much.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 The plant materials can provide them, and if you eat more than you need,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 the excess amino acids become antithyroid agents and make your metabolism even slower.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Oh, when you have more protein than you need, it actually slows your metabolism.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 Wow, that's interesting, which is a thyroid thing, right?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 Yeah, about 40 years ago, Broda Barnes decided to do a high-protein diet just for an experiment.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 For years, I think his daily dose of armor thyroid was two grains,

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 and when he went on a high-meat and protein diet, he found that he needed four grains of armor thyroid every day.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Just to keep his temperature stable in the morning.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 Yeah, even in moderate middle age, he felt that effect.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 But the older you are, the more toxic too much protein can be.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 It's probably more difficult after you have about 70, 80 years under your belt to catch a buffalo or something.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 It's probably an evolutionary thing.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Yeah, sitting around eating fruit is an appropriate thing.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 It's a lot easier, right?

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 Yeah, it's a lot easier.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Stay right there. Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, thanks for being on the show, sir.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 It's always a pleasure.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 If you have a question, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 And if you want to do a little thyroid, testosterone.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 The first supplement I like to take in the morning, right after I wake up, is Pine Pollen Pure Potency, or P4.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 This is Cirque Rival's flagship testosterone and androgen support formula.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 It's made with the pollen of pine trees, which is rich in testosterone, androstenedione, DHEA, and a bunch of plant sterols.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 These are all substances, phytochemicals, that support the body's natural androgens, or male hormones.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 Of course, men and women are using this product, but usually it's men in andropause.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 Men after age 40, whose testosterone production has started to decline.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 Many of Cirque Rival's supplements can be taken any time of day, but Pine Pollen Pure Potency, it's important that you take at very specific times of the day.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 Now, it can be taken once, twice, or three times, depending on how much you want to supplement yourself with the phytoandrogens found in it.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 But the key is taking it at morning, right upon waking, midday or noon, and then again right before bed.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 So once, twice, or three times a day, but always at those times.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 And that's because that's when your body's naturally producing its own testosterone.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 And all we want to do is amplify that sine wave.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 We don't want to start to take testosterone at a time where our body's purged it from the bloodstream.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Instead, we want to take it at a time where those levels are already spiking and we're just subtly helping to increase them.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 This product tastes fantastic. I think of it like an orange creamsicle.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 And that's because in addition to that subtle pine flavor, there's a little bit of orange peel, Tahitian vanilla bean, cloves, and then a little bit of maple syrup just to give it this nice kind of sweet orange flavor.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 So it's really delicious and easy to take.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 So if you're looking to increase your testosterone or androgen levels and you want an alternative to pharmaceutical testosterone replacement therapies, there's nothing that does it better than Pine Pollen Pure Pote.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 And we love this product. I've been taking it.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Well, what I do and what you should do are two different things.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 But I can tell you, I've been using it for years.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 It's a food, it's a pollen, and little pine trees do their thing in the spring.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 And pine pollen and all the animals and everybody eats it and who knows.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 It's just a pretty magical substance.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 But this is just one of the many products that Daniel Vitalis has in his store from One Radio Network.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 If you can click on there, and Colostrum is one.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 We love that product. They now have four different colostrums.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and the original, the original, pine pollen, shiaga, and reishi.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 And these are fruited bodies. They're not just, you know, they just really go to some great extent to make these more potent.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 They have a vitamin D, K2, 3 thing.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Also, a digestive bitters products that we love.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Some CBD oil and also a CBD that for your skin, which I just got and I've been playing around with it. I like.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 So, just a great selection of products that I think you'll enjoy.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 And that's at any thrival link on oneradionetwork.com.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Click through our website because we get a little commish when you buy through our website.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 And that helps us to support ourselves.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 As you know, you know, one of the big buzzwords out there right now is inflation.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 And there's a lot of it going around.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 We think the real inflation rate is probably 15, 18 percent.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 Yeah, I know. It's a little about 8 percent more than what the gov is telling you.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 That's for the most part what we believe with the research that we do.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 One of the places we like to go is Shadow Stats.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 This fellow, he does incredible research.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 He's been doing it for a long time and name is escaping me.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 But, you know, it's just much more.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 But you don't need a government or anybody to tell you what the inflation rate is.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Just go to the store and, you know, we, my girl here, Doodle, is lying next to me, a golden doodle.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 She eats raw, grass-fed, organic beef many nights.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Other than that, it's organic raw chicken, either wings or legs.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 And some cornucopia pet foods.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 It's in a can that you can go there.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 We don't have a financial interest in them.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 But cornucopiapetfoods.com, 100 percent absolutely, totally organic.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 And if you want to feed them in the can and it's, you know, it's been cooked.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 But, hey, you can't get 100 percent organic food in a bag in a kibble.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 And we don't recommend kibble.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 It's got a lot of issues.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 I don't care how good it is.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 But anyway, that's here near the here and near there.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 But I was just going to mention before I got so rudely interrupted by my mind,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 is that the meat that we're feeding Doodle has gone up about $1.25 a pound just in the last month.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 A pound.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 So things are moving up.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 The way to protect from inflation, the only way that we know to hedge against inflation is gold and silver.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 Well, platinum and stuff like that.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 But the way, easy way to do it is gold and silver.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 That is the only real money on this earth.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 The rest of it is all just made up.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 Just made up.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 So give Fred a call.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 800-878-2646.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 800-878-2646.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 Fred at U.S. Coin Capital.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 He'll hook you up with whatever you need.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 Just trust me on this one.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 He's got the deal.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 Did you know the DNA of the pearl and we humanoids are very similar?

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 Did you know that?

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 The DNA that's responsible to create the pearl is very similar to how our human calcium metabolism is done.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 So it's very, very interesting.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 That's why the pearl is so good for our skins, for our bones, for even to rejuvenate our bone marrows, rejuvenate our bones, and rejuvenate our skins.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 And also nerve systems and joints, all kinds of muscles.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 And like eyesight, our eyes is a big muscle basically, and also our heart.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 It's very good for the heart.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 It's quite interesting that she mentioned the pearl works to build the bone marrow.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 And in Ayurvedic medicine, they often talked about the idea when you build the bone marrow is when you build beauty and longevity.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Curious.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 Pearl, this is a great product.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 You can brush your teeth with it, and in my opinion, you'll see amazing results on your two feet.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 Really amazing.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 You can take it internally, mix it with face cream.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 Our link on One Radio Network goes to a two pack where you get a great discount.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 But if you only want one to start, just click around and you get yourself one.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 Pearl Sim, click on the ad on the front page, oneradionetwork.com.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 I get lots of compliments for my two feet, and that compliment is just an ego thing, so it doesn't mean anything.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 But I'm only telling you that because you can really see the pearlness of your teeth when you use this product.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 It's great.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 You can take it internally.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 It's not all calcium, but it's heavy calcium and lots of target proteins, and it's from real pearl.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 It's a living thing that Dr. Ruehl and Chu figured out how to--

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 She's a quantum physicist, pretty cool gal, very, very cool lady.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 She's going to be on soon.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 She figured out how to get the pearl and get it into a powder form without messing up the cellular matrix thing.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 Does that make sense?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 She figured out how to do it.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 And so it's not like she's using Mother of Pearl or something that you get on Amazon.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 It's a really nice product, a once-living source product, pearl.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 And it's on our website for your teeth and internally, oneradionetwork.com.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is oneradionetwork.com.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 On the third Monday of each month, around 1130 or so, if I get there on time, which I usually don't,

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 is Dr. Ray Peat, Ph.D.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 He started in the '70s, Doc, is when you really began this, right?

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 School?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 I started graduate school in biology in 1968.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 1968, wow.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 I had gone through a master's program in the late '50s.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 But I worked in linguistics, art, and literature for the intervening eight or nine years.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 So were you out in the street demonstrating against the Vietnam War in '68 like I was?

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 Oh, sure.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 Oh, yeah, we all were.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 Do you know, it's interesting when you think back on that, just for what it's worth.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 I mean, there was some real evidence that us crazy people out in the streets,

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 we actually moved Nixon along a little bit, didn't we?

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 I mean, the evidence shows that they did.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 He got out of there sooner because we were out there.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Sure, yeah.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Yeah, we did.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 Well, I guess for a peaceful protest does a little good now and then.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 Yeah, like the treacherous convoy that's moving things along.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
 Yeah, I think so, too.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 So are you ready for some questions?

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 Sure.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 All right, here we go.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 Let's see.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 Several people in the natural health community say that supplementation with inorganic minerals

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 not directly derived from foods or once living sources--I was going to ask about that--

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 are just kind of unhealthy and can do calcification in the arteries and organs.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 Did Dr. Peat agree with this idea?

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 It would depend on the source.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 A lot of mineral sources are very contaminated, so that's the main argument against them.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 When they're incorporated into living organisms, they're already extremely highly purified,

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 and so they're safe in that form.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 Wasn't the Max Planck people--you know them, Max Planck Institute--years ago suggested that

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 when we take something in from a other-than-living source, it can be detrimental.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Correct?

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 Yeah, there are many studies showing that even the type of isotope within a given element

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 that can be chemically pure in the chemical sense but has the wrong balance of isotopes.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 Isotopes.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 The typical molecule comes in the standard form.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 Sometimes it has an extra neutron, so the atomic weight is a little different.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 Those are just randomly mixed together in the mineral sources.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 But a plant sorts out and prefers certain isotopes over the others.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 So it's the ultimate in finding not just chemical purity, but a bias in the weight of a particular chemical element.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 The weight and the energetics of it from the living is just different.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 Yeah.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 For example, the cane sugar grown in the tropics from the first rain that comes out of a warm ocean has more deuterium.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 It's a heavier form of water, and high deuterium content accelerates the aging process in the early '50s

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 when heavy water was being used in the nuclear industry.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 No one had studied it biologically, so they gave experimental mice deuterium oxide rather than ordinary water.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 They turned gray and got arthritis and deteriorated much faster because of the different isotopes.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 But organisms and plants filter out the preferred isotope for every element that has a significant difference in atomic weight.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 If you use sugar that was grown in the northern, central, or eastern region where the tropical rain has fallen out,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 then coming over the Rockies, for example, the cold temperature squeezes out even more of the heavy water.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 So any water that's left over the northern plains is likely to be very depleted in deuterium.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 So the crops, especially sugar beet grown in those areas, has more light water, which is biologically more compatible.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 Very interesting. What's the deuterium doing in there? That's kind of like a Mother Nature thing.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 Why is she putting deuterium in there? Why would she do that?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 All of the atoms come in more or less a random arrangement of the distribution of the neutrons and protons.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 It's just a random thing?

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 As far as I know.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 Somebody sent me a link to a website from lip gloss that actually has some snake venom in the lip gloss that's used to make the lips more swollen,

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 that the Hollywood people like. Have you ever heard of that?

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 I don't know what that's about. Why would snake venom swell up your lips? I guess it would.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 Anything that causes inflammation.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 Inflammation, yeah. Okay, here's one for you. How to gain weight. I'm a 66 year old female.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 Long COVID digestive symptoms, pain in location of the pancreas, liver fullness, fatigue, have to lie down, too tired to complete more than some of the basic activities,

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 fat malabsorption, fall asleep after eating. Wow. So this lady's got a lot going on here.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 First thing would be to check thyroid function and body temperature.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 Very low body temperature depletes your ability to make energy.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 And so if your body temperature is very low, you would want to have a blood test to see, in particular, TSH, which causes inflammation if it's high,

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 and vitamin D deficiency of which causes inflammation and under metabolism.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:22.000
 Vitamin D deficiency. Right. Do you know a number, like if people want to do a vitamin D test that you like?

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 Oh, yeah. In nanograms per milliliter, it should be around 50 or 60.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 50 or 60 per milliliter.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 Nanograms per milliliter.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 Do you think we can get enough from the sun?

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000
 What was that?

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
 Do you think we get enough from the sun if we're out there on the sun?

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 Oh, yeah. A person who spends, for example, on the beach, a person spending hours a day with a lot of skin exposed to full sunlight will have maybe 150.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:08.000
 Whoa. Yeah, I'm out in the sun a lot. It'd be fun to take it just to see as an experiment, you know, to see what the levels are.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:16.000
 It'd be interesting. There's a place for those of you who are interested. It's called Let's Get Checked, and it's online.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.000
 And they actually will ship you a little thing, and you can get your thyroid TSH test or vitamin D.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
 Very inexpensive. You don't have to go anywhere.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:35.000
 Yeah, some places will charge you more than $200 for a vitamin D test, or should be somewhere in the range of 40 to 60.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000
 Right. I did my TSH doc with them, and it was like 50 bucks or something, TSH.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:52.000
 And again, for those who are new to Dr. Peat's work, and he's done quite a bit on thyroid, your favorite TSH level is?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
 Close to zero.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:00.000
 Close to zero. Right. You are the lowest one than anybody we've ever talked about. Why is that?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:11.000
 I've been attending to the TSH issue ever since it came into use.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:30.000
 First, when Synthroid substituted for Armour thyroid, Armour had been the standard of thyroid potency for about 50 years.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 And then when synthetic thyroxine was developed, a huge advertising campaign convinced doctors that T3 was the only active thyroid hormone.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 So they said scientifically, you should use the pure thyroxine, not the random mix that you find in the Armour thyroid.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:23.000
 They used a blood test, protein-bound iodine, and found that only 5% of the population was deficient in protein-bound iodine.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:34.000
 So they said almost no one needs a thyroid supplement, but when they need it, thyroxine should be the thing.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:46.000
 And using the meaningless protein-bound iodine test all through the 1950s and into the 1960s,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
 they were saying almost no one needs a thyroid supplement.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 And then it turned out that there was absolutely no biological basis for saying that protein-bound iodine had anything to do with your thyroid function.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:20.000
 At that point, they were convinced that T4 thyroxine was the only scientific way to treat thyroid and that only 5% of the people might need it.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:30.000
 And so they discovered very precise ways of measuring TSH using a radio-immunoassay.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 So they picked out 5% of the population who had the highest TSH and said, "That's the number that is justified to give thyroxine to."

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 But it was entirely phony based on a meaningless test that that 5% of TSH was established.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:15.000
 So ever since the 1960s, that has been refined, literally telling doctors to ignore all of the traditional signs of hypothyroidism,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:29.000
 to ignore body temperature, all of the signs like falling hair and problems maintaining the weight, either being too thin or too fat.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
 Ignore all of those, go only by TSH.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 But without looking at the history of it, it might sound scientific in some way, but it's totally irrational.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:05:03.000
 It turns out that TSH directly activates inflammatory systems and a lot of the symptoms of hypothyroidism come from elevated TSH, not from an actual deficiency of thyroxine.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:15.000
 So where are we now? The original one, Armor, was the good stuff, right? That was the best?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
 Armor, yes.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
 But that's no longer available, correct?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:30.000
 It's still available, but when the Armor company sold out in the early 90s, they had been testing every batch.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:43.000
 They had both pork thyroid, beef thyroid, and a mixture, and every batch was tested for biological activity on mice.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:52.000
 So it was refined right down to 1% of effect on metabolic rate.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
 It was scientifically ultra-precise.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:08.000
 During those years when the synthroid people were saying, "Don't use a natural product, it isn't scientifically refined enough,"

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:19.000
 during those years, there were times when the thyroxine activity of synthroid was off, I think, by as much as 40%.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
 Wow.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 So Armor and Synthroid are the two choices for folks now who get prescriptions, right?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
 Oh, yeah. There are lots of synthetic thyroxines.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 Okay.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:47.000
 Most of the mixed synthetic products have been discouraged, taken off the market.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:59.000
 But the one that's the closest, it was based on the typical Armor ratio of T4 to T3.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
 That's CINO Plus.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
 CINO Plus.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 A 4 to 1 ratio of T4 to T3.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
 And you can get that in this country, or is that a Mexican thing, CINO Plus?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000
 Mostly, it's, I think, made in Mexico and is popular in Latin America and somewhat in Europe.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:22.000
 So if you had to take it, wanted to take it, that's what you would go for, the CINO Plus?

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:31.000
 Yeah. I wouldn't hesitate to take Armor, even though they really don't pay attention.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
 You get a little fishy with the numbers, huh?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
 Yeah.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
 So now when you see there's some products out there over the counter,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
 well, you can get them through docs, but not necessarily totally over the counter,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
 where it says bovine, I have something here I had on the shelf.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
 It says bovine, L-Y-O-P-H-I-L-I-Z-E-D.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 Yeah.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 What's it mean?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
 Freeze-dried.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
 Freeze-dried bovine.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
 What's in here?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
 You don't really know.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 You don't really know.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000
 The people making it aren't aware of the history of the Armor definition.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:29.000
 And at first, at the end of the 19th century, the thyroid was used in a fresh form, not freeze-dried.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 And in that form, it was two-thirds water.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:43.000
 And so when they dehydrated the gland without altering it except to take out the fat,

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:53.000
 the Armor product was extended with lactose bound into a pill.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 And they added about two parts of lactose for every part of powdered thyroid,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 so that it had the same weight ratio to potency that the fresh gland had,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
 because it was a widespread standard of dosing.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000
 So when they say one grain dose, it was for 50 years the world standard.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
 Armor meant it was basically one-third active.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
 And so if you used the pure powdered glandular, it was called 3X,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 because it was three times as strong as the fresh or the extended product with lactose.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:57.000
 But now the concept of 1X or 3X is used only by chemical suppliers like Aldrich and Sigma.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 You use those categories.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
 But the people selling it don't know what they're selling, basically, whether it's 3X or 1X.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
 So you might get super strong stuff or very weak stuff.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000
 So if you wanted to go that route, you would just have to take it and see what's your body temperature

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
 and see how you feel and your metabolism, right?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:28.000
 Yeah, which always had to do with Armor anyway, because everyone has a different requirement.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
 Right, right.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:39.000
 So is there--do you know any sources of just a bovine or pig that are just not desiccated or freeze-dried,

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
 that are just like a powder you could take?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 Yeah, but I don't know of any way to be sure whether you're getting 3X or 1X.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 You don't know.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
 Or maybe one-tenth X.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
 The Sino Plus, I used to have some of those.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 I sent those to a friend that needed it.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
 I didn't need it any longer.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
 But they were just little guys, if I remember, right?

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
 Little tiny ones?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
 Yeah.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
 And how many grains are in that one?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.000
 About two-and-a-third, I think, of grains equivalent to one tablet.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
 So it's right up there, right?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
 So that's 60, 120, maybe 150 or 160 or 70, right?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 Something?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000
 Yeah, and so people often not realizing how potent they are, very often overdose on their Sino Plus.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 You should start with an eighth of a tablet.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
 Yeah, and just kind of work your way up.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:43.000
 So just to wrap up on thyroid, if people wanted to need to get their TH level down there to close to zero,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.000
 they're going to do okay, in your opinion, with the Synthroid or Armor, right?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:12:02.000
 Well, with Synthroid, women are much less able to activate by roxam turning it into T3.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
 So they'd be better with Armor, the ladies?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
 Yeah.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 Wow.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
 What a land...all these landmines out there, Doc.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 How do people figure this stuff out?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:23.000
 Unfortunately, the researchers generally have failed to notice that because of estrogen level,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:31.000
 women's livers are much less likely to fully activate the thyroxine.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 And so sometimes a woman can get more and more hypothyroid, the more thyroxine they take,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.000
 because it begins diluting the T3 that came out of their own thyroid gland.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:57.000
 And if their liver is blocked by estrogen, they can get worse by taking more thyroxine.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
 That's just...wow, just crazy.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
 You would think, Dr. Peat, that these people would understand this thing

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
 and really dig into it if you're making these things, wouldn't you?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.000
 You would think it's the same as the propaganda and the virus thing.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
 Yeah, who knows?

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:25.000
 Here's a 68-year-old male who recently had a thumping in his head, ooh, like a faint heartbeat,

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.000
 but it doesn't follow the heart. Rather, the thumps, maybe 240 times per minute.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
 That's a lot of thumping. No other symptoms.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 Does Dr. Peat have any ideas what this could be?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
 Lots of thumps in his head, not going along with his heart.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:57.000
 Basically, I don't know, but I've experienced some things and found that occasionally there would be a resonance

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 with something that I wasn't hearing through my ears, but by resonating through my sinuses,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:15.000
 something in the environment that happened to be vibrating at a different frequency from my heart.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:24.000
 I would hear this ticking, wondering why my heart rate was doing one thing

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
 and the ticking in my head was doing something else,

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
 and found it turned out to be something in the environment just resonating with my head.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.000
 Dr. Peat, do you have an opinion regarding Dr. Lester Morrison's research

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 indicating heart disease could be reversed as well as prevented with chondroitin sulfate?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:59.000
 No, I'm very skeptical that that would improve heart disease.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:07.000
 Heart disease, as you know it, it's more of something going on right with the heart muscle

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000
 rather than atherosclerosis, correct?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:20.000
 Oh, no. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory condition that affects your heart at the same time as the blood vessels.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 But people have removed the plaque and chemically stained it and found that it's full of breakdown products

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.000
 from polyunsaturated fat, age pigment basically.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
 Pufus. The culprits again, Pufus.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.000
 Do we get too many Pufus more than we want just by eating fish?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.000
 Yes, you eat too much fish. That's why I advocate only the low-fat fish.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 Low-fat fish, which are, what are some of your low-fatters?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
 Cod and sole.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
 Cod and sole are the best ones. Cod and sole.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
 That's why the salmon, they got a lot of Pufus in there, right?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
 Yeah, good old Pufus.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000
 Let's see, here's someone.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 Okay, I don't understand this one. Sorry.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:50.000
 I read that it takes about 40 to 56 days for skin cells to turn over from stem cells to disquamination off the surface of a follicle,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:55.000
 hypokeratosis, and I started supplementing vitamin A for it.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
 I'm sorry, did you understand those words?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 Yeah.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:10.000
 In Dr. Peat's experience, how does vitamin A supplementation, how long does it take to clear skin problems like follicular hypokeratosis?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:30.000
 I've had experience with the leukoplakia, which is on the moist surfaces, for example, inside your cheeks.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:44.000
 They're waterlogged and they can stick out so you bite your cheeks unavoidably, but that's considered a precancerous condition.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:18:06.000
 I found that whenever I was extremely deficient in vitamin A, I would get leukoplakia, and so I tested it with if I took 50,000 or 100,000 units of vitamin A, just for two or three days, it would disappear completely.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:13.000
 So it depends on how deficient you are and what caused your deficiency.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 Estrogen happens to accelerate the turnover and the formation of the dead keratin state of the cells, and vitamin A has an anti-estrogen effect on the skin, slowing the turnover, creating less of the dandruff effect.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:43.000
 It's very easy to see on the wet tissues like the uterine cervix.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 Leukoplakia is sometimes an excuse for doing a hysterectomy, but just putting vitamin A on topically in just a few days, same as inside your mouth,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 it can totally abolish the white abnormal cells.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:18.000
 Lawrence wants to know, he says I'm 56, good health, but every now and then I get a little purple kind of a dot or a square on my forearm.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
 What could this be?

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
 Oh, weak capillaries.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
 Weak capillaries.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
 That's kind of a young age for it happening.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 In 80 or 90 year olds, it becomes very common, so that a 90 year old will typically have those from red to brown splotches covering their surface fairly well.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 What are some things that Lawrence could take to strengthen his capillaries?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:11.000
 Keeping your cortisol low, avoiding unopposed estrogen causes your adrenals to overproduce cortisol and underproduce DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:23.000
 Keeping your cholesterol up as a precursor to pregnenolone and DHEA, that toughens all of your connective tissues and your capillaries.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000
 Keep Mr. Cholesterol up so he'll have lots of eggs, good?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.000
 Well, yeah, carbohydrates are how we make cholesterol.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 Carbohydrates, not the eggs, carbohydrates.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:47.000
 Well, it takes lots and lots of eggs to raise your serum cholesterol for just a moderate amount of extra carbohydrates can do it.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
 Like oats or rice?

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
 Yep, just making sure they're well cooked so they digest easily.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
 Very interesting.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
 Fascinating. This is great fun.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:07.000
 Any remedies for inguinal hernia surgery is not an option?

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
 I-N-G-U-I-N-A-L, hernia. What is that?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:26.000
 Oh, again, DHEA falling in relation to cortisol is going to weaken all of your connective tissues.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:42.000
 And the vitamin D deficiency, it isn't just the bones that are strengthened by adequate vitamin D, but all of the connective tissues and muscles are weak in the vitamin D deficiency.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 And so, first thing is to make sure you're getting enough calcium and vitamin D, and then if that's adequate, then check to make sure you don't have an excess of cortisol and estrogen relative to the pregnenolone and DHEA.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 And what are some things that people do to get too much estrogen? What do they eat?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
 Stress, basically.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
 Pretty much stress.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:21.000
 Hypothyroidism, B vitamin deficiency can do it, various kinds of poisoning.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:29.000
 Is there any downsides to taking a little extra vitamin D just to make sure you're topped up? Is that a problem?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
 I don't think so.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
 No?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
 Five thousand units a day.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
 Five.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 Some doctors say that's excessive, but I've never seen anyone get a very high blood level from it.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
 You've never seen a problem with that?

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
 No, I've never seen anybody get a very high blood level from five thousand.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:52.000
 What can be done for scoliosis? Is protein involved as well as calcium and vitamin D?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:55.000
 Yeah, and thyroid.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 And thyroid. Ah, that old thyroid again, boy.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:07.000
 So that's the deal. You want to get that TSH down to near zero, as close to zero as you can, Doc, right?

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
 I think so, as long as you're eating well.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
 Um, can you explain a little bit?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:25.000
 If you take a lot of thyroid, you can get your TSH down very low, but also your metabolic rate is increasing,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:32.000
 and so you have to make sure you're getting enough of the vitamins and other nutrients.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
 I see. Mm-hmm.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
 Okay, here is somebody, let's see.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:47.000
 Huge blister on the front of my shin, just above the ankle.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.000
 It has been at least nine months and it's still red, even though the liquid has drained out.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.000
 Now there are small red spots. Rash kind of looks like tiny red pimples.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.000
 Um, hmm, any ideas what I could do? Could this be some kind of toxin coming out?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
 Uh, or possibly an infection.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:19.000
 I think it should be tested. Have a doctor take swabs and such to see what's happening.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
 See what it is. Right.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000
 Hold on, my mouse is not working. Do something. Hold on.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 My email thing just crashed, don't mind me. Here we go.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:44.000
 Um, hi Patrick, we asked Dr. Peat what he thinks of berberine for diabetes to lower blood sugar. Berberine.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
 What was the word?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:54.000
 Berberine, B-E-R-B-E-R-I-N, lowering blood sugar.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
 I don't recognize that word.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.000
 I've seen that somewhere, but I don't know what it is either.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
 Berberine, berberine, no? Hmm. I don't either.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:17.000
 Um, how much total phosphorus intake matter if the diet has a good calcium-phosphorus ratio?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
 Is a low phosphorus diet preferable to a normal phosphorus diet

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 if the calcium-phosphorus ratio is exactly the same in both cases?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:39.000
 If it's, if both of them are extremely low, then it's possible to be deficient in both of them.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
 But in the normal range, it's the ratio that counts most.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:55.000
 Mm-hmm. Um, you know, last month you had mentioned that you were dubious about a lot of the creams, right?

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
 The bio-identical hormone creams?

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
 Oh yeah.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
 Yeah, boy, we had a lot of emails about that saying that, I don't think, here's one,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 my group uses a biometric hormone replacement protocol that replicates the youthful rhythms,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000
 and the hormones or creams based in the woman is intact.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000
 They will, so there's people that are suggesting that maybe that they do okay on these.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:36.000
 Uh, yeah, even if it's going to cause cancer, it might make you feel okay for 10 or 20 years.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 But you really should think ahead what's happening and look at the research historically on what the safe levels and rhythms are.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:07.000
 For example, all through the 1940s, experiments were being done on the rhythm of estrogen effect in relation to cancer.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000
 If you gave even a very small dose of estrogen continually,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:23.000
 it had a very high rate of questionization of all of the organs and tissues.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:30.000
 But if you interrupted it regularly, about once a month, then it was harmless.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:44.000
 And the function of progesterone is to knock out the estrogen system, stopping the synthesis and the receptor response to it.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:51.000
 Once a month prevents cancerization of all of the tissues.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
 So that's something that I didn't dig into last time when you mentioned that.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:05.000
 It wasn't necessarily that they weren't absorbing, but it was the potential cancerous effects on the topical progesterone, correct?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:12.000
 Yeah, and you really should look at your blood levels.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:29.000
 But even the blood levels in a deficiency of progesterone, the enzymes that regulate estrogen are inactivated.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:42.000
 Progesterone activates the enzymes that attach substances to estrogen and make it inactive and excreted.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000
 And at the same time, progesterone is inactivating estrogen.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:58.000
 It's knocking out the estrogen receptor and turning off the aromatase enzyme that makes estrogen.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:10.000
 So there are close to 10 different enzymes regulated by progesterone with an anti-estrogen effect.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:23.000
 And so if your progesterone is inactive, the enzymes that are excreting estrogen don't remove it from cells.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:32.000
 And so the estrogen inside cells can go wild, leading to cancer.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
 But it doesn't show up in the blood because it isn't being excreted.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
 It's being formed right in the tissue.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:52.000
 The uterus and the breast, for example, were thought of as target tissues for estrogen coming from the ovaries.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:05.000
 But in rat experiments, if you take out the ovaries, wait a week, the serum estrogen is just as high as it ever was.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:18.000
 Because in the absence of progesterone, all of your tissues begin secreting, forming and secreting estrogen.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:32.000
 But the uterus and breast, instead of waiting to be stimulated by ovarian estrogen, in the absence of progesterone,

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000
 they begin forming their own estrogen locally.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:47.000
 So in endometriosis, for example, the uterus begins forming estrogen.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
 That doesn't have to depend on the ovarian estrogen.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:02.000
 And a thyroid deficiency and a progesterone deficiency will increase endometriosis and eventually cancer

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:09.000
 by the internal uterine production of too much estrogen.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
 Same in the breast. The breast tumor begins producing its own estrogen.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
 It doesn't need getting estrogen from the blood.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:27.000
 So that's why you have often recommended just a little dab for men and women, if I'm correct.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:34.000
 This progest-D is the one that you kind of developed internally, right?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:42.000
 Yeah, it should be used intermittently for about half to two-thirds of the month

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:55.000
 against a background of adequate vitamin D and thyroid so that you aren't overproducing estrogen in the so-called target organs.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:03.000
 Ab muscle, uterus, breast, everything can take over the production of estrogen.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:14.000
 And so it's very hard to imagine how any tissue could conceivably suffer from an estrogen deficiency

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:21.000
 because when it's under stress, not getting adequate thyroid and progesterone,

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
 every tissue can become a source of estrogen.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
 My goodness, wow.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:35.000
 Catherine is in Canada. She says, "I'm 35. I had my appendix removed at the age of 9, ruptured.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:42.000
 I've read that the appendix is an immune organ and is involved in replenishing good gut bacteria,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
 digesting fiber, and helping to produce fatty acids.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:58.000
 I'm curious what this might mean for my metabolic health and how to maximize my health, digestion, and immune function without this organ."

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.000
 Yeah, every little bit of the body matters.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:12.000
 You can get along without various parts, but not as well.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:18.000
 And so you just have to pay a little closer attention to eating digestible foods,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:27.000
 keeping your thyroid and vitamin D and general nutrition at an optimal level.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 But considering everything, the lack of an appendix is a terrible problem.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
 Okay, good.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:52.000
 I heard Dr. Peat mention on a past show that a stressful event can just turn the thyroid off,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:58.000
 the trauma of a daughter who has gone through a stressful period.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
 When younger, her thyroid is turned off, very low body temperature, hormonal issues, depression.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 She's living in the country where there's no way to get any thyroid supplements or progesterone, as Dr. Peat usually likes.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
 So are there some natural things to help to get her thyroid working again?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
 Well, I mean, you can get things through the mail, right, Dr. Peat?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
 Oh, sure.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000
 So, yeah, you can go by his advice and just get things in the mail.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
 I mean, this Cynoplus, what's the name of that place in Mexico, the Cynoplus, do you remember?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
 Oh, yeah, there are two stores.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:44.000
 One, the original Farmacia Del Nino up near the border, it's a little corner pharmacy.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
 Very helpful people you can talk to on the phone.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000
 And there's a big pharmacy in Mexico City, which took advantage of the name,

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:04.000
 but they changed it to Farmacias with an S, Del Nino dot MX.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:14.000
 And they have the advantage of being close to an international airport, so they can give slightly faster service.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.000
 I see. So we had the original, the Farmacio Del Nino, that's near the border, a small one.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
 And then the, how do you spell Farmacio? How are we spelling that?

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
 F-A-R-M-A-C-I-A.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:34.000
 Del Nino dot MX for the big one, right?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
 With an S, Farmacias.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 Oh, they changed the name to an S, good for them. I see.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
 And CINO plus. But again, you got to be careful, that's two and a half grains.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
 So you just don't want to go popping this.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:56.000
 It's really good to learn a moderate amount about thyroid function.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000
 You'll very likely in a day or two know far more than your doctor knows.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
 That's right.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
 Here's another one from Canada. We have a lot of Canadian listeners.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat what would cause the increased tendency to flush?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
 Flushing seems to increase throughout the day and is worse by the end of it, where I have a constant red glow.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
 Histamine? Exclamation point? Roshida?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:34.000
 Yeah, and low thyroid people often have that extreme ability to release histamine.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
 They've got red ears and red cheeks and so on.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000
 Can you ask Dr. Peat what recommends a thyroid if we don't want to do the Mexican?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
 I think we've been over that, right?

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
 You can get bovine thyroid desiccated, but then you don't know.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
 Do they have the mix in those things? I don't think I've asked you.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
 The T4, T3, we just don't know how strong they are? Is that the downside?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:10.000
 Yeah, if it's the actual glandular material, the ratio will be somewhere between 3 to 1 and 4 to 1.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:22.000
 But the question is how pure it is and whether it has been diluted and standardized.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:33.000
 So it's very good to be cautious and take maybe something like 15 milligrams of the powdered material.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:39.000
 Just a little bit for a test and see how you feel and get your body temperature.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
 So the body temperature is really mission critical.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:54.000
 This is something you can do first thing in the morning. Is this a very good, and you use your words, marker for thyroid function?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.000
 Yeah, temperature and heart rate first thing in the morning.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:07.000
 First thing in the morning. And the temperature normal or where we want it, minimum, what is it, 97.7?

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
 Something around that.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000
 Around in there, yeah.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 And then after eating breakfast, it should fairly quickly come up to 98.5 and later in the day, it's okay if it gets to 99.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
 Do you think breakfast is important, something substantial?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:39.000
 Carbohydrates, since your morning cortisol is almost always high, it's a response to low blood sugar during the night.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:47.000
 The more you use up your stored glycogen during the night, the higher your morning cortisol is going to be.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:55.000
 And so getting it down quickly with something like orange juice or oatmeal is a good idea.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.000
 Oh, so orange juice actually gets the cortisol down?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
 Getting your blood glucose back up.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000
 Getting your blood glucose back up, but what about that high cortisol in the night?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
 It's going to take the oats to do that?

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:22.000
 If your thyroid and progesterone are good, you can make it through eight or ten hours of sleep without getting hypoglycemia.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:28.000
 But some people wake up in the night and have some milk and orange juice.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:39.000
 Boy, I tell you what, I don't know what it is, but for me, if I wake up in the middle of the night and do some raw goat's milk, just warm it a little bit, it's like manna from heaven, Doc.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
 Yeah, it's ideal.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:46.000
 And I put sugar in it, too, the organic beet sugar.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
 It's very good.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
 A couple more, then we'll let you go.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
 Let's see, Dr. Peat talks a lot about milk.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.000
 Milk is milk estrogenic. Cows are injected with artificial hormones to produce more milk.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
 What effects do these hormones have on the human?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
 All traces of harmful pesticides, herbicides are found in milk.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
 Well, you can get good milk, though. You don't have to get milk with all shut up, right?

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:19.000
 Yeah, a lot of places now make it evident that they don't give their cows hormones.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
 Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:28.000
 Robert wants to know, is it possible to reduce the enlarged prostate?

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
 Oh, yes, thyroid and aspirin will generally do it fairly quickly.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
 Thyroid and aspirin, good old, good old aspirin.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
 And making sure your vitamin D is okay.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:46.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks so much. We kept you a little long, but we had so much fun.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.000
 Thanks for being here, and tell folks about your website, which is drrayPeat.com, right?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
 Or raypeat.com.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
 Yeah.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.000
 RayPeat.com, and your newsletter is rayPeatsnewsletter.com.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
 RayPeat's newsletter is gmail.com.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
 Gmail.com.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000
 And you're doing about three, four, six times a year now on those?

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
 Four times a year now.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
 Four times a year.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
 So it's only $10 a year.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
 What a deal.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
 Dr. Peat, thank you, sir.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
 Thank you. Bye-bye. You take care.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
 All right.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000
 What a nice guy. Oh, man, I'll tell you what.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.000
 Yep.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
 When I grow up, I'm just going to be Dr. Ray Peat.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
 I don't want to do that. Come on.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
 Hold on a second.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
 Oh, come on.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
 Give me a break here.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
 What's going on?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
 There it is.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
 I don't know what happened there, but my finger had a bad hair day and my mouse.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:10.000
 Well, what a wonderful fellow he is.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
 I think we got to most of them.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.000
 We got most all of them today.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
 Okay.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
 Well, we're going to go where no man has gone before.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
 Well, actually, a lot of people have gone before.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000
 But we're going to talk to Dr. Brian Artis tomorrow on the 19th.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
 Would it be the 19th of April?

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.000
 And dig into the Bell Venom thing.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
 But the more and more we see it--well, we'll just get into it tomorrow.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
 There's no sense talking about it now.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
 But I think he's a good man.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
 I know he is.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000
 He really broke the deal on the resveratrol thing.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000
 I think there's a lot of things that were going on with the production company of this "Watch the Water" video

01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:02.000
 that were beyond Dr. Artis' control, which is what I began to understand.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
 So everything's good.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
 There's no snake venom in the water.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
 No evidence of that.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:14.000
 Now, what's in the injections and the vaccines of remdesivir, we'll talk to Dr. Artis about that tomorrow.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:21.000
 But there's nothing in the water other than all the yuck stuff that's been in the water for the last 50 years.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
 And chlorine and whatever.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
 So clean up your water.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:31.000
 A lot of people say the best thing to do is just distill it.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000
 There's also a lot of viewpoints on everything.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000
 The other viewpoint is to reverse osmosis, or if you distill it, to structure it up again.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:51.000
 We, us, we take distilled water and we bubble it in our hydrogen-browns-gas machine,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
 which I didn't even mention today, which I'll get a little plug in before we go.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:05.000
 This is the water that we drink, and we think it's the best because it just, it structures it beyond anything anything's going to do.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
 And this is the water that we drink.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000
 It's molecular hydrogen water through the browns-gas machine.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
 Browns-gas machine.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
 And this is the Aquacur machine.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
 Promo code 1RADIO, 20% off.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
 This is the only water that we drink now.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:29.000
 You can make it easy in about 10 minutes, and you can drink as much as you want.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:36.000
 And it's especially good to drink this water a lot of it before you eat, about half an hour.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
 It gets everything happening in Mr. Tummy.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:45.000
 Promo code 1RADIO, 20% off in the Aquacur Browns-gas machine.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:58.000
 Now, you're going to find, you will find, many, lots of browns-gas, well, no, you're going to find lots of hydrogen machines out there,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:08.000
 very few browns-gas machine, and that's just a leveraged hydrogen machine that George figured out how to do.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:14.000
 It's got the fourth phase of water thing that Dr. Pollack has talked about.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:20.000
 This is why this water is very hydrating, extremely hydrating, hydration, hydrogen.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:23.000
 Whoops, how does that work?

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000
 And we think it's the best water ever to drink.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:35.000
 You can make all the water you want and then breathe the gas, and we do both, and get this machine 20% off.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000
 They're a little backed up there, so you're not going to get it in a week or so, but he's doing better.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000
 People are getting it quicker than we thought.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:50.000
 You can order it right now, the Browns-gas hydrogen machine, Aquacur machine, George Wiseman.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:57.000
 As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by my mind, there's a lot of machines out there.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:05.000
 Most of them are just hydrogen, not browns-gas, and they are, some of them are less expensive.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:17.000
 And just beware, George has a lifetime warranty, lifetime warranty, a one-year no questions asked money back warranty,

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.000
 and also safety features on his machine that very few people have, I don't have any.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:33.000
 And hydrogen is a very powerful molecule, hydrogen buses, hydrogen balloons.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
 You know the Hindenburg that blew up?

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:44.000
 This machine is not going to blow up, he's got lots of safety features, they're very safe,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:52.000
 and he's got safety features, they'll turn off if anything goes silly, or they get low or high.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
 So, you can get one cheaper, but I don't recommend it.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:06.000
 Recommend ours, the Aquacur machine, on OneRadioNetwork.com, promo code OneRadio, 20% off.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000
 Failed to plug that during Dr. Peat.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000
 Oh, black helicopter.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:27.000
 We don't hear a lot of helicopters around here. There it goes.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
 All right kids, we'll see you tomorrow, Brian Artis and then George Altgeld.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:40.000
 We're going to be talking a lot about food, growing your own food, but also some of the yes/no maybes in the food supply that maybe we want to think about.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
 I will see you tomorrow, I love you all very much.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.000
 Thank you for your ongoing support, definitely appreciate it.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:54.000
 Don't forget, today's tax day, midnight tonight is your deadline if you want to file your taxes

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.000
 and not pay any penalties on any money that you owe the boys.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.000
 As I've said many times and I'll continue to say, taxes are totally unconstitutional,

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:10.000
 they're taken by force, but do it because they'll clean out your bank account or come and get your money

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000
 and your eldest child if you don't.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
 Just do it. I love you.
