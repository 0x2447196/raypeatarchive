00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.520
 - Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.400
 Know the source, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.440
 - Well, a very pleasant good morning to you.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.600
 Oh, well, let's turn my microphone on.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.600
 Hold on a second.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.120
 (laughs)

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.240
 I got a little control here

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.440
 that we turn off during the weekend.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.120
 Yeah, it is.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.000
 Well, here we are.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.240
 Very pleasant good morning to you.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.360
 This is Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.280
 Hi, it is the 21st of December, quite a day.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.240
 The summer or the winter solstice, rather,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.580
 the longest day of the year.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.820
 Beginning tomorrow, the days will start to get longer.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.840
 This is pretty cool.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.800
 Some very interesting things

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.840
 astrologically going on around this time.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 You can look into the night sky tonight

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 around 7 p.m. Central, and you'll see the moon there.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.160
 And then if you go down to your right,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 to your right, make a little catty corner,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 to your right, you'll see that Jupiter and Saturn,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.000
 the two largest planets in the solar system,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.280
 will appear closer together

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 than they have ever been since the Middle Ages.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 1226 is the last time they were this close together.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.800
 And a lot of the astrological people are saying

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.360
 this is a really cool thing.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.880
 You have the Star of Bethlehem thing happening today,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.840
 and then also the summer solstice.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.240
 And this conjunction will take place

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200
 in the low western sky about an hour or so

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.480
 after sunset, where you are, if you'd like to check it out.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.680
 1226.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.240
 I looked it up, King Henry III was the dude,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.040
 the main dude, back the last time that these guys were close

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.080
 as close as they are today.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 And a lot of the astrological people

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.620
 that are looking at Corona,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.880
 the fight for Republic going on right now,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.200
 which is the hugest thing, in my opinion,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.200
 what has happened to this country since the Revolution,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.220
 as our Republic is kind of hanging by a thread,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.240
 and there's about one month to go

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.040
 before the thread will break.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.480
 And the astrological people,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.120
 and a lot of the people that we're following,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.380
 our sources are saying,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.720
 just, you know, it's not over till the fat lady sings,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.720
 and she's very hoarse right now, the fat lady.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.240
 Okay, so we're honored to have Dr. Ray Peat on

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.240
 as our last show for the year.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.960
 We're gonna be taking some time off

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.800
 after this show, up until around the fifth,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.640
 when Anna Bergstrom will be here,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.880
 and we're gonna finish up our screenplay

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.520
 and just rest up a little bit.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.880
 It's been quite a year for all of us

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.200
 who have looked into the movie out there

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.320
 we call "Physical Reality,"

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.160
 and hard as we may try,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.400
 many of us got caught up in a little bit,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.200
 and that'll kind of wear you out.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.880
 So we can all use a little rest,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.120
 but we're gonna have all kinds of different

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.440
 archive shows up here,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.640
 just a little bit of business

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.600
 before we introduce you to Dr. Ray Peat,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.280
 who's one of our faves, very popular,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.280
 renowned nutritional counselor.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.320
 Been at it for a very long time,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.240
 it's about late 60s,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.440
 but we'll introduce you to Ray Peat in a minute,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.240
 just a little bit of business here.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.240
 We are totally phased out of Facebook.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.960
 We are going to be canceling that account

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.720
 at the end of the year, in about two weeks.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.560
 We're moving over to Parler and MeWe,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.920
 and so if you'd like to connect with people of like minds,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.640
 MeWe's a good place to do it.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.640
 Just go to MeWe, Patrick Timpone.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.900
 You can connect up with people.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.160
 Just has to be friends with us,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.720
 or whatever they call it,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.300
 but it's public to everybody,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.360
 and then you can communicate with people.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.920
 And then we're doing some posting on Parler,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.340
 which is more like a Twitter thing,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.000
 where you just post different articles

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.980
 and videos that we come across

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.720
 from some of our sources,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.580
 and some insights,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.720
 but mostly the MeWe thing is more like Facebook,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.360
 and then we've gravitated off of YouTube,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.460
 so we won't be censored out there.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.220
 All of our videos are on One Radio Network.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.020
 Just go to One Radio Network,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.560
 click on Videos,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.680
 and you'll see all the video shows there.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.760
 Not quite all of them yet,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.000
 but we'll be getting them all up in the next week or so.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.960
 So we're bypassing YouTube,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.300
 because they've been censoring us,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.480
 and Facebook, they're old news.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.680
 So there we are.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.440
 That's gonna be where we'll hit the ground running

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.880
 in the first of the year,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.080
 and we're gonna have some very cool people

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.320
 on the first of the year.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.280
 A doctor who has co-authored

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.080
 a very landmark study on vaccines,

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.120
 and showing that the kids who are unvaccinated

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.120
 are healthier than the vaccinated kids.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.720
 He's going to be here next.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.500
 His name is Dr. Wheeler.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.240
 Next, the first week in January.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.120
 Also, Martin Armstrong,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.080
 fellow we've been trying to get on for a very long time.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.960
 Fred Dashefsky in the real world of money.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.040
 Judy Mikovitch is going to be here

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.960
 in the beginning of January.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.960
 She's the one that came out with information about Fauci

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.560
 and the whole AI/AIDS pandemic.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.000
 And then Ralph Moss,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.840
 he is a PhD and the author of the book,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.960
 "Cancer Incorporated," coming up in the first of the year.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.840
 So we have a lot of great things coming up.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.640
 Stay in touch with us through our website,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.880
 One Radio Network,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.920
 and then also through those social media places as well.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.420
 Dr. Ray Peat, as we said,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.520
 is here on the third Monday of every month.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.720
 Happy to have him here.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.240
 He's a PhD nutritional counselor,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.000
 and he worked on hormones

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.360
 and really got his start there, specialization in hormones.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.600
 Wrote his dissertation in '72,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.280
 which he outlined the ideas on progesterone and hormones.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.760
 He's here on the third Monday of every month.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.280
 We're pleased to have him.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.280
 And one of his specialties is hormones as well.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.360
 Dr. Ray Peat, good morning.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.180
 Welcome back.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.440
 How are you, sir?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.720
 - Good morning.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.560
 Very good.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.440
 - Yeah, well, nice to have you here.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.440
 As you know, there are not a whole lot of people out there

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.360
 talking about what could be going on

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.960
 in the world of coronavirus, Dr. Peat,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.360
 other than just a few tidbits on Fox News,

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.860
 where they kind of courted the idea

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.400
 that the vaccines could be dangerous for just a few minutes.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.600
 And now we have Senator Rand Paul,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.320
 who's out big time questioning the whole idea

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.480
 of the efficacy of the masks.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.640
 But when we talk about this,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.880
 one of the biggest things we get, Dr. Peat,

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.800
 from people, people in my family and other people

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.600
 who really watch mainstream TV,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.640
 is one of the biggest questions they say to us,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.560
 well, what about all these people?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.340
 What about all these deaths?

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.640
 I mean, look at all these deaths.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.760
 How can you say that this thing

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.160
 isn't what they are saying it is?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.400
 And I know you've been looking into that as well.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.640
 What can you help them with in that regard?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.600
 - I just read an article that was removed

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.440
 from the website because of its dissent,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.600
 but a professor at Johns Hopkins, just a few weeks ago,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.600
 wrote an article looking at the pattern

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.120
 of deaths in the US in 2020.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:48.240
 Genevieve Bright-Briand, I think her name is,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.880
 and it is saying what several of us have been saying

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.360
 since last winter, that essentially nothing special

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.920
 has been happening this year as far as deaths

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.060
 and respiratory disease deaths go.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:16.800
 I looked at the total number of deaths recorded

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.960
 from previous years and compared them to what the CDC

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.260
 had done for each week of this year.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.260
 And they were remarkably historically low for months.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.600
 And it was only in the middle of the summer

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.120
 when a few people had been saying

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.500
 that it's very interesting that the spike of deaths

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.500
 listed in the second week of April for COVID,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.720
 which was the exact week that the listed deaths

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.960
 from influenza dropped sharply just within a day or two.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.760
 People stopped dying of influenza supposedly

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.320
 when the surge of COVID deaths came.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:14.320
 But the quantity missing from all of those weeks

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.360
 before April 12th were just about the same quantity

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.900
 as the number of people in the spike.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.680
 Danny Rancourt had this graph on Dale Bigtree's interview.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:39.080
 He said in the self that was enough to put

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.720
 all of the top people in jail

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.100
 because it's so obvious a fraud.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.200
 But when Genevieve Briand looks at these facts,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.600
 she notices that there was a historical fall off

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:05.680
 in deaths from heart attacks, strokes,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:11.200
 and a couple of the other standard invariable deaths

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.480
 that corresponded to the spike.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.120
 So what they seem to have done is just

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.680
 change the definition of people dying

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.280
 of heart attacks and strokes.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:36.080
 The order went out to, by default,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.560
 if you didn't know what a person died of,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.560
 for example, someone fell off a roof

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.560
 and went in and died and was put in a hospital.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.640
 Put down as a COVID death.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.000
 People with cancer were put down as COVID deaths.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 And nurses photographed the hospital record

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.560
 showing that people who tested negative

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.680
 repeatedly were put down as COVID deaths.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.560
 And at the same time,

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.280
 John Rappaport has done a good article on this.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.480
 At the same time, they ordered people to run

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.480
 the PCR test beyond its capacity of accuracy,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.680
 and far into the range in which it produces false positives.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:41.800
 So they ordered people to expand the testing program

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.800
 using a method that is predicted

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.600
 and known to produce false positives.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.600
 So they were getting people who weren't infected

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:02.440
 very, almost certainly, these false positives

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.320
 were being put down as having the COVID infection.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.520
 And then whatever they died of,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.160
 they were recorded as COVID deaths.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 So I'm just as skeptical as I was in February or March.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.240
 - Even probably more so.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.440
 The New York Times is out this morning, Dr. Peat.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.560
 And I mean, it's just like a tragic finish.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.960
 And they have a graph of the new cases

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.960
 in the United States is per million is way, way above.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.400
 Japan seems to be the lowest.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.040
 And of course, these new cases, as they're said in the news,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.840
 are based on the PCR test.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.320
 Some people are suggesting, Dr. Bhakti,

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.680
 we had on, Suchart Bhakti and others,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.080
 that the PCR could be as much as 95% inaccurate.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.440
 You think that's possible?

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.880
 - Yeah, it's designed to run a maximum of 33 to 35 cycles.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:09.920
 And Fauci ordered it to run more than 40 cycles.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.920
 That's just like jiggling the machine

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.160
 so it puts out some kind of output,

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.840
 even though it has nothing to do with reality.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.360
 - And there was a tape that we ran on our show.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.040
 I don't have it right here, but this was in, I think, July,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.240
 where he was on tape doing an interview

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.600
 and suggested that anything over 30,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.080
 he said possibly 35, but anything over 30 cycles,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.960
 the CT is just showing up dead,

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.680
 I think it's dead nucleotides or dead molecules,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.720
 whatever his term was.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.280
 - Yeah, nucleic acids.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.240
 - Nucleic acids.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.840
 You've been at this a long time.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.880
 Is it surprising?

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.960
 I mean, your opinion of how this thing has managed

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.960
 to go where it goes has gone and still going today.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.920
 - Yeah, and at the first sign of possible

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:19.680
 flu-like epidemic or pandemic,

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.320
 Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:35.440
 said this is better than planetary warming.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.080
 This is just what we need to bring things under control,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.960
 to destroy the legacy economies,

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.640
 to shift over to artificial intelligence everywhere,

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.960
 telemedicine, remote education, remote shopping, and so on.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:04.680
 Get rid of all retail stores, retail schools,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.380
 retail hospitals and medical practices.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.600
 - And many are saying, too,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.240
 we've had quite a few shows, Dr. Peat,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.520
 on the idea that the whole financial system

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.560
 wants to, the term being used is reset, right?

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.400
 And they're using this for that, too,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.020
 and nobody really knows what that means,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.020
 but I'm sure there's a lot of digital stuff in our future.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:34.720
 - Dollars will be outlawed as physical objects.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.280
 - You think so?

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.080
 You think that'll be it? - Silver or gold.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.200
 And you'll have only digital money,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 and at that point, the banks will start copying Japan

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.760
 and charging interest for you

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.640
 to store your money in the bank.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:59.760
 So having savings will be making money for the banks,

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.320
 and your money will be shrinking constantly.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.520
 - Yeah, not keeping up with the inflation,

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.880
 which is, of course, the expansion of the monetary supply,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.280
 right, when they print money.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.760
 - They won't even have to count on puffing up

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.080
 the money supply to shrink everyone's money.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.440
 They can just put it down on the account

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.200
 as the cost of storing your money.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.140
 - Yeah, right.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.000
 Lots of talk, too, about these new digital coins,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.080
 like the FedCoin and the ECB's gonna do one,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.680
 and they want people to get an app, to have an app,

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.920
 and then they'll be able to just give you digits

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.320
 when you need them, you know.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.400
 Well, before we start taking questions,

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.320
 let's move on to the vaccine.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.520
 They've been released, of course, Pfizer.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.620
 Quite a few reports that people are not reporting on,

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.520
 but there's been, I think, 13,000,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.280
 really, what they claim,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.380
 or how do they use the term,

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.960
 significant events with people, you know,

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.400
 that have taken the vaccine, according to news reports.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.000
 - I saw that-- - Did you see that?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.160
 - There'd been three or four cases of Bell's palsy,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.880
 and the FDA said, well, that probably would've happened

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.040
 anyway, even though there were three in the vaccinated people

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.760
 and one in the placebo, but even if it's causing that,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.360
 we have drugs to treat that.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.940
 So, according to the FDA,

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.120
 a few minor things, like the paralysis,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.180
 as long as they have some drug to stop the pain,

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.660
 it's okay with them.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.900
 Well, Suchard Bhakti, who was on the show,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.860
 talked about the dangers of these vaccines,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:16.220
 and his opinion, he's got quite a prominent

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.920
 immunologist and biologist, and he was suggesting

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.500
 that the idea of genetic insertion,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.220
 this RNA, DNA thing, is totally new

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.560
 and has never been done.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.560
 Can you explain to us more clearly about what this means,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.620
 what's really going into these things?

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.080
 Have you looked into that?

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.540
 - Yeah, have you ever heard of the reverse transcriptase

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.220
 enzyme in 1969?

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.060
 - No.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.660
 - I was in graduate school, and at that time,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.340
 professors were actually talking about

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.340
 the central dogma of molecular biology,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:05.540
 which is that information flows only from the DNA gene

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.580
 through RNA into protein.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.940
 Information can never go the other way,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.160
 from protein to RNA, or from RNA to DNA.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.380
 If it went that direction, that would be Lamarckism,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.180
 so absolutely, that's unthinkable.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.700
 - What's the word that would be, what, sir, Lamarckism?

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.540
 - Lamarckism?

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.860
 - What does that mean?

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.860
 - Oh, the non-belief in evolution,

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:43.340
 or evolution by intention, becoming what you intend to be,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.840
 not what random changes impose on you.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.180
 Absolute Darwinism is that everything happens

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.460
 by meaningless chance.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.660
 - Oh, like it's just a random thing,

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:03.340
 but you kind of believe, if I understand your writings,

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.180
 it's not that way, that we are more creating as we go,

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.020
 correct?

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.860
 - Right, right.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:16.460
 So in 1969, when Timmon and Baltimore discovered

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.660
 that there was a retrovirus on the order

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.420
 of what later turned out to be the HIV/AIDS thing,

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:33.580
 they found that this retrovirus consisted of RNA,

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:41.220
 and that it had with it an enzyme that could copy its RNA

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.620
 into DNA and deposit that DNA in our genes,

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:56.300
 and then our own enzymes would forever make copies

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.400
 of the virus.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:03.300
 So in that case, information was flowing from RNA to DNA,

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.260
 and so none of my professors could accept

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.460
 that that was possible.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.660
 - Possible, yeah.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.900
 - Even though I think they got the Nobel Prize

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.100
 for the discovery.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.780
 But now it turns out that, again, the professors hate

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.620
 to even think about this, but it turns out

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:29.620
 that we have our intrinsic enzymes that will turn RNA

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:35.740
 to DNA, exactly what Lamarckism would say we needed

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:41.680
 if we're going to adapt to the world

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.520
 and become what we intend to be.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.060
 These physical adaptations that we make can be recorded

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.700
 in the genes if we have reverse transcriptase enzymes

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.380
 to turn RNA into DNA.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.940
 - Oh, so let me stop you for a second.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.340
 So if I understand then, as soul spiritual beings

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.660
 in these bodies because of our state of consciousness

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.420
 and lifestyle, we mainly affect the RNA and not the DNA,

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.520
 but it's shown that the RNA can work backwards,

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:23.520
 not like you were taught, and that's why epigenetics works.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.180
 - Yeah, yeah. - Is that close?

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:30.180
 - Yeah, that's why the whole idea of epigenetics,

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:34.500
 first it was impossible, then it was only an event

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.500
 that was temporary in the cytoplasm for the moment,

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.980
 then, well, maybe it was passed on to your offspring

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.000
 and then maybe four generations and so on.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.440
 So the whole idea of epigenetics has taken about 50 years

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.260
 to get established halfway.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:00.580
 - Yeah, yeah, and so when we come into this reality,

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:06.780
 do our DNA and RNA carry different things

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.120
 that may be from grandma and grandpa and stuff?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.460
 - Oh, they're probably working on it.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.460
 Definitely we carry the experiences back to probably

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:25.260
 our great-grandparents in animal experiments.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.520
 You can see it for four or five generations consistently,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.900
 how well they ate, for example.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.540
 - Yes, but so just because great-grandpa, though,

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.660
 had a heart issue, it doesn't mean we have to,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.900
 as many of the doctors believe,

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.060
 just simply by changing our lifestyle and we just--

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.100
 - Yeah, good experiences you have

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.280
 will erase the bad experiences.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.120
 - How does that work?

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.800
 Good experiences, that's interesting,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.840
 erase the bad experiences.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.660
 - The injury that happened to your grandparents,

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.660
 for example, will cause changes in their hormones

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:10.660
 and their hormones will affect their reproductive cells.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:16.500
 And this incidentally brings in the exosome

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.300
 virus-like particle thing, Darwin called them gemmules,

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:28.940
 in which the changes that happen epigenetically

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.780
 in our body cells are floating around in the body,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.700
 getting into our germ cells.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:39.700
 But anyway, empirically what we've seen demonstrated

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:45.620
 in the last 40 years is that changes do happen,

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.740
 at least in the hormones, if not in the exosomes.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:55.740
 But the hormonal changes cause the germ cells

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.460
 to be a little different.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.580
 And then the fertilization of these

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.460
 slightly altered germ cells,

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.460
 the organism is implanted in the uterus

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.460
 and the mother's hormonal and metabolic constitution

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:21.180
 is shaping the organism all during

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:23.720
 its nine months of development.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:28.720
 And so her inherited from her parents,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:34.900
 her metabolic abilities are influencing

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:39.900
 the developmental metabolic abilities of the offspring.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:45.800
 So it's all on the level of fluids and hormones

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.640
 and things that have been known for over 100 years.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.680
 These are very obviously going to affect

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.360
 how the pregnancy turns out.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.160
 And so that means that you can intervene in the pregnancy,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.960
 make the pregnancy happier and healthier.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.600
 And of all things, don't shock the immune system

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.740
 of the pregnant woman.

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.740
 But CDC advocates giving flu vaccine, for example,

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.200
 to pregnant women, a murderously insane idea.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:34.320
 Any kind of immunological shock increases

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.600
 autism risk, for example.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.560
 - Interesting.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.600
 So these exosomes you talked about,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.520
 they have been spoken about by people

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.560
 around the world since this whole thing started.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.280
 And they were saying that they were identifying a virus

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.660
 that looks just like these exosomes.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.920
 Can you explain that a little bit

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.060
 and what's going on there?

00:27:59.060 --> 00:27:59.900
 Is that true?

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.960
 - All of them look a little bit different.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.000
 So you can't say they look exactly like them.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 But the particles, the exosomes are roughly

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.560
 a tenth of a micron,

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.040
 about more or less the size of a flu or COVID virus

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.200
 or thousands of other types of viruses.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:27.400
 So in terms of size and the fact that as a rule,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.960
 not always they'll have some RNA,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.520
 maybe a little bit of DNA in them,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.400
 and proteins, hormones.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.920
 Material, generally our exosomes are carrying information

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:53.280
 from a sick cell to a bone marrow cell, for example,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:00.420
 signaling the need for some repair material,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:06.280
 some cells to be manufactured to replace injured cells.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.120
 So the bone marrow differentiates

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.840
 in the direction of the information

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.520
 it got from the injured cells' exosomes

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.480
 and puts out cells which know how to migrate

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.220
 to the area that was injured,

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.040
 the lung or the kidney or wherever.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.880
 - Interesting.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.560
 - It sends in repair cells.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.400
 - Wow.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.480
 - And the repair cells,

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.640
 it happens that cancer is always sending out signals

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.960
 for help to repair the wound.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.920
 And they found that even when they cut out the cancer

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.920
 or poison it out or irradiate it out,

00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:00.600
 the wound area still, or even more so,

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.200
 sends out alarm signals that it needs repair cells.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.280
 So somewhere else in the body, like the bone marrow,

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.280
 produces repair cells which migrate in.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.280
 But now the wound site has been horribly injured,

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.240
 new kinds of inflammation,

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:26.760
 creating problems for the tumor-removed area.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.320
 So the new cells arriving there

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.680
 experience even worse conditions

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.720
 than the removed cells did.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.720
 So it means that whenever you destroy a cancer,

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.720
 you haven't destroyed the conditions in that area.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.840
 So that area is very likely to produce new cancers.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.840
 - Yes, so that's why we see the numbers.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.600
 And oftentimes people who do nothing, no chemo,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.120
 do even better than folks that do that.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.840
 Is that the argument you've just made?

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.680
 - Yeah, and there's very few studies

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.880
 that have looked at the people

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.680
 who chose not to have any therapy,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.720
 found that they lived much longer

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.440
 than the people who immediately went

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.600
 to have the cancer removed.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.440
 - Fascinating.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:28.400
 We then share, if these exosomes are information

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.680
 on how to, are they actually information

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.640
 to help us all evolve?

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.680
 And do we share these exosomes?

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:45.520
 - That has been theorized as the only plausible source

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.760
 of where viruses could come from.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.600
 Because a virus lives only in a higher organism.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.480
 So definitely viruses didn't evolve

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.600
 as an independent pest.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.960
 They had to come from a higher organism.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.960
 So now that we know that higher organisms

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.640
 create their own virus-like particles,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.640
 it's only plausible to assume

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:27.640
 that viruses are derived from these normal exosomes.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:34.320
 But that if a very sick animal

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.680
 is spreading its particles around,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.040
 and another organism,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:47.480
 remotely related organism,

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.080
 picks up these sick particles,

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:55.080
 then its organism, if it isn't in very good health itself,

00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:00.680
 these sick particles might further derange

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.360
 the cells of a sick organism.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.960
 So the whole idea is plausible

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.960
 that exosomes from sick animals

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.680
 can make other animals sick.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.000
 - Yeah, and that would be,

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.320
 maybe, oh, I just splashed on the idea, Dr. Peat.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.960
 Maybe that's why many animals go off on their own to die.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.800
 Maybe they--

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:31.000
 - Yeah, I think that is kind of intuitive, native knowledge.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.160
 - Just to save the tribe, huh?

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.000
 No sense.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 So this corona thing, I mean,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.960
 it's just a coronavirus that's been around.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.960
 And to your opinion, do you think it's any different or,

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:56.040
 I still don't understand where it came from.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.640
 And it's just gonna keep going.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.400
 I mean, you don't kill something like this, right?

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.920
 A virus just, explain it.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.800
 - The coronavirus type is very common,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.800
 and people have been dying from it for who knows how long.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:19.640
 A really bad cold in a person who is otherwise weak or sick,

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:27.960
 a really bad cold has been killing people forever

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.480
 just because it causes inflammation

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.320
 that their body can't deal with.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.480
 - Can't deal with, right.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.480
 - But I think there has been a lot of research

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:47.520
 and there has been some political maneuvering

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.880
 connected with the military research,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.840
 germ warfare research that Richard Nixon

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.960
 supposedly terminated in 1969.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:08.040
 Those labs which had been devoted to creating viruses

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.520
 and bacteria that were especially lethal,

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.280
 they were told to stop producing biological weapons.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.320
 But immediately almost, they went to producing

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.660
 the same organisms but saying, we need to do this

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.960
 because enemies might do it,

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.920
 and we need to create defenses.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.120
 So we have to invent any horrible thing

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.080
 that someone else might invent as a weapon.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.640
 So that, for example, we can test vaccines against it.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.600
 So there was no end to the military germ warfare.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.300
 They just renamed it as vaccine research.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:57.240
 And one of our major vaccine research labs

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:03.500
 continuing this military biological warfare research

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.480
 was Ralph Baric's group

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.300
 at the University of North Carolina.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.240
 And under his name in PubMed,

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.720
 you can find several articles describing

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.720
 the manufacture of viruses of this type

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.720
 and how they picked out a lethal part

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:31.200
 from another virus such as the spike protein

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.200
 which binds to and inactivates our angiotensin receptor.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:42.840
 Angiotensin 1,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:53.400
 I'm not sure that the numbers are so many subdivisions,

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.400
 but anyway, it binds to our defensive angiotensin receptor.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.800
 And it's a degrading enzyme.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.800
 And the activation of inflammation in the body,

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.360
 activating the angiotensin system

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.120
 by knocking out the enzyme

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.480
 that degrades the inflammatory enzyme,

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.200
 that is the chosen mechanism

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.180
 not only for the natural virus,

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.180
 but chosen because it is such a destructive,

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.820
 dangerous feature of a virus.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:37.140
 So it was picked out in the Baric lab

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:42.140
 as a feature to put into their synthetic virus.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:47.220
 And other particular nucleotides in the RNA chain

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.820
 were manipulated.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.500
 One or two nucleotide changes at a time

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.500
 to improve the ability of the virus to infect human cells.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:08.420
 Last I saw these articles were still up on the internet.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:15.420
 So there was no question that a virus of this type

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.020
 had been a project for years.

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.980
 And then a few years ago,

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.980
 the CDC closed down the Fort Detrick,

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:33.500
 the main famous germ warfare lab,

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:38.500
 because they had had over 1,000 accidents.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.420
 And it was in the news that they were closing the lab

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:48.420
 because of its lack of clean behavior exposure.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:53.820
 Exposing the environment to their toxic viruses.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.940
 That was in the newspaper.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.940
 And for them to be so public as well as so sloppy,

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.660
 I think was a propaganda operation

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.660
 to convince the Chinese who had no doubt

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:17.300
 about all of the stuff which had been in the news

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.300
 for 40 years that the US was working on biological warfare.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:29.580
 So with all of this publicity coming out in recent years,

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:34.540
 obviously the Chinese would be very sensitive

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:39.540
 to taking instant precautions of an exaggerated sort

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.660
 if they thought the Americans were actually spilling

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.740
 this horribly lethal virus

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.220
 and that it might get spilled into China.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:57.220
 So I think it was propaganda intended to get the Chinese

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:03.180
 to put out a historically huge reaction to a virus

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:08.220
 which they got under control in a few weeks.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:13.700
 But having that as an example in the news

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.580
 that China shut down the whole country,

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:21.580
 then that news they had created with this publicity

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:27.660
 over preceding two or three years,

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:33.540
 that was the example for realizing the plans

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:38.620
 of the World Economic Forum which had been talked about

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:44.540
 and planned for like the event 201.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.380
 - Yes.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:48.980
 - They were planning for this

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.980
 and so they created the international staged theatrical

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:59.780
 defensive reaction of China and said,

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.980
 "Look what they did, we have to do the same."

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.980
 So even without any evidence of actually how many people

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.020
 were dying from it and actually how infective it was,

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.020
 just what China reported, the whole thing came into play.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:23.460
 The program that had been designed years previously

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:27.780
 and now everyone was trained to put it into practice.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.780
 Lockdowns, the whole campaign to sell vaccines

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.820
 to everyone in the world.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.900
 - Fascinating, interesting story.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:42.300
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.980
 So before we go to the calls,

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.220
 and we'll take a quick break before the calls,

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.980
 but by the way, if you'd like to ask Dr. Peat a question,

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:53.220
 he doesn't do medical advice, we can't do a lot here,

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:56.340
 but at least he can maybe lead you in the right direction,

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.980
 save you some time on some issue that you're having.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.540
 We have a lot of good questions already,

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.300
 we'll get to as many as we can.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.340
 But back to the vaccine and this idea

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.380
 that there's actually putting genetic material

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.140
 in which many are arguing

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.420
 that it's never really been done before.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.780
 I mean, what risk could this pose for people

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.920
 that are taking this vaccine?

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.340
 - Oh, you asked me that?

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.180
 - Yes, sir.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:34.620
 - Yeah, it's the shock to the system

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.580
 is the first thing.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:43.980
 Two nurses in England who on the first day

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.980
 developed anaphylaxis,

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.900
 they had a history of allergies,

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.820
 but Pfizer or whoever their vaccine was made by

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.620
 didn't announce to the world

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.620
 that people who had allergies shouldn't take it.

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:12.060
 They had excluded allergic people from their test subjects.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:18.020
 So naturally, there was absolutely no evidence of safety.

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:23.460
 If they excluded allergic people and old people,

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:26.940
 and who knows how many other categories

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.980
 were excluded from the test samples,

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.900
 that that was an obligatory bit of information

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.660
 that should have been announced to the world last Monday

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:45.140
 when the vaccine was announced as a finished thing.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:52.980
 But they said, "Well, yes, we did exclude allergic people."

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:58.300
 And immediately an official in the FDA said,

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:03.300
 "But there are 1.6 million profoundly allergic people

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.680
 "in the United States.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.400
 "That's a very large number.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.900
 "We can't exclude that many from receiving the vaccine."

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:18.020
 So according to the FDA,

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:24.000
 the Pfizer policy of not testing it on allergic people

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.940
 and then giving it to people with a history of allergy

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.980
 was perfectly all right,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.980
 because that was an appropriate risk.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:41.460
 Safety testing has never been done like that.

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.660
 It's really fraudulent.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:48.780
 And the article was published

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:51.140
 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.340
 People have analyzed it,

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:58.340
 showing that the article didn't resemble at all

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:03.900
 the way an announcement of a new drug or product

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.260
 should be handled.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:10.260
 It was like a public relations advertising bit.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.380
 And it went with an editorial,

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.380
 not by an expert who could evaluate the Pfizer report,

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.160
 but the editorial was written by the editor-in-chief

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.660
 of New England Journal of Medicine,

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.660
 whose magazine receives advertising money

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:34.420
 and major support from Pfizer.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.420
 And this editor was on the FDA committee

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.700
 voting to approve it.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:46.700
 So there was sort of a conspiracy all the way

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.660
 from advertising money

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:55.660
 through the medical journal announcement

00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.020
 and the approval of it in the FDA.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.420
 And then the FDA is saying it's all right,

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.820
 no matter what it does to people.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.980
 - Is there a potential then for long-term effects,

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.780
 two, three, five, 10 years from now

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:14.620
 that we would have no idea of knowing?

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:19.500
 - Yeah, not only the damage done to the immune system,

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.820
 which has its repercussions,

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:25.740
 depending on how basic the injury was,

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.740
 but being RNA and even our own DNA replicating enzymes,

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:37.700
 what we need for every cell to reproduce

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.540
 and to produce offspring.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:45.540
 The DNA replicates enzyme happens to have the ability

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:52.660
 to function as a reverse transcriptase,

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:57.820
 able to transcribe RNA into DNA,

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:03.180
 making basically genes out of this bit of viral RNA,

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:09.260
 which can go into the genes.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.140
 The person can then become a factory

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.460
 for making the spike protein,

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:20.460
 this uniquely inflammation promoting a bit of information,

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:29.620
 producing the viral protein,

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:35.300
 multiplying it endlessly by possibly all of our cells.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:40.660
 So we would not only produce increasing amounts

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.180
 as our body went through its normal,

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:49.420
 restoration and growth processes,

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:54.420
 but being spreadable by our secretions

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:58.900
 and passed on to our offspring

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:02.060
 if people should live that long.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:08.180
 - And so there could be then some validity to the idea

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.700
 that some are concerned about the potential issue

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.620
 of making women less fertile with this thing

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:21.180
 if they figured it out right.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:26.180
 - Yeah, that particular thing was based on the similarity

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.700
 between an enzyme in the vaccine

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.700
 and the enzyme which creates the placenta,

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.180
 happens to be just a structurally similar protein.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:42.660
 That created doubt and suspicions

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:47.140
 that any sensible person would want to check it out.

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:48.980
 But instead of checking it out,

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.460
 they called it a conspiracy theory and so on.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.460
 - So it's not a big stretch if folks explore the idea

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.380
 of eugenics and some very bad people

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.820
 that think there's too many people on the planet.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:05.840
 It's not a huge stretch to say

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.080
 that this vaccine is part of that.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.740
 - Yeah, you shouldn't even have to be a suspicious person

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:18.540
 to want to check out all of the possible things

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.500
 that could possibly eliminate the species

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.220
 or a big part of it.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.740
 - You know, in vaccines, there's this idea of shedding

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.660
 where the kids that get vaccinated

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.580
 actually can be more dangerous than the unvaccinated

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.500
 'cause they throw off stuff.

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.420
 Could it be possible that the vaccinated people for corona

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.300
 could throw off stuff that you and I

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.980
 wouldn't want to be exposed to?

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:47.820
 - Yeah, because that RNA is put in there to be copied.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.660
 - Oh, great.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:54.300
 So those should be the ones with the dangerous passports

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.300
 and not the non-vax people.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:57.140
 - Right.

00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:01.520
 - But now before we go though, this is key.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.540
 So I want to get your take.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.420
 You know, there's people like Cowan, Kauffman,

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:10.140
 David Parker, others who suggested the virus idea.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.060
 You know, the germ theory is structurally incoherent

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.580
 because they have proven that you can take snot

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.380
 and saliva from somebody with something

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.700
 and give it to another person, right?

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.860
 And it doesn't work.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.620
 It only works in the Petri dish.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:30.340
 - No, if you take it out of a Petri dish

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.900
 where you have a big concentration

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.360
 and drip it into someone's nose while they're lying down,

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.500
 it's a pretty repeatable process.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.500
 - But not necessarily person to person.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:48.500
 - No, it's pretty hard to spread a cold

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.180
 from person to person.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.740
 But the fact that you can do it,

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:57.420
 I don't think you should go around saying

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:01.020
 that the whole idea doesn't work.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:06.020
 If you've ever seen a cold sore

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.920
 passed on in a family,

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:12.860
 you know that viruses are real.

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.160
 - Right, a cold sore is always,

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.780
 but you can touch it, you know, like a herpes virus

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:21.460
 and you have, and so viruses are real.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.000
 They're there.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.540
 But when you say it's difficult to even share

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:28.720
 a cold or a flu virus.

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.220
 - Yeah, they've put one very sick person

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.780
 with a cold into a room to play cards

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.660
 for several hours, passing things back and forth

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.780
 with a bunch of healthy people.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:49.040
 And that almost never goes across.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.460
 You have to be receptive.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:58.460
 So the terrain theory is the basic thing.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:02.060
 But you can't forget that things like herpes virus

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.820
 are super easy to transmit.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:10.980
 With just the slightest break in the skin, for example,

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:15.220
 doesn't even have to be a visible wound.

00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:19.160
 - So then that would play as well as for STDs?

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.540
 - For which?

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:25.140
 - STDs, sexually transmitted diseases.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.580
 - Oh, oh, sure.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.300
 Same thing 'cause you're actually making contact?

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.980
 - Yeah, and--

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.700
 - To the mucosis, right?

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:38.700
 - Yeah, Epstein-Barr and lots of contact viruses.

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:48.240
 The experiments show that with extreme effort,

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.500
 putting a concentrated batch of viruses

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.740
 derived from one person,

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:59.740
 if you put 'em right into the upper nasal membrane,

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:03.980
 it will catch on a fair amount of the time.

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.940
 - It'll catch on a fair amount of the time,

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.940
 but passing stuff to somebody who's two feet away from you,

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.000
 are you saying it's pretty rare?

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.020
 - Yeah, in one experiment,

00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:21.420
 they put a dye in a person's runny nose.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.540
 - They put a what?

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:25.740
 - A colored agent into their nose.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.740
 - Okay.

00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:29.220
 - And then had them play cards.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.220
 And the dye was transmitted to everyone in the card game,

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:38.580
 but no one caught the virus.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.980
 - No one caught it.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:44.500
 So then that brings us back to social distancing

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.180
 and all that and lockdowns and masking.

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.900
 There's real no science behind any of it, is there?

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.580
 - Absolutely no science.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.040
 - Wow, wow, man.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:01.660
 - Giving vitamin D is probably the single

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.220
 most functional thing.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.100
 Vitamin D, vitamin A,

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.140
 adequate protein and carbohydrate and everything,

00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:14.140
 but vitamin D is probably the main deficiency

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.040
 leading to epidemics.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.760
 - So are you a fan then,

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.280
 if folks can't get sun on their skin,

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.880
 to take supplemental D during the time

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.520
 when they can't get sun?

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.120
 - Oh, definitely.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.040
 That has, in the higher latitudes,

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:37.040
 the winter sun doesn't make any vitamin D to count.

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:43.560
 And we need probably 5,000 international units a day

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.180
 is good for adults.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:54.960
 If a person is overweight, it might take more than that.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.960
 But the idea, the so-called research done medically

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:06.000
 has used doses of things like 500 milligrams,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.880
 500 units instead of 5,000 units.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.200
 And then they say, oh, vitamin D didn't do anything

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.680
 to strengthen their bones or improve their immunity

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:16.880
 or reduce inflammation.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.880
 But you have to actually get their serum of vitamin D up,

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:29.440
 and it has to be the kind of vitamin D

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.000
 that's the same as made in your skin by the sunlight

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.520
 and developed in your liver.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:41.520
 And not the 1,25-dihydroxycholecylsterol,

00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.800
 which is called--

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:45.640
 - That they test for, right?

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:46.480
 That's what they test for?

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.560
 - They've activated the vitamin D,

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.560
 is what they call that one.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:56.200
 But we only activate ordinary vitamin D

00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:01.200
 into the dihydroxycholecylsterol under stress.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:06.680
 If we're deficient in vitamin D,

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.720
 the curative anti-inflammatory material,

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:14.720
 our body suddenly starts converting this,

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:19.120
 any trace of it, to a very small amount

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:24.120
 of 1,25-dihydroxy, and that happens

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:29.600
 to do all kinds of destructive calcification things.

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:35.000
 So if you hear about the toxic vitamin A,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.400
 it's almost always because they're talking

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.600
 about active vitamin A.

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.880
 But if you take enough calcium in your diet

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.160
 and the normal amount of sunlight exposure

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:54.160
 or vitamin D from even fish oil

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:58.260
 is usually an adequate source,

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:01.460
 if you take calcium and that kind

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:05.960
 of environmentally derived vitamin D,

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:10.960
 you'll have extremely low activated vitamin D.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.200
 Activated vitamin D is the dangerous one.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.120
 - And is that the one that shows up on a test

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.880
 when you test for vitamin D?

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:23.920
 - Only if the doctor does the wrong thing.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.040
 If he's a kidney expert, he's likely to do the wrong thing.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.800
 - Okay, but generally, the one that they test

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.220
 for the vitamin D is okay.

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:36.520
 - Yeah, it's called 25-hydroxy.

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:38.480
 - 25-hydroxy.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.240
 You mentioned the sun, so like here in Texas,

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.600
 if I get out in the sun, I'm at an altitude

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.800
 where I'm getting D in December?

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.400
 - Yeah, in the winter, the summer,

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.200
 the sun is a little weaker, but in Texas--

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:56.560
 - We still get it.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.360
 - Yeah, in a couple of hours,

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.120
 you're getting an odd dose of vitamin D.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.520
 - In what areas would our listeners not get

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.520
 the vitamin D on their skin in December, that they won't?

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:15.240
 - For example, at the latitude of Oregon.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:20.960
 Even San Francisco, I think the sun is so weak right now

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:25.240
 that you could sit in it for eight hours.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.080
 - You still don't get it, huh?

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:31.520
 Is there any risk of having too much

00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.560
 of the supplemental vitamin D, getting too much?

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.680
 Are there any side effects?

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:43.600
 - In experiments, either by accident

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:48.360
 or in animal experiments, people have occasionally,

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:54.320
 for confusion, taken maybe a quarter of a million

00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:01.240
 units per day and doing that for a matter of weeks.

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.440
 They do start showing signs of calcification,

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.640
 but if they stop in time,

00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:15.520
 it isn't the extreme danger that it was made out to be

00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.640
 when they insisted that 200 units a day

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:25.640
 was okay for kids and 400 for adults.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:29.240
 - But now 5,000 units, if somebody's taking 10 or 20,

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.680
 probably no issues with that if they wanted to take--

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.880
 - Yeah, I've known quite a few people

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.240
 who weren't getting their blood level up

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.520
 on 5,000 or 6,000 units a day,

00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.880
 so they took, for just a couple of weeks,

00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:46.120
 they would take 10 or 20,000 units

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.360
 and suddenly their blood level would come up to normal

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:54.360
 and their symptoms would generally just suddenly disappear.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.840
 Weakness, body pains, depression,

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:06.040
 rheumatoid symptoms just respond amazingly

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:12.280
 when you actually get your 25-hydroxy level

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.760
 up in your bloodstream.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.440
 - And if you had a number that folks could look for,

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.880
 what would that be on that 25-hydroxy on the blood test?

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:26.720
 - On the nanogram scale, it's about 50 mg per milliliter.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.240
 - Yeah, that's the main thing they use.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.480
 So that's the D.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.440
 If folks need to make sure they're getting A,

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.560
 you're okay with some high-quality fish oil?

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.120
 - Not fish oil, but liver oil.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.400
 - Oh, now what's the difference?

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.240
 Do you mean cod liver oil?

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.400
 - Yeah, cod liver or halibut liver oil

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.360
 is you get lots of vitamin D and A

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:58.160
 in a small amount of oil,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:03.160
 but in fish oil, you get only the tiniest trace of vitamins.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:09.200
 Just it accidentally gets in there

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.520
 when the whole fish is squashed.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.200
 - Could you take a good high-quality cod liver oil

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.160
 ongoing without any ill effects with the yellow fat

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.720
 and all the lipofuscin and stuff?

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.160
 - I don't advocate it,

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.160
 but if it's your only source of vitamin D and A,

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.240
 naturally, it'll save your life,

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.480
 but still, it's better not to have the chronic--

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.080
 - Too much, yeah, too much.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.800
 Well, and the foods with the D and A?

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.840
 - Oh, liver.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.280
 - Liver?

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.600
 - Any chicken liver, beef, any kind of liver,

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.760
 is a great source of not only A and D,

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.360
 also K, all of the nutrients.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.240
 The only problem with liver is it's very high in iron

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.240
 and very high in phosphate,

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.480
 and so I don't think you should eat

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.240
 more than one good serving of liver per week

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.920
 because you can chronically overload

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.320
 on some of the over-concentrated nutrients.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.280
 - And we've been told that many of us

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.080
 have too much iron running around anyway

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.920
 because they put it in the food and--

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.840
 - Yeah. - Is that right?

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.000
 - But yeah, one serving of iron per week

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.840
 won't hurt you unless you're eating

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.360
 red meat twice a day or something.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.520
 - Yeah, yeah, and you talk of serving

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:48.360
 to be four to six ounces, something like that,

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:49.720
 would we do you up?

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:55.640
 - Yeah, four ounces is a pretty filling amount of liver.

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.040
 - Yeah, it is.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:57.960
 Well, stay right there, sir.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.240
 Boy, this has been a great first time.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.440
 We may wanna keep you,

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.000
 can we keep you just a little bit longer today?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.360
 Is that okay? - Oh, sure.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.080
 - Oh, good, because we have lots of emails

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.760
 and our first part has already been an hour or so.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.120
 We'll impose upon the good doctor for a bit.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.520
 We're pretty excited about a sale that's going on

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.520
 today only on Surthrival, 21%

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.900
 in observance of the summer,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.880
 the winter solstice, December 21.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:30.880
 Today only, today only, 21% site-wide,

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.000
 everything on Surthrival.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.500
 So jump on it if you wanna get some products.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:40.320
 Use promo code infinite, I-N-F-I-N-I-T-E.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.960
 So that's everything, everything they have.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.280
 Let's do the pine pollen first.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.240
 We're talking with Daniel Vitalis of Surthrival.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.640
 Is there a benefit to using the elk velvet antler

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.280
 and the pine pollen together?

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.980
 - Yeah, they really enhance each other's effect

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.720
 and they don't have any contraindications.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.440
 So both of them nourish and feed anabolic pathways,

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:01.480
 but in different ways.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:04.040
 The pine pollen adds direct testosterone

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.760
 and other anabolic hormones into the body.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.240
 The elk antler helps to fine tune the metabolism

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:15.240
 and feeds in all that connective tissue enhancing collagen

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.800
 that helps to feed and build up the body.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.040
 At the same time, it helps to increase lean body mass.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.600
 The two together would be your optimal nature-based formula

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.720
 for both bodybuilding, for youthening, for anti-aging,

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.040
 and for anybody who's looking to keep their body

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.560
 in a youthful, anabolic, vigorous, and elastic state.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.040
 - And is it fair to say they're both tonics

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.320
 so they can be used every day?

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.840
 - Yeah, both pine pollen and elk antler are tonic medicines.

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.160
 In other words, they don't have any contraindications

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.480
 of use and they don't have to be cycled on and off.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.000
 So somebody could use them short-term,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.600
 but they could also use them long-term

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.320
 without worrying that they're overdosing themselves on them

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.400
 because like you said, they're tonic medicines.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.040
 - Every day in every way, let's just get stronger.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.920
 Boys and girls, all so--

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.760
 Yeah, you bet 'em.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.800
 Boy, this would be a great time

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.280
 if you'd like to try the pine pollen.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.480
 I just ran downstairs to get some water.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.020
 You'd like to get some pine pollen, and I ran.

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:14.560
 It's a great time to do it.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.560

 And then you might want to try

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:33.520
 their vitamin D K3 product.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.520

 Look at the, listen to the ingredients.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.600
 See if I can find them here.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:06:01.320
 The D3 from lanolin, K2 is from natto,

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.960
 which is a traditional Japanese fermented food.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.480
 And that's it.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:11.240
 So you got the vitamin D K3, K2 or K3,

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.280
 what do they call it?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.480
 Vitamin D K2 Daylight.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.640

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.020
 Pretty cool, huh?

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.000
 Have you heard about hydrogen?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.120
 If you're thinking about,

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.200
 well, check this out for an investment.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.600
 Hydrogen technology is pretty exciting.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.440
 This is George.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.000
 Many people have said, and we concur,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.360
 that the number one investment we should make

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.080
 is in our health.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.440
 Here's George Wiseman.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.540
 - Glass collar, I'm sorry, I didn't remember his name,

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.080
 said an investment.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.680
 And this is really the investment kind of thing

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.780
 that you need to do.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:59.160
 Not my machine specifically.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.000
 I think I sell the world's best machine,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.340
 and I do my best to maintain it

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.000
 and support the customers and everything.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.920
 But regardless of who you get it from,

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.840
 you really should invest in your health.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.820
 How are you gonna enjoy life if you haven't got health?

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.160
 How are you gonna fulfill that bucket list?

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.800
 So number one on the bucket list should be your health,

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.340
 and then you get some extra years.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.620
 I say this thing not only adds years to your life,

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:26.900
 because the science is showing a 30 to 50% life extension.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.160
 So I'm expecting to go to the 120, 150 years old,

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.920
 and I'd help a lot of people between now and then.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.320
 But it also adds life to your years.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.200
 There's no sense living your last decade of life

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.760
 if you're in a hospital bed attached to machines,

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.600
 you know what I mean?

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.320
 Throwing a Frisbee and having fun.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.560
 - It's so true, isn't it?

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.220
 Boy, if we don't feel good and have the energy

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.080
 to do what we need to do, I mean, what's the point?

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:53.600
 And here's an investment with a lifetime warranty,

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:58.320
 and also a one year, no questions asked, money back,

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.040
 guarantee if you don't want it.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.200
 Check out this Aquacure machine,

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.240
 bubbling hydrogen gas, drinking it, breathing it.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.640
 This is real cutting edge technology.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:08.800

 And if you're clever and you figure out

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.120
 how to write it off on your taxes,

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.240
 which got a good tax person, they could figure it out.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.400
 I don't, trust me, I don't do tax advice,

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.160
 but you can get one before the end of the year,

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.200
 and just kind of get one.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.040

 and look at peer reviewed studies from around the world.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.760
 Lots going on in China, Japan,

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.400
 with all kinds of pretty interesting stories

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.000
 with helping people to recover from strokes,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.800
 breathing the brown hydrogen.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.560
 Our machine is Browns Gas,

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.800
 which is just a step up from just pure hydrogen.

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.280
 (upbeat music)

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.760
 - We are listener supported, One Radio Network.

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:08.240
 - Well, we've had quite a first hour with Dr. Ray Peat.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.680
 Thanks for being here, sir.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.840
 Ray Peat, it is DrPeat.com.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.480
 You can do Dr. Peat's newsletter,

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:18.240
 and DrPeat's newsletter at gmail.com, right?

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.240
 And get your newsletter?

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.360
 - Right.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.200
 - That's good.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.600
 And you put that out every couple of months, huh?

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:26.440
 - Two months, yeah.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.000
 - Every two months.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.920
 Well, let's get to some emails for you, Doc.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.080
 So here's one.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.920
 So kissing someone vaccinated with an RNA virus

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.600
 can spread the exosomes from the vaccine

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.520
 by horizontal genetics?

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.240
 (laughs)

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.080
 That's great.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.680
 - I think that's a real possibility.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.360
 - Wow, man.

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.400
 So now we'll be on dating sites and say,

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.520
 instead of wanting people who have been vaccinated, right?

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.800
 To get people that haven't been vaccinated.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.640
 - Yeah.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.480
 - That's great, man.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.720
 Only on planet Earth, Doc.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.080
 How about, would you please ask Dr. Peat,

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.480
 is the table sugar processed with phosphoric acid

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.480
 for refinement better than the one processed with sulfur?

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.800
 Hmm.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.760
 - What kind of sugars?

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:19.960
 - The table sugar.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:23.560
 Table sugar processed with phosphoric acid

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:27.140
 for refinement better than the one processed with sulfur.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:33.720
 - Sulfur is a much more allergenic material

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:38.760
 that in trace amounts has the ability

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.240
 to cause allergic reactions.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.720
 And trace amounts of phosphoric acid

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:47.300
 are almost always harmless.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.540
 Down at the threshold where you can't taste them,

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:57.380
 sulfur has the risk of increasing allergies.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.700
 - Okay.

01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.260
 Thank you for asking Dr. Peat on your show.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:03.500
 I have a question for him.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:08.260
 What is the significance of the optic nerve cup

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:12.140
 to disc ratio, CD ratio,

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:15.140
 and can it be brought back into normal?

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.980
 Diagnosis of glaucoma.

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.660
 - The word is cuff?

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.500
 - I'm sorry?

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.580
 - C-U-F-F was the word?

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:30.820
 - What is the significance of the optic nerve cup?

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.660
 Cup, C-U-P.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:32.820
 - Oh, cup, cup.

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:41.340
 I think cup represents dead tissue that does atrophied.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:48.740
 And so it determines or expresses

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:53.760
 how much of the nerve is gone.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:59.780
 So I would guess that the cup is a bad indicator.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:06.440
 - Do you have any suggestions?

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.500
 We get so many emails with folks

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.460
 that are beginning to get cataracts over the years.

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:16.580
 It's a pretty, very popular kind of a challenge.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.060
 What do you think about it,

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.740
 the cause and some things people can do?

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:23.440
 We're talking about the eyes here.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:29.500
 - By putting an animal lens with a cataract

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.020
 into a culture dish,

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.420
 they have found that it's responsive

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.940
 to the osmolarity of the solution,

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:44.860
 that a watery solution expands a cataract

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:49.860
 and a slightly over-concentrated solution

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.460
 can regress a cataract.

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:57.460
 And inflammation generally creates a watery,

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:04.220
 low osmolarity solution that contributes.

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.700
 The cataract itself becomes opaque

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:11.540
 because the cells take up more water than normal.

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.700
 And in that process,

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:17.860
 they are losing not only their transparency,

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.780
 but their resilience.

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:25.780
 The proteins in the cell are like egg white.

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:31.860
 When it's cooked, it's opaque and firm.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.340
 When it's functional and alive and clear,

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:40.700
 the water is in a special state.

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:48.060
 Things that damage the cell's ultraviolet light

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:51.300
 or too much estrogen, for example,

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:56.180
 are things that will change the state of water in the cell,

01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.180
 make it over-hydrated, hardened, and opaque.

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:09.020
 Keeping systemic inflammation low,

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:14.120
 avoiding the things that tend to waterlog your tissues,

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:19.560
 all of those reduce the progress of cataracts.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:25.120
 And incidentally, lots and lots of optometrists

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.320
 are now exaggerating the language they're telling people

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.280
 that they have developing cataracts

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.060
 when what they're really seeing

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:39.520
 is just the normal yellowing and browning

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.120
 of the lens with aging.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.120
 An old yellowed or browned lens can still be very clear.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:50.160
 It's not a cataract.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.260
 It's just the change of color with aging.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:14:59.260
 A cataract is a more or less focal spot

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:04.600
 where the cells turn white and become opaque

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.760
 as they take up too much water in the wrong arrangement.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.760
 - Interesting, wow.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.780
 Linda's in Michigan.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.220
 Dear Patrick, I looked for you on MeWe, couldn't find you.

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:19.040
 Just do Patrick Timpone on MeWe and you'll find us.

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:22.000
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat if he would think,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.120
 what could a, oh, a pillow that's infused with silver,

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:35.200
 could that be a beneficial effect on protecting from EMFs?

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:36.040
 Wow.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.160
 - Doing what with silver?

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.000
 - A silver infused pillow.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.800
 - Oh, no, I think the conductor has to be between you

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.320
 and the source of the EMF.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.160
 - I think so too.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:57.160
 - So you can get curtains with embedded wire filaments,

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.700
 silver or copper or whatever.

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:06.700
 And if you have a telephone tower visible

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:12.940
 through your window and you put a big drape over the window

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:17.940
 and maybe over any of the wall between you and the tower,

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:22.560
 that is protective.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:27.300
 - David is in Atlanta, Georgia listening this morning

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.020
 or watching, whatever.

01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:32.420
 Dr. Peat, you've said that metabolism

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.900
 and epigenetic damage causes baldness.

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.260
 My metabolism has improved but I'm still bald.

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:42.920
 So how can I undo the epigenetic damage and grow some hair?

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:50.900
 - The tissue, once it's damaged, has changed its structure

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:56.060
 and laid down a lot of collagen and fiber cells

01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:02.220
 and so the examples of people who have gone

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:10.260
 from complete baldness to regrowing a good crop of hair,

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:16.260
 it has usually involved some kind of shock to the tissue

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:21.260
 that activates repair processes that will actively clean out

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:24.360
 some of the fibrous tissue.

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.700
 Probably massage would be the best bet

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.440
 to activate the cells.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.180
 Like putting a niacin or something

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:41.620
 that simply causes a local inflammation.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:47.100
 Not niacinamide but the one that makes the skin turn red.

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:51.960
 That sort of thing creating a mild inflammation.

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:57.900
 One old guy fell on his head in the fireplace

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:02.900
 and seriously burned his scalp and that area,

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.180
 when it healed, was producing hair.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:09.820
 So it takes some kind of activation,

01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:12.540
 getting circulation back into it

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:17.220
 to actively remove the fibrous tissue

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:22.220
 and let the germ cells or the stem cells

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.180
 that make hair recover.

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.180
 An important part of that is to make sure

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:32.380
 that your parathyroid hormone is down

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.860
 at the lower end of the normal range

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:39.260
 because you're getting enough calcium

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:43.900
 and vitamin D in your diet and not too much phosphate.

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:48.500
 Eating a lot of meat, the phosphate is constantly

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.660
 pushing up your parathyroid hormone

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:56.660
 and the parathyroid hormone is turning down metabolism

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:58.820
 in your hair follicle.

01:18:58.820 --> 01:18:59.660
 - Oh I see.

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.940
 So but just to the original,

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.700
 there's actually some physical issues going on

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:09.420
 with the bald guys so the hair can't even pop out.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.980
 You said there could be different ways to scrub it

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.740
 or I don't know.

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:18.740
 - Yeah, effectively rubbing it every day.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:20.620
 - Rubbing it every day.

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:22.380
 That's right, that might work.

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.700
 That's pretty interesting.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.180
 Okay, here's one, Sophie, she's in Jacksonville, Florida.

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.220
 Dr. Peat, what are your thoughts on cactus fruit

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:33.100
 like prickly pear and dragon fruit?

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.260
 Some research says that they have

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:38.180
 high calcium to phosphate ratio.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:43.820
 - The main thing is they're delicious foods

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:46.340
 and growing in the desert,

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:49.900
 they do tend to have lots of minerals.

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:55.620
 In some of the traditional areas of Mexico,

01:19:55.620 --> 01:20:00.540
 they cook down the prickly pear fruit,

01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:04.460
 make a mush of it and then concentrate it

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.860
 and it's one of the most delicious candies

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.860
 I've ever tasted.

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:09.780
 - Is that right?

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.580
 - It's just full of minerals, calcium and magnesium

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:17.140
 in a very, very pleasant taste

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:21.780
 and the young tender leaves themselves,

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.100
 if you slice them up,

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:29.580
 they're a very pleasant vegetable, very nutritious.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:34.220
 - You've often mentioned the idea that even for animals

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.940
 and like dogs, which are carnivores,

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:41.420
 that too much meat without enough calcium is an issue.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.780
 Same for people, right?

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:47.780
 Dogs, too much meat and we need more calcium

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:50.140
 than real calcium with bones or?

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:55.140
 - Yeah, in the wild, animals tend to eat the small bones

01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:58.380
 like a carnivore eats a chicken.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.860
 They aren't gonna spit out many of the bones

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:06.180
 because they can crush them and get the marrow out

01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:09.380
 and so on, so they're getting lots of calcium

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:10.700
 in their normal diet.

01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:12.780
 - Interesting and the calcium then,

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:17.220
 that ratio you suggested affects the thyroid, right?

01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:20.340
 Can make the thyroid not work as well.

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:23.580
 - Well, that's a consequence but the first thing

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:27.420
 is the parathyroid hormone increases

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:31.460
 under the influence of too much phosphate

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:36.080
 or not enough calcium and the parathyroid hormone

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:41.080
 is what turns on the activated vitamin D,

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:46.480
 the harmful part of the vitamin D system

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:51.320
 and it turns off cellular energy production.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:56.920
 Not only in the hair follicle but in the thyroid gland

01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:01.920
 and muscles, everything gets weak and tends to get inflamed

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.600
 if you have too much parathyroid hormone

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.280
 and phosphate is the main thing in excess

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.040
 that will drive your parathyroid hormone too high.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.960
 - Interesting, there's a lot of very natural breeders

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.400
 that have been using the whole chicken raw for dogs

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.200
 for a long time and they do very well on it

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.960
 'cause I guess they're eating all the bones, too.

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.800
 - Yep.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.560
 - Dear Dr. Peat, this is Susan in Tennessee.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:39.560
 Is glycerin okay to use topically, glycerin topically?

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.400
 - Yeah, I think it is okay topically.

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.680
 You don't want to take it orally

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.680
 because part of the effect of stress

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:56.920
 is to release fat from storage

01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.920
 and every molecule of triglyceride

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.320
 involves a glycerin molecule.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:09.880
 And glycerin, even from our natural tissue stores,

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:16.400
 a certain amount of it converts to methylglyoxal

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.240
 which is a toxin and which adds to the protein glycation

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.240
 and the aging process.

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:34.440
 So you definitely don't want to ingest glycerin.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:41.600
 I wouldn't use it copiously on the skin

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.480
 because a little bit of it might get absorbed.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.600
 - We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.320
 He's here on the third Monday of the month,

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.760
 One Radio Network.

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.040
 You can check out other videos we've done with Dr. Peat

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.480
 on One Radio Network.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.440
 Look for the video section and also in the archives,

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.280
 all the audio shows are there.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.280
 His website is rayPeat.com

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.520
 and you can send him an email,

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:11.200
 rayPeats, a plural newsletter, at gmail.com

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.800
 and sign up for his terrific newsletter.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.520
 It comes out every couple of months.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.560
 Dr. Peat, do you have much experience

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:23.560
 with using for different things, a DMSO?

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.880
 - Oh yeah.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.720
 - Do you?

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:31.720
 - I was very interested in it in the mid, late 60s

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:38.440
 and then I had a series of experiences

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:45.680
 in which it was producing inflammation

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:51.640
 and that sort of discouraged my interest in it.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:56.800
 Besides, it produces a bad taste in your mouth

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.480
 if you just get it on your skin

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.480
 and it can easily take impurities into your skin with it

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:10.640
 and so the question of getting an absolutely pure substance

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.340
 in itself is hard enough,

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:19.340
 but then if you just introduce a trace of contaminant

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.720
 along with it, it can--

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.960
 - Drive it right in.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.040
 - Penetrate, yeah.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:27.120
 - I mean, you could actually,

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.240
 people have said you could use some maybe DMSO

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.840
 and something else on your feet and put on a sock

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.560
 and if it has dye in there, that would draw that in.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.920
 You have to be careful with that stuff.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.760
 I did a sauna, I like to do a sauna

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.720
 with a little bit of DMSO and castor oil

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:45.080
 and just let it on my stomach

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.800
 and I did one the other night and I just got over,

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.480
 I don't know, overabundant with the DMSO

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.800
 and Dr. Peat, I have to tell you,

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.360
 my stomach burned on the outside.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.240
 I actually burnt it for about two or three days.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.760
 I mean, it's been itching and it's finally going away.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.640
 That stuff can burn you, right?

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:08.000
 - I was seeing that happen frequently around 1970

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.040
 so I lost interest in using it.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.560
 - I have to be careful with this stuff.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.480
 Here's an email from Trent.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.920
 If low cell oxygen can result in cancer,

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:25.080
 will antioxidants such as vitamin E or vitamin C

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.360
 promote the growth of cancer?

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:34.640
 - Actually, cancer produces its own powerful

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:37.760
 reductants and antioxidants

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.640
 and the big change that has been happening

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.480
 in the last 10 years is realizing

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.360
 that vitamin C, when it's working in a healthy cell,

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.160
 is a pro-oxidant.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.880
 The reductant antioxidant form of it

01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:00.520
 is not what's doing most of the benefit.

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:05.520
 It's the catalytic support of the oxidative systems

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.320
 that makes vitamin C useful.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.320
 And vitamin E has its oxidative phase.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.560
 And the things you find in orange juice,

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:24.560
 fruits and vegetables, the polyphenols,

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:28.600
 nobiletin, fisetin, for example,

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:33.600
 these have been historically classified as antioxidants

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.840
 but actually they shift the cell pro-oxidative processes,

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:44.800
 protect against the excess reduction,

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.880
 the opposite of oxidation that goes with stress

01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.280
 and that is characteristic of cancer.

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.840
 The cancer metabolism is stuck

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.840
 in an over-reductive antioxidant condition.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.640
 - Here's an email from Ellen.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.160
 Interesting, my sister chose to do chemotherapy

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.760
 for cancer and she's incredibly nauseous,

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.000
 can barely eat any kind of food.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.640
 Can you recommend some kind of foods or drinks

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.080
 that I could share with her

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.040
 so she could get something down?

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:29.280
 - Moderately salty chicken broth

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.760
 is historically one of the best things.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:36.000
 The broth is a complex mixture

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.280
 that doesn't do anything irritating

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.080
 but it has to be moderately salted

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.640
 because if there's too much water,

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:46.640
 that in itself creates inflammation

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:48.840
 in the digestive system.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.920
 So the natural fluids,

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:55.640
 the right concentration of a salted broth

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.600
 or milk or orange juice,

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.000
 which are more or less balanced solutions,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.720
 those are all supportive of healing

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.640
 and anti-inflammatory,

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.920
 promote oxidative healing processes.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.840
 - I see.

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.840
 And so these chemicals,

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.440
 do they damage the mucosa of the stomach

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.480
 and cause nausea or what's going on?

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.000
 - Yeah, chemotherapy is killing cells

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.920
 in proportion to how fast they grow

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:30.920
 and your stomach lining is probably the fastest growing

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:34.040
 other than parts of your immune system.

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.080
 The stomach lining is turning over

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:40.040
 every two days roughly.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:44.000
 And so if you kill the fast growing cells,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.240
 that's how a lethal dose of ionizing radiation,

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:53.240
 for example, kills people by burning out

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.600
 the lining of their stomach,

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.720
 of their intestine.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.120
 The chemical therapy does the same thing.

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:06.640
 It kills cells in proportion

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:09.240
 to how fast they're replicating,

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.880
 assuming that cancer is always fast growing.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:17.400
 But very often a tumor is slow growing

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:22.400
 but still determined to go down the wrong pathway

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.120
 even though it isn't dividing very fast.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.960
 So the ordinary radiation and chemotherapy

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:33.200
 are going to hurt your intestinal cells

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:37.760
 much more than they hurt the cancer

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.360
 if it's slow growing.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.000
 - On the vitamin C,

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.920
 do I recall that you're not a big fan

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.800
 of using just ascorbic acid or sodium ascorbate?

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:51.160
 - Yeah, because of that reduction.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.680
 It's a powerful reductant.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:59.400
 And what you wanna do is get it into your cells

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:04.400
 in an oxidized form without pushing

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:07.800
 the growth of cancer cells, for example,

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.320
 or starting a process of inflammation.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.480
 Once it gets into the cells,

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.480
 about 80% of vitamin C is in the form of dehydroascorbate.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:24.560
 And that means that eating meat,

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:29.920
 the animal's vitamin C that it makes

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:35.240
 is in all of its tissues, including the muscles,

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:40.840
 and at least 70 to 85% of it will be

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:45.840
 in the invisible oxidized form, DHA.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.480
 And so when you're eating meat,

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:53.700
 you're taking in lots of vitamin C.

01:31:55.240 --> 01:32:00.240
 And still, the official Department of Agriculture charts

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.720
 don't show any vitamin C content for meat,

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.080
 even though Eminson, was that his name,

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.360
 the Arctic Explorer, showed that they did fine

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:15.300
 if they ate meat all winter, didn't get scurvy.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.680
 - How many oranges would we need a day

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:21.120
 to get plenty of vitamin C?

01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:27.520
 - So the anti-scurvy dose is only about one orange a day.

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.160
 - One orange?

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.200
 - Is enough, but for general health,

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.160
 it's fine to eat 20 a day.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.480
 - You can eat a lot of oranges.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.740
 Is there a benefit to eating the whole orange

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.960
 rather than juicing it?

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.560
 - Not if it's a commercially grown orange,

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:50.560
 because the toxins pretty much stick on the peel,

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.400
 and so you don't want to make marmalade

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:59.840
 out of anything but a clean, organic orange.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:01.520
 - But organic orange, you eat the whole thing,

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:05.080
 is it more beneficial than juicing?

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:08.440
 - Well, when you cook it in a marmalade,

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:14.360
 it is very beneficial, but once I heard that

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:18.400
 when I was about 16 or 17,

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.320
 and tried eating a whole orange,

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.560
 and it's very irritating to the stomach.

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.800
 I couldn't keep it down.

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.360
 - Fascinating how cooking some things

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.580
 really make them more powerful.

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:37.680
 - Yeah, it releases the actually valuable nutrients

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:42.920
 and degrades some of the irritants.

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:46.620
 - That would be true in things like kale, collards?

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.680
 - Oh yeah, the--

01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:49.520
 - Cauliflower?

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:55.440
 - Yeah, leaves are very full of irritants

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.440
 intended to interfere with animals' digestion,

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:05.880
 aimed primarily at worms and herbivores,

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:11.520
 but when we eat them, they have specific enzyme inhibitors

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:18.360
 that will decrease the nutritional value.

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:22.560
 But when you cook it, some of those are degraded,

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.080
 and so it's a lot safer to eat well-cooked vegetables.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.720
 - Kale's a good food, kale?

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:33.720
 - Yeah, as a source of vitamin K in particular,

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:36.440
 calcium, magnesium.

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.720
 - Would you ask Dr. Peat, this is from Helen in Australia,

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.880
 approach to dealing with uterine fibroids,

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.480
 especially when they have grown so much

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.640
 that they're putting pressure on the colon and my bladder.

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.480
 Wow, okay.

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:56.280
 - Yeah, having a blood test is important

01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:01.080
 to check your thyroid, estrogen, and vitamin D.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:05.760
 Calcium and vitamin D are recognized

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.760
 as very important anti-fibroid factors,

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.380
 along with thyroid.

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:18.480
 One outstanding example, I think,

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.320
 illustrates what thyroid can do.

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:26.400
 A woman in her early 40s had a child and wanted to,

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:33.320
 but she had a big fibroid blocking the top of her uterus,

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.080
 blocking both fallopian tubes.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:44.960
 I explained how thyroid lowers estrogen

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.240
 while increasing the activity of enzymes

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.380
 that can break down fibrotic tissue.

01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:58.400
 Anyway, she took what her doctor said

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.120
 was a very dangerous overdose of thyroid,

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:08.120
 kept her heart rate beating at rest, 110 beats per minute.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:12.200
 That was in the spring.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.200
 She had an ultrasound every month

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:18.160
 and saw visible shrinking,

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.200
 so she stayed with it through the summer.

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.600
 And by, I think it was September or October,

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:25.720
 she was pregnant.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:31.280
 The tumor had shrunken visibly every month

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.520
 just by keeping her estrogen under control,

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:39.080
 by keeping a steadily,

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.160
 slightly above average thyroid activity.

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:43.060
 - Interesting.

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:48.680
 Has erythromycin, how do you say that?

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:52.500
 A-Z-I-T-H, safe, Dan wants to know.

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.840
 - What about it?

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.360
 - Is it safe to take?

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.520
 - Oh, I think it is.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.520
 I've used erythromycin, which is the original form.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.560
 They're very similar.

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:12.560
 They both have the extra virtue

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:15.900
 of being anti-inflammatory

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:20.900
 and somewhat pro-propulsion of the intestine.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:26.360
 So people who are having intestinal problems

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:29.920
 notice that the inflammation goes down

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:34.920
 and the tendency to reverse parasites

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.920
 or reflux during the night or constipation,

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.280
 the erythromycin acts as a mild laxative

01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:49.960
 keeping the intestine going in the right direction

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.360
 rather than coming up into the throat.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:53.560
 - And why does it go,

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.480
 what's the causes of it coming back the other way

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.880
 and causing heartburn and other stuff?

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:05.720
 - During the night, excitation increases

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:08.880
 from the blood sugar going down

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:14.120
 and this generalized inflammation

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.440
 against a background of low thyroid,

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:22.040
 the thyroid keeps the peristalsis

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:26.500
 running in the normal direction from top to bottom.

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:29.560
 When that gets confused

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:34.560
 and you get random centers of irritation and inflammation,

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:39.880
 inflammation just below your stomach, for example,

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.880
 start a wave of peristalsis moving through your stomach

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.600
 and up your esophagus,

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.080
 carrying stomach contents

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.520
 or even lower intestinal contents into your mouth.

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.520
 A medical professor in the 1920s

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.400
 experimented on his medical students

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:06.400
 putting an indicator, an indigestible particle

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.520
 that is very easy to recognize under the microscope.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.680
 He put a little dollop of this

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:19.120
 in the rectums of all of his medical students

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:23.800
 and then in the morning had them take a swab of saliva

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:25.840
 and put it under the microscope

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:29.080
 and all of those who had morning breath

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:34.600
 found the particles that had been inserted the night before.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.440
 - Whoa.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:37.840
 - Showing that reverse peristalsis,

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:42.320
 even in healthy young people, is very common

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:45.280
 and it shows up most often

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:48.440
 as simply bad breath in the morning.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.920
 - Reverse peristalsis, go figure.

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:54.240
 Here's someone that's chronically underweight, they say,

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.640
 despite eating high calorie foods

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.160
 filled with carbohydrates, fats, and protein.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:06.080
 And I'm experiencing low thyroid,

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.120
 so could the related low thyroid be the cause of this?

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:13.520
 - Yeah, over the years I've talked to,

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:19.160
 I think three or four young middle-aged men,

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:21.680
 20s and 30s, early 40s,

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:26.400
 who were eating maybe 4,000 calories a day

01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:31.400
 and still weighed only 135 or 145 pounds,

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.440
 just couldn't put on any muscle.

01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:37.240
 And my own experience was that

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.200
 through my late teens and 20s,

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.040
 I ate gigantic amounts,

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.200
 produced huge amounts of heat and steam,

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:50.360
 but stayed at the same weight,

01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:53.520
 165 or 170.

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:58.520
 And as soon as I experimented taking thyroid,

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:03.520
 my caloric requirement decreased by 30 or 40%

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:07.760
 and I suddenly was able to put on weight.

01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:12.640
 And so I mentioned thyroid supplements to these men.

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.400
 Each one of them had the same experience.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:18.440
 Immediately they were able to put on weight.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.440
 That's because thyroid is our basic anabolic hormone.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:30.680
 That was published in endocrine textbooks 80 years ago.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:37.040
 A picture of people who had experienced removal

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.360
 of their thyroid gland without replacement

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.840
 of a thyroid supplement.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.360
 They wasted away, it was called the cachexia,

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.840
 the wasting disease caused by thyroid deprivation.

01:41:54.840 --> 01:42:01.920
 - I mentioned to you in an email,

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.640
 I was gonna try the Sinoplus,

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.440
 my TSH is up a little,

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.960
 and I ordered it from Mexico

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:09.880
 and it ended up with the FDA in Chicago

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.960
 and it's held in ransom.

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.720
 It's a shame that they've done that.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:16.160
 Maybe it's just a one-off thing, I hope.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:19.240
 Have you heard anybody else of that happening too?

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.200
 - Um, just occasionally.

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:26.200
 - Okay, it was probably just a bad karma for Patrick.

01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.640
 - I think it's like a lottery.

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.800
 - Yeah, it's like a lottery.

01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.080
 You just take your, pays your money, you take your chances.

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.840
 Few more here.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.960
 Oh Stella, this is interesting.

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.360
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat,

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.640
 I'm in my 20s, struggling with self-pleasuring

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.800
 for five years since been with someone,

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.120
 wondering what I can do to control

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.320
 sexual urges and desires.

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.440
 I'm suffering.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:53.720
 Wow, interesting.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:59.560
 - Having hormone tests as part of it,

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:04.560
 the ability to get satisfaction

01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.480
 is an essential part of the sexual response.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.760
 Arousal is a big part, but satisfaction is the end of it.

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:21.000
 And that thyroid and related hormones

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.200
 are essential parts of that.

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.920
 - So if the thyroid is out of balance,

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.560
 that can make other things be out of balance.

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:32.400
 - Yeah, the estrogen goes up in relation

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.320
 to progesterone and the androgens.

01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:40.320
 And estrogen is the gadfly that creates arousal,

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:49.000
 but progesterone and the androgen and thyroid

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
 are the things that create the energy process

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
 that gives satisfaction.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.480
 - I see, interesting.

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:00.520
 Hi Dr. Peat, I love your newsletter, thank you.

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.200
 You're turning me into a PhD.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.860
 My question is, can you talk about the symptoms

01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:08.320
 of shingles, how to address these symptoms

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.640
 and how to keep this virus, in quotes,

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:14.200
 is it a virus, he says dormant, thank you.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:21.240
 - A good non-inflammatory diet is the first thing,

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:28.760
 but aspirin is the most generally useful drug

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:34.420
 for turning off the herpes virus in particular.

01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:40.240
 When you get your nutrition up and use aspirin regularly,

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:48.440
 that will quiet the nerves that are creating

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:51.680
 the excitement that causes the virus to replicate.

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:59.200
 - So this little guy gets in there, this herpes virus,

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:01.480
 and it never kind of goes away

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.960
 and just comes alive sometimes?

01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:08.960
 - Yeah, the nucleic acid of it lives in the cell body

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:13.820
 and only when the organism is under stress,

01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:19.340
 when the pituitary is activated by a change of season,

01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:24.340
 for example, this activates the virus

01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:29.860
 to travel down the nerve fiber into the skin

01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:35.820
 where it produces the sore and becomes infectious.

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:41.140
 And at that point, probably an ointment

01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:47.340
 or a wash containing dissolved aspirin

01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.540
 will help at the surface,

01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:52.340
 but the quieting anti-inflammatory effect

01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:57.340
 of aspirin systemically reduces that continuing process.

01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:03.820
 So keeping your energy up with good food and thyroid

01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:06.660
 supplemented with aspirin as needed

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:13.140
 is the quickest way to bring a shingles attack to a close.

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:15.740
 - Yeah, so I guess that would explain,

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:19.820
 and you hear stories over the years of brides

01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.580
 who are so excited that they show up

01:46:22.580 --> 01:46:24.380
 on their wedding day with a cold sore, right?

01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:27.480
 I mean, it kind of makes sense sometimes.

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:31.820
 - Yeah, yeah, emotional nervous excitement

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.100
 is a major thing.

01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.820
 - Mike wants to know what a holiday dinner feast

01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:39.100
 looks like at the Dr. Peat's household.

01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.340
 - Oh, very simple.

01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:42.180
 - Very simple?

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:47.580
 - Often just a fine stew.

01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:49.140
 - Make a stew or something?

01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:49.980
 - Mm-hmm.

01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.500
 Couple more here.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:54.780
 Let's see.

01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.900
 Thanks for being listening, Dr. Peat, for a long time.

01:46:56.900 --> 01:46:58.220
 I'm glad you have him on.

01:46:58.220 --> 01:46:59.920
 Can you ask his thoughts,

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:03.180
 is there any connection to Lyme disease

01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:05.620
 and anything he would recommend for someone

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.860
 with Lyme and ALS?

01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:10.220
 - ALS?

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:13.120
 - ALS, yes, and Lyme's connection.

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:18.120
 - Oh, well, ALS is the degenerative nerve disease, right?

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.100
 Lou Gehrig's disease. - I believe so, yeah.

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:21.100
 Lou Gehrig's, yeah.

01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:26.340
 - Lyme disease is definitely a bacterial

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:28.500
 spirochete-type infection,

01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:31.980
 and it can be cured two or three weeks,

01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:36.140
 maybe using two or three antibiotics at the same time,

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:39.260
 but there are some doctors that claim

01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:44.260
 that it's a perpetual thing that takes endless treatment,

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:50.460
 but really it's very cleanly eradicated

01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.860
 by a good course of antibiotics.

01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:59.420
 I've had experience only with one person

01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.780
 with confirmed ALS,

01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:07.780
 and he started changing his diet and behavior

01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:13.260
 right at the very beginning,

01:48:13.260 --> 01:48:18.260
 and he met a lot of other patients at the same stage

01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:21.340
 in the neurologist's office,

01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:25.420
 and so he watched the course of their disease

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:28.780
 very similar to his for the first few months,

01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:32.600
 but then suddenly he started getting better

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.780
 as they kept getting worse,

01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:39.780
 and all he was doing was changing his hormones

01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:45.520
 and nutrients, the things that we've been talking about,

01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:51.220
 but also every day he would shine a bright light

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.060
 on the back of his neck in particular

01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:58.580
 for an hour or more every day,

01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:02.860
 making sure he was getting penetrating light

01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:04.400
 into his nervous system,

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.580
 as well as doing all of the anti-inflammatory,

01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:11.540
 pro-energetic things,

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:16.540
 and he had reached a point where he bought equipment

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:21.420
 for using the bathroom, hoists,

01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.020
 and all of that sort of equipment,

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:29.020
 and quit his job at his own business,

01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:34.380
 and was ready basically to become a complete invalid,

01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:40.820
 but then suddenly his improvement started,

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:46.540
 and in less than a year from the time he started,

01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.340
 he was completely recovered,

01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:52.540
 sold all of his machinery,

01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:53.940
 and went back to work.

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.260
 - I'll be, I'll be.

01:49:55.260 --> 01:49:57.500
 - At the age of 70 or 71.

01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:58.780
 - That's fascinating.

01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:01.420
 Do you think exposure to red light

01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:04.140
 and the various lights that are available ongoing

01:50:04.140 --> 01:50:06.180
 is benefit for the body?

01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:09.700
 - I think a plain, like a--

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:10.700
 - Chicken lamp?

01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:15.300
 - Chicken lamp, plain clear front light bulb is good.

01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:19.100
 It has all of the spectrum,

01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:23.820
 and we aren't sure exactly which wavelengths

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:26.020
 are the therapeutic ones.

01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:28.180
 Red definitely is part of it,

01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:31.580
 but I think it's good to have orange and yellow

01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:32.420
 at the same time.

01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:33.460
 - And those chicken lamps,

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:37.980
 I think you can actually get at Home Depot, right?

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:40.620
 And you just put 'em in there, 10 bucks?

01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.640
 - Five dollars, they should be.

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:47.580
 - Is anyone doing, here's an interesting one,

01:50:47.580 --> 01:50:49.480
 is anyone doing, Dr. Peat,

01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:52.780
 the William Budd maintenance method

01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:54.880
 for type one diabetes today?

01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.100
 The urine must be measured to match the glucose

01:50:58.100 --> 01:51:00.980
 going into the glucose going out, doesn't it?

01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:08.940
 - Well, it spontaneously does that.

01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:13.860
 The more sugar you eat, the more will come out,

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:18.540
 except that, yeah, if you do that,

01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:23.540
 that will reduce the consumption of your good tissues,

01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:26.620
 converting them to sugar.

01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:29.500
 So if you eat as much as you're losing,

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:36.500
 that will tend to cure the process.

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:41.740
 It stops the stress, which is destroying your pancreas.

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:46.940
 And I've only known a few people

01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:50.820
 who decided to get off the program

01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:55.820
 and start eating a balanced high-carbohydrate diet,

01:51:55.820 --> 01:52:00.100
 and they had the same experience

01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.420
 that those doctors did 140 years ago.

01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:10.500
 - George says, "I'm experimenting with thyroid medicine

01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:11.980
 "I did get from Mexico."

01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.560
 Patrick, oh, okay.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:16.300
 And my TSH is about four,

01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:19.380
 and I'm wondering how I could determine

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:22.860
 at the right dosage if I was getting too much.

01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:25.780
 What would be some signs that I'm taking too much?

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:28.260
 - Overheating is the first thing.

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:30.760
 - Overheating, meaning taking your temperature

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.300
 first thing in the morning?

01:52:32.300 --> 01:52:36.660
 - No, just feeling too hot, out of breath,

01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:39.060
 and then checking your temperature.

01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:43.020
 Your temperature might get to 99 all day,

01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:48.020
 but if your pulse rate is going 120 at rest,

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:50.940
 that's definitely too much.

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:55.340
 So you should aim for a daytime 98.6

01:52:55.340 --> 01:52:58.180
 and 80 to 85 pulse rate.

01:52:58.180 --> 01:52:59.020
 - Wow.

01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:05.020
 So 80 to 85 is normal for a thyroid normal person.

01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:10.380
 - Yeah, for a very metabolically active person

01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:14.380
 who's burning calories intensely.

01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:18.040
 - And it's higher even for girls, the pulse?

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.220
 - And the what?

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:22.940
 - And it's higher even for women, the pulse rate?

01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:24.020
 - Roughly, yeah.

01:53:24.020 --> 01:53:25.700
 - A little bit?

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.540
 Wow.

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:29.260
 - Women have smaller hearts,

01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:33.220
 so they beat faster for pumping the same amount of blood.

01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.580
 - I didn't know that.

01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:35.880
 Women have smaller hearts.

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:38.620
 I think we just, two more.

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:43.060
 So, can I use niacin on my left leg only

01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:46.180
 to improve circulation in that leg,

01:53:46.180 --> 01:53:50.180
 and foot, which has gotten pretty bad with MS,

01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:52.380
 I would have to take it internally?

01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:54.660
 Oh, niacin.

01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:59.660
 - I think generally niacin amide internally is the safest

01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:04.980
 because big doses of nixenic acid

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:09.500
 create increased prostaglandins

01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:12.140
 and have a lot of pro-inflammatory things

01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:16.340
 that I don't think are at all good for MS.

01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.820
 - So niacin amide, does that in general

01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:19.980
 increase circulation?

01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:22.500
 Does it do the flushing thing?

01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.500
 - It improves metabolism.

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:25.540
 - Metabolism.

01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:30.540
 - By reducing free fatty acids that block oxidation.

01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:33.860
 - Leon is in San Diego.

01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:37.860
 I experience bloating one to two hours

01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:39.140
 after my evening meal.

01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:43.940
 I've done a food list and journal,

01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:47.060
 and it doesn't seem to be associated with any food.

01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:48.740
 It happens with all food.

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:50.740
 I'm wondering if Dr. Peat thinks

01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:52.900
 I could be having not enough acid

01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.980
 or not enough enzymes or both.

01:54:54.980 --> 01:55:01.460
 - Yeah, and the peristalsis might be a problem too.

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:04.940
 So having some fiber in the diet

01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:07.740
 is one way of reducing inflammation

01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:10.300
 and stimulating peristalsis.

01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:12.460
 And then checking your body temperature.

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:16.140
 Usually a low body temperature

01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:19.300
 goes with sluggish peristalsis.

01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:22.500
 - I see, and so that could be causing his problems,

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:27.100
 the bloat, because the peristalsis is just happening.

01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:31.020
 - Yeah, the stomach and the intestine just sit there

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:36.020
 letting any gas that forms stay put and blow up,

01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:39.820
 where peristalsis should be squeezing out

01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:42.300
 little bits of gas as they form.

01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:44.780
 - I see, and then that would be,

01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:48.780
 different forms of fiber would be the psyllium husks maybe,

01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:50.620
 and mushrooms?

01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:54.180
 - Yeah, mushrooms are very pleasant.

01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:57.020
 Psyllium husks constipate a few people,

01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:58.920
 but when they work, they're fine.

01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:04.380
 Cooked bamboo shoots are good for some people.

01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:11.140
 Oat bran mush works all right, but it's very starchy.

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:15.700
 - Wow, so you keep that going and that causes things

01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:18.260
 to not back up like he's getting.

01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:20.020
 So that's the bloating.

01:56:20.020 --> 01:56:21.660
 It's just not moving downward.

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:26.820
 Let's see.

01:56:29.820 --> 01:56:31.100
 I think we have one more.

01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:34.980
 Please mention what a chicken lamp is.

01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.240
 What's a chicken, oh, these are chicken lamps

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:39.340
 where you can get at Home Depot, right, Doc?

01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:42.500
 And they're the big silver thing that you can put 'em in

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.860
 with a clamp.

01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:45.140
 You've seen those, you can find 'em

01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:46.660
 in the electrical department.

01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:49.580
 And a chicken lamp is go to the light department

01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:51.940
 at the Home Depot and they have these red,

01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:56.940
 I guess, are they LED or, near-red, aren't they lamps?

01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:59.620
 - Well, they're usually clear front.

01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.540
 The clear front is a lot cheaper.

01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.820
 - Oh.

01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:06.020
 - And it has just as much red light.

01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:08.540
 - Really, so you don't even need the red front.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:11.940
 - No, the red front cuts out blue light,

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:16.220
 so gives a red appearance, but the clear front

01:57:16.220 --> 01:57:19.280
 is putting out just as much red radiation.

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:22.620
 - But isn't the blue light an issue

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:27.280
 for turning off melatonin, or is it different blue light

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:30.380
 from the computer and a television screen?

01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:32.500
 - Well, the good thing about the chicken lamp

01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:34.660
 is there's very little blue in it.

01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:35.500
 - Okay.

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:38.700
 - Because it runs warmer, less hot.

01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:39.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:42.420
 Well, Dr. Peat, good job.

01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:43.500
 We kept you a long time.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:46.180
 Thanks for hanging with us.

01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:48.780
 Happy holidays, Merry Christmas to you.

01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:52.940
 And we will see you, I guess, in the third week in January.

01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:56.460
 And so have fun and stay out of trouble.

01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:59.280
 And appreciate you being here once a month.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:00.900
 It's really an honor, sir.

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.580
 - Oh, okay, very good, thank you.

01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.640
 - Thank you, sir.

01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:08.640
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:15.020
 Well, we are going to take some time off here.

01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:24.040
 It is December 21st, the winter solstice,

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:24.960
 all kinds of things.

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:27.200
 Pluto is getting together with Saturn

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:29.620
 and all kinds of fun things are happening.

01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:33.660
 Goodness knows, the astrological people

01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:37.900
 are just all kind of at Twitter this time of the year,

01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:39.840
 some of the things that are going on

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:41.880
 with the winter solstice.

01:58:41.880 --> 01:58:46.360
 And tonight, a couple hours after sunset,

01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:49.320
 wherever you are, you can go on there

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:53.920
 and see the whole, the planets doing their little thing.

01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:58.920
 Saturn and, is it Saturn and, yeah, here they are.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:02.080
 It's kind of fun.

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:07.200
 Well, Saturn and Jupiter, they're like the closest

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:10.200
 they've been in since 1226.

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:16.760
 Hello, that's a long time, closest they've been.

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:21.560
 So the astrological people say some pretty exciting things

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:24.040
 are gonna be happening on planet Earth.

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:27.000
 Things get turned upside down and turned over

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
 and if one kind of wants to morph these ideas

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.580
 into the struggle that's going on in our culture

01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:46.120
 for to save our republic, and that's what I believe this is.

01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.520
 This is not about Donald Trump and Joe Biden,

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.360
 much bigger deal.

01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:56.360
 This is a real, a real third act of a movie

01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:02.480
 and it is, in my opinion, a struggle for our republic

02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:06.720
 to save this country from going the way of a globalist

02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:09.280
 who wanna change the whole deal.

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:11.780
 And this is what it's about and it's a big deal.

02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:18.800
 You can go on our parlor page

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:19.840
 and we talk about it a little bit,

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.960
 but there's a lot of people talking about it.

02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:25.160
 You don't need us, but just keep in touch with us

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:27.120
 during this end of the year.

02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:28.660
 I'll be in touch on email.

02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:34.560
 If we can do anything for you, please let us know.

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.200
 I'll be around and we'll see you back

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.000
 on the beginning of January.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.440
 But so who knows what's gonna be going on

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:47.200
 between now and then and then after January.

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.280
 And so we're gonna see.

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.620
 We'll see what's going on.

02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:55.560
 Lots and lots of very exciting things.

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.360
 You might, this is an interesting story that is out today.

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:07.080
 President Trump is out today saying

02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:10.280
 we are closer and closer than ever to

02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:19.000
 succeeding in our second term.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.640
 So he's got something going on that's way above and beyond

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:26.560
 what we're being told the possibilities are.

02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.040
 But we've been writing about it.

02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:31.120
 You'll see him on our parlor thing and you'll see him,

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.080
 now I guess we'll go on MeWe and do that.

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:36.060
 But we've done some shows on that,

02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:40.040
 but you do your research and kinda keep in touch

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.640
 and we'll see what happens.

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.680
 Could be a whole brave new world

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:47.240
 by the time we get together.

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:50.360
 I guess it'll be January 4th, right, with Adam Bergstrom.

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:57.640
 So one last little plug for Surthrival.

02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:02.640
 There's a 21%, 21% sale going on right now

 the Digestive Bitters, which we like a lot,

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.280
 Colostrum, I guess that's about it.

02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:33.760
 Lot of great products.

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.880

02:02:49.080 --> 02:02:51.360
 Okay, so we're out of here.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:56.080
 We will see you live back on the 4th of January

02:02:56.080 --> 02:02:57.380
 with Adam Bergstrom.

02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:03.240
 We have all of our videos now being laid out on our website.

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:06.560
 You don't need to go to YouTube or anywhere else.

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.880
 If you'd like to watch the videos of these people,

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:11.800
 oneradionetwork.com, you'll see the videos.

02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.880
 They're all being propagated there.

02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:17.140
 We've no longer doing the Facebook thing.

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:21.160
 And we're on Parler and MeWe,

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.800
 and we can keep in touch there.

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:25.800
 This is mostly the MeWe for you all,

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:27.520
 you all, we say that in Texas,

02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:30.480
 for you all to communicate with one another.

02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:32.100
 You don't need me.

02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:35.000
 And you can, you know, talk amongst yourself

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.800
 and just be kind and don't get snarky on MeWe.

02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.960
 But at least they're a free platform

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:44.360
 and there's no censorship going on on MeWe

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.640
 that we know of, as well as Parler.

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.640
 We're just tired of YouTube and Facebook,

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:55.640
 and they really are just not very good people

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:59.000
 censoring just everything.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.960
 So, goodness knows what their karma dharma is,

02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:03.760
 but we don't want any part of them.

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:06.920
 So we're just blowing the popsicle stand.

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.360
 It's over.

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:11.360
 Sorry, Mark, we are breaking up, Mr. Zuck.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.820
 Godspeed.

02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:14.240
 So I love you all very much.

02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:15.840
 Thank you for everything.

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:16.920
 It's been an honor to be here.

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:18.400
 It's been quite a year.

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:21.240
 This is a wrap for 2020.

02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.200
 We've all been through quite a bit,

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.980
 just depending on how much of the movie

02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:29.120
 that we bought into during the year.

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:33.280
 And we've all bought into a little bit of it.

02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:37.520
 So, but we've made it through.

02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.920
 We're stronger than we ever were.

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:43.280
 Stronger than we ever were.

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:46.380
 Or whatever.

02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:49.740
 I think we have a note here from Adam.

02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:55.000
 Oh, Adam wants to be friends on MeWe.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.600
 Yeah, I'll do that, okay.

02:04:56.600 --> 02:05:05.300
 (laughs)

02:05:05.300 --> 02:05:06.500
 Adam has a MeWe thing.

02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:08.900
 Visit with Adam on MeWe as well.

02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:14.500
 Remember, 20 years ago, Zuckerberg started like a MeWe.

02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:17.300
 I think we have 75 friends or something.

02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:20.260
 Doesn't matter.

02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:22.020
 All right, kids, have fun.

02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.260
 Take care of yourself.

02:05:23.260 --> 02:05:30.940
 I love you.

02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:32.900
 May the blessings be.

02:05:32.900 --> 02:05:33.740
 Take care.

02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:37.600
 (upbeat music)

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:43.780
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:47.700
