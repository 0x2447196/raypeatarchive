00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.840
 Know the source.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.520
 One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.280
 Okay, sorry for our little bit late start.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.280
 We generally start at 1030 central on the third Monday, whatever it is, on One Radio

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.840
 Network dot com with a very popular guest, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.880
 He has a PhD and Dr. Peat has been at this idea of looking at human nutrition, healing,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.040
 how the body works for a very, very long time.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.440
 A PhD from years ago.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.000
 He's a nutritional counselor.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.120
 He got his PhD from University of Oregon and he specialized in physiology.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.520
 Started his work in hormones in '68, way back when I was in the military and I remember

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.680
 kind of a wild year where, if I recall, it was Bobby Kennedy was killed, President Johnson

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.160
 decided not to run, and Martin Luther King was murdered and for what that's worth.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.880
 And then he wrote his dissertation in '72 and really talked about progesterone and hormones

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 and such.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.600
 And he's here, as I said, on the third Monday at 1030 central time, a little bit late.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.440
 But Dr. Ray Peat, good morning to you, sir.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 How are you?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 Good morning.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 Very well.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.440
 Yeah?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 Yeah.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.480
 You're an orange juice guy.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.600
 How do you drink orange juice every day?

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600
 Yeah.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.440
 I start out with either coffee con leche or orange juice.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 So you start off with what?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.520
 Coffee and milk.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520
 Coffee and milk.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 Mm-hmm.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.680
 And then orange juice.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.320
 Over the years, we were told by our moms and school people that it's not too good to drink

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 orange juice because it has too much sugar in it.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 Remember that?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.240
 During the night, we use up almost all of our stored glucose, stored glycogen.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.360
 And that's why almost everyone has very high cortisol in the morning, the stress hormone.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.400
 And that's because it begins turning our good tissues, everything from the bones to the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.280
 skin, starts breaking down as dawn approaches because we're using up our stored sugar and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.680
 we need sugar to keep the brain alive and the blood cells.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.920
 And so the stress hormones come up near dawn and start breaking down our tissues to feed

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.160
 the brain.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.520
 Is that similar to having the lowest blood sugar in the morning or just this is more

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 glucose taking more sugar in?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.960
 In the biggest group of people, low blood sugar happens around 3 to 4 or 5 a.m.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:18.160
 And that starts the intense surge in all of the stress hormones, not just cortisol, but

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:29.000
 rising serotonin, histamine, parathyroid hormone, everything related to stress and breakdown

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.800
 of tissues.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:41.480
 People starting around menopause start losing almost all of their daily bone loss, starts

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.480
 in the early morning hours.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.960
 And when they start eating sugar and get the blood sugar back up to lower the stress hormones,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:00.720
 then the rest of the day, they don't lose a significant amount of bone or other tissue.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:09.560
 The bone loss is just an easily measured sign that your body is being torn down.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.080
 It happens to your skin and everything that isn't protected by hormones like testosterone

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080
 and progesterone.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.160
 So let's talk about that.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.240
 So the progesterone and hormone, which you're really one of the experts at, have been in

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 a long time.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.400
 By the way, if you'd like to be on the air with Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920
 We're just audio this morning.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.280
 We'll get this video thing.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.400
 We almost got it going, working, and we'll try it again tomorrow after doing a little

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 tech stuff.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.040
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com, 888-663-6386.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.320
 So let's go back.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.800
 So three o'clock or so, the body starts running down on glucose, the hormones, and the cortisol

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.920
 levels.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.280
 And that's really the beginning of losing bone and also where the skin will look a little

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.400
 ruffled maybe in the morning or wrinkles and stuff like that?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:16.760
 Yeah, it's actually a little bit weaker and thinner, but water replaces the lost tissue.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.960
 So you don't always notice that it looks thinner and tending to wrinkle.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.400
 But yeah, the skin does look worse in aging people after the age of about 45 or so.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
 In the morning?

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400
 In the morning.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.400
 In the morning.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.800
 So could we eat something before bed, right before bed, that would help with this issue?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.520
 Yeah.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:52.000
 Sort of like an athlete socks up on carbohydrates for a day or even in the couple of hours before

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.160
 a marathon or whatever.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:05.080
 You want to get your muscles, liver, and brain well supplied with glucose, glycogen, and

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:14.240
 so carbohydrate as your late afternoon or early evening meal is very important.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:22.920
 And right at bedtime, a big surge of calcium such as a glass of milk helps to hold down

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:33.120
 the parathyroid hormone which specializes in bone destruction, mobilizes the calcium,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:40.760
 and coming out of the bone, the calcium then activates the breakdown of your blood vessels

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.040
 and skin and tends to calcify blood vessels.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:53.800
 So the calcium coming out of your bone doesn't just innocently get into the urine, but on

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:01.800
 the way there, it is exciting, helping to break down and age all of your tissues.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.400
 So what if somebody wanted to get some good stuff right before bed, but they didn't like

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:13.960
 milk or they were dairy or lactose intolerant or something, would there be a substitute?

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:24.640
 Nothing is as good as milk because milk is very specialized for stimulating, optimizing

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.360
 the absorption of calcium and magnesium.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:39.160
 Not only the lactose, but the various proteins in milk prepare the lining of the intestine

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:47.160
 to very efficiently absorb the calcium and magnesium.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:56.240
 You can absorb it if you have orange juice and, for example, either the juice or the

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:03.240
 cooked leaf of kale, for example, is very rich in calcium and magnesium.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:11.160
 So if you have a big serving of cooked kale and a glass of orange juice, that won't be

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.800
 as good as milk or cheese, but next best thing.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800
 Before bed.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800
 Before bed.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.520
 Actually, actually have kale before bed.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:26.800
 Milk and cheese sounds like tastier than that, but you know, whatever works for you.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.280
 Is okay with goat or cow milk or camel or anything else works?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:43.320
 I think camel and sheep milk are kind of thick, high on energy and fat, but they would work,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.160
 but you would get fatter than low-fat cow milk.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:56.760
 One percent cow milk or reduced fat goat milk is probably the best source for most people

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.840
 because if you're working all day on a farm, for example, it's fine to drink a gallon of

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:12.200
 whole milk because you're spending so many calories, but even drinking two quarts a day

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.080
 of whole milk, the average sedentary person is going to get fat.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:24.520
 Boy, milk though, as you know, milk has sure gotten a bad rap, especially more so in the

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.040
 natural world over the last, what, 25 years, Dr. Peat?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:36.400
 And then the mainstream, people in the mainstream still drink some milk, but not too many people

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.880
 in the natural world think, they've been told it's terrible, you can't exhort it, it was

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.400
 only meant for cows and all kinds of stuff, right?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:49.480
 Yeah, and if you look at the culture, it's getting fatter and fatter, and milk happens

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:58.400
 to be the best weight loss food there is because the high calcium assimilation from it increases

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:08.480
 our metabolic rate, the combination of protein and calcium and magnesium is ideal for increasing

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.520
 our ability to burn calories.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.960
 That's interesting, that is so interesting.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:21.160
 And that plays along with the whole idea that we were sold, Doc, when was it, I guess early

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:27.240
 '90s, you know, that fat was bad, and that's when the whole low-fat thing really came on

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240
 board, right?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:35.600
 Yeah, the fat has to be adjusted to your activity level.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:42.800
 If you're burning 5,000 calories a day, you can handle the fat of something like whole

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:52.480
 milk, but I found when I was in graduate school that drinking a gallon a day of 2% milk, I

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.560
 was starting to get fat, so I changed to 1% and have stayed the same weight ever since.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.920
 But we've heard, though, that if you're gonna drink milk, it's best just to go with the

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.800
 whole stuff, though, the whole, no, the whole thing?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.320
 The full fat, the full fat, I guess.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:24.040
 Yeah, the high fat content is for a high work, high energy expenditure, and if you aren't

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:34.160
 spending 5,000 calories a day doing hard physical work, it's necessarily going to store as fat.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.040
 So what about, say if you wake up in the middle of the night, 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock, could

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.880
 be a blood sugar thing, would orange juice work there as well?

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.560
 Oh, very well.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.560
 Really?

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:54.840
 I usually use a glass of milk with a spoonful of sugar in it, but orange juice is fine.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:03.720
 I've even used Coke when I was traveling and woke up at 3 a.m. and needed sugar, and Coke

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720
 worked all right.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720
 Yeah, very interesting.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:13.680
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.800
 So here we are, gosh, July 20.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.440
 I think the whole COVID thing, we're kind of tired of talking about it, but I'm sure

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.600
 that you've looked at a lot of different things over the past three, four, five months.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.000
 We've talked to it in past shows.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.680
 Give me your, on July 20 here, with your opinion and all the research you do and the people

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:43.240
 that you talk to, can you give us your best opinion about what's going on as far as a

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.720
 virus, communicable, no virus, bioweapon, body makes the virus, whatever.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.920
 Do you have an opinion on it?

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:58.280
 Is there any kind of real, let me finish it for a second, is there any kind of real science

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:06.920
 that is provable, or is it all just conjecture, even from a credentialed fellow like yourself?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:17.960
 That's what I've been asking myself for, starting in February and March, I began writing down

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:26.640
 and looking at the numbers published by the Centers for Disease Control, and comparing

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:35.840
 them to previous years, and starting in the first week of January this year, the numbers

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:47.680
 of weekly deaths consistently over the last many years, they've completed their national

00:13:47.680 --> 00:14:00.120
 compilation of deaths throughout the country within two weeks of reference week, and so

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:06.040
 starting in the third week, I was writing down the finished numbers for the first week

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:17.360
 of the year, and then comparing those numbers to the previous week in 2019, and after I'd

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:24.280
 done this for two or three months, I noticed that someone on the internet had been doing

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.400
 the same thing, only more thoroughly going back several decades.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:37.040
 What I was seeing was a sharp drop in the weekly mortality, referring to the previous

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:48.440
 year, a sudden drop of 10-15% from last fall, and I couldn't find any historical precedent,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:56.760
 and this person who has a website, I think his name is Joe Hoft, H-O-F-T, anyway, he

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:04.720
 did it for previous decades and came up with the same results.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:14.560
 The mortality peak in last fall started at steep rise, exactly like every preceding year,

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:23.520
 the winter pneumonia deaths, but then suddenly around January 1st, there was a crash in the

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.800
 deaths all around the United States.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:35.280
 People were dying less often from all causes, and that went on through March.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:42.840
 There is this weird, it's like a volcano collapsing and making a crater, a historically unique

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:56.760
 mortality curve, and then if you look back at 10-15% unhistorical lack of deaths, suddenly

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:06.000
 in the first week of April, all of those missing deaths reappear in a gigantic, again, unhistorical

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.840
 peak, which they called the COVID death peak.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:21.800
 And basically, there's no way that can happen, even if the bubonic plague started up, you

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:31.920
 just can't get a historical collapse of total mortality all around the country that way.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:38.320
 I think the only way a criminal prosecutor could interpret it would be that someone was

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:46.600
 fiddling the numbers with foreknowledge that they were going to want a lot of deaths to

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:55.200
 report, so they trimmed impossibly the total mortality to have a big pile of deaths to

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.040
 report in April.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040
 Interesting.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:04.240
 So, you can actually see where there was something done to the numbers in, what was it, you're

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.000
 saying in late fall and early winter?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.640
 No, the death curve was perfectly normal right through December.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:22.480
 And then it was just about the first week of January that if you plot their own numbers,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.360
 you see this, it looks like a volcanic crater forming.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:36.560
 A peak starts up and then collapses and then comes up super sharp on the other side.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.320
 To make it look like there was a big "pow!"

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:50.640
 Yeah, except they haven't explained why those tens of thousands of people weren't dying

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:56.720
 in the run-up, almost three months.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.680
 Wow.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.720
 So.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:12.120
 They didn't give out any explanation or show that anything real was happening, that they

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:24.320
 were just talking about this week 15 people died with a diagnosis and so on.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:31.400
 You see the same thing happening now in Texas and Florida.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:40.640
 They say a month ago there were only 10 or 15 people per day dying.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.360
 Today 25 people died.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.720
 Everyone should panic, we're all going to die.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:54.200
 But when you look at the daily mortality in the state with 30 million, every day hundreds

00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:00.440
 of people, 700 or 800 people are dying of all causes.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:10.040
 And what they're saying is today twice as many people died with a diagnosis of COVID

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.360
 as did on a given day the previous month.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:24.280
 But if you look at the number of daily tests given and look at the curve of COVID-diagnosed

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:35.840
 deaths, the rise in the daily tests given exactly corresponds to the rise in the daily

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:44.560
 diagnosed COVID deaths, and you can't really diagnose for sure that someone has the virus

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.880
 unless you do the test.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:55.640
 And if the number of diagnosed people rises exactly as the number of tests administered

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:04.120
 rises, then you have no evidence that anything at all is happening.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:14.200
 Does the PCR or DNA test give with any amount of accuracy that someone has a unique virulent

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.920
 potentially deadly communicable virus in their body?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:30.160
 Well any virus is likely to be communicable and if you're in a very particular weakened

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.480
 state just about any virus can be deadly.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:45.640
 Any old cold virus or just the most trivial sort of virus can push a very sick person

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.920
 over the edge.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:59.400
 But the PCR test will find, even if you have just sitting on your mucus harmlessly, you

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:09.800
 could have a rabies virus or whatever, one of them sitting on a piece of spare mucus,

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:17.200
 the PCR test would find it and say you had rabies, but that virus might never have reached

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.320
 your living tissue.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:28.000
 So when we're seeing antibodies, it doesn't mean that someone has a unique virus called

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.160
 COVID in there.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:41.920
 Well the antibody, if their antibodies are truly specific for that particular antigen,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.600
 that's a very different thing from the PCR test.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:57.440
 The PCR test will amplify the most trivial amount of viral information, but to form antibodies

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:05.560
 that are more or less specific to that virus means that your immune system was exposed

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.280
 to it, but it doesn't mean you ever got sick from it.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:19.840
 So which one is the antibody test, the other than the PCR test?

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.120
 Like the PCR test, we have two, right?

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.960
 The PCR test and the DNA test?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.720
 The PCR test is for either RNA or DNA.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.040
 And then what's the other test they're using?

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:40.880
 The antibody test is to see if you have been exposed to it and formed antibodies in your

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.880
 blood.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.440
 Is that considered a positive test that they're reporting?

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:52.360
 Well it means that you've been exposed to it, but you might have had sniffles from it

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:59.880
 and not even noticed that you had anything and you can still form antibodies.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:07.360
 Like when you eat a new food, you're likely to form antibodies.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:16.960
 Your immune system is testing foods that you've eaten and checking them and preparing antibodies

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.720
 so that you will be tolerant to that food.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:29.920
 It prepares to block any irritation from that food if your immune system is good.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:36.160
 So the antibodies means you're safe from that particular antigen.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.960
 It's a barrier against any further action by that particular thing.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:48.240
 Do you know which test are giving most often, the PCR or the antibodies?

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:57.120
 No, for a time the CDC was listing the numbers all mixed together.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:08.280
 So for weeks their numbers were totally meaningless because they were blending everything together

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:17.680
 and saying that these are the numbers of people with COVID, but absolutely different tests

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.140
 mixed together don't mean anything.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:29.720
 So when governors and mayors and people are closing cities and masking orders and all

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:38.160
 that using people testing positive, which are called new cases, can you conjecture of

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:47.520
 what percent accurate that is?

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:54.080
 Well it's accurate in the sense that they have a positive result, but it doesn't mean

00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:02.040
 that people were at all sick or if they were sick, it doesn't mean that if they died, it

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:08.600
 might have been a stroke or heart attack or trauma from falling out a window or something.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:18.000
 But if they had the presence of the virus, they were put down as a COVID death.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.480
 Two or three months ago, Deborah Birx, who used to appear in all the press conferences

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:38.560
 with Fauci and Trump, she said the government is listing everyone positive for a COVID test

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.920
 as a COVID death.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:50.560
 She expressed what I was just saying that she no longer appears in the press conferences

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:59.880
 every day, starting right after making that sort of incriminating statement that there's

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:03.320
 no rational basis for what they're saying.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.840
 We posted an article, I'll just read you the first paragraph to get your opinion, with

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:13.640
 Dr. Ray Peat, if you'd like to be on the show, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com, a high-profile

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.240
 European pathologist is reporting that he and his colleagues across Europe have found

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.160
 no evidence of any deaths from a novel coronavirus on that continent.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:30.280
 Dr. Stolen-Alexoff contacted the World Health Organization and he was accusing them of creating

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:36.440
 worldwide fear and chaos without providing objective, variable proof of a pandemic.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:42.200
 And then along with that, the Bulgarian Pathology Association, he's part of that, they believe

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.080
 it's currently impossible to create a vaccine against the virus.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.080
 He also revealed that the European pathologists haven't identified anti-antibodies that are

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.600
 specific for SARS-CoV-2.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:27:03.400
 Well, the Bulgarian is exactly right about the impossibility of making a vaccine.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:16.480
 They've tried to make vaccines for the coronavirus, which is the common cold main cause for decades.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:27.040
 They've found that the virus mutates within a few months to become resistant to any vaccination.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:36.760
 And there's, being an RNA virus, all of these coronaviruses mutate about a hundred times

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:45.760
 faster than DNA virus and about a million times faster than mammalian DNA, very, very

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.520
 fast constant mutation rate.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.440
 Constant mutation, wow.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:28:00.240
 He's right on the impossibility of a vaccine, but his comment about the specific antibody,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:09.360
 he's using a specificity of an antibody in a particular way that isn't correct for general

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.200
 immunology.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:23.360
 You can have specificity as a composite of half a dozen different molecules that each

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:28.600
 one is roughly specific for the virus.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.360
 So you don't have to have one absolutely specific antibody.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:44.320
 He's thinking about the monoclonal specific antibody, but you don't need that kind of

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.440
 specificity to have a vaccine.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:54.160
 What about his statement on, has not found any evidence of any deaths?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:01.560
 That was a different group and I haven't read that paper, but I would agree that, how do

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:08.880
 you prove that a death was caused by a virus?

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:19.440
 In the case of hospital deaths, just recently news came out that the intensive care units

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:29.880
 have since the first months of the so-called pandemic, mortality has dropped by 30%.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:39.800
 What has happened around the country, they've discovered that when they intubate someone,

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:48.240
 the process of putting the tube in them and giving them powerful drugs to make them unconscious

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:58.600
 and relax their reflex muscle contractions, those drugs combined with forced respiration

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.480
 kill almost 100% of the people within a few weeks.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:11.240
 So they were killing 100% of their patients, practically 80 to 100% simply by the treatment

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.560
 they were giving them.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:21.680
 That came to be realized now simply by reducing the number of intubations for which the government

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:30.800
 was paying them $48,000 per patient tubed and killed.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:39.240
 Simply by reducing their greedy uptake of government money, they've cut intensive care

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.240
 unit mortality by a third.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:49.560
 So how long did this go on and any possibility of knowing how many deaths were attributed

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.320
 to this incorrect procedure?

00:30:53.320 --> 00:31:06.680
 When one doctor in Europe compared two nearby hospitals in Germany, he was working with

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:16.360
 one of them and he explained why the tubing was killing patients because it was irrationally

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.360
 disturbing their oxygen carbon dioxide balance.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:32.080
 So he just adjusting a nasal cannula, no drugs to relax them or stuffing tubes down their

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.320
 trachea.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:45.240
 His hospital mortality went to zero while the adjoining hospital continued to have 100%

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:55.680
 mortality and absolute all or none difference just by a conservative using standard nasal

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.320
 cannula gas mixing recipes.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:09.240
 He wasn't even recognizing the importance of having the proper balance of carbon dioxide

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.780
 but still he was not killing any of his patients.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:19.280
 Because when you just use the cannula, you're retaining the balance of carbon dioxide?

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.680
 Letting the patient balance it himself.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.240
 And so before they were just pushing in pure oxygen?

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:37.640
 Yeah, to different extents and that's been known now for generations that when you artificially

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:48.280
 ventilate someone, you override their rate regulating system and if you slightly exceed

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:57.040
 the oxygen dose, you drive out the carbon dioxide which is needed to deliver oxygen

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.200
 to the tissues and even open capillaries.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.080
 You shrink the blood vessels in the brain for example and starve the brain for oxygen

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.520
 because you're giving too much oxygen.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.880
 Yes, and different from using oxygen therapy but because this is putting it inside the

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.960
 body through unnatural means with a tube.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.420
 And you can give too much.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:33.280
 For example, just the difference in altitude, if a person is having a regulatory problem

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:40.680
 even at sea level, keep keeping their carbon dioxide up because they're forming lactic

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680
 acid.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.180
 There's a natural competition between lactic acid and carbon dioxide.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:56.100
 If a person tends towards stress or diabetes for example, their background lactic acid

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:05.060
 will indicate the appearance that they're under chronic exercise or something.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:14.700
 There will be a residual lactic acid level and if you add carbon dioxide, that will suppress

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:18.460
 glycolysis that makes the excess lactic acid.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:27.720
 So you can correct those signs of incipient diabetes and stress by adding some carbon

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.980
 dioxide.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:40.300
 And if you rise in altitude and are healthy, your body under lower oxygen pressure is able

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:48.980
 to regulate itself to maintain higher carbon dioxide than at sea level.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:56.660
 And so adapted people, they've known for at least 50 years, more like 70 years that they

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:07.580
 call it the lactic acid paradox that when you're adapted to high altitude, you can work

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:16.180
 full force and you make much less lactic acid than you would doing the same proportion of

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:18.900
 work at sea level.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:24.780
 So the altitude stops your excess lactic acid production.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.380
 That's because of the retained carbon dioxide.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:33.980
 So the lactic acid can be a real issue with all kinds of things including the heart muscles,

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:34.980
 right?

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.980
 And myocardia.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:48.140
 And some of the doctors have, one of the earliest New York City doctors reported that they weren't

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:53.220
 low in oxygen especially, but they were low in carbon dioxide.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:36:05.100
 And that lets the lactate rise and the lactic acid, even in the presence of normal amounts

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:15.500
 of oxygen, the presence of lactic acid creates what they call pseudo hypoxia or reductive

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:29.620
 stress which is similar to sepsis and all of the mortality associated features of COVID.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:40.100
 It's all basically a stress syndrome which is intensified by the treatment and the COVID

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:48.300
 has a very small role in triggering that in people who actually have a very intense respiratory

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.300
 infection.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:54.860
 So, in general, when we are exercising, we get stronger in lung capacity and such and

00:36:54.860 --> 00:37:01.420
 do not have to breathe as often while we're moving, whatever, treadmill or even walking.

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.740
 We're retaining more carbon dioxide, right?

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:10.180
 And then that puts more oxygen where we need it, in the cells, right?

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:14.420
 Yeah, that's when you're called fit.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.060
 That's when you're fit.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.060
 Or well adapted.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.060
 Well adapted.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:23.780
 You're making lots of carbon dioxide because you're really using your oxygen.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:29.460
 And using the oxygen without over breathing, right?

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:40.380
 A person who isn't fit produces lactic acid very easily, even with hardly any activity,

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.700
 their lactic acid begins to rise.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.260
 Because they're over breathing, just breathing too much?

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:53.300
 Yeah, if you, a perfectly healthy person, if they just sit still and pant for two or

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.180
 three minutes, they'll have a surge of lactic acid.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:04.340
 Because the carbon dioxide that suppresses it is gone and they'll produce a poisonous

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:09.820
 amount of lactic acid and that will cause edema.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:16.200
 You get cramps as an early sign of over breathing.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:24.820
 Your hands will drop and that's an indication of loss of carbon dioxide.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:32.860
 And along with that, your capillaries and arterioles start becoming edematous, swelling

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:38.220
 up and losing the ability to transmit oxygen.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:44.780
 So you can potentially kill yourself by intense over breathing.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:49.940
 So that's why, that's one of the root causes of edema is just over breathing.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:39:00.020
 Yeah, and probably 20 or 30% of the population could, you could find good evidence of over

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:06.180
 breathing relative to their needs and metabolism.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:12.060
 So the less breaths we take per minute, the better it is, right?

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:22.380
 Not necessarily a person with a very high fitness, the most intense metabolism, they

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.060
 need lots of fuel and oxygen.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:33.660
 They can sit still and productively burn three, maybe 4,000 calories just because their body

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:41.340
 is running at high, perfect metabolism.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:46.580
 So they need both lots of calories and lots of oxygen.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:52.780
 So you have to look at the body temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, everything

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.900
 to know what the respiration rate means.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:04.460
 So if we are exercising briskly and doing bursts and other things, rebounding and treadmills,

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:10.920
 and we get our pulse rate pretty high, I mean, maybe two, maybe three times our normal resting

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.140
 rate or more.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:19.740
 And if we can do that without breathing or over breathing and retaining carbon dioxide,

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.700
 is that a sign of good health?

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.340
 To get the heart rate up without having to breathe a lot?

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.020
 I don't think it is necessarily.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.380
 You have to look at the whole thing.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.620
 How many calories are you able to burn?

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:43.100
 How much oxygen can you dispose of in burning those calories?

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:51.380
 And the most fit person is running at a high rate even at rest.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:57.500
 So they can't get fat even if they sit around.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.340
 Because they're burning calories because they're fit.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:06.380
 That's why they stay fitter, just by burning.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.380
 Here's an email for you.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.340
 We love Dr. Peat.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.540
 Thank you for having him on.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.540
 You're welcome.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.860
 Thanks to Dr. Peat.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:21.180
 What's Dr. Peat's pregnenolone dosage guidelines for someone in their 30s?

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.740
 This is from watching on YouTube, the stream.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:33.060
 I was in my 40s, at 48, when I first tested it.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:42.220
 And the result was so absolute that I experimented with different amounts.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:49.940
 And I found that one dose of 300 milligrams would last me for 10 days.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.180
 And then my symptoms came back.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.100
 Or that would work out to 30 milligrams a day.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:03.260
 And I found many people, 10 or 20 milligram dose.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:10.380
 I had two or three experiences.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:18.740
 Two extremely depressed men, for example, they happened to be sipping a glass of wine

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:24.580
 and being very gloomy and talking about giving up their profession.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.380
 I dropped 10 or 20 milligrams on their wine.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:37.220
 And when they had consumed that, their face got pink instead of gray.

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:44.740
 They started grinning and making plans for improvements in their business.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.900
 Isn't that funny?

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:51.980
 Just in 15 minutes, you could see a change from that very, very small amount.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:59.620
 So it acts as a catalyst and can get your own production going.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:08.540
 And for an experiment, I took 3,000 milligrams a day for a year and felt fine.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:13.380
 But it was very expensive and wasteful.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:21.580
 So then I found that I didn't need any because it had repaired my system.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.580
 And animal studies are similar.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:33.980
 They gave rats a stomachful, I think it was a 10-gram wad, which would be like about a

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.180
 pound for a person to eat at once.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:43.100
 But it didn't have any hormonal effects at all unless they were under stress to begin

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.100
 with.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:49.460
 And it normalized, prevented excess cortisol production.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:54.900
 So that's why some people recommend even for guys to have a little dab of this pregnenolone,

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.100
 this natural stuff every day.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.100
 Yeah.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:03.060
 And lots of people have been reporting hormonal reactions from it.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.140
 That means it isn't good pregnenolone.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:11.380
 There should be absolutely no so-called hormonal effect.

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:20.100
 It should simply normalize things, lowering your ACTH and cortisol if they're too high,

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.940
 bringing them up if they're too low.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.660
 So you shouldn't feel anything.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.300
 You maybe just feel a little bit better or a little...

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:29.300
 Yeah.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:37.380
 And it could be if you're feeling depressed or weak or something, if it's what you need,

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:47.300
 and often it is when you're in your 40s, the effect happens in less than an hour and is

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.980
 a day or a night sort of change.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.020
 And this generally from the good stuff, where it's from yams, Doc?

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.020
 Wild yams?

00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:00.700
 No, it doesn't matter where it's made from as long as it's made by someone that knows

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.700
 what they're doing.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:09.220
 But in the last 15 years or so, it has become popular and there are dozens of little chemical

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:13.540
 companies popping up and there are no regulations.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:18.420
 It's not regulated as a drug or hormone or anything.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:30.860
 So you absolutely can't know without doing about a $3,000 analysis showing the absence

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:36.820
 of any of the antagonistic hormones like estrogen.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.340
 Oh, they could be in the product itself?

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:42.380
 As an impurity from manufacturing.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.780
 Oh, wow.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:49.260
 Do you have any clean companies you can recommend people?

00:45:49.260 --> 00:46:00.660
 No, but if you know that it's coming from one of the gigantic monopoly companies, they

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:06.820
 have a history of extreme cleanliness because they're monitored constantly.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.460
 Oh, you're actually better going with the big boys in this case?

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.460
 Yeah.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460
 It's cleaner.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.180
 They are regulated and the little ones aren't.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.180
 Interesting.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.180
 Hi, Dr. Peat.

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:25.260
 In the past, you've spoken favorably of the effects of a microdosing GHB.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:30.220
 In Canada, GHB is highly regulated and possible to acquire without a prescription and illegal

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.220
 to make yourself.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:35.100
 However, it can be legally purchased and possessed.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:41.460
 Is a healthy young adult male in a health, is it safe to ingest microdoses of GBL?

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.660
 GBL to get the same results.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.900
 Oh, GBL to get the same results.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.900
 What is the L?

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.900
 I don't know.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.900
 Gamma butyric lactone?

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:58.300
 Yeah, that's the paint thinner, I think.

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:08.620
 It used to be sold for 25 cents a quart or something as a paint thinner and very non-toxic,

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:14.300
 but a very powerful paint remover.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:25.260
 The FDA has this policy of knocking traditional safe drugs off the market and licensing even

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:33.700
 things that have been used for hundreds of years, licensing them to a single artificial

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:41.180
 monopoly so that company can raise it from a dime a dose to $100 a dose, which they've

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.820
 done for treating narcolepsy with GHB.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.660
 That's what GHB is, narcolepsy?

00:47:50.660 --> 00:48:10.660
 It was used previously for relaxing people before surgery.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:27.340
 Isn't GHB the date rape drug thing?

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.260
 It has been used that way, yeah.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:35.020
 It can kill a person in an overdose because it turns everything off.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.280
 And people are microdosing it, some people?

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:49.140
 If you eat passion fruit, you get a small measurable amount in the tasty passion fruit.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.140
 How'd we do?

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.820
 That's a good one.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.300
 Here's a question from Eric in Finland.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:07.660
 Can you give your insights into the Kelly Protocol surrounding its success and aspects

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:15.020
 that both Kelly and Gonzales used that the Francis Pottinger introduced to medical science,

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:21.940
 namely restoring health to a person by restoring proper autonomic nervous system balance by

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:28.820
 the sympathetic and parasympathetic components that comprise the system?

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:40.620
 Kelly got his idea from John Beard, who was a doctor at the beginning of the 20th century

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:52.020
 who theorized that cancer is an embryonic process gone wrong and that the pancreatic

00:49:52.020 --> 00:50:00.420
 enzymes digest proteins and are present in the blood.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:11.020
 The same pancreatic enzymes used to digest food by excreting them into the intestine

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:21.180
 are in the blood in the Beardian hypothesis and they digest these ovarian uterine reproductive

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:30.980
 hormones, in his theory, were involved in cancer.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:39.100
 William Kelly, the dentist, adopted the idea when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:51.420
 that the Beardian hypothesis and a deficiency of pancreatic enzymes was involved in cancer.

00:50:51.420 --> 00:51:03.700
 So Kelly started taking pork pancreas, dehydrated pork pancreas, or beef either way.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:12.820
 The only drawback is that they have to be dehydrated but unsterilized.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:20.260
 So if there was any infection, bacterial or parasite or whatever, in the animal, you can't

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:26.700
 sterilize it because you're eating the powdered pancreatic tissue.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:32.100
 But Kelly had very good results.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:46.180
 I was acquainted with him and followed his work and added to his nutritional program.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:53.700
 Someone convinced him to put the glutamates in his supplement and as soon as he made those

00:51:53.700 --> 00:52:01.900
 additions, magnesium glutamate and other mineral glutamates, he began having epilepsy attacks

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:07.100
 every day starting that January.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:14.860
 He contacted me in spring or early summer of what could be causing his seizures every

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:24.740
 day and I looked at the changes in his formula and explained that the glutamates are brain

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:34.380
 toxic excitatory and he stopped eating his supplement and the seizures stopped the very

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:40.260
 day he stopped his glutamate consumption.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:52.020
 With that success, from my suggestion, he decided to add pregnenolone to his total vitamin

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.020
 supplement.

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:59.020
 As his lawyer said, since it's not a hormone, you can put it in anything.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:05.180
 So it was just added to his vitamin mineral nutritional supplement.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:16.020
 And then his clients started having other health benefits, not just the enzyme effect

00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:27.700
 on whatever cancer they might have but general health benefits such as eye problems and muscle

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:33.420
 problems and all of the things related to a steroid imbalance.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.380
 Very interesting.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:42.420
 So should we be wary of some glutamates we see in different supplements and foods?

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.420
 Absolutely.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:52.260
 Some of the quantities are enough to seriously imbalance our amino acid intake.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:57.100
 And what formula do they usually come in with products?

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.260
 What would we look for?

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.260
 Just the word glutamate?

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.260
 Yeah.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:02.260
 Monosodium glutamate.

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:06.540
 Oh, monosodium, of course.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.260
 We're generally aware of that.

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:17.820
 If you say calcium glutamate or magnesium glutamate, it's the same glutamic acid that

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.820
 is in MSG.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.460
 Oh, same thing.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.460
 Wow.

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.460
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:26.420
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:32.540
 Your email for your newsletter is newsletterrayPeat.com, right?

00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:39.620
 No, Ray Peat's newsletter with an S on it.

00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:42.420
 Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:47.500
 Jay, Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.980
 Patrick Timpone, stay right there.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.300
 Doc, we're just going to take a quick little break here.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:56.940
 I didn't want to do a lot of breaks today just because I was feeling like talking after

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:01.500
 our technological kind of adventure we had this first hour with the video.

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.180
 But we'll do a couple.

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:08.980
 Previously with the highly credentialed Dr. Thomas Levy, he argues because the literature

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.340
 shows that oxidation is the cause of disease.

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:22.340
 But the whole point is the location, the concentration, the duration, the distribution of oxidized

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:28.220
 biomolecules determines 100% of all diseases.

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:32.700
 And so that's why I say oxidative stress doesn't cause disease.

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.780
 Oxidation is disease.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.660
 If there's no oxidized biomolecules, you don't have a toxin.

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:43.700
 The toxic effect is oxidation of biomolecules.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:44.700
 That's the entirety of it.

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:50.260
 And by the grace of God, several months ago, George Wiseman said this about hydrogen.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.500
 Hydrogen is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:56:01.580
 First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than

00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.180
 vitamin C, things like that.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:08.060
 So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.180
 body and go right into the very DNA and repair it.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:18.060
 So now it makes sense why George was able to say this back in August 2019 with such

00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.060
 conviction.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:26.020
 The body accepts that gas and uses it to heal everything.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.900
 It's like the fountain of youth.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:30.900
 It's astonishing the amount of ailments.

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:35.060
 In fact, in scientific studies, and they have over a thousand scientific studies now, they

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:39.660
 are showing that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly from virtually

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.820
 every ailment that ails any water-based life form.

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:43.820
 Okay, I'm sold.

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:47.820
 And I was able to get one a couple of months ago, thanks to your support.

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.980
 It's called the Aquacure Hydrogen Machine.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.220
 Breathe the gas and bubble the water.

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:56.060
 There's a promo code OneRadio for 10% discount.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:02.060
 I think a great investment for you, knowing what we know now, on oneradionetwork.com.

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:09.340
 Previously with cardiologist Dr. Joel Kahn, 35 years experience in cardiology.

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:13.740
 On your commercial break, you hit a hot button because I'm a giant fan of infrared sauna

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.220
 and the cardiac benefits.

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.700
 Tell us about why you like these saunas for the heart.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.700
 What does it do?

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:24.740
 In Japan, it's a traditional therapy of heart disease to even sick heart patients to sit

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:29.340
 for 15 or 20 minutes in an infrared sauna, then lie down and rest and hydrate for about

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.500
 half an hour.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.740
 They call it WAON, W-A-O-N.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.660
 It means soothing heat.

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.380
 And they've done research studies, like 30 of them, in humans.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:42.300
 Anti-ages your arteries and improves the strength of your heart, and it may actually prolong

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.060
 survival in sick heart patients.

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:48.300
 Anybody can just, again, go to the internet, read about infrared sauna heart disease, or

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.340
 put my name there because I've written many articles about it.

00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.900
 Now there's data coming out of Sweden and Finland because they've published some amazing

00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:00.660
 data that the number of times a week you're in a sauna, the number of minutes each time,

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.420
 you can just track out how long you're going to live.

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:07.980
 So very powerful therapy by being in, my favorite is, an infrared sauna.

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.460
 We have a really nice one that we've been playing around with.

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:16.140
 Gosh, and I'm in there virtually, well, say five times a week now during the summer, take

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:19.380
 a couple days off, and in the winter, every day.

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.380
 And it's a great one.

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:21.420
 It's portable.

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:27.060
 And if you're watching on Ubi2bi right now, or just look on the sauna page on our website,

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.060
 you have head sticks out there.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:34.780
 They're low EMFs there, just the electrical and magnetic stuff from the floor to the bottom

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:38.840
 of the chair, and you get that just standing next to your juicer or your refrigerator or

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.620
 driving in your car.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:43.620
 So it's definitely not an issue.

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.780
 We do get questions about that.

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:52.500
 And then, you're going to sweat and you'll have a very good experience.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:57.980
 This is technology out of Taiwan, so hopefully they don't go to war with China or in the

00:58:57.980 --> 00:58:59.980
 United States and we have a problem.

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.380
 But it's a medical university.

00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.320
 They've won lots of awards with their technology.

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.340
 So it's a great unit for the price.

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:08.820
 We think it's the very, very best.

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:13.620
 Somebody sent me a link to a sun lighter, and I don't want to speak badly about another

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:17.940
 product, but they were like $5,000 and they're beautiful and you're a wooden thing and you

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:20.540
 lay down there for five grand.

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:26.740
 But I've used those wooden guys and I've never really been able to do the sweat thing as

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:31.180
 much and I can't see how there would be any real advantage at all, except that they're

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:35.560
 beautiful and you lay down in them, you know, do a movie star thing, which is cool.

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.560
 But try ours.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.560
 Check it out.

00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.560
 It's a great website.

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.780
 It's the Relax Far Infrared Sauna.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:44.100
 We have a special price, $1,150.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:50.780
 They don't allow us to put that in print, so $1,150 and we'll hook you up.

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:54.300
 Just email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.300
 Send me an email.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.300
 That's the only way to get it.

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.300
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:06.180
 We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being on oneradionetwork.com.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.100
 On the third Monday of the month at 1030, we talk with Dr. Ray Peat.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:11.580
 His website is rayPeat.com.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:18.140
 He has a newsletter that comes out a couple times every other month.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.140
 Every other month, right, Doc?

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.140
 Every other month?

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:21.140
 Yeah, six times a year.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.140
 Six times a year.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.140
 What's your next one coming?

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:35.260
 I think it'll be on education and what's happening under the pandemic program, destruction

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:44.780
 of conventional education to impose things more efficiently.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.100
 Ray Peat's newsletter, gmail.com, right?

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:55.180
 So you're feeling something other than beneficial for the kids with this whole COVID, don't

01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.580
 go to school and all of that, and school online?

01:00:58.580 --> 01:00:59.580
 Yeah.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:04.980
 The details have been sketched out years in advance.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:15.540
 In May of 2019, Eric Schmidt, who was chairman of Google for a long time, went to work for

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:27.820
 the Pentagon, head of, chairman of the Defense Committee on Artificial Intelligence.

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:37.460
 And in that, he said that for the sake of getting ahead of China, we're going to have

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:46.740
 to destroy the present economic system and move rapidly to automation using artificial

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.740
 intelligence.

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:57.460
 For example, in shopping, he said the online shopping is a great experience, especially

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.780
 if you can't get it in the stores.

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:13.020
 And that online computer remote medicine is going to be better than contact between patient

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:19.060
 and doctor, and you won't spread a disease that way.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:26.300
 Digital money so you don't spread disease, digital education so you don't waste time

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:32.500
 going to school and having actual interaction between student and teacher.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:44.700
 And incidentally, the best artificial intelligence programs are owned by Google and will monopolize

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:58.940
 education and money will be poured into the systems of virtual reality to give even poor

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:08.260
 kids the same fine curriculum that the rich kids get.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:19.540
 And the taxpayers will subsidize this monopoly system of uniform remote education.

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.940
 Fascinating.

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.820
 So this was Eric Schmidt and when?

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.940
 And where did he say this?

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:40.820
 May of 2019 and I think it was May of 2020 that he went to work with Governor Cuomo in

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:50.740
 New York to start revising New York's education, public health and other systems in line with

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:56.820
 his plan that was worked out in the Pentagon a year before the pandemic.

01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.380
 Oh my goodness.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:03.300
 And the May 29 Eric Schmidt comments, where were those Dr. Peat?

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.260
 They're published on the internet.

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:17.900
 It's called the, I think it's the National Defense Commission on Artificial Intelligence.

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:22.220
 I think the initials are NDCAI.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.260
 Eric Schmidt.

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:28.540
 And so he's the head guy at Google.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.540
 He was.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.740
 He went from there to the Pentagon to New York.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:33.740
 Interesting.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:34.740
 Wow.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.220
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.340
 I always get a little surprise here.

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.340
 You just never know.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.340
 Let me turn this thing off.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:46.220
 I had it on talking to the geek this morning.

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.740
 Yeah, I don't want this.

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.380
 I don't know how to turn it off.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.020
 Spam burger.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.020
 Here's an email.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:59.060
 This is from Jeremy.

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:07.500
 Several months ago I began using EWOT, which is exercise with oxygen training.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.500
 Okay.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:13.940
 And I'm feeling really good and stronger, but I just want to know, are there any cautionary

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:21.540
 things I should know about using oxygen when exercising that Dr. Peat thinks I should be

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:24.180
 aware of?

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:30.620
 If you're adding oxygen, your lungs are at risk.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:42.980
 An increase over the atmospheric 21% can basically inflame your lungs.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:51.660
 You do the same things starting to your lungs that the intubation over breathing does to

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:55.540
 all of the tissues, starting with inflammation.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.260
 So but what if he does it without over breathing?

01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.260
 Is he still in good?

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.260
 Is he okay?

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:11.700
 Yeah, but I don't know of any value from adding a higher concentration of oxygen during

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.860
 exercise.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:19.740
 Adding a little CO2 I would think would be more protective.

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:29.500
 You're churning a lot of oxygen through your lungs when you're breathing very hard.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:35.260
 I think that tends in itself to create lung inflammation.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:40.500
 So that CO2 retention again is the key.

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.940
 Please ask Dr. Peat, I'm a 21 year old guy.

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.620
 This is from a Harish.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.980
 I have chronic chapped lips for about five years now.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:56.540
 I think they started after I applied iso-trethon, T-R-E-T-H-O-I-N on my face for a couple of

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.540
 months.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.140
 I'm supplementing with thyroid, eating low PUFA diet for the past couple of years.

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:07.620
 And I've also developed seborrheic dermatitis on sides of my nose in the past several months.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:14.260
 I've been taking B-complex supplements to see if the dermatitis, but it doesn't go away.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.260
 What could be going on?

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.260
 Any ideas?

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:25.660
 Either a deficiency or a great excess of vitamin A acts the same.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:33.380
 If you're deficient in all of the antioxidant things, all of the stabilizing factors of

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:44.940
 which vitamin E is just one, if you're deficient in those, an overdose of vitamin A leads to

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:45.940
 auto-oxidation.

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:51.500
 The vitamin A starts catalyzing its own breakdown.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:08:01.380
 And the supplements of retinoic acid, there are three forms of it.

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:05.460
 Two of them are extremely toxic.

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:14.660
 The third one, it's a matter of having it in great excess.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:24.620
 All of those forms of retinoic acid normally are locally derived in very particular tissues.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:31.540
 For example, the developing embryo is the most noticeable place where you use retinoic

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:36.980
 acid to create tissues such as the eye.

01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:47.220
 But if it's out of place, then it has a toxic effect and leads to the breakdown of the basic

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:56.940
 safe form, retinol, which is the form that occurs mostly in foods.

01:08:56.940 --> 01:09:04.600
 The retinol begins to be destroyed when you've started catalyzing the breakdown.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:11.100
 So it's very hard to know whether to use any supplement at all.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:20.220
 I would suggest if you have those symptoms to rely only on foods such as milk and eggs

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.420
 for your vitamin A rather than a supplement.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.660
 You could be getting too much.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:35.180
 Yeah, because the system, once it starts down that path, you need something to interrupt

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.180
 it.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:46.500
 And vitamin E and progesterone are things that are known to help to interrupt the process.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:56.260
 So you might try a lotion of something containing either vitamin E or progesterone on the lips

01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:08.500
 directly to see if that can stop the chapping process, which means your proteins are not

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.860
 being synthesized properly.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:18.620
 Cells are being formed and dying prematurely.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:26.180
 In his article, writes an email entitled "Regeneration and Degeneration," Mr. Peate mentioned that

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:32.940
 50 years ago, inflammation was seen as a necessary part of the healing process, but now it's

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:38.060
 recognized as causes for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and the aging itself.

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:43.340
 What could a person eat or supplement with to prevent this aggressive, excessive level

01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:49.980
 of inflammation from developing and stop the unhealthy fibrosis and disease that doctors

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:53.660
 mislabel as aging?

01:10:53.660 --> 01:11:02.420
 The inability to use oxygen properly tends to go with a deficiency of carbon dioxide

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:07.300
 and lactic acid formation.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:14.420
 If you even inject lactic acid, it will start this systemic inflammation.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:24.980
 So lactic acid is really the fundamental agent of all of these degenerative inflammatory

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.420
 processes.

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:36.740
 So you want to keep your lactic acid, if possible, below the so-called normal range on the blood

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.940
 test.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:44.380
 If you have a blood test for it, it should be at the extreme bottom of the test range.

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:45.380
 Interesting.

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:55.420
 Because in proportion to the presence of lactic acid, you're moving in the direction of the

01:11:55.420 --> 01:12:01.140
 degenerative diabetes, cancer-like metabolisms.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:12.140
 Are there symptoms that can show us, or bodily symptoms and the like, that can be symptomatic,

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.060
 if I can use your word again, of too much lactic acid?

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:30.100
 Well, it's involved in everything that constitutes failure.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:44.780
 Stress fatigue is one of the traditional signs, but edema is probably the next after fatigue.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:58.300
 All of the nerve muscle digestive failures or inflammatory processes, all of these will

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.580
 be brought on by lactic acid.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:09.100
 At an extreme surge of lactic acid, panic attacks are becoming much more common.

01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:17.340
 A very high percentage of people are starting to have a panic attack, which means they're

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:20.340
 having a surge of lactic acid.

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:24.540
 And again, that's not enough CO2, right?

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.540
 Not enough over-breathing.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:35.060
 Yeah, and a lot of people find that having even half a teaspoon of baking soda in a couple

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:41.460
 of ounces of water helps to break an anxiety or panic attack.

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:45.820
 Does baking soda internally affect lactic acid to go down?

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:46.820
 Yeah.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:56.740
 When you absorb the baking soda, the immediate effect increases your alkalinity, but the

01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:02.620
 kidneys just very quickly, it has a diuretic effect.

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:12.100
 And so the sodium goes out very fast, leaving the bicarbonate, which by itself is turned

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:20.700
 into carbon dioxide, which goes into cells and restores their normal, relaxed, slightly

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.500
 acidic pH.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.420
 Just a little teaspoon of baking soda.

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.700
 Anything on that order.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:32.380
 Half a teaspoon will sometimes make a difference.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.380
 Interesting.

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:35.940
 It doesn't hurt to take a teaspoon.

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:41.460
 What's the best way, writes an emailer, to determine how many calories are best for us

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.900
 on our body?

01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:45.740
 Watching for weight gain.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.500
 That's it, right.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:54.900
 If someone isn't allergic to tomatoes and bell peppers, does that mean that it's okay

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.220
 for us to eat them?

01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:00.580
 Yeah, very good food, tasty.

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:06.780
 Does supplementing urea, here's another one, wow, we just mentioned that, does supplementing

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.780
 urea take care of edema?

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.780
 Supplementing urea.

01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:17.980
 It has been used that way up until the 1960s.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:27.820
 It was found to, for example, with heart failure that causes generalized edema, people were

01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:40.660
 kept on anywhere from 10 grams per day of urea to several doses of 10 grams dissolved

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:48.060
 in fruit juice, grapefruit juice or orange juice, you don't notice the taste of it.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:58.220
 It has maintained people without progression of heart failure for many years.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:01.940
 It was used to treat brain swelling.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.340
 It was very safe and effective.

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:15.940
 One kid with practical brain death, no functions after an accident, they gave him, I think

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:28.300
 it was a 90 gram dose of intravenous urea over a period of a few hours in a proper solvent

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:32.660
 and he recovered and went back to school.

01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:42.380
 Absolutely the right thing for treating brain swelling or other crucial edema, but some

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:53.260
 doctors thought of it as an osmolite like sodium chloride and so they gave a certain

01:16:53.260 --> 01:17:05.220
 number of grams in distilled water, treating it as if it acted osmotically like salt and

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:13.780
 they found that it broke red blood cells and killed the person by destroying their blood.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:22.820
 That was reported and the idea spread that you can't use urea, you have to use one of

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:35.140
 the new sugar-based or starch-based things that will draw water out of the brain into

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:42.460
 the blood, but they don't work the same way urea does and basically only work part of

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:43.740
 the time.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:53.420
 But the whole failure that led to the disuse of urea therapeutically was based on a total

01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:56.220
 ignorance.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:04.220
 Urea is not an osmolite, it has to be added to an isotonic solvent.

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:15.300
 You start with a solvent like physiological saline or ringers or whatever, something that

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:24.300
 will not destroy your red blood cells and then you add the dose of urea, neglecting

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:36.340
 completely its so-called osmotic potential and then the urea acts by entering cells.

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:43.500
 It isn't an osmolite, it doesn't stay outside, it goes into the cell, modifies the cell's

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:50.980
 water retaining functions, causes the cell to return to normal and excrete the water.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:57.300
 So it's not pulling the water out, it's pushing it out from the inside.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:05.380
 So a demon, these things are basically kidney issues.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:10.460
 The kidney eventually handles it, but it's an intracellular thing.

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:18.220
 When you don't have enough carbon dioxide, your cell loses the ability to excrete water.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:27.860
 Lactic acid shifts the electrons in the direction that cause the cell substance to crave water.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:35.020
 Lactic acid makes the cell have more electrons, is more attractive to water and so it swells

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:47.700
 up and the urea and/or the carbon dioxide change that electronic behavior of the cells,

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:55.300
 countering lactic acid, making the cell resist water, push the water back out and return

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.300
 to normal.

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.220
 Boy, it sounds like the CO2 is pretty good stuff.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:05.140
 I mean, what are some of the main ways we retain more CO2?

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:11.380
 Thyroid is our basic thing.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:16.020
 If you're low thyroid, you're basically always hyperventilating.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.020
 Really?

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:21.220
 You would be doing it and not knowing it?

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:29.420
 Yeah, because the cell isn't producing carbon dioxide at the normal rate.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:35.020
 And if it isn't producing carbon dioxide, you're not taking it in from the outside.

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:44.420
 Then any little need for energy, the cell will burn some sugar, turn it into lactic

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.100
 acid without burning it all the way to carbon dioxide.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.100
 Interesting.

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.100
 Wow.

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:53.740
 So a low thyroid could be doing all kinds of things that unless you talk to somebody

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:56.580
 like you or really do your research, you wouldn't know, right?

01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:57.580
 You just wouldn't know it.

01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:02.020
 It's like, "I have edema, I have this and boy, I'm connecting the dots."

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:05.140
 That's why we're very grateful to have you on, Dr. Peat.

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:08.620
 Thanks for being here once a month.

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:14.340
 Measuring your temperature is the next best thing to measuring your oxygen consumption

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:16.940
 and CO2 output.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.220
 First thing in the morning, we want it around the 98.6.

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:27.180
 Well, 97.8 is okay early in the morning, but then it should, after breakfast, get up to

01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:28.180
 temperature.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:29.180
 Get up to 98.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:33.780
 Do those little things you kind of use on your forehead, are they pretty accurate or

01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:37.900
 do you need to stick it in your mouth kind of mercury?

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:44.620
 The mercury in the mouth is very, very absolutely accurate.

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:52.100
 The infrared in the ear of the instrument is well designed.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:55.460
 That's very quick and handy to use and accurate enough.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.380
 Yeah, I had one of those infrared in the ear things I played with, but they'd always come

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:04.580
 up these different numbers, you know, so I got really leery of using it.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:08.060
 Yeah, some of the instruments are kind of flaky.

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.460
 Not very good.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:18.340
 I may ask Dr. Peat to clarify the difference between using T4 or T3 or both products for

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.340
 thyroid health.

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:25.220
 Does Dr. Peat recommend the Mexican brands of Sino Plus and Sino Mel?

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:29.020
 Are there any USA ways to buy these?

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:38.460
 You can find drugstores on the internet that sell them and check the price.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:46.300
 More people buy it, the more likely you are to find rip-off prices.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:50.620
 They should be in the vicinity of $15 a bottle.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.460
 So those two that you mentioned, those are just T3s, right?

01:22:54.460 --> 01:23:06.220
 No, one is a good balance of T4 and T3 that imitates the old 40-year-ago standard of armor

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:14.500
 thyroid or Thyralar, which was the armor company's synthetic and that exact formula was taken

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:22.900
 up by Sino Plus and I've been, since the armor company, sold to a cosmetic company and then

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:30.740
 has gone through ownership changes and price increase from a penny a pill to a dollar a

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:31.740
 pill.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:36.940
 I, in the 90s, started using Sino Plus and Sino Mel.

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:43.260
 So Sino Plus is 4 and 3 and 4 and Sino Mel is...

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.060
 It's pure T3.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.120
 Okay.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:51.540
 So Sino Plus would be, you want to get both if you're going to do it?

01:23:51.540 --> 01:24:02.580
 Most people do okay with Sino Plus and it's quick acting compared to the glandular, so

01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:10.140
 it's best to break the tablet into two or three doses per day because you can feel the

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:16.940
 action starting right in your mouth if you chew it up, where the glandular pill has to

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:24.780
 be digested, takes two or three hours to get digested and broken down and produce the active

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.780
 hormones.

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:26.780
 That's the Sino Plus, right?

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:27.780
 The Sino Plus.

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:33.340
 Sino Plus, yeah, is the quick acting combination product.

01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.620
 And again, the difference between the Sino Mel?

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:45.540
 Sino Mel is only the active hormone and its activity peaks in an hour and a half roughly

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:54.020
 after you take the pill and then it starts down and it's half gone within about 12 hours.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:25:03.900
 So if you try to take one T3 pill in the morning like the druggist will often tell you, by

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:05.260
 12 hours later...

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.260
 It's gone.

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:10.060
 ...at that time, you're hypothyroid.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:14.580
 So the Sino Plus, they'll stick around longer, those T3 and T4?

01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:15.580
 Yeah.

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.580
 The body.

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:26.940
 In the late 1940s when they were starting to synthesize T4 companies that became the

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:40.420
 major producer of synthroid synthetic thyroxine, they tested their synthetic on 25-year-old

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:51.860
 male medical students, the healthiest population imaginable, and compared the glandular armor

01:25:51.860 --> 01:26:01.140
 product with their synthetic and they said it worked exactly the same as the natural

01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:02.140
 thyroid.

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:14.380
 So that was the basis now for 70 years, substituting for the natural which had established all

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:17.980
 of our knowledge about thyroid hormone function.

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:21.220
 It was done on the basis of natural thyroid.

01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:28.660
 The fact that it lowers cholesterol, for example, immediately, there's no cholesterol excess

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:32.380
 problem if you don't have a thyroid problem.

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:44.540
 But since that idea that 25-year-old males respond to the synthetic the same way they

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:51.580
 do the natural, they failed to take into account the experiments that had already shown that

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:59.820
 estrogen blocks the ability to convert thyroxine into the active hormone.

01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:08.420
 And so they didn't test their product on even 25-year-old females, much less 38-year-old

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:21.620
 women at the peak of their estrogen, in a very high proportion of middle-aged women,

01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:30.420
 if it accumulates, can even have an antithyroid action by suppressing your pituitary, showing

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:40.060
 zero TSH and so no stimulation of the thyroid gland and so no formation of T3.

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:50.220
 At the University of Oregon Medical School in the 1970s, a doctor had prescribed 100

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:57.980
 micrograms, which was a moderate dose of thyroxine to a hypothyroid woman.

01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:04.300
 And after a few months, she didn't improve, so he increased the dose to 200.

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:12.420
 Over months, got it up to 400 micrograms of thyroxine per day, and she went into a myxedema

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:21.060
 coma and was taken into the medical school hospital, where they found she had absolutely

01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:29.660
 no detectable T3 in her body, explaining the coma.

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:35.500
 Her brain simply wasn't making carbon dioxide or energy.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:45.700
 So they gave her intravenous T3 immediately, came out of the coma, recovered from the massive

01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:54.300
 edema, myxedema, and they put her on a mixed product containing T3 to maintain her, and

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.180
 there was no problem.

01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:03.700
 But there are milder cases like that, millions of them around the country, women being prescribed

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:17.900
 thyroxine and the response being measured in terms of how much their TSH is being suppressed,

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:24.260
 it totally ignoring their body temperature, their symptoms, their cholesterol, all of

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:31.700
 the basic absolute indicators of what the thyroid is doing and how much is needed.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.020
 Interesting.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:40.420
 If you, what would be, is there such a thing as like the perfect cholesterol number?

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:46.100
 I mean the big number that everybody talks about, you know, 180, 200, or do you have

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:48.820
 a fave number that you kind of like to see?

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:52.180
 Oh, it depends on your age.

01:29:52.180 --> 01:30:04.140
 The Framingham study found that basically no one who had their cholesterol well over

01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:13.900
 200, very low incidence of dementia if they kept their cholesterol up over the age of

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:23.460
 150, but those who were below 200 had an extremely high dementia incidence.

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:33.140
 That's explained because your gonads and adrenals depend on the amount of cholesterol in the

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:38.620
 blood for making the protective steroid hormones.

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:45.580
 In an experiment with an isolated ovary, for example, they measured the amount, keeping

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:52.980
 the thyroid hormone level, they measured the amount of progesterone coming out of the vein

01:30:52.980 --> 01:31:02.260
 from the ovary and they varied the amount of cholesterol going into the artery to the

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:10.460
 ovary, and as they increased the cholesterol in the blood going in, the amount of progesterone

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:15.540
 coming out of the ovary corresponded and increased.

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:24.540
 So rising cholesterol is adaptive, keeping your brain steroid hormones up, keeping your

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:33.700
 ovarian systemic hormones up, your adrenal hormones, everything, your brain especially

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:43.980
 depends on the adequate amount of cholesterol in the blood, and if your thyroid is low,

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:49.860
 that means you require more cholesterol in the blood to keep your brain supplied with

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:52.860
 steroids.

01:31:52.860 --> 01:32:02.660
 And so hypothyroid people properly and adaptively have a proportionally high cholesterol.

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:07.620
 Oh, because they needed to keep it in balance.

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:12.460
 So that would be the argument for all the people, the dangers of statins and them getting

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:17.900
 this cholesterol down in guys for like 120 and 130 cholesterol.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.980
 Yeah, that's biologically crazy.

01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:24.500
 That's making it impossible to make the brain steroids.

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.180
 My goodness.

01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:33.140
 Could you ask Dr. Peat, to improve myocardial respiration, are there certain times of the

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:38.300
 day that would be better than others for doing such things as bag breathing and red light

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.820
 exposure?

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.740
 Oh, exercise is always safest in the afternoon.

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.740
 Afternoon.

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:54.940
 I know of someone did a study of having people jog before breakfast and then after breakfast

01:32:54.940 --> 01:33:03.140
 and took a blood sample and found broken chromosomes in their blood cells.

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:10.140
 If they jogged before breakfast when blood sugar was not adequate, after breakfast there

01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:18.980
 were no broken chromosomes caused by the stress of running or the increased lactic acid.

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:28.740
 And other experiments show that later in the day your ability to resist stress damage is

01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:30.660
 at its highest of the day.

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:31.660
 Oh, interesting.

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:35.420
 More three, four, five o'clock, that kind of time?

01:33:35.420 --> 01:33:36.420
 Interesting.

01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:42.260
 Kira wants to know what you think about eating raw meat, given that it is a good source specifically,

01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:48.020
 is it better or worse digested and what could be benefits from having it raw?

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:56.420
 Oh, it's slightly better nutritionally, very easy to digest and you don't risk the carcinogens

01:33:56.420 --> 01:34:01.780
 produced by overheating it.

01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:13.980
 But the thing that keeps me from eating it either rare or raw is the possibility of various

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:20.060
 kinds of infections, bacterial or protozoal or whatever.

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:24.500
 That's why I think some of the raw meat people, they sear it everywhere pretty good to kill

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:28.260
 anything on the outside, but it could still be on the inside though, right?

01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:30.980
 Yeah, if the animal has a disease.

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:31.980
 If it has a disease.

01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:42.540
 You're being exposed to it and a healthy digestive system can handle it, but I prefer to cook

01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:46.340
 it rather than trust my digestive system.

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:57.420
 What does Dr. Peat think about the Texas Dr. Bartlett who is successfully using BUDESINDE

01:34:57.420 --> 01:35:00.100
 steroid inhaler for COVID?

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:07.340
 Malik is using cortisol injections for seven days with a bunch of supplements like C and

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:10.620
 Zinc and the British are now successful with interferon beta.

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:14.500
 Have you seen this Dr. Bartlett's videos about using this?

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:23.780
 I haven't seen his videos, but anyway you take in an anti-inflammatory substance since

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:33.820
 the essence of the COVID symptoms and mortality, the essence is inflammation.

01:35:33.820 --> 01:35:39.500
 All kinds of anti-inflammatory things are going to be helpful.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:53.540
 Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, the combination studies of those two, they're ridiculed by

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:59.820
 the know-nothing doctors because they say neither of them kills viruses.

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:06.700
 One is an antibiotic and the other is for autoimmune conditions.

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.700
 Those are anti-inflammatory.

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:18.860
 Azithromycin and erythromycin happen to be very effective anti-inflammatory agents.

01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:24.900
 And so they're missing the point that they are extremely therapeutic.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:28.580
 Anything anti-inflammatory is helpful.

01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:33.540
 Carbon dioxide is our simplest, most basic anti-inflammatory.

01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:38.820
 Carbon, good, I'll see you on Tuesday.

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:47.700
 Aspirin, progesterone, cortisol, a thousand different safer things.

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:58.060
 The synthetic glucocorticoids used for asthma inhalants will immediately protect you against

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:03.780
 the inflammation, but they have the long-range problems of tissue breakdown.

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:09.260
 Do you think there's any connection, I mean, let me put on my tinfoil hat with this whole

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:13.020
 demonization of CO2 and the good stuff about it?

01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:16.020
 I mean, is that possible?

01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:17.660
 Is what possible?

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:24.060
 The demonization of CO2 in our culture with man-made global warming and all that.

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:38.700
 Yeah, but at least the pandemic, the founding chairman of the World Economic Forum announced

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:48.100
 the theme of their January 2021 World Conference will be the Great Reset.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:59.060
 And he said the global warming thing was helping us to eliminate the old fossil fuel economy,

01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.580
 but that has been coming along very slowly.

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:09.620
 And luckily, we now have the pandemic allowing for almost instant change, shutting down the

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:15.940
 old economy by fiat rather than gradual legislation.

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:16.940
 Interesting.

01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:21.340
 Yeah, we've been hearing a lot about that potential reset.

01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:28.140
 Here is a fellow from, I don't know where really, it sounds like Africa, does methylene

01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:33.500
 blue taking orally, is that dangerous?

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:38.980
 People take unnecessarily big doses of it.

01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:52.700
 There have been reports of it interacting with the SSRI antidepressants and such, but

01:38:52.700 --> 01:39:01.820
 it's effective in doses of one-tenth of a milligram on the order of T3 thyroid form.

01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:06.420
 He says that he's taken, Dr. Jean-Philippe says he's taken a 1% solution and I take one

01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:08.420
 milligram of that.

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:10.420
 Oh, that's good.

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:12.140
 I think that's a safe dose.

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:17.340
 Oh, so one milligram of 1%, that's pretty small.

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:30.660
 Yeah, one milligram of the actual substance people have used for treating depression and

01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:40.500
 get almost immediate results the way they would with a similar dose of T3 because it

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:48.180
 activates your mitochondrial respiration in very similar ways to thyroid hormone.

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.380
 Here's an email from RJ.

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:55.540
 My doctor prescribed using four liters of oxygen per minute to sleep with using an oxygen

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:56.540
 concentrator.

01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:00.620
 I also use supplemental hydrogen gas called Brown's gas.

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:04.900
 Is that okay or do I need to change?

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:09.420
 I don't think concentrated oxygen is safe.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:10.420
 You just don't like it.

01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:18.620
 Don't they put most people in nursing homes?

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:28.140
 Very often they do things that accelerate death while keeping them quiet.

01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:29.140
 Oh, good.

01:40:29.140 --> 01:40:34.980
 So again for Robert, for RJ, what is his concerns using even four liters a minute which isn't

01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:39.380
 very much while sleeping?

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:46.740
 I think any excess is a risk starting with the lungs.

01:40:46.740 --> 01:41:01.900
 If you improve your metabolism, historically probably the most widely used successful chemical

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:11.340
 treatment is using acetazolamide which makes your body retain the carbon dioxide that a

01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:19.100
 hypothyroid person isn't making enough of and that keeps stimulating your breathing

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:25.420
 apparatus during the night and prevents sleep apnea.

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:35.060
 So metabolically keeping your CO2 up with progesterone and/or thyroid and all of the

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:48.140
 nutritional things work the same as acetazolamide in inhibiting the enzyme that eliminates carbon

01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.980
 dioxide.

01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:50.980
 This is from Cecil.

01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:54.380
 We have a few more and then we'll let you go back to work.

01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:59.420
 It seems to me as Dr. Peters mentioned that as long as the body has all the nutrients

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.700
 it needs and is spiritually well, it should pretty well be immune to most diseases.

01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:05.700
 Am I wrong?

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:12.180
 Does Dr. Peat believe a real potent bioweapon is possible out there with COVID?

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:24.340
 Yeah, healthy people simply don't notice when they are exposed to the various viruses,

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:33.340
 the viruses to take and act on people who are already sick.

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:45.500
 Even after menopause, it isn't officially a sickness but it represents the effect of

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:52.420
 40 years of a bad diet, too much PUFA in the diet.

01:42:52.420 --> 01:43:00.140
 Adds up, modifies the estrogen-progesterone balance and the excitatory processes in the

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:05.820
 brain shift you away from progesterone production.

01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:17.980
 At menopause, the women who have had practically, there is almost a zero mortality from COVID

01:43:17.980 --> 01:43:24.340
 in women who are healthy and cycling and not using any estrogen supplements such as birth

01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:35.780
 control but starting at menopause and increasing in old age, women catch up with men in susceptibility

01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:44.620
 to COVID infection and mortality because their estrogen goes down, I mean their progesterone

01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:47.860
 goes down and the estrogen comes up.

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:48.860
 Good morning you two.

01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:52.940
 I have come in late but I heard you talking about lactic acid.

01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:55.860
 We have these symptoms of too much.

01:43:55.860 --> 01:44:02.180
 Is only baking soda the go-to?

01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:08.500
 A lot of people find that that can help to break an anxiety attack and helps with their

01:44:08.500 --> 01:44:16.740
 endurance by tending to keep their production of, for example, athletes take as much as

01:44:16.740 --> 01:44:29.380
 a tablespoon before an endurance bicycling or run and it keeps being absorbed from their

01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:38.340
 stomach and intestine for part of the race that tends to keep their lactic acid production

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.340
 suppressed.

01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:46.420
 Cindy is in Arkansas or Alabama, Rogersville, Alabama and she gets fever blusters and they

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:51.700
 do not get fluid filled but they have been a nonstop for over about four months.

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:56.380
 Any ideas what could be going on?

01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:06.500
 The immune system is being disturbed, pituitary, excitatory and stress hormones tend to excite

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:18.020
 the nerves allowing the virus to reproduce so checking things like the amount of sugar

01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:23.940
 and carbohydrate in your diet, make sure you are not eating too much fat in proportion

01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:31.580
 to your carbohydrate which can increase your lactic acid and turn on the stress hormones.

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.940
 Too many carbs can?

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:34.260
 No, too few carbs.

01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:35.260
 Too few carbs.

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:36.260
 Oh, yeah.

01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:45.100
 Yeah, when you are under stress, you liberate free fatty acids and if you eat a lot of fat,

01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:54.180
 that increases your free fatty acids and turns off your ability to use glucose oxidatively

01:45:54.180 --> 01:46:02.180
 and that increases your lactic acid and the lactic acid keeps the stress hormones going

01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:08.020
 and maintains the inflammation that lets the virus replicate.

01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:12.940
 So when you say carbs, Dr. Peat, do vegetables count or do we want to also do some complex

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:17.100
 carbs like corn or rice or whatever?

01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:27.180
 If you handle them and they are well cooked but things like well cooked summer squash,

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:32.060
 for example, is a very easy to digest kind of starch.

01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:35.140
 Very well cooked rice is okay.

01:46:35.140 --> 01:46:45.100
 Tortillas, hominy are probably the easiest to digest starch because they have been processed

01:46:45.100 --> 01:46:48.660
 by lime that makes them very easy to digest.

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:54.700
 There is a fellow that has a great natural pig company, Doc, and he has a booth in Dripping

01:46:54.700 --> 01:47:00.540
 Springs Farmers Market and has a new product with different colored tortillas and he says,

01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.940
 let me tell you about these tortillas.

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:03.140
 They have been nixtamized.

01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:05.380
 So this guy is going, isn't that cool?

01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:06.380
 Going through the whole thing.

01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:07.380
 Yeah.

01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:11.260
 Yeah, they are more nutritious, much safer.

01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:12.260
 Easier to digest, right?

01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.260
 You have told us.

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.260
 Yeah.

01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:23.660
 Naomi wants to know, could CHITOSANE help detox PUFAs since it kind of binds to fat?

01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:29.460
 Any fibrous food helps to carry stuff out of you.

01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:38.900
 Raw carrots and well cooked mushrooms are a pleasanter thing than CHITOSANE.

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.180
 You don't need to buy a supplement.

01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:46.020
 You can just choose the most fibrous foods.

01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:51.180
 Oat bran is an additive to breakfast cereal.

01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:54.940
 It's a pleasant way to get a lot of fiber.

01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:59.500
 So that will take some things out like PUFAs if there's too many of those hanging around.

01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:05.780
 Yeah, and for a weight loss diet, it helps to simply keep some of the fat from being

01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.540
 absorbed and carries it out of you.

01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:14.740
 Lynn wants to know what you think about intermittent fasting, say eating only from noon to 6 p.m.

01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:18.820
 as many people are recommending.

01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:28.540
 The studies have been done on very specialized populations of mice or highly trained athletes,

01:48:28.540 --> 01:48:30.260
 for example.

01:48:30.260 --> 01:48:39.260
 And I don't think it applies to people on an average activity schedule.

01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:45.980
 So you don't think just overall it's beneficial just to do that once a day?

01:48:45.980 --> 01:48:56.060
 For anyone with a borderline metabolic problem, which applies to about half of the population,

01:48:56.060 --> 01:49:01.980
 it can increase the stress to go extra hours without food.

01:49:01.980 --> 01:49:08.060
 Kane wants to know, help us understand why high dose PUFAs like fish oil seem to help

01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:12.780
 so many thrive for decades from athletes to brain injury.

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:17.420
 Fish oil has helped and is helping many perform at high levels.

01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:20.940
 How can you explain that because you're so against them?

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:29.100
 By the time it gets absorbed into your bloodstream, it's becoming highly oxidized.

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.740
 If you leave it out at room temperature, it gets sticky.

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:35.420
 It starts to form varnish.

01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:43.980
 And at body temperature, 98 degrees in your blood with oxygen pumped into the blood, the

01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:48.620
 oxidative breakdown is extremely fast.

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:56.580
 These oxidative fragments are powerfully immunosuppressive.

01:49:56.580 --> 01:50:05.420
 They knock out the enzymes that form prostaglandins, for example.

01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:12.900
 They knock out the inflammatory process very helpfully in the short term.

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:23.500
 But meanwhile, over a period of six months, you start damaging the functional long-range

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:30.500
 effect of your immune system and run the risk of immune deficiency syndrome.

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:33.220
 My goodness.

01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.500
 Here's May Thien.

01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:37.540
 She says, "I have a 14-month-old granddaughter who has eczema.

01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:43.420
 It seems sometimes she scratches herself so much it's hard to see and prevent her from

01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:44.420
 scratching.

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:45.420
 What can I do to help?

01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:47.060
 We're just at a loss here."

01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:48.060
 My goodness, 14-month-old.

01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:57.700
 Checking the diet thoroughly for potentially irritating, poorly digested foods would be

01:50:57.700 --> 01:51:01.300
 the first thing.

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:12.740
 Then if you don't find particular foods like bread or pasta would be first things to consider.

01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:23.660
 Then you might consider a blood test for vitamin D deficiency or too much phosphate in the

01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:31.060
 diet, an excess of meat, for example, or for milk and cheese.

01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:35.740
 Those things can activate the inflammatory system.

01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:44.020
 Dr. Peat, do you think it's worth the expense or the effort to get raw cheeses as opposed

01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.300
 to just old pasteurized cheese?

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:54.820
 No, I think the really important thing is if you have a reaction to the cheese, a lot

01:51:54.820 --> 01:52:03.420
 of people have started having bad reactions digestively or allergically.

01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:04.540
 Look at the labels.

01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:15.180
 If they don't say just milk, salt, natural cultures, traditional cheeses might say natural

01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:22.500
 cultures, but just milk, salt, and rennet are the basic safe ingredients.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:36.220
 If it says vegetable rennet, that can mean an engineered enzyme system, a manufactured

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:42.220
 bunch of fungal enzymes, for example.

01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:48.740
 Two-thirds of the commercial cheeses are now using those so-called cultures and enzymes

01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:56.940
 bought from a manufacturing company rather than acquired in the barn or the cave where

01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:58.740
 they age the cheese.

01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.940
 So what are the ingredients that we want to look for in cheeses?

01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:04.940
 Milk, salt, and rennet.

01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:05.940
 Just rennet.

01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.180
 That's it.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:10.180
 More than that, just find another one?

01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:11.180
 It's questionable.

01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:12.180
 It's questionable.

01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.940
 Final question for Dr. Ray Peat.

01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:14.940
 Great stuff today.

01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:15.940
 Thank you, sir.

01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:21.340
 The U.S. government wants high-tech immunity passports potentially for everyone as soon

01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:22.340
 as possible.

01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:30.460
 What does Dr. Peat think the chances of this coming?

01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:40.100
 I think you can get the necessary context for that partly in Eric Schmidt's last year's

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:52.620
 speech, partly in the Rockefeller Foundation's 2010 publication on the planning basically

01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:59.500
 for the coming pandemic and reset of the economy.

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:07.380
 They called it "getting people in lockstep," and they used China as the example of how

01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:15.580
 people could be forced to shift to absolute lockstep conformity.

01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:16.980
 Yes, sir.

01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:21.420
 Many people are arguing that this whole social distancing and masking, sheltering at home

01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:24.540
 is kind of a training ground for that.

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:25.540
 Right.

01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:26.820
 It's obedience training.

01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:33.820
 When you put on the mask, you're telling the public that you are an obedient servant doing

01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:36.180
 an irrational thing.

01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:45.220
 There have been 17 well-known studies of the effectiveness of wearing a mask.

01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:49.580
 Three of them weren't proper controlled studies.

01:54:49.580 --> 01:55:01.100
 The good 14 studies that were done with controls, the best quality science, found no effect,

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:03.740
 no benefit from wearing a mask.

01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:12.700
 So if you're wearing a mask, you're an obedient but not fully rational citizen.

01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:14.660
 Wow.

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:20.020
 And we've seen that even science shows that these 95 or whatever they call them, Doc,

01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:25.340
 that the P95s or something, that they don't do anything more than the cloth as well.

01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:35.500
 There's now evidence that the coronaviruses are aerosol, that they are particles smaller

01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:46.620
 than a bacterium and aerosolized bacterium even can, to some extent, they can go right

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:56.180
 through ordinary masks, but the aerosolized virus almost encounters no resistance even

01:55:56.180 --> 01:55:58.300
 in the best masks.

01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:02.460
 In the best masks, no resistance, just goes poof, right through.

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.460
 Wow.

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:06.360
 Well, it's a brave new world, Doc.

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:12.020
 If you'd like to get Dr. Ray Peat's newsletter, it's rayPeats, that's plural, newsletter,

01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:17.420
 at gmail.com, and if you're thinking about school and concerned about your kids, he has

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:23.620
 a whole thing coming up on schools and education that I'm sure will be interesting to read.

01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:28.660
 Boy, it looks like it's going to be, boy, the folks are rebellion out there.

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:30.500
 They want their kids to school.

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:38.580
 It's a real clash, isn't it, from the school, I don't know why the school, people that control

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.700
 the schools are so intent on keeping the schools closed.

01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:51.460
 They want to keep in good with the government.

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:58.700
 The government can turn off their money supply or apply pressure to them, so they're being

01:56:58.700 --> 01:56:59.700
 obedient.

01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:02.980
 But isn't President Trump, he's been talking, he doesn't want to close them, he says they

01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:03.980
 should open.

01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:07.300
 Other parts of the government, right?

01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:16.420
 Yeah, he isn't really in control, as you can see with the hydroxychloroquine issue.

01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:27.340
 The FDA just rescinded their emergency permission to use it, and they say it causes dangerous

01:57:27.340 --> 01:57:34.660
 heart rhythm problems and liver failure and kidney damage and all kinds of things.

01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:40.020
 In 80 years of use, it was never found to cause those.

01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:50.540
 Now suddenly, and less than a month after a very good study of 2,500 patients in the

01:57:50.540 --> 01:58:00.980
 Henry Ford Health System, that found a 50% reduction in mortality in the people who used

01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:01.980
 hydroxychloroquine.

01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:09.180
 Now the FDA says it's too dangerous and absolutely ineffective.

01:58:09.180 --> 01:58:16.500
 The FDA Public Health Service has something in mind other than public health.

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:17.500
 And we'll leave it at that.

01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:19.420
 Dr. Peat, thanks so much.

01:58:19.420 --> 01:58:20.420
 Great show today.

01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:21.500
 We appreciate it.

01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:24.660
 You take care of yourself, and I'm going to go out and get some oranges.

01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:25.660
 Okay.

01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:26.660
 Thanks a lot.

01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:27.660
 Thanks.

01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:30.660
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone on Radionetwork.com.

01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:33.060
 What a blessing to have him.

01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:39.500
 And the president, I guess he was taking hydroxychloroquine for a while.

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:40.500
 Well here you are.

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.380
 We're going to try again to do the video thing.

01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:43.780
 We're going to get it tomorrow.

01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:48.860
 We have, well, Brandon Smith doesn't have a video camera, so that'll be, we'll see if

01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:49.860
 I'm going to be on there.

01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:52.180
 Just so we can get it all straightened out today.

01:58:52.180 --> 01:58:57.700
 And then also Tim O'Shea, who I think he has a, I saw a story about Tim O'Shea.

01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:01.460
 Dr. O'Shea says he's going to give somebody a whole bunch of money if they can show me

01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:05.620
 a coronavirus, show me the virus.

01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:07.820
 I think he's offering a reward.

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:08.820
 Best lest I hurt.

01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.460
 So it should be a good show.

01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:12.060
 We're going to have some fun.

01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:14.380
 Brandon Amelani, it's been a long time.

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:15.580
 He's a really cool guy.

01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:17.100
 Chinese medicine fellow.

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:22.540
 We'll talk a lot about herbs and immune systems and exercise and cool stuff.

01:59:22.540 --> 01:59:27.100
 And then also, who else is coming on Wednesday?

01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.460
 I should certainly know that.

01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:31.580
 Oh, Richard Mayberry.

01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:35.660
 He's on the last Wednesday of the month.

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.660
 Pretty fun.

01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:39.380
 So, I will see you all tomorrow.

01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:40.900
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:45.820
 Again, we apologize for some of the strange things that went on this first hour.

01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:49.620
 Or early this morning at nine o'clock, we were trying, we had the thing all working

01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:55.620
 and I tested it yesterday and something didn't work and there's something going on that's

01:59:55.620 --> 02:00:02.460
 not compatible with our studio and didn't know that you couldn't hear the audio.

02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:04.380
 I didn't test the audio.

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:09.180
 And so when we made it right on the video today with Dr. Massey, you couldn't hear the

02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:10.900
 guest talking on the audio.

02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:14.100
 So we'll have to figure that one out before we do it again.

02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:15.100
 All right.

02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:16.100
 I love you all very much.

02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:17.100
 Thanks a lot.

02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:18.100
 Take care of yourself.

02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:19.540
 Let me know if I can help with anything.

02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:24.060
 Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:25.060
 Take care.

02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:31.500
 And may the blessings be.
