00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
 I want to hone in on the topic like Brad suggested about reductive stress in our obesity panel,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.000
 which you both were a part of.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.040
 I saw, Brad, you were smiling, you know, very happily when you heard Dr. Peat reference

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.160
 reductive stress.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.500
 So I want you guys to unleash, but try as best as you can to make this accessible for

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.480
 people who are a little new, but don't let it hold you back too much.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.400
 Go try to find the balance there.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.000
 Explain what is this reductive stress and how is this connected to PUFA and how is this

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.240
 causing obesity?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.120
 Dr. Peat?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:54.640
 - The PUFA role is, part of it is just a physical chemical effect, how the fat molecule affects

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.520
 the ionic balance of the cytoplasm and so on.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:12.040
 But the reductive stress link to the PUFA, a lot of it is through thyroid function and

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:23.320
 estrogen, because PUFA in the bloodstream will activate estrogen while blocking thyroid.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.040
 Thyroid promotes an oxidative state, estrogen promotes a reductive state.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:42.320
 And so reductive stress goes with the ratio of estrogen to thyroid.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 And the immediate triggers for the fat balance, a lot of people have assumed that something

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.640
 interferes with the oxidation of fat causing obesity.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:18.760
 But in fact, fat people during exercise burn more fat than normal lean people.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:32.400
 Estrogen makes women burn a much higher proportion of fat than men burn relative to sugar metabolism,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.200
 creating a reductive state.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 The synthesis of fat is increased while the oxidation is also increased.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.760
 And so simply the fact that people get fatter made a lot of people think it's failure to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:17.720
 oxidize fat, but actually the tendency or being pushed to oxidize fat, it's called the

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.000
 Randle effect or the Randle cycle.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.760
 If you are forced to oxidize fat, which fat people do very well, women do better than

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:40.360
 men, that turns off your ability to oxidize glucose.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:55.880
 And so it slows your actual oxidative consumption of oxygen and production of the oxidizing

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.680
 balance and so reductive stress.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:14.200
 The Randle cycle is a way of seeing what is forcing you into that choice to use fat

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.240
 for energy rather than glucose.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:30.560
 When you are using fat for energy, you're in a reductive condition by failing to oxidize

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.640
 glucose.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:47.360
 And that reductive condition is part of what activates fatty acid synthase.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:59.440
 So you increase your production of fat, but not to a degree that compensates while you're

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.600
 also increasing fat oxidation.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.880
 And that is also characteristic of cancer.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:17.360
 Cancer consumes lots of fat, ends up making people waste away with cachexia, but at the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.160
 same time, cancer activates the fatty acid synthase system.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:33.120
 And if you can stop the fatty acid synthase, you cure both cancer and obesity.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.400
 And that's under the control of the redox balance.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.680
 So Brad, how does that fit with what you think about with reductive stress and obesity and

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.000
 try to translate this as best as you can?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.440
 Yeah, I think that's about right.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.000
 And I just want to, you know...

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.480
 I don't mean that insultingly either.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.400
 I'm just trying, I'm not a specialist like you guys, so I'm trying to process this.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400
 Right.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.000
 And I always, and this is something that I always struggle to sort of define succinctly.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.360
 You don't have to give us all the explanations, but give us a little bit of intermediation.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.440
 I'll give you a little bit of intermediation.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.640
 So our food, our food is, when we eat our food, it's in the reduced state.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:21.440
 So carbohydrate is mostly carbon connected to hydrogen, and it's also connected to oxygen.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.480
 And then fat is just carbon connected to hydrogen.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.800
 And those electrons that live between the carbon and the hydrogen, they would be happier

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.560
 if, or at least the oxygen would be happier if they were connected to oxygen.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.080
 And so when we eat our food, it's fat, which is like just carbon and hydrogen.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.240
 But when we exhale it, it's CO2 and H2O.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.120
 So all those hydrogens have recombined with oxygen and all those carbons have recombined

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.840
 with oxygen and that's how they leave.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:06.280
 So when carbon and hydrogen leave our body after, you know, after we "burn the fuel,"

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.080
 it's very oxidized, but it comes into our body very reduced.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 And so basically fuel calories are all in the reduced state.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.680
 And the whole point of our, you know, of our metabolism is we oxidize the reduced fuel

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.840
 that we eat.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.120
 And so what happens is reductive stress in a cell sort of looks like a bit like the cell

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.120
 has overeaten.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.560
 What you find, you have, you find too much things in the reduced state.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.080
 And this is, and this usually is stated in terms of intermediates.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.320
 So like, so the citric acid cycle or the TCA cycle or the Krebs cycle, depending on what

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.760
 you want to call it, is really at the heart of our metabolism.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.240
 And it's this cycle, you know, it's usually drawn as a circle.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.080
 It doesn't really spin in a circle, but that doesn't matter.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:05.440
 Every time you go around the circle, you need three molecules of NAD+ which is oxidized.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.920
 It's oxidized NAD.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.200
 And it all gets converted to NADH.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:18.120
 And so for each like, you know, for each glucose, you need like six of these NAD+ in order to

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.000
 oxidize the glucose.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.280
 For a fat molecule, you need way more.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280
 I don't know.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280
 It's a, it's a big number.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.680
 It's like you need 40 or something of these NAD+ to oxidize the fat.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.600
 And so it turns out that our metabolic rate is really limited by how much of this NAD+

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
 that we have.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:42.760
 So the main way that we reconvert the NADH back to NAD+ is by burning calories.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.120
 So if you, you know, whatever, when we get up and we walk, our muscle cells in our legs

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.800
 are burning calories.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.920
 And what's happening is the NADH is giving its electrons to the electron transport chain

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.200
 that's making ATP.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.900
 We're burning that ATP.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.840
 And every time we're burning ATP, we're generating more NAD+.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.320
 But at some point, you know, if we're, if more fuel is coming into the cell than is

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.280
 really required, if we're not exercising, that's when you can, that's when you can have

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.840
 this buildup of things like NADH.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.840
 And when that happens, NAD+ drops.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.520
 And so, and you can have more of something called acetyl, acetyl CoA comes in.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.080
 Is this the same thing that Paul Saladino was explaining when he said the cells are

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.240
 getting so fat, they're bursting from-

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240
 Well, that's later.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.800
 That's, that's once you've stored fat.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.200
 This is, this is sort of before that.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.280
 This is like what happened.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.480
 This is like, so, so all of our fuels, whether it's glucose, whether it's fat, whether it's

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.280
 alcohol, they all get converted to acetyl CoA.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.320
 They really get converted to acetyl groups.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.600
 CoA just is sort of the chaperone.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.000
 But they all get converted in this CO, in this CO, acetyl CoA.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.640
 And the acetyl group has a bunch of these electrons and the electrons need to go somewhere,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.640
 right?

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.440
 So it's really all about the flow of the electrons.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.920
 The acetyl group is just two carbons and like four hydrogens attached to it.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.020
 And so what you've got is you have a bunch of high energy electrons and they, those electrons

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.840
 all need to somehow recombine with oxygen to make CO2 and H2O.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.480
 That's how they're going to leave the body.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.600
 And so what you have, if you have a bunch of these acetyl groups, if you have all of

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.280
 these electrons and they need to somehow get out, right?

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.120
 And so, so the body essentially has a choice.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.480
 How do we get rid of the electrons?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.740
 We can do one of two things.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:45.320
 We can either burn the electrons as, you know, as energy, as calories, we can do some kind

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:52.320
 of thermogenesis or we can, just as Dr. Peat suggested, we can start converting them into

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320
 fat.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.440
 We can build them back into fat and we can store them.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.440
 Right.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:06.800
 And so, um, and so, you know, our metabolic rate within each cell, um, as calories come

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:13.080
 in our mitochondria literally have a decision to make and they can either burn that fuel

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.080
 or they can store that fuel.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.080
 And what determines that is the rate of reductive stress that the cell is in.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.960
 If the cell sees that there's a lot of NADH and not much NAD plus, and if there's a lot

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:32.520
 of these, if there's a lot of this acetyl CoA around, which is basically, it's all fuel,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.520
 right?

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.720
 The, the cell see the, the mitochondria sees fuel burning up both as NADH and as acetyl

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720
 CoA.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.320
 Now the cell is in reductive stress.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.900
 When that happens, the cell is going to make the decision.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:51.020
 We need to store this as fat because it's building up and we're not burning it fast

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.020
 enough, right?

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.100
 That's, that's what the, so the cell is monitoring this kind of reductive stress.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.620
 And so, okay, well, what, what is the thing that has changed?

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.140
 Why did we not used to be in this reductive stress?

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.380
 And now we are because we ate these vegetable oils.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:14.460
 Um, and what I believe it is, is there is a system in the mitochondria and it is, it's

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.260
 sort of a detoxification system if you want to call it that, although that's not really

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.700
 how I think of it.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:25.540
 Um, what it is, is saturated fat when we burn them in the mitochondria create a lot of reactive

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.460
 oxygen species.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:35.060
 And what that means is, um, the electrons, instead of making ATP, they're just, they're,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.700
 they're, they're kicking out of the electron transport chain and they don't make it all

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.700
 the way through.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.320
 And then what happens is they recombine with oxygen to form this thing called superoxide.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.660
 And superoxide is a reactive oxygen species.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:53.540
 It's a free radical and everyone thinks that it's bad, but the more that we learn about

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.700
 it, we actually have this very efficient system in the mitochondria, which gets rid of the

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.300
 kind of danger of it.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.460
 And this is done by something called glutathione, which a lot of people have probably heard

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.220
 about it's called the body's master antioxidant.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:15.220
 Uh, the glutathione is our superoxide dismutase comes in first, it makes hydrogen peroxide.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.460
 Um, the hydrogen peroxide is very efficiently eliminated by glutathione.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:27.060
 And then glutathione reductase gives us a molecule of NADP plus in this other enzyme

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.860
 called NNT converts that to NAD plus.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:39.500
 So what happens is for every, for every molecule of superoxide that is generated in the mitochondria

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.500
 and goes through that pathway, we get an NAD plus back.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:50.820
 And so essentially the more, the faster that we can drive, because remember, reductive

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:57.660
 stress is just too many electrons that haven't recombined with oxygen.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:03.380
 So every electron that comes out of the electron transport chain and create superoxide and

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:08.660
 then is efficiently, you know, detoxified or whatever you want to call it by the body.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:14.500
 Well that's another electron that's like a, it's like a, it's like a pressure valve that

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.820
 opens up and it's like, okay, well if there's too much energy in this cell, we open the

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.180
 pressure valve, we just blow off some of the extra pressure.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.420
 And now we're no longer in reductive stress because those electrons can just flow straight

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:32.180
 back to oxygen and it's all dealt with very efficiently.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:41.420
 And the problem is that the, the, the PUPA, when they go through the mitochondria, they

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:47.620
 don't create as much input at complex two of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.300
 And that's what drives the, the, the ROS in the first place.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:59.780
 So my argument is that this thing that we've all been very scared of, this idea of creating

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:05.900
 reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria sounds very scary, but when everything is

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:12.580
 working correctly, when everything was the way that it used to be, that, that, that and

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:20.380
 let me be very clear about the, the, the path of the pathway of this, it's reactive oxygen

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:29.420
 species and then it's superoxide dismutase and that makes it into hydrogen peroxide.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:36.060
 Glutathione turns the hydrogen peroxide into water and then glutathione peroxidase or sorry,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:43.260
 glutathione reductase gives us an NADP plus back and then NADP plus swaps the NADP plus

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.300
 into NAD plus.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.380
 And that NAD plus is what allows our metabolism to just keep on cranking.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:56.900
 And so that system of, of getting rid of the reactive oxygen species is actually, that's

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.440
 the top gear of our metabolism and the PUPA eliminates it.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.900
 And everybody's like, well, PUPA are great because they eliminate, you know, when we,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.340
 when we oxidize PUPA in our mitochondria, we're not making as many reactive oxygen species.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.340
 And that's true.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:14.740
 We're not.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:21.340
 But the problem is that the reactive oxygen species actually are the fifth gear of our

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.340
 metabolism.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.620
 You know, that's, that's what I think.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:32.740
 And that's what I think is ultimately the problem with the PUPA.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:42.220
 The alternative to all of that though is to oxidize more glucose and the medical doctrine

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:51.820
 about diabetes has totally deranged, made it impossible for them to understand what

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.580
 reductive stress is.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:17:02.780
 They say that eating too much sugar can cause reductive stress.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:12.780
 And they say, it seems that the people who are making lactic acid showing excess reduction

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.820
 are doing it because they have high glucose.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:31.100
 They put the blame on glucose rather than seeing it's the oxidation of fats blocking

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:40.780
 the inter-annual cycle effect, blocking the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:50.940
 And if you think of the meaning of oxygen where the concept came from, it means acid

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.740
 source, oxy acid and tin.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:05.700
 And oxygen is recognized as the acidifier of the cytoplasm.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:13.220
 And the cytoplasm is alive when it's acidic.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:25.380
 The living state depends on oxygen creating a constant acid tension, in effect a deficiency

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.580
 of electrons.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:38.740
 Basically by the presence of carbon dioxide attaching to the protein water system of the

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:47.020
 cell, oxygen making carbon dioxide acidifies the cell and sustains life.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:55.940
 The diabetes theory gets it exactly backwards seeing glucose as a reductant.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:04.740
 Glucose is the source of our basic acidifier.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:18.740
 If you can keep your glucose oxidation up, you are decreasing the formation of fat.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:32.460
 The reduction condition produced by a deficiency of carbon dioxide from lower glucose consumption

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:45.380
 that the deficiency of carbon dioxide is what turns on the fatty acid synthesis and turns

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:57.220
 on the production of fat even when we should be using the energy rather than storing it

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.180
 as fat.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:12.220
 That is where the reductive imbalance becomes obvious with oxidation of glucose to carbon

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:22.620
 dioxide decreasing the oxidative state of the cytoplasm or favoring a reductive state

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.260
 of the cytoplasm.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:35.220
 And that's why breathing carbon dioxide is therapeutic in so many ways, anti-inflammatory,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.220
 pro-respiratory.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:45.460
 Dr. Peat, what was the thing that you said turns on the fatty acid synthase?

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.340
 A reductive state.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:21:00.020
 One of the functions, how the sick cell is seeing it, is like age pigment production.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:15.540
 The process of making fat is one way of disposing of the free electrons, keeping the cell acidified

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:20.860
 to the degree that lets it go on living.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:30.060
 The production of fat becomes an electron sink, so it's defensive but with a lot of

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.060
 bad consequences.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:47.020
 Yeah, I mean, I think I agree with most of what you're saying.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:54.260
 I do have this question, I think, which is what in your opinion would be the difference

00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:02.660
 between me eating bread with butter versus bread with soybean oil?

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:11.820
 How does the bread with soybean oil lead to reductive stress versus the bread with butter?

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:20.140
 Probably the major, both immediate and long-range effects are to block thyroid function and

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:26.900
 activate estrogen function.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.660
 That happens right in the bloodstream as you're absorbing the fat.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:38.660
 It turns several switches all in the wrong direction.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:50.740
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know that much about how estrogen works, but it's very interesting.

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.060
 So Brad, can you help me understand?

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:59.340
 It sounds like you guys are both saying high PUFA diet causes this reductive stress problem

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.380
 in the cells, which leads to obesity, but there's a little bit of difference in how

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.620
 this works for both of you?

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.620
 I don't understand it.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.500
 Yeah, I mean, I believe that we're both, I mean, we are both very much on the same page

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:19.340
 with the idea that reductive stress is a buildup of molecules in the reduced state.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.900
 The example molecule that I mentioned was NADH, is the reduced version of NAD.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:35.500
 And so when the cell is in the reduced state, as Dr. Peat said, that raises the production

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:42.300
 of fatty acid synthase, which I'm 100% in agreement with, absolute agreement.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:51.180
 So I think what we are both in agreement with is when the cell becomes too reduced, that

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:58.820
 is when de novo lipogenesis happens, and that is when we start making fat from our food

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.620
 rather than burning fat.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:13.780
 I think what we have differences in is perhaps what causes the reductive stress in the first

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:22.500
 place when we eat polyunsaturated fat, and there's a good chance that we're actually

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.540
 both correct.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.860
 We're talking about two different mechanisms, but as far as I know, they might be reinforcing

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.860
 mechanisms.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.780
 I don't think there's any reason to think that one ...

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.820
 So you're saying what?

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.260
 Because Dr. Peat's saying it's estrogen, right?

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:48.580
 Dr. Peat is saying that it has effects on, yes, estrogen and thyroid hormone.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:49.900
 And you're saying it's what?

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:58.860
 I am suggesting that it actually has to do with this mitochondrial system of ROS, this

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:10.140
 system of reactive oxygen species removal, which involves glutathione reductase and the

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:17.460
 enzyme called NNT, both of which together, while removing reactive oxygen species, they

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.820
 end up oxidizing the NADH back to NAD+.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:28.660
 So it's this kind of physical mechanism of oxidizing NADH and giving us back NAD+, with

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.580
 the net result that the reactive oxygen species are eliminated.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:42.820
 If you increase your thyroid function, which increases oxidation of glucose and production

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:53.700
 of CO2, the production of reactive oxygen species declines sharply as the oxygen consumption

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:59.380
 increases, uncoupling to survive.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:04.660
 There's a good paper with that title.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:17.780
 The faster you run the electron transport chain, oxidizing all the way to oxygen, and

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:26.820
 the mechanism is that that increases your CO2 production, and it simultaneously suppresses

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.660
 reactive oxygen formation.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:45.220
 So the relatively quiet mitochondrion can be producing very toxic reactive oxygen species,

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:53.140
 and if you can get it revved up with thyroid and glucose and CO2, that suppresses reactive

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.140
 oxygen.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.140
 Right.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.740
 And I don't disagree with any of that.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:11.180
 And what I've seen is that, for instance, in a lot of mouse models, for instance, there

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:23.340
 is a mouse model that sort of stimulates intense reductive stress, which is they've made a

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.100
 knockout of the gene SIRT3.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:32.780
 And so, anyway, I don't want to go into the whole story of that, but those mice, as Dr.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:40.220
 Peat suggests, while they're on a high-starch diet, they burn tons of glucose, and they're

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.940
 just fine.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:48.060
 But when they start to oxidize too much fat, that's when they get into problems, and that's

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.020
 when you see fatty acid synthase spike.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:58.580
 And so I think that this ROS system that I'm talking about, and this ROS removal system

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:04.500
 is very specific to when the animal is on a high-fat diet, or when the animal is actually

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:09.700
 burning a lot of its own fat, presumably.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:16.020
 And I think that the ability to burn glucose is clearly good.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.700
 I mean, if you can burn glucose, that's great.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.720
 That's what healthy animals are supposed to be able to do.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.940
 And I think that's very clear that that's true in humans.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:31.900
 And it's more when we burn a high-fat diet, that's when we tend to see the reductive stress.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:39.680
 And so I think that the system that I'm talking about really is specific to the quality of

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.740
 the fat that you're burning when you're burning fat, which I also agree with Dr. Peat that that

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:54.580
 happens mostly, one, if you're eating a high-fat diet, but also if you're obese, you tend to

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.380
 rely a lot more on that leg of your metabolism, which is burning fat.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.100
 And that is when you can get into more trouble with reductive stress.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:11.400
 And so I'm in 95% agreement, I think, with Dr. Peat.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:18.960
 Dr. Peat, what do you think of Brad's explanation of that specific mechanism that he's describing

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.960
 for the—

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:20.960
 I think it's right.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.400
 It looks like you're in 100% agreement, Brad.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.400
 Yeah.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.880
 It sounds that way.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.220
 So Brad has a specific—you're doing some experimentation to try to solve this obesity

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.600
 problem using your own experimentation.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.400
 And I wanted to see if Dr. Peat can see if that's on the right path.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.440
 Would you mind sharing, Brad, with the class a little bit?

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.440
 Yeah.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.440
 Well, yeah.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:54.920
 I mean, I actually—there is one that I'm actually very curious about Dr. Peat's specific

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.880
 supplement that I've been thinking about.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.760
 And I suspect he's not going to like it, but I'll let him answer.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:08.120
 Dr. Peat, I've been looking at the supplement of lipoic acid, and the reason is that it

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.360
 seems to oxidize NADH back to NAD+.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.640
 And I was wondering if that's something you're familiar with and/or had any thoughts

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640
 on.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.640
 No.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:24.800
 I don't know if it disposes of its electrons.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800
 What's that?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.960
 How does it dispose of the electrons?

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:40.760
 It seems like what happens—it has two cysteines that when you consume it are oxidized.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:52.800
 And within hours, the molecules are taken up into—well, it seems like it has, I believe,

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.440
 a right-handed and left-handed version.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.320
 And one of them go into the mitochondria and the other go into the cytoplasm, and those

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.600
 cysteines get reduced.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.520
 And then the body essentially eliminates the lipoic acid.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.200
 And so it's a naturally produced cofactor that is used in a bunch of human enzymes.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:22.120
 And so it's a human compound that seems like it behaves differently if used as a supplement

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.960
 versus how the body creates it.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:29.360
 But essentially, you eat it in the oxidized form.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.000
 It relatively rapidly is reduced and then broken down and excreted.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.880
 Seems to be how it works.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:43.960
 It's a pretty long track record of having good evidence, both in mouse and human studies.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.360
 And it's something that I've been experimenting with.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:32:00.920
 I've read a lot about it, but I'm not sure how safe its disposal of the electrons is.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.240
 Right.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:09.440
 Yeah, I mean, it's like a lot of things.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.000
 There are certainly lots of questions about it.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.400
 But it does seem to be one of the few...

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.920
 Why is he worried about the electrons?

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.440
 Is that going to cause obesity?

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.720
 Is that what Dr. Peat, you're saying?

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.600
 He might cause obesity too?

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.640
 No, no.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:40.880
 Just that anything that alters the cysteine and glutathione balance is likely to be harmful

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.040
 more often than helpful.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:51.120
 In this case, it seems like it is specifically using the...

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:59.960
 Well, yeah, it is oxidizing NADH back to NAD+.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.880
 Seems to be its primary mode of action.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:09.920
 And then that does sometimes have downstream effects on...

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.640
 It actually tends to wind up with a more reduced glutathione pool, but it seems like its primary

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:27.800
 mode of action is to oxidize NADH back to NAD+.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.160
 That should be good.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:42.880
 A test would be if you look at the resting lactate content of the blood, would a supplement

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:51.920
 of lipoic acid lower that, indicating that it's affecting the whole system pretty much

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.640
 in a constructive way?

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640
 Right.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.600
 Yeah, in my case, with a little lactate meter that I had, it did seem to do that.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.400
 But then I ran out of the test strips and I haven't been able to get more yet.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.920
 So in one small experiment, it seemed like it did that, but I need to repeat that.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.160
 But that's good because that's exactly the test that I was planning on using.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.400
 So I'm glad that you think that's maybe on the right track.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.480
 Brad, what about your sterculic oil, your tropical nut oil, and your succulinate or

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480
 whatever that is?

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.480
 Succinate, yeah.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:36.160
 Well, succinate is one that I've been-- so this is, I think, this is very specific to

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:53.120
 the idea of when we see obesity and when we see animals in torpor, they have down-regulated

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.560
 activity of their mitochondrial complex 2.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.120
 Especially in torpor, that is one of the first things that is lowered as the animal goes

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.640
 into torpor.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:14.440
 And so complex 2 is the very thing that is driving the system that I was talking about

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:20.240
 with the ROS production and the glutathione reductase and the NNT.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:27.640
 And so to me, when I see that in obesity and in torpor animals, they're both lowering this

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.760
 complex 2, I think, well, maybe we need to return that complex 2 activity.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:40.320
 And the first way that you do that is by getting out of reductive stress, because what happens

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.960
 is in reductive stress is that complex 2 becomes acetylated.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.720
 So when I was saying that one of the things that builds up in reductive stress is this

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:59.920
 acetyl coenzyme A, well, those acetyl groups actually will stop your-- it seems to be a

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.980
 natural process.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.160
 This isn't done with an enzyme.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.280
 Those acetyl groups will literally stick on to your mitochondrial enzymes, and they'll

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.280
 stop working.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:11.380
 So complex 1 that transfers electrons will just stop working.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.080
 Complex 2 will stop working.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:19.060
 And so pretty soon, all your mitochondrial enzymes are not working anymore.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.200
 And then you wonder, why am I not able to burn energy?

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.640
 And it's like, oh, well, all my mitochondrial enzymes are turned off because I'm in reductive

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640
 stress.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:31.640
 And so the first step is to get out of reductive stress.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.920
 And that's why I've been thinking about things like lipoic acid to help.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.720
 And then once you've done that-- and you can do that.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.040
 You can perhaps do that with some intermittent fasting.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:51.460
 But once you've done that and gotten your mitochondrial enzymes working again, then

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:59.300
 the best way to stimulate complex 2, which is the first thing to get turned off in TORPER,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.600
 is to give it its preferred fuel, which is the succinate.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:09.940
 And so what you see is that the difference between PUFA and saturated fat is PUFA has

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:17.300
 less input to complex 2, and monounsaturated fat has less input to complex 2.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:23.260
 So the idea is that if you were to eat some unsaturated fat with succinate, you're sort

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:29.340
 of mimicking as if you had eaten the saturated fat in the first place.

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:41.060
 Now that is not going to fix the effects that Dr. Peat has suggested on estrogen and thyroid

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:53.700
 hormone, but at least biochemically, it restores the balance of complex 1 and complex 2 inputs

00:37:53.700 --> 00:38:01.700
 that saturated fat would have at the mitochondrial entrance point, if that makes sense.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:09.420
 It was kind of a lot of jargon there, but-- Dr. Peat, does that succinate idea have any

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.860
 resonance with your research?

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:13.980
 Did I say the word right, succinate?

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.380
 Succinate is what I said.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.340
 Yeah, it's a possibility.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:26.580
 Do you have another alternative recommendation for people trying to overcome the obesity

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:33.900
 problem caused by this PUFA problem?

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:46.740
 Starting with close attention to your thyroid and carbon dioxide levels, the fact that carbon

00:38:46.740 --> 00:39:01.740
 dioxide in itself will turn off the production of lactate shows that its action on the cytoplasm

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:10.260
 in many different ways is restorative of the oxidative state.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:25.980
 The gaseous CO2 is a powerful acid, a Lewis acid, that binds to the proteins above other

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:36.980
 things and in binding to the protein, it acidifies the protein and the whole cytoplasm, correcting

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:50.860
 in an instantaneous way some of the reductive stress, simply retracting the electrons into

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.780
 the system, making it more acidic.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:59.260
 Brad, what does that mean to you?

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.500
 Can you explain?

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.700
 You know, even I'm going to have to think about that one for a bit.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:09.540
 What does that mean in terms of a dietary intervention, though?

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.540
 What is that, Dr. Peat?

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:17.620
 Are you saying increase your carbohydrates to get rid of the obesity problem?

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.620
 Yeah.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:29.260
 You don't want to overload either on fat or protein because that can interfere with your

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:42.900
 ability to oxidize enough glucose carbohydrate.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.700
 So you want to keep your protein moderate?

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.300
 Is that what you're saying?

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.300
 Yeah.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:41:00.100
 The ketogenic diet often is high protein among other things, but the ketogenic diet is powerfully

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:15.380
 stressful, reductively, interfering with thyroid function and the consumption of electrons.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:28.260
 The concept of oxidation, if you start with St. Georgie and Gilbert Ling, the meaning

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:39.700
 of oxidation looks very different from the standard medical thinking in terms of the

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.140
 Brunstad-Lowry acid.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:55.220
 Their thinking is based on the Lewis acid approach.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:08.340
 The Lewis acid constitutes an acceptor of electrons and CO2 is a powerful acceptor of

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:12.700
 a set of electrons.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:26.620
 In doing that, through an inductive effect, the affinity for electrons is transmitted

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:34.460
 from the carbon dioxide through the adjoining parts of the protein chain.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:44.060
 And that's at the root of what reductive stress is doing wrong.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:54.980
 The CO2 acidifies the system, retracts electrons, makes them less reactive, less harmful.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:43:07.300
 And that goes back to the very beginning of the century with Moses Gomberg and his understanding.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:13.020
 He was the one that first produced a stable free radical.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:26.420
 One of his students was W.F. Koch who investigated the role of electron acceptors, powerful electron

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.860
 acceptors, as therapeutic agents.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:40.100
 And that combination of thinking of Moses Gomberg and W.F. Koch was a powerful influence

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:52.260
 on St. George and working more or less at the same time Gilbert Ling was applying the

00:43:52.260 --> 00:44:08.420
 same ideas of the long-range inducting effects of electron affinity agents, especially carbon

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:20.820
 dioxide.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:28.360
 You know, Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, I was listening to her, she's a natural holistic doctor.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:34.460
 She has a concept called muscle-centric medicine that she believes you've got to really get

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:42.820
 a lot of protein, especially animal protein, to improve your metabolism and ward off problems

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.820
 like obesity.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.260
 It's all about gaining muscle.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:52.140
 She's very pro lots of protein, but you're saying protein is in the way here of solving

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.140
 obesity?

00:44:53.140 --> 00:45:04.220
 Especially some of the amino acids that are anti-thyroid, anti-metabolic, and excitotoxic

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:15.020
 amino acids, especially mesionine, cysteine, and tryptophan, but some of the other excitotoxins

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:23.380
 like glutamate and aspartate contribute to the problem.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:32.380
 Once your growth slows down, then you should reduce the ratio of protein to carbohydrates.

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:40.380
 So in your 20s and 30s, there should be a drastic cutback in the proportion of protein

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.380
 to carbohydrates.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:47.940
 And that won't cause deterioration of muscle organs or whatever?

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:55.460
 No, actually it helps.

00:45:55.460 --> 00:46:06.580
 If you look at restriction of just single amino acids, animal experiments found that

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:18.100
 getting mesionine intake right down to the bare limit that you need for exchanging, for

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:28.500
 renewing cells that are turning over, there's a certain amount that is required.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:35.060
 And anything beyond that begins to have anti-metabolic effects.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:45.420
 Just by restricting mesionine to that bare minimum, they got 40% lifespan extension in

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.580
 animals.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:56.660
 And restricting other amino acids, you get great benefits, not necessarily as high as

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.660
 40%.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:08.100
 Dr. Peat, I know that there is, well, I've read a few papers recently suggesting that

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.660
 branched chain amino acids, at least high circulating levels of branched chain amino

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:22.020
 acids, were very preferred for beginning new fat chains in de novo lipogenesis.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:28.980
 I believe this was specific to white adipose tissue, white fat.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.620
 Is that something you're familiar with or do you think it's similar to what you were

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:35.620
 talking about?

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:44.900
 Yeah, too much of several of the amino acids can derange things and turn your metabolism

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.460
 upside down.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.700
 So you're suggesting that someone who's dealing with serious obesity should increase

00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:01.340
 their carbohydrate consumption, of course, avoid high poof of foods, and moderate their

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.300
 protein consumption, is that correct?

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.860
 Yes.

00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:13.300
 And does your prescription for obesity include lots of exercise of any type?

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.660
 No, not especially.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.020
 And there's no fasting or anything?

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.540
 No normal activity.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:31.380
 So is there specific carbohydrates you're suggesting for obesity that people eat to

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.060
 lose weight that way?

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:43.460
 No, anything that the digestive system works with.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:51.380
 Because it's indigestible, you don't want things that cause gas and discomfort.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.900
 I'm interested in exploring this.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.420
 I did carnivore for several months, nose-to-tail carnivore, Dr. Peat.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:05.460
 I was eating kidneys and liver and muscle meat, rib eyes, and that was it.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.780
 And I did it for months doing that, you know, testicle, everything.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.700
 I mean, I tried everything, pancreas.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:18.140
 And I lost a lot of weight, and I noticed how like I'd wake up, and it was like when

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.860
 I woke up, it was like, bam, the lights came on, there was no grogginess.

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:27.540
 Like when I eat a high-carb diet, and when I'm struggling with weight, and I'm trying

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.500
 to eat a high-carb diet, I get groggy, I get brain fog.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.860
 So what you're saying is so, I mean, and I know you're saying the poofas are what's causing

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:41.540
 that, but when someone's not eating poofa, you're saying to increase the carbohydrates.

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.100
 But what was I experiencing?

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.980
 I don't mean, I'm not asking you to get into my particular situation, but how come I was

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:53.500
 finding energy and waking up fully alert when I was on a nose-to-tail carnivore diet?

00:49:53.500 --> 00:50:05.940
 The good thing about an all animal food diet is that it doesn't contain the lectins and

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.060
 botanical toxins.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:16.500
 Plants being sedentary need chemical defenses.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:29.020
 And so even most of the plant materials that are good foods do contain anti-metabolic and

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.660
 even toxic materials.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:46.260
 The poofa function in seeds, a lot of it looks like it's specifically aimed at blocking animal

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:54.060
 digestion to defend the plant, making the seeds especially toxic.

00:50:54.060 --> 00:51:01.780
 But leaves are also among the most toxic parts of the plant.

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:06.780
 They're essential for the plant's energy production and growth.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:13.700
 But the fruits are the lowest in defensive toxins.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:22.260
 And the fruit has to be pleasing to organisms to spread the seeds.

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:38.900
 And the root vegetables often have useful antibiotics and lack the mammalian toxins

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:42.980
 that above ground parts of the plant need.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:50.700
 So the root vegetables don't have to worry about grazers, but they are defensive against

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:55.180
 fungus, bacteria, and worms.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:06.380
 And so they can improve our intestinal conditions by some antibiotic effects.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:12.340
 So would you be okay then, or would you recommend or be friendly with a nose-to-tail carnivore

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:18.540
 diet that wasn't so heavy on muscle meats, but maybe you incorporate shellfish and liver

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:22.180
 and other things we're going to get some of the carbohydrates from, or you think that's

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:26.340
 not enough carbohydrates for a healthy long-term diet?

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:39.300
 Yeah, I think for a relatively methionine and tryptophan-deficient diet is better than

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:51.900
 the things you gain from a basically meat diet are digestibility and freedom from plant

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:52.900
 toxins.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:53:00.380
 But still, you have the metabolic suppressive effect of the tryptophan.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:10.020
 Dr. Peat, what do you think of the idea that in a healthy person, and we see this all over

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:14.700
 the world, that we should be burning a lot of carbohydrate and it's really good for you,

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:22.380
 but in an obese person who has stored up a lifetime of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:29.740
 fat, if that person then immediately tries to switch to a high-carbohydrate diet, it

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:35.420
 doesn't work because you're still going to have the reductive stress because any time

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:42.340
 between meals, you're switching back to burning your own body fat, which is full of polyunsaturated

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.900
 and monounsaturated fats.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:55.380
 Yeah, and keeping adequate glycogen stores is essential so that you don't have these

00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:01.580
 surges of PUFA coming out of your tissues.

00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:10.740
 And to store adequate glycogen, it not only requires carbohydrate in the diet, but a good

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.060
 thyroid function.

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:23.140
 And so to unload the PUFA safely, you need thyroid and glycogen to activate the liver's

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.580
 detoxifying system.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:36.980
 When the liver is supported with its carbohydrate and thyroid, it can produce the detoxifying

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:49.060
 glucuronidation and sulfation systems that will treat circulating PUFA as toxins.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:56.700
 And during the night, instead of circulating and poisoning your brain progressively because

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:05.140
 your glucose drops during the night, creates lipolysis, the bad fatty acids equilibrate

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:10.540
 into your brain, cause brain damage every night.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:21.100
 If you keep your carbohydrate and thyroid up in a good range, then your liver recognizes

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:31.060
 those circulating PUFA molecules as toxins to be sulfated and glucuronidated for excretion

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:36.980
 through the kidneys so you don't have to oxidize them.

00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:38.740
 Interesting.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:46.700
 So, you know, I want you to be right, Dr. Peate, because I want to eat ice cream and

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.820
 stuff, but it hasn't worked out for me when I've done it.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:57.420
 So I got to figure out how to do that right, you know?

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:07.860
 Some of the safest carbohydrates are orange juice and grape juice because those are high

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:24.740
 in the flavonoids, which have the—inside the cell, they work as pro-oxidants.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:32.140
 What about—would you still recommend people avoid common, you know, wheat products when

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:36.780
 they're in an obese state or overweight state like that?

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:49.180
 If they have digestive reactions to them, yeah, bread, industrial bread is a big problem

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:59.060
 because of the way it's made instead of traditional leavening, which broke down a

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.620
 lot of the toxins.

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:13.340
 The quick production methods leave a lot of the seed toxins in it.

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:26.140
 Like you mentioned, white rice is a detoxified grain carbohydrate that is relatively safe.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:30.220
 So you would recommend that people just up their carbohydrate intake?

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:35.020
 They don't have to add extra diet—I mean exercise regimen into your prescription for

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.020
 obesity.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:39.580
 They just need to up their carbohydrate intake to how many carbs a day?

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.900
 How many grams of carb are we talking about here?

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:50.980
 Oh, there are lots of animal and human experiments showing that you can add hundreds of calories

00:57:50.980 --> 00:58:02.940
 of carbohydrate to a standard diet without increasing any fat storage because that moderate

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:11.580
 amount of increased carbohydrate increases the metabolic rate by—usually the experiments

00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:19.580
 show a 20% increase in metabolic rate when you add a few hundred calories of carbohydrate

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.140
 to a standard diet.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:27.180
 Dr. Peate, is there a study like that that you can remember off the top of your head

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.980
 that would be a good one to read?

00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:29.980
 No.

00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:35.380
 Sorry, I don't mean to put you on the spot.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.500
 I know it's hard to remember these things.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:38.660
 I can rarely remember either.

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:45.580
 So you're saying, like, are we talking like 500 carbs a day or what are we talking about

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.580
 here?

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.020
 Three or four hundred has been used in—

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:51.020
 What did you say?

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.020
 I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:57.660
 Three or four hundred calories extra.

00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.780
 What does that translate into grams of carbs?

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:01.500
 I'm thinking about like packaging and stuff.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.820
 It's about a hundred grams.

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:06.380
 Four hundred would be a hundred grams.

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:08.620
 So he's saying eat a hundred carbs a day?

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.660
 Is that what you're saying, Dr. Peat?

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.700
 At least that.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.780
 That's still considered low carb by a lot of American standards, though.

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.180
 I'm trying to understand.

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:22.620
 Yeah, I think several hundred.

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:25.980
 That's extra added to a standard diet.

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:30.540
 He's saying that they've showed that if you take someone that's at weight balance at,

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:36.980
 say, 2,500 calories a day on their normal diet, you can give them an additional 300

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.340
 calories of pure carbs on top of that 2,500 without weight gain.

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:47.580
 Yeah, that's been done in several different animal experiments as well as a few human

00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:48.780
 experiments.

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:54.460
 So how do you burn all that toxic poof of fat that you've stored if you're obese?

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:57.300
 You don't really want to burn it.

00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:06.700
 You want to support your liver so it can excrete it.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:17.540
 When you wake up with foamy urine in the morning, a lot of that is the poof that has been detoxified

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:26.420
 and turned into a sulfate or a glucagonide with a soapy function so it goes into the

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.420
 urine.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:32.020
 So you secrete the poof, you do not burn the poof.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:34.020
 That's the safe way to get rid of it.

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020
 Yeah.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.900
 And it takes several years once you stop eating high poof of foods, right?

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.420
 Or no?

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:41.420
 Yeah.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:48.820
 Typically, both animal and human experiments suggest four years for a complete turnover.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:49.820
 Wow.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:56.420
 So you just got to urinate it all away.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.900
 Is there another way to get out of it, to get rid of it?

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.300
 That's what I've come across.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.860
 Oh, my goodness.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:03.860
 Wow.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:12.140
 Does that mean that if you're burning, so you're upping your carbohydrate intake and

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:20.980
 then you don't have to add extra exercise or anything and then that will burn the fat,

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:21.980
 the health weight.

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:26.020
 You're burning, but how do you get rid of the fat if you're not burning it?

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.020
 You're excreting it.

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.020
 Okay, okay.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.020
 Yeah.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.020
 Wow.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:37.980
 And the thyroid is essential for liver detoxifying systems.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:42.740
 So just eating lots of carbohydrates, including table sugar, can help you lose weight.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:43.740
 Right.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:49.420
 It's been done experimentally.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:54.380
 But so everybody who's overeating carbs and gaining weight are doing it because they're

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.420
 eating high poof of two, right?

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.420
 Yeah.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.420
 Okay.

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.380
 And Brad, you're saying, I don't agree, or at least not necessarily.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.540
 I'm not saying you're saying disagree, but you're saying that's not enough because if

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:11.780
 you're dysfunctional from the high poof accumulation, you can't go straight to high carb because

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.260
 that's why you're doing all your experiments.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.700
 Well, yeah.

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:25.100
 I mean, this is the first time that I've heard the idea that we can eliminate the poof with

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:31.980
 through urine and I'm, like I say, I'm not highly familiar with all of Dr. Peat's work.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.980
 So that's interesting to me.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.900
 It certainly had not been on my radar.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:41.820
 Brad, I'd rather drink orange juice than sterculic oil, if this is true.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.820
 Well, yeah.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.780
 And so I'm like, well, I mean, I don't know.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:45.860
 You know, that's interesting.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:56.420
 And so, but I do, here's what I do agree with that clearly metabolically healthy people

01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:02.500
 can consume an awful lot of carbohydrate without it being a long-term problem.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.260
 I think that's clear.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:10.320
 And I agree with Dr. Peat on that.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:17.420
 And I also think that, you know, when I said the average West Coast adult male, according

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:24.500
 to the USDA was eating 5,000 calories a day in, you know, the 1930s.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:30.260
 And Dr. Peat said, well, in the 1950s in the Forest Service, I was eating 9,000 calories

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.260
 a day.

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:35.180
 You know, I think that was, I think that was fairly normal.

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:39.340
 And you know, when I say things like that, everybody's like, no, that can't be possible.

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.980
 I think, I think it's true.

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:48.260
 You know, all of the evidence that we have suggests that it was true, but people don't

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:57.140
 want, there's a sort of a vociferous, somehow that really like hits at people's core beliefs

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:59.660
 and they don't like hearing that.

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:02.980
 And then when we say, well, it's not really because of exercise.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.460
 And Dr. Peat just said, well, when I was eating 9,000 calories a day, I was just walking through

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.540
 the woods and like placing small trees.

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.580
 It wasn't particularly arduous work.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580
 Sure.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.900
 I mean, I was walking around.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.900
 And I think that that-

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.940
 Is that important, Dr. Peat, that you walk around a lot, even if it's brisk or not brisk

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.940
 or whatever?

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.940
 Yeah.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:35.740
 Just not feeling trapped in an office cubicle is a very de-stressing experience.

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:41.220
 Just free movement is the important thing.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.340
 For how long a day?

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:58.060
 Oh, well, people are sedentary mostly because they're trapped by circumstances.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:08.220
 If you have an opportunity to shoot baskets or play tennis or something, the fun of an

01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:12.100
 activity is what's important.

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:17.540
 Is sunlight very important for this metabolic rate increase that you're talking about?

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.540
 Oh, definitely.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:29.900
 Certainly sunlight and vitamin D support the metabolic rate to the extent that you can

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:44.340
 correct obesity mostly by increasing a person's vitamin D and calcium intake as a very anti-obesity

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.340
 action.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.140
 So, Dr. Peat, you're suggesting that Brad doesn't ... He's talking about this experimentation

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:55.740
 of trying to stop this reductive stress problem caused by the high PUFA.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:06:04.180
 You're saying you don't need to have an intermediary stage where you introduce these other ... The

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.060
 lipoic acid and the succinate and all that.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:08.060
 You don't need to do that.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:13.860
 You can go straight to high carb and up your carbohydrates, and you can burn ... You can

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.700
 lose weight that way.

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.700
 Yeah.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:24.140
 And you're saying that even table sugar for massively obese people or just go wild on

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:27.220
 the table sugar can still help or no?

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:36.340
 Well, it isn't nutritional in other ways, but a couple of my articles I write about

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:47.940
 a French and an English doctor who found that they could cure diabetes very quickly by letting

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:55.500
 people eat all of the sugar in addition to their beef and potato diet or whatever they

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.620
 were eating.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:08.380
 And they often craved so much sugar that they would eat approaching a pound of sugar per

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:12.500
 day as well as their other foods.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.260
 And after just a couple of weeks of doing that, they stopped wasting away.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:30.060
 People who were obviously going to die quickly from the wasting of diabetes, the wasting

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:38.240
 stopped in a couple of weeks, and they recovered the ability to oxidize glucose and could go

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.580
 back to a standard diet and go to work.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:46.820
 Well, how come people find benefit on diabetes doing ketosis though?

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:52.660
 I've heard so many different stories of people doing carnivore or ketogenic diets and having

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:56.500
 huge rebounding in health with diabetes, they report.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:05.700
 Is that two ways the skin of a cat or what's going on there?

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.660
 What they call diabetes.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:15.460
 Many different things are called diabetes.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:25.860
 Diabetes was a classical insulin deficient type 1 diabetes where cachexia and death from

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:32.620
 wasting are the very quick outcomes of classical diabetes.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:42.540
 And obesity has been called diabetes only because it involves high blood sugar.

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.460
 It's a very different thing.

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:50.580
 Okay I see what you're saying.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:56.100
 What about the argument that people in tradition, we were fat hunters, we evolved to eat, we

01:08:56.100 --> 01:09:01.980
 were eating these massive fatty animals and then later on even in more indigenous communities,

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:06.380
 natives, tribes and so forth, they're always eating the organ meats and they're eating

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.300
 these fatty animals and megafauna.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:13.900
 Does that not have any support for you?

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:23.140
 I think that's bragging by hunters who exaggerated their hunting abilities.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:34.860
 I think the hunting gathering cultures really were basically living on the women's gathering

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:44.140
 of roots and fruits and the men occasionally would have success hunting.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:54.540
 But I don't think that there's any anthropological reality to the hunter-meat-eater origin of

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.820
 people.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:01.420
 I think we're descended from fruit-eating monkeys.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:05.820
 So you don't buy the whole mammoths went extinct because they were being driven into extinction

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.020
 by all these archaic hunters going out.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.020
 No.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.020
 Okay, interesting.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:15.860
 But it's a very fascinating stuff.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:21.740
 Brad, any final thoughts or anything or questions?

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:29.580
 Yeah, I mean, sorry, just getting over the flu.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:34.940
 Yeah, I mean, we went a lot of places there.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.620
 I think it's a good discussion.

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.260
 I'm trying to think if there's anything in particular.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:51.180
 I mean, you know, I think that Dr. Peat and I are in broad agreement that the process

01:10:51.180 --> 01:11:01.460
 of this kind of reductive stress and this over—I don't want to say overgrowth, but

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:08.740
 too much reduction, too much NADH and acetyl-CoA and all of these other reduced things in our

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:17.300
 cells is at the root cause that is driving both de novo lipogenesis and also our inability

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:22.820
 to efficiently use carbohydrates very broadly.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:31.220
 And I think that, you know, the reasons why—how these polyunsaturated fats are driving this

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:37.420
 process and then also what are the most efficient ways to get back out of it once we're in

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:44.340
 it, you know, I think this is going to be topics of much interest going forward.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:50.420
 And obviously, you know, I think Dr. Peat and I agree very broadly on the basics of

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:57.140
 that core idea, and we have some disagreements on the edges, but, you know, that's okay,

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:58.140
 obviously.

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:07.140
 And I just think—I think that really is where a lot of interest should be happening,

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.740
 and hopefully people are interested in this.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:15.180
 You know, I'll certainly be writing a lot about it at fireinabottle.net, and I just—I

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:18.700
 think that's really on the cutting edge of where things are going.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.100
 And there's a lot of research right now—

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.140
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Brad, I would love to—I would—I want Dr. Peat to be right

01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:25.980
 because I would rather—you know, I mean—I mean, that's what I want to—is there any

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.100
 way we could do an experiment?

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.580
 I mean, you're always doing these self-experiments.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:34.340
 Is there any experimentation you could do to try what he's saying and then see versus

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:36.380
 what you're doing and see what the market—

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.380
 Dr. Braden Hickman: Yeah, perhaps.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:42.660
 I'm gonna—I'm gonna have to think about it after this for a little while, so—see

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.500
 how we can—see how we can do this.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.500
 I don't know.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.620
 Like I said, this is the first time you're hearing it, it's the first time I'm hearing

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:52.540
 it, so I need to—I need to puzzle through it a bit before I can say that for sure.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:56.180
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Dr. Peat, any thoughts you'd like to close with?

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:58.900
 Dr. Peter Peterson: Nope.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:09.660
 I'm just gonna be reading some of St. George's work and Gilbert Ling's for a different

01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:11.460
 perspective on the meaning of—

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.460
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: I'm sorry.

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:15.180
 There's some kind of noise interference.

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.180
 Is that your thing, Brad?

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:18.180
 I'm sorry.

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:27.340
 Dr. Peter Peterson: For a different perspective on oxidation in the living system, St. George

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:32.140
 and Gilbert Ling, I think, are always good sources.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:35.300
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Wow.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.740
 Well, very good.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.220
 I really appreciate your time, both of you.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.380
 And Dr. Peat, how can people join your newsletter?

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:48.220
 Because I'm sure a lot of people would like to join your newsletter after this very interesting

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.220
 discussion.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:55.540
 Dr. Peter Peterson: It's at raypeats Newsletter at gmail.com.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.060
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Okay, very good.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.540
 And Brad, yours is FireInABottle.net, right?

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:02.540
 Dr. Peter Peterson: Yep.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:03.540
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Your blog.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:04.540
 Thank you both.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.540
 Thanks for following.

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:06.540
 Dr. Peter Peterson: FireInABottle on Twitter, but yep.

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:07.540
 FireInABottle.net is the best.

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:08.540
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Okay.

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.540
 FireInABottle on Twitter.

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:15.300
 Thank you for—and Dr. Peat, thank you again for what you've done because what—you know,

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:20.220
 regardless of whatever lingering debates there may be, you certainly seem to be a voice in

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:25.540
 the wilderness about the high PUFA seed oil problem for many decades and you know, you're

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.740
 like—were you lecturing before the 80s or did you start in the 80s lecturing, just to

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:30.740
 clarify?

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:31.740
 Dr. Peter Peterson: Oh, no.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:37.740
 I started right away in the 70s after finishing my PhD.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.700
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Thank you for doing that because you know, I think there's gonna

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.100
 be a huge cascade of people coming online to these ideas.

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.860
 So it's an idea whose time has come, as we say.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.860
 FireInABottle.net.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:50.860
 Dr. Peter Peterson.

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.860
 Yeah.

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.860
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Very good.

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:53.860
 Thank you, guys.

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:54.860
 FireInABottle.net.

01:14:54.860 --> 01:14:55.860
 Dr. Peter Peterson.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.860
 Alright.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:56.860
 Thank you.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:57.860
 Bye.

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:57.860
 Dr. Justin Marchegiani: Bye.

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:58.860
 Bye.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:14:58.860
 Bye.
