00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 The new Carl's Jr. Tex-Mex Bacon Thickburger.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 It's not for everyone.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 If you flinch when sizzling fire-roasted fajita veggies pass your table, it's not for you.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 It's not for you if the heat of pepper jack cheese once gave your mouth a boo-boo.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 But if fire-roasted peppers and onions and bacon on black Angus beef makes you want to take a massive bite while straddling the Texas-Mexico border, it's for you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.500
 Introducing the Tex-Mex Bacon Thickburger at Carl's Jr. for a limited time at participating restaurants.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
 Blog Talk Radio

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.500
 Welcome everyone. Welcome back to a brand new season of Holistic Living with Josh and Jeanne Rubin.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 As you know, we are really excited this year to launch a, I would say, anywhere from 9 to 12 shows with our one and only Ray Peat from RayPeat.com.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Today's show we're going to be talking about inflammation.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 More his view on inflammation, where it comes from, what's involved in inflammation, what's in our environment and our bodies that's creating inflammation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.500
 And our goal this entire year is to really kind of give everyone an education, whether you're a practitioner, whether you're the layperson.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 We feel like Ray can offer a lot of insight into what's going on in your life, your physiology.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 And we feel that not only can he add some insight, but it can educate you.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 So we want to start from the base, work all the way up to solutions, which will be last.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 And I'm sorry guys, let me just click Jeanne in because she has Ray on the other line.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 We're on Josh.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Yes, I hear her.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Okay.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Hey, hi Ray, how are you doing?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Hi.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 So just to introduce and tell everyone kind of where we're going this year, starting at a base, really educating people from the why behind everything instead of always talking about solutions.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 So we're starting our show, our first show, with kind of inflammation.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 And I kind of talked about why.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 So as I mentioned before guys, we're kind of leaving the whole caller thing up in the air.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 If we feel like there's a lot of callers and Ray sparks a lot of questions and interest, then we will take callers.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:36.000
 If I feel like he's on a roll and we're learning a lot and I want to get as much in as we can in this short 60 minutes, then we probably won't take callers.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Just two things.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 When you're on the line, just wait a little bit because if he's talking, I'm not going to interrupt him.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And secondly, when I click you on, please say your name and where you're calling from and I'll say your area code so I know or you know who I'm clicking in.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.000
 So I guess here we go. How's it going, Ray?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Very good. Have you talked anything about the history of what people believe about inflammation?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Well, you know, our first question was kind of, you know, what I've gathered from a lot of your research and, Jeannie, you have, based on your science and research, kind of a very different view on a lot of things.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:36.000
 Why don't you tell us kind of how the definition in your eyes of inflammation has changed and kind of maybe explain the traditional definition and give your definition of what inflammation is.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:04:02.000
 Okay. A. L. A. Metchnikoff, about 100 years ago, more than 100 years ago, discovered the phagocytes and explored the immune process in which when you put a splinter into an organism, white blood cell type cells engulfed it.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:15.000
 And they would eat it if it was edible or just concentrate and form either like a sheath or a pus deposit around it.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:32.000
 For Metchnikoff, immunity was this sort of process in which certain cells protect the organism basically by eating it up.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:48.000
 And that was considered sort of the essence of inflammation and it was a good thing. But for Metchnikoff, the immune system, he was looking at primitive organisms, cylindrates,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:05:02.000
 and he viewed this eating process as part of the developmental process maintaining and generating the proper structure of the organism.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:16.000
 There's an English doctor, Jamie Cunliffe, who is following up on Metchnikoff's idea of what the immune system is.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:33.000
 And as she expresses it, it's the process of cleaning up messes. But the general idea is that our immune system is primarily to maintain our organism.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:46.000
 And the idea of being directed at foreign invaders is really secondary to the process of fixing anything that goes wrong in the organism.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:06:06.000
 It's a developmental process primarily. But because of the person, Erlich, who got the Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff, he was working on toxins to kill invading organisms.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:21.000
 The idea of killing invaders came to be identified with immunity and inflammation throughout the 20th century.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:46.000
 Inflammation was seen as a good defensive reaction against invaders. But if you try to continue the Metchnikoff-Cunliffe idea, the inflammation really is a problem rather than a solution.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:07:00.000
 When things are really working smoothly, we can either tolerate the presence of foreign organisms or eliminate them without a big mess being produced.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:22.000
 F.W. Koch was an American biochemist and doctor who showed that organisms can be tolerated at very high levels without producing disease when our immune system is really working.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:33.000
 He gave another perspective on why inflammation is really something separate from the immune system.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 About 20 years ago, people started shifting their thinking and seeing that degenerative diseases are all inflammatory processes.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:08:10.000
 The hardening of the arteries, brain degenerative diseases of all sorts, including Alzheimer's disease, aging in all of its aspects involves inflammation rather than simply cleaning up the mess quietly.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:29.000
 The factors with aging being an exaggeration of the inflammatory process suggest looking at the earliest stages of development,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:42.000
 not just going back to Metchnikoff's evolutionary view of evolution, but looking at our development during gestation.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 When the fetus or embryo is injured, the tissue is simply repaired without producing a scar or inflammation.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:08.000
 So, the prenatal functioning of the immune system is basically what Metchnikoff and Cunliffe were talking about.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 It's keeping the integrity of the organism and not worrying about the process of killing invaders.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:31.000
 What happens after the fetus is fully developed and is born,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:56.000
 then there's no longer the mother's body and the placenta filtering the environment and all mammals have at birth a very low concentration of the so-called essential fatty acids, the polyunsaturated fats.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:04.000
 As these are taken in from the environment without the filtering process of the placenta,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 the action of the immune system starts to produce inflammation and scarring and defective healing of the damaged area,

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:29.000
 where prenatally, without inflammation, everything proceeded smoothly, simply to create a new area,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 substituting for the damaged area, removing damaged material and smoothly reconstructing it.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:50.000
 It's the accumulation progressively of the polyunsaturated fats that starts what we know as inflammation.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 When cells are inflamed, they shift from an oxygen-based metabolism to a simple sugar-consuming metabolism

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.000
 and are in an excited state that promotes cell division.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 In this oxygen-free or oxygen-wasting environment, the cells begin to produce collagen as part of a repair process,

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:34.000
 but the ability to remove the collagen is impaired by the presence of polyunsaturated fats.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 The breakdown of the polyunsaturated fats involves the production of prostaglandins,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 which aren't really part of the essential development of the embryo and fetus,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:57.000
 but they become very important as we begin eating the polyunsaturated fats.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 So, the presence of these excitatory mediators, prostaglandins, and the pre-fatty acids,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:23.000
 blocks the cleanup process and keeps the inflammation going and leads to the production of a scar.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Depending on how unopposed the polyunsaturated fats are, you tend to get a bad healing and a big scar.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:43.000
 That's part of why vitamin E, by opposing those processes, can practically eliminate scarring

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 if you get a very high concentration in the presence of the healing process.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Ray, can I interrupt you real quick? You're talking about the fetus and the placenta working as a filter

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:05.000
 in protecting the immune system against polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 If a mother has a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, would the placenta still act as a filtering agent?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Yes. Normally, even people who have been on a high N-3 and N-6 diet,

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:31.000
 these come out, according to current definitions, as being essential fatty acid deficient.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 That's the argument for putting fish oil in baby formula and such.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 When you look at calves, they're extremely deficient at birth,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 but even the small amount of polyunsaturated fat in milk, maybe 2% of the fat,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.500
 is unsaturated. They will gradually also start to load up as they grow,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.500
 and their fats will become more and more unsaturated.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:19.500
 When people have tried to supplement pregnant women to correct that universal deficiency of the newborn,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.500
 they find that the babies are born smaller, more susceptible to allergies and inflammatory diseases,

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.500
 and the worst part of it is that their brains are smaller, not just their bodies,

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.500
 but the brains are... development is retarded.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:53.500
 People who are trying to show that the brain requires the N-3 fats were feeding these to pregnant women,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:15:00.500
 and they expected to show that the fetus would be able to learn more easily in utero

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:07.500
 with a higher concentration of N-3 fats, but in fact they found that they didn't learn...

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:19.500
 Yeah. And one of the events caused by the excess of N-3 in particular

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:30.500
 is that the metabolism of tryptophan, which should go largely to form niacin and melatonin,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:40.500
 and this type of unsaturated fat in particular, followed by linoleic acid and N-6 fat,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:50.500
 these cause tryptophan to be metabolized in a toxic direction, producing less niacin

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:58.500
 and more of the excitotoxic quinolinic acid and even more of the carcinogenic forms

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.500
 of tryptophan in the old derivatives.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:11.500
 So, you know, you might have...

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.500
 You know, this stuff is just fascinating.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.500
 It definitely takes a little bit for a lot of us to wrap our head around,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.500
 but, you know, what do you think causes inflammation?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.500
 Do you think inflammation starts from polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.500
 you know, from the food that people are eating?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.500
 Or, you know, maybe you can elaborate that a little bit more for the listeners

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.500
 so they understand maybe where is this inflammation coming from?

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.500
 Is it just the food? Is it actually happening in utero?

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.500
 You know, where is it coming from?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.500
 Polyunsaturated is what starts it and instead of being a quick corrective process,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:03.500
 it's the presence of the fatty unsaturated fats that cause, instead of correction,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:11.500
 the inflammation, calcium uptake, accelerated growth and collagen production,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.500
 and eventually calcification of the fibrotic scar material.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:29.500
 The end stage is calcification of fibrous tissue that then tends to lead to atrophy

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:36.500
 and creates the conditions for degeneration into cancer.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.500
 But the challenge, the worst challenge that we're constantly exposed to

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.500
 is the bacterial toxin production in the intestine.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:59.500
 Everyone has it unless they've been specially prepared in a laboratory like germ-free rats,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:06.500
 but everyone develops these, a balance of colonic bacteria

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.000
 and the composition of the bacteria depend on what we eat.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 But there are always some that are producing endotoxins,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 lipopolysaccharide molecule that creates a stress poisoning physical disruption

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 of cells lining the intestine.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:40.000
 And this part of the reaction is to produce serotonin.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 The intestine is where about 95% of our body's serotonin is produced

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 and it has various functions to stimulate peristalsis

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 and activate some defensive processes and so on.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:06.000
 But when there's a slight overbalance of the endotoxins

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 in relation to our ability to adjust the circulation and the phagocytosis and so on

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 to get rid of the problem, then the serotonin starts to be the main problem.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And the serotonin activates other things including the formation of prostaglandins

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:38.000
 from fatty acids and the release of nitric oxide and this cluster of things,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 most of which can have an adaptive protective effect.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 When there's not enough energy supplied to the organism

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 and too much endotoxin from the bacteria,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:58.000
 then the nitric oxide and serotonin create inflammation

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 in the wall of the intestine and blood vessels

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 letting endotoxin get into the bloodstream

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 and the endotoxin causes this effect throughout the body

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 then releasing more nitric oxide than serotonin.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:21.000
 And these things, the serotonin then becomes the main factor

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 with aging and accumulated stress effects.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Can you, you know, that's fascinating, I think people listening are going,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 maybe rewind a little bit, tell us what endotoxin is

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 because I know from reading a lot, I would say from what I've seen,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 you're probably one of the only people that talks about endotoxin.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.000
 There's a lot of people going, well what is endotoxin?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Maybe tell us, like, what is endotoxin and where does it come from

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 and elaborate even more on how it affects us

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 because as far as I know, like I said, you're the only one that really talks about it.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 It's normally just part of the bacterial cell structure,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 the covering of the bacteria contains a starch-like molecule

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 with some fatty acids attached to it

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:18.000
 and it happens that these are not only structurally part of the bacteria

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 but organisms have been dealing with them for so long

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 that they are sort of our basic signal

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 of the need to defend ourselves against the environment.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:45.000
 And so they are very good triggers of such things as the production of serotonin and nitric oxide.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 But all bacteria produce, they sort of leak these little molecules

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 as they're forming new bacteria or being stressed,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 the bacteria will produce more of these chemicals

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.000
 that have a physical irritating effect on the lining of the intestine

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 or through the blood vessels once they get out of the intestine.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 So how do we get exposed to these?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Do we get exposed to these from meat?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Do we get exposed to these from the foods that we eat?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Oh, yeah, they're constantly being produced in the lower small intestine and colon.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:40.000
 And the upper part of the intestine normally is completely free of bacteria.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 But when we eat undigestible food,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 starches and complex fibrous materials, lignans and so on,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 these feed different combinations of bacteria depending on how undigestible they are.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:10.000
 And you can create particular symptoms like when they feed one type of starch

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 that humans can't digest but bacteria do,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 they find that the rats eating these rather than more digestible starches

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 become anxious and aggressive because of disturbance of things like serotonin and nitric oxide.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:39.500
 And so it's the particular amount and type of bacterial toxin

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:50.500
 is determined mostly by the presence of chemicals or things in our foods that we can't digest.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:01.500
 If you think of what happens to vegetables, if you keep them warm,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:09.500
 uncooked vegetables will very quickly start producing bacterial overgrowth

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:15.500
 and foul smelling substances.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:24.500
 When they're eaten, if they aren't reduced to a liquid by chewing or preparation,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.500
 this material passes along into the lower intestine

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:37.500
 and supports the same kind of foul bacterial decomposition products.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:47.500
 And if that material gets mixed with more proteinaceous things,

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:54.500
 undercooked beans for example, then you get a different category of toxins,

00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:03.500
 the indoles, indole amines, things that resemble serotonin and histamine

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.500
 and things that resemble our natural inflammation producing chemicals.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:16.500
 Some of them come directly out of the bacterial interaction with beans and vegetables.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.500
 So just elaborating a little bit more on the endotoxin,

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.500
 because I know you talk about it a lot, because we're talking about inflammation,

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.500
 how does this affect going into perpetuating the cycle of inflammation?

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.500
 How does this affect the liver?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.500
 If the liver is affected, how does it affect other parts of the body

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:40.500
 in regards to the detoxification of estrogen and leading to more cell proliferation and inflammation?

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:51.500
 The liver should absolutely destroy any of these toxins that reach it,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.500
 that get through the intestine.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.500
 But when the intestine is in bad shape,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.500
 if the liver isn't well nourished and well supplied with thyroid hormone

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:10.500
 to give it the energy to produce the antitoxic processes,

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.500
 the poorly nourished liver or the low thyroid liver

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:24.500
 lets basically all of the junk absorbed through the permeable injured intestine,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.500
 lets all of it into the system.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:33.500
 And then you get things like leakiness of blood vessels,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:43.500
 which in the brain can cause symptoms like multiple sclerosis and edema in other organs,

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:50.500
 inflammatory processes involving the leaking movement of big molecules

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.500
 in the liver of blood vessels and other cellular compartments

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:05.500
 where they shouldn't be able to get under good conditions.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.500
 I'm going to take a call, Ray.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.500
 We've had a guy waiting on the line for a while.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.500
 Actually, the show's started, so I want to take the call.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500
 He might have a question for you.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.500
 Let's see what he has to say.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.500
 Caller from the 858.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.500
 Where are you calling from?

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.500
 Hello?

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.500
 I can hardly hear you.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:31.500
 You're going to have to turn up your volume.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.500
 Are you there?

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.500
 Where are you? Where do you live?

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.500
 I don't know. We're going to have to let him go.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.500
 All right.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.500
 We'll move right along.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500
 Taking calls is always a challenging thing,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.500
 I swear to God, since we started it's always really challenging.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.500
 We'll talk more about inflammation.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.500
 He'll probably call back, I guarantee it.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.500
 We're talking about inflammation, where it comes from.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.500
 I'm sure a lot of people are going to have to listen to this over and over to gather it.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.500
 We've talked about endotoxin.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:07.500
 We'll go back to maybe some of the other, I should say,

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.500
 inflammatory facilitators in our food and in our environment that can cause inflammation.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.500
 With chronic inflammation, where does it go from there?

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.500
 What do we see in our society today when it comes to chronic inflammation?

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:32.500
 When the liver gets weakened by the bacterial toxins and lets them into the system,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:42.500
 the liver also begins to fail to regulate the body's own hormones.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.500
 For example, estrogen accumulates when the liver is being stressed by endotoxins.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.500
 Such that, for example, in a fertility clinic,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:05.500
 the doctors tried giving infertile women an antibiotic and they were checking their hormones.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:13.500
 Shortly after they took the antibiotic, the women reported that they didn't have their fatigue

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.500
 and premenstrual type symptoms.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:22.500
 But their blood tests showed that right after taking the antibiotic,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.500
 their estrogen levels went down sharply,

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.500
 their progesterone went up at the same time,

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.500
 and the cortisol and other stress hormones went down.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:44.500
 So that they had created a fertile endocrine pattern just by taking an antibiotic.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.500
 The same thing has been done in rats.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.500
 They take estrogen and cortisol down and progesterone up with an antibiotic.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.500
 I've seen the same thing just with a carrot salad,

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:07.500
 because the carrot is an unusual vegetable in being antifungal, antibacterial,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.500
 and very resistant to production of endotoxins.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.500
 So it works like an antibiotic on the intestine, reducing endotoxins.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.500
 And when the liver is failing because of the endotoxin burden

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.500
 and your cortisol and estrogen are high,

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:36.500
 that goes with a systemic excess of serotonin and deficiency of thyroid hormones.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:44.500
 So serotonin lowers cellular oxidative metabolism and energy production.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:55.500
 One of the biological effects of high serotonin is to allow rodents to hibernate.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.500
 When they're under stress and the serotonin goes up,

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:06.500
 these rodents are able to drop their body temperature enough to go into a torpor

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.500
 and get through the stress of bad food supply.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.500
 And when the days get warmer, for example,

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:25.500
 their system starts destroying the serotonin and bringing their metabolism back up.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.500
 But when people who can't hibernate,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:36.500
 when people are constantly exposed to the endotoxin, serotonin,

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.500
 pre-fatty acid, and estrogen pattern,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.500
 all of these things lower their ability to produce energy

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.500
 and tend to cause the body temperature to fall.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.500
 And as part of the defensive system,

00:31:53.500 --> 00:32:00.500
 serotonin happens to increase the pituitary hormones to compensate,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.500
 for example, by driving the thyroid gland harder.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:10.500
 Serotonin stimulates the TSH, the thyroid stimulating hormone.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:18.000
 But it also stimulates ACTH, prolactin, gonadotropins, growth hormone, everything.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 It's just sort of an emergency turning on the pituitary

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 to try to drive everything up to compensate for the fact that

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 the mitochondrial energy systems are being blocked by these same substances.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:42.000
 So just for everyone listening, he's just basically naming specific hormones

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 and things in our body that will create inflammation,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 poke calcium from the bone, drop body temperature,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 inhibit our immune system, just to kind of clarify all that.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Yeah, and all these pituitary hormones in themselves,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 since they're endogenous, doctors like to see them up in a certain range.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:15.500
 So they don't like to see a very low level of FSH, LH, TSH, and so on.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:21.500
 And they'll tell you that if you take thyroid to suppress your TSH,

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.500
 you're going to cause problems.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:29.500
 But in fact, the TSH itself causes most of the problems

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.500
 that are identified with hypothyroidism.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:41.500
 High serotonin is associated with low thyroid function and high TSH.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:50.500
 But the TSH itself contributes to a great variety of inflammatory processes,

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:58.500
 atherosclerosis, increased blood lipids, increased blood pressure,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.500
 and the whole range of conditions that seem mysterious to the doctors

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:15.500
 that believe you should have your TSH and thyroid hormones in the so-called normal range.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.500
 But this is actually part of the inflammatory range.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:29.500
 Now, is inflammation, I guess, important for the process of healing?

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.500
 Or should we say it's essentially a bad thing that's going to create disease,

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.500
 or is it actually a process?

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:50.500
 Well, it's the healing process of the Metronikoff-Kunliff view of the immune system.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.000
 There's always the opportunity when your pituitary is revving up,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 it does increase the output of your thyroid gland and increase steroid production and such.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 But it happens that the counter effect of the energy-lowering effect with aging tends to win out.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.500
 And even though the pituitary is potentially having a curative effect,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:33.500
 as long as you're continuing to be exposed to endotoxin and unsaturated fats

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.500
 and the toxic prostaglandins,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:43.500
 then your adaptive processes are going to be constantly at every moment

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.500
 thwarted by these inflammatory things rather than the corrective energy-producing reactions

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.500
 that would happen to the fetus.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:00.500
 Thank you. I'm going to take this caller again and see if we can get him back.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.500
 It's the same guy that we had earlier.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:09.500
 It's a caller from the 858. What's your name? What are you calling from?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.500
 Hello? This is the reason why I cannot stand taking callers.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:24.500
 I have to be honest with you. That's why I almost am going to abolish taking calls.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
 That's a good idea.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:37.500
 So we talked about inflammation, where it goes, the hormones, its process.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.500
 You talked about carrots and you do talk about carrots a lot and its effect on endotoxin.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.500
 Can you talk about maybe other foods that are anti-inflammatory

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.500
 and at the same token talk about foods that are inflammatory?

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:01.500
 Well, calcium is sort of a central thing.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:10.500
 It stimulates cell energy production and when the cell has what it needs

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.500
 such as sugar and the vitamins and minerals,

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:19.500
 the calcium will increase the oxidative metabolism

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:25.500
 and cause the cell to unbalance, have higher energy

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:31.500
 and ability to prevent the harmful accumulation of calcium.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:39.000
 A calcium deficiency turns on the inflammation related processes

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 to attempt to correct the calcium deficiency

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 and this leads to eventually the calcification of soft tissues that shouldn't be calcified.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:38:01.000
 So this is the main reason that I recommend using milk rather than meat

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 because of the high calcium content.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Meat has a very high phosphate ratio to calcium

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 and eggs would have the right ratio if people would eat the shell as well as the egg.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:24.000
 So with milk you get a very good ratio of calcium to phosphorus

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 and the parathyroid hormone that is suppressed when we eat enough calcium

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 and get enough vitamin D and vitamin K,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 the parathyroid hormone has some of the inflammation promoting effects.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 So keeping our hormones low is really one of the goals of eating right.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.500
 The pituitary should be as quiet as possible,

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:58.500
 parathyroid hormone should be low, estrogen and cortisol should be low

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:07.500
 and the steroids that are protective, pregnenolone and progesterone primarily

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.500
 and DHEA in itself,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.500
 these are produced by getting enough vitamin A and vitamin E

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:25.500
 and the oil soluble vitamins K and D.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:36.500
 Keeping the polyunsaturated fats down is essential for all of these.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:45.500
 Too much unsaturated fat will turn off the production of pregnenolone and progesterone for example

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:50.500
 and increase the cortisol and estrogen.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.500
 Interesting.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.500
 Yeah, alright guys, Ray, you know if you read his stuff over and over,

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:06.500
 he's a big advocate of dairy and not an advocate of polyunsaturated fatty acids

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.000
 and you can check out our YouTube page and blog and website,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 we've done some stuff on that so you can understand like what foods have polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 He's not a liver oil advocate and he's a huge dairy advocate

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 and kind of a moderate protein advocate in a simplistic sense.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 Alright, I'm going to give this caller one more chance.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 He's back on, he's persistent so it could be a she.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Let's try.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 Caller from 858, what's your name and where are you calling from?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.500
 This is your last chance buddy.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.500
 Yes, no, see you later.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.500
 He can probably hear you, why don't you tell him to email you the questions that might...

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:53.500
 Yeah, if you have a question, feel free to email us at info@eastwesthealing.com

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.500
 and I don't mind asking Ray the questions.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.500
 Sometimes when callers call in personally like this, it just takes away time from the show.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.500
 So Ray, just to kind of get a sense, I mean I know when people think inflammation

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.500
 they relate it to redness and swelling and stiffness and pain and all of those things.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:18.500
 However, you know, there's also that aspect of inflammation that you don't feel.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:25.500
 So how would somebody know aside from, you know, arthritic conditions or diabetic

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.500
 or those types of things, how would you know if you're suffering from some form of inflammation,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.500
 underlying inflammation? I mean, is there any signs?

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:45.500
 The defects in the energy process will show up very early as poor sleep quality,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:42:00.500
 tendency towards insomnia, fatigue or excitability, many nervous problems,

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:06.500
 inability to concentrate or being twitchy and tense.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:18.500
 The energy of the nervous system is probably the most sensitive indicator of a process

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.500
 tending in the direction of too much inflammation.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.500
 So it would be safe to say that most people are suffering from some form of inflammation.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:32.500
 Yeah, by the time you're 8 years old or so it's starting.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.500
 So in saying that, as far as speaking about polyunsaturated fatty acids and whatnot,

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:45.500
 would you say in general eliminating them from the diet as much as possible or in moderation

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:50.500
 if somebody is more on an even keel or more on a health...

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:58.500
 I mean, what's the guideline as far as polyunsaturated fatty acids are concerned?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.500
 I know that's a big question. I mean, people are like completely eliminate them 100%

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.500
 because they're completely toxic or their response in the body is completely toxic

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.500
 to the body and the systems and whatnot. So where is the fine line there?

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:20.500
 Well, it's for example a healthy 8-year-old with a very intense metabolic rate.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:26.500
 Kids have 2 or 3 times the rate of metabolism as adults and that's largely the accumulation

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.500
 of these pro-inflammatory things. But a healthy 8- or 10-year-old person

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:45.500
 can burn a very large amount of polyunsaturated fats so that they accumulate it more slowly.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:52.500
 Once your metabolism has slowed down after puberty, then a very high likelihood

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.500
 of it getting incorporated into your tissues is the rule.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:08.500
 And once your body has incorporated these pro-inflammatory materials,

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:15.500
 every time you're under stress or haven't eaten for a certain length of time,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:30.500
 your body will resort to burning the liberated fats which come partly from your fat tissue,

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:38.500
 the fat-looking material, the stuff that looks and feels like fat,

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:44.500
 but partly from the breakdown of other cells that liberate phospholipids.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:53.500
 And the stress will activate destructive breakdown of protein tissues,

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:58.500
 including your skin and first your thymus gland and muscles.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:08.500
 But the skin is broken down and used for food, both for protein and fat per energy.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:19.500
 So if you can dispose of these toxic stored materials through a healthy liver,

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:25.500
 your liver will sense them when they're released into the bloodstream

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:32.500
 and will treat them just like any toxin and will attach either a sulfate

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:37.500
 or a glucuronic acid to them and excrete them through the kidneys like a toxin.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.500
 And if your liver is losing energy and not able to excrete them as a toxin,

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:52.500
 then your various tissues, including the liver, will have to oxidize them for energy.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:46:02.500
 And that's where they quickly poison the energy-producing apparatus

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.500
 and are turned into inflammatory mediators, increase the serotonin.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:19.500
 So you can limit that breakdown by keeping saturated fats in your diet.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:27.500
 Coconut oil has enough of the short chain, very water-soluble fatty acids

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.500
 that they will be taken up by preference and protect the mitochondria

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:38.500
 from the stress-released polyunsaturated fats.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:43.500
 So you were saying earlier, even with the vitamin E being more of an opposing factor,

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.500
 coconut oil works the same as well.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.500
 Yeah, vitamin E and coconut oil have very similar effects.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.500
 And fruit, besides having the sugar which helps to restrain the breakdown of tissues,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.500
 the minerals, potassium and magnesium and calcium in the fruits,

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:17.500
 help to stop that process too by acting sort of like insulin to inhibit the breakdown of tissue.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.500
 We got another caller. I'm going to try to take this caller.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:27.500
 It's not the 858. I'm sorry. Anyone with 858, I can't take your call right now.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.500
 Call from the 450. What's your name? What are you calling from?

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.500
 Hi, my name is JP. How are you, Dr. Peat?

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.500
 Hi.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.500
 Do you remember me?

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.500
 Yes.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.500
 Yes, he's a good friend of me. Good question, Dr. Peat, for the audience now.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.500
 What is your advice to reduce the cortisol secretion during the workout in the gym?

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:56.500
 Do you have special advice to reduce that during and after the training?

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:04.500
 Several years ago, someone was taking blood samples from people in the morning

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:10.500
 just before they went for a jog and then when they got back,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.500
 they had some people eat breakfast before they went for a jog.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:23.500
 They found that the people who did that amount of moderate exercise without eating breakfast

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.500
 had broken chromosomes in their white blood cells.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:39.500
 It's sort of like radiation injury to exercise on an empty stomach.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.500
 It seems to be mostly the sugars and minerals in eating breakfast.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:50.500
 Probably just a glass of orange juice and milk would be enough

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:55.500
 to prevent that stress-induced chromosome damage.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:49:06.500
 Okay. Do you agree about the bitter chocolate to prevent the cortisol secretion before the workout?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.500
 Yes. Chocolate is probably mostly the leucine content of the chocolate.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:18.500
 It's a very high protein content, but leucine acts like insulin

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.500
 and helps to prevent tissue breakdown.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:29.500
 So, chocolate is an anabolic protein more than many other proteins.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:35.500
 Okay. And is it okay to eat chocolate alone or especially with other food before training?

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.500
 I think it's good to have some sugar with it.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.500
 Okay. Thank you very much, Dr. Peat.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.500
 Thanks, Justin.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.500
 Bye.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:51.500
 I think that was a great question because I know your take on exercise,

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.500
 but a lot of people that tune in listen to exercise, so it's great to get.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:59.500
 I think it's important because everyone out there is so keen on supplements

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.500
 and the reason I like your approach and philosophy is because we use

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.500
 what Mother Nature has provided us with, definitely in a different way than most people,

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:13.500
 but you're just big on the nutritional side of it and I think people need to hear that,

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.500
 especially pre and post-workout.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:20.500
 So, I hope a lot of people are tuning into that in regards to, yeah,

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.500
 he's talking about maybe a supplement here and there,

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.500
 but it's really using nutrition to match the physiology of the body.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.500
 Yeah. There are some supplements that are worse than others.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.500
 Right.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:44.500
 The most dangerous are the carotenes because they act very much like a polyunsaturated fat.

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:52.500
 They are polyunsaturated and the tryptophan and hydroxy tryptophan

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:58.500
 activate the inflammation process very directly.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.500
 And that's part of the biggest thing we get from people is a lot of people don't understand

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.500
 that process and they're pumping tryptophan in the body,

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.500
 pumping melatonin into their body without really knowing

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:15.500
 the negative cascade of effects they're creating.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:19.500
 So, I'm hoping people that are listening are picking up on that.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.500
 We've got another call and we've got about nine minutes left,

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:25.500
 so I'd love to take it. It's a different 858, so let's hope it's someone tuning in.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.500
 Call from the 858. What's your name and where are you calling from?

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.000
 Hello?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Same caller.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 No, it's a different caller.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 So, well, we've got about eight minutes left. No other callers.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 Is there anything else in regards to inflammation that you want to talk about,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 you know, just so people can have a better understanding?

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 Well, another dangerous thing that many people are using now

00:51:55.500 --> 00:52:00.000
 is the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 Those, to the extent that they do raise serotonin,

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 their antidepressive effect is probably because they activate other things in the brain,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 but they are being found responsible for increased osteoporosis

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:32.000
 and breast cancer, and I think they'll probably be found to contribute to obesity.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 Now, what do you say, because a lot of people listen,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 and I know there's a lot of people out there that are taking these things,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 and they say, "Well, what's my choice? My doctor tells me I need them.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 I don't know what to do." What do you recommend?

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:53.000
 Things that promote your real energy production while lowering inflammation.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 The thyroid hormone is, doctors have a very strange idea about it

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 that was produced by the pharmaceutical industry,

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 but thyroid hormone itself is anti-inflammatory,

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 partly by suppressing the pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone,

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.000
 which is inflammatory.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 And so the things that support the thyroid, such as the saturated fats and sugars and salts,

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 all of the minerals that are called electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium,

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:44.000
 all of these help to protect tissues and work with the thyroid

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 to produce the right kind of steroids, pregnenolone and progesterone.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Fascinating stuff, Ray.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 Yeah, I see it as another call to me.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 I love it, and I...

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Sorry.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:09.000
 Yeah, Ray, I mean, it's such a bummer because these shows are 60 minutes

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 and it's just... I wish we could do it much longer.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 I could definitely listen to you all day and learn from you.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 So I know a lot of listeners really appreciate you coming on

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 and kind of sharing your wisdom and experience

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 because what you have to kind of preach is a 180 of what most people preach.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.000
 So what's the word I'm looking for?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 Breath of fresh air.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 And necessary. It's necessary that this information get out there.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 We appreciate you taking the time to join us and be open to sharing this information

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 because when we started looking at it and reading your books and your research and all that,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 it was very hard to take.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 It was very hard to swallow because it was so completely 180 of what we have been told

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:06.000
 and so many people are suffering unnecessarily so because they're so misinformed.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 There's one little anti-inflammatory tidbit that's very easy to do that I haven't mentioned.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 It's connected to the fact that once the inflammation starts to lower your energy,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 it becomes a vicious circle.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 Right.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:32.000
 And cold feet and cold hands creates an inflammatory condition.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 When the blood drops a few degrees to circulate through your cold feet,

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 it releases inflammatory mediators.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 And so just, for example, sleeping with a wool cap and warm socks

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 can help greatly with inflammation as well as insomnia problems.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 Right.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.500
 Because we can guarantee that we'll be at home tonight sleeping with wool caps.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.500
 Yeah, yeah.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:12.500
 I'll be drinking my milk, putting a cap on, and boots and jumping in bed with my birthday shoes.

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.500
 Well, we don't have any of the callers.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.500
 I don't know if we've got a couple more minutes if you want to add something in regards to inflammation

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.500
 or if you want to tell a little bit more people about where they can learn more about you.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.500
 You're totally welcome to, Ray.

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:34.000
 Well, calcification and osteoporosis are two very important aspects of inflammation.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 The inflammatory substances, prostaglandins, serotonin, TSH, the cytokines, interleukins,

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:57.000
 break down the healthy bone structure and at the same time put calcium into your arteries and brain,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 pineal gland, every place that you don't want calcium.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 So just taking aspirin, for example, to lower inflammation will help to prevent

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:25.000
 calcification of your arteries and help to strengthen the bones because inflammation is affected by so many things.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 And something as simple as aspirin helps with osteoporosis.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 Great. It's great stuff.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Guys, I know he's modest. If you want to learn more about him, check out his website,

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:47.000
 Ray, R-A-Y-T-E-A-T dot com. He's got tons of articles.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 We posted a lot of links on our site, eastweshealing.com, bring you to his site.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 His articles are deep, as I mentioned, but just read them and reread them and reread them and reread them.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 I'm going to put up another 10 or 15 articles in a few days.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 Awesome.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 Oh, great.

00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:11.000
 He's also got, you know, I'll add that to my stack of articles to read of yours.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 Because I've printed out every article from Ray's website, guys, and it costs you, about black and white, about $260, but it's worth it.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 He's also got five or six, you have five books, Ray, or six?

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 Five.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:37.000
 Five. He's got five books. They're awesome in regards to PMS and hormones and menopause and nutrition for women.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 So definitely check them out. They're cheap. I think you can get all of them with shipping for maybe $70.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 And they're probably some of the best books I've read. I think I've read, and Jeannie's read them, we've read them numerous times.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 So check those out.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 So we really appreciate it, Ray.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 Another great...

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.500
 Okay, thank you.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:07.500
 So we look forward to having you on again. We just want to say thanks and have a great day.

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.500
 Okay, thank you.

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.500
 Great, thanks, Ray.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.500
 Bye.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.500
 Bye.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:17.500
 All right, guys, thanks for tuning in. We've got 30 more seconds.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:28.500
 I know 60 minutes with Ray is definitely not enough. Personally, it's a lot of information. It's deep, challenging information, but, you know, the goal is to...

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:33.500
 I think at the same time it's enough to allow you to swallow it and get ready for some more.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:40.500
 Yeah, well, the goal is to really listen to the show and re-listen to it and really give you a place to start learning.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:56.500
 Not to really give you an education in 60 minutes on inflammation. It's really kind of an outline so you can start researching estrogen, progesterone, researching serotonin, researching what inflammation is and what polyunsaturated fatty acids are.

00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:04.500
 You know, if I'm pregnant or want to become pregnant, how do I create the body to facilitate life in an embryo versus facilitate inflammation?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:19.500
 We really appreciate everyone tuning in. Tune in, check out our Facebook, Josh Rubin, Jeanne Rubin. We'll be posting tons of articles as well as our next show with Ray in February, which will be on... I'm not sure yet, but it'll be another great topic.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.500
 So, thanks for tuning in. We'll see you in February.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.500
