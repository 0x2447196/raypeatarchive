WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 okay and Mischa because you know how to do this really well this is a zoom

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.360
 recording so you know how all of that works we did it once together when you

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.560
 were showing me things so Dr. Peat I would like to have Mischa just kind of

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.400
 go over a bit what he's been doing and the aspect specific most specifically of

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.280
 how you use how Mischa you use the ketogenic diet as a part of what you do

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.840
 I know it's not the be all and end all by any means it's the breathing piece

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.880
 because Mischa has become a really a warrior in terms of getting people's

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.520
 breathing in good shape partially mentored by Artur Rakhimov another

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.520
 friend and colleague of mine so I wanted to give him credit so Mischa why don't

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.040
 you go ahead and kind of Dr. Peat a little bit the idea and then Dr. Peat

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.640
 after he has if you would sort of maybe you have some questions or some remarks

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.360
 that would be great and I will attempt to keep from sticking my nose in here

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:10.840
 too much okay and then afterwards Dr. Peat I want to get that diet we're

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.200
 talking about Mischa we were talking about how Dr. Peat many many he's a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.120
 becoming an expert on how to have a good nutritional diet based on his research

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.880
 for how much a day back to Dr. Peat would you say well for in Mexico on Blake

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:37.120
 College it was about $15 a day $15 a day I mean a month 15 a month 15 pesos a day

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.320
 yeah and so yeah yeah but that was back before you were born Mischa it would be

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 hard to do it right now to do the same who knows I don't know we'll find out

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.500
 okay so take it away Mischa and kind of go go for it and Dr. Peat whatever

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.920
 questions you have at any time please jump in well it's a very big pleasure to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:18.520
 join in in conversation with you you but and well I I'm very very interested in

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.760
 human physiology and I'm not a doctor I'm not a medical professional and I'm

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:37.500
 not a specialist I see but I am more I try to see at the at the healing as an

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:48.080
 engineer so I try to kind of combine different concepts and what I come to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:57.840
 through my limited experience now is that I see at the I made a kind of a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:07.680
 modal of human healing that I use to my patients to my clients and that is if I

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:17.320
 may explain that is a is a pentagram actually the pentagram which consists of

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:25.600
 the five star the five and start with five ends and there's a two groups of

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.720
 ends the if you if you know the the Vitruvian man you remember what it is it

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.320
 was the Leonardo da Vinci the drawing of the Vitruvian man you remember the

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.160
 circle and the star in it and the man standing in the star it's called the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.080
 Vitruvian man and I'm talking about energy acquisition from the environment

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.840
 to optimize energy acquisition to the body and then to optimize energy

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.680
 distribution in the body and in the in the five-star energy acquisition is the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.440
 two main sources is the energy acquisition from the food

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:23.040
 macronutrients and micronutrients and then acquisition from the from the air

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.600
 that's oxygenation on the cellular level that's energy acquisition and energy

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.920
 distribution that's a model we have acquisition here from the hands and then

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.200
 energy distribution I base it as the triangle and I call it the triangle of

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.880
 resilience and the top of the triangle that's the mental resilience and then

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:55.880
 the in the base here and here that's the physical and immune resilience so my

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.920
 idea is that when we all the five parts they are interconnected and interdependent

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:11.040
 they are the pentagram is actually a mesh so I base my exercise on what I

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.800
 called multi-purpose exercise if I take a physical part then I can connect it to

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:26.120
 all the four others and I I make the exercise for example physical exercise

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.680
 it's always a movement is a structural movement and this structural movement I

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.400
 can connect and explain how it works on immunity on mental side on the on

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.080
 breathing and actually also on nutrition and on digestion and the same with five

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.240
 stars and the digestion has the very central role in it and what I use is the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:05.240
 ketogenic nutrition because I tried myself many different kinds of diets I

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.960
 tried to be vegetarian and I tried to do paleo paleo and I tried just to eat

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:23.940
 everything also a holistic diet and I found out that first on myself that's

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.280
 the because I do a lot of sports I found out the ketogenic I never do bunking I

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:40.960
 never go hypoglycemic never and it was really interesting because I used to

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.440
 always to take on court with me I play tennis every day almost every day now I

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.920
 used to play every day I used to start my day at seven o'clock on tennis court

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:59.280
 to two times a week with the trainer and three times a week for matches playing

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.040
 matches and I always had chocolate I always have a different kind of glucose

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.120
 things and I always been I always I start all used to start morning eating a

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.240
 very big breakfast and then going on court and and stopping after half an

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.760
 hour 14 minutes and get something glucose or something because I was

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:35.440
 really was like bunking because it's yeah I run a lot and it's I will always

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.320
 play singles and in the singles you move a lot and use a lot of energy when you're

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:48.840
 playing on certain level so I found out that in ketogenic I used to have a very

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:56.960
 short nutritional window of like I eat first time at 12 o'clock and last time at

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:04.560
 five o'clock with time it get it gets it got smaller and smaller so now for

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:10.800
 example I eat last time at five o'clock in the in the in the daytime and then I

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:17.280
 play tennis for example next morning at seven o'clock not having eaten anything

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:24.080
 and I have plenty of energy I'm never bunking I eat the first time at 12

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.520
 o'clock when I come home I'm not hungry and that's a very special thing

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:38.680
 actually I like this way of eating a lot and I see on my clients that is working

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:48.640
 perfect and the well my clients they have cancer they have diabetes they have

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.080
 asthma and all the kind of disease that is based with systemic on systemic

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.840
 inflammation could you be a little bit more specific about how you do the

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:06.360
 ketogenic diet the specifics of what you're recommending and using yes sure

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:16.080
 sure what I'm recommending in and using it's the for myself it's not the same

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:23.120
 macro nutrient ratios that are I use for my clients for my clients I use

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:33.840
 something called therapeutic ketosis and therapeutic ketosis is defined as 90

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.840
 eight and half one and half 90 percent of energy coming from fat eight and half

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:48.680
 percent of energy coming from a protein in one and a half coming from carbs

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:56.760
 that's the call the ketogenic and what I use the model called keto I F C R or

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:03.720
 therapeutic ketosis with intermittent fasting and caloric restriction caloric

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:12.520
 restriction is defined as 75% of VMR basal metabolic rate and it can be a

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.640
 little bit different from person to person for example when I work with a

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:24.720
 chronic fatigue syndrome with ME it's the it's the most difficult as I see is

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.600
 the most difficult of all of all illnesses of all as I experience it is

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:44.340
 very very hard it's very hard to to gain energy in this and well intermittent

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:52.480
 fasting means reducing your eating window or nutritional window and the

00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:02.440
 idea behind that is that we try to trigger autophagy and especially this

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.040
 kind of autophagy that is called CMA chaperone mediated autophagy and

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:15.280
 chaperone chaperone mediated autophagy that's a cellular cleaning of half of

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:24.280
 the you know in intracellular fluid of proteins so the the cells are digesting

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:36.960
 themselves the contains of themselves air and that's what plant claims or you

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.960
 call it whatever but it's it's called autophagy and that's very healthy for

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:55.520
 the the human cells and it starts about ten hours after the last the last food

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:05.440
 in the stomach then you food as I understand so in order to to have the

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:12.280
 cells as long time as possible in this autophagy state we reduce nutritional

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:19.340
 window okay misha could you stop right there for a moment Dr. Peat any

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:27.200
 reactions or questions so far what particular kinds of protein and fat

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:45.900
 would you use well I use I use mostly well proteins that's the mostly animal

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:58.980
 animal proteins different kinds of proteins we use meat fat meat I use well

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:11.280
 avocado there's some protein there what else butter and but mostly that's that's

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:19.040
 animal animal protein and the fats it's saturated fats mostly because the most

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:28.560
 stable fats and then we use mono and saturated and try to avoid polyunsaturated

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:41.240
 fat as much as possible what proportion between meat eggs milk cheese seafood

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:50.160
 you see we don't I don't do so much I don't define the proportion so very much

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:56.640
 because I tried to establish this diet very much together with a client in

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:04.440
 order to fit the because we want to establish the process actually the

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:10.440
 hardest thing in all of that is to see from the helicopter view and from the

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.900
 helicopter view in order to establish the change the lifestyle change we need

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:21.680
 to establish very strong process and for me to see if we if I want I normally

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:29.240
 have my clients for a year like half a year to a year we work together until

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:35.280
 they are okay and then they can go in maintenance and maintenance we don't we

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:45.400
 don't work together as you know so constantly like every day like I do from

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:51.120
 the start so to establish the process is very very crucial and I want them to eat

00:14:51.120 --> 00:15:00.800
 the food that they they prefer they like so that it has a very big very big value

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:06.240
 here so some of them prefer more the seafood some of them prefer more you

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.620
 know nice some kind and different kind of vegetable so it's it's a little bit

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:23.960
 different but I try to tell them that seafood has some special specific kind

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.360
 of micronutrients that they need but some of them don't like seafood for

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:37.120
 example some of them don't like a fat meat so it's a it's always it's a

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:47.400
 different from person to person I try to stick mostly to to macro nutrient

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:58.380
 breakdown and go from there and very very slowly introduce new foods so they

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:08.400
 get very kind of very different kind of the foods I really want them to to try

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.240
 different kind of foods and some people that have eating disorders it's a very

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:19.040
 very hard thing to do because they don't want to try new things just don't want

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:27.720
 they refuse and sometimes when they are at my place I I do I love cooking and I

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:33.640
 actually try to to show them very very fast how to do some different things and

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:41.760
 combine just put the color eat eat try this try that sometimes it happens that

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.920
 it works misha would it be useful to show a chart of one of your patients

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:55.160
 would that be possible so Dr. Peat can see you know the kind of extraordinary

00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:02.640
 tracking that you do with people on all levels and maybe speak about that let me

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.360
 start just a second I'll share my screen

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.360
 [no speech detected]

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.360
 Okay.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.360
 Okay.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.360
 Okay.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.360
 Okay.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:43.360
 Thank you.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.360
 Yes, let me see how we share the screen.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360
 Just a second.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.360
 Last time you did it yourself. I didn't do anything. So I'm just.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.360
 I'll try. I'll try here. No, just a second.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:05.360
 You start.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.360
 Should I hit share screen or not?

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:21.360
 Oh, start share here. Yeah. I found it. Okay.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.360
 Can you see.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.360
 Can you see the screen.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360
 Yes.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.360
 Can you see the screen. Okay.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.360
 So you see that's the.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.360
 That's the.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:47.360
 The online file that I have with every each of my clients where we work every, every day.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.360
 And as you see, there's something called journal.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.360
 You see, there's a different.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:19:00.360
 How do you call it in the Excel chart, Excel sheet, the different spreadsheets.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:07.360
 This one is called journal and this journal we, we have all our meetings and I write the program for the next day.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.360
 Or next week.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.360
 What kind of things we are doing.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:23.360
 And so next one is called breathing log and the breathing log.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.360
 I'll show you.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:38.360
 In the breathing log, we have a different kind of training. The red fields, you see the red columns called FR.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:45.360
 This is a fall off training. There's with a breathing breathing retraining with a froloughed device.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:51.360
 That's the device.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.360
 Dr. Peat, did you have you heard about froloughed device, the breathing device?

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:03.360
 Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I said you that I sent you, you know, a summary of that.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.360
 A person that Dr. Peat had worked with who use a froloughed.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:12.360
 Yes, I remember. That's right. And Dr. Peat, I do it myself. I do the device myself.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.360
 I don't use the original froloughed device.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:27.360
 I do the device myself and I will show you how it looks like. Just a second.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.360
 And it's easy to make these, Dr. Peat.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:47.360
 If you want, you can make one yourself and it's actually probably a good thing to use if Catherine wants to use it. I know she was wanting to use the mask.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:21:12.360
 Misha also uses the mask, but he uses it mostly when he's exercising. OK. Now I try to stop sharing just a second.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.360
 The device looks like that.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:24.360
 That's the the flag. God, you're really wow.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:33.360
 The reason I said wow is because when you make it like he's making it, it's a huge amount of CO2. He's almost he's getting somewhere around 2%.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:41.360
 No, no, no, no. This is the smallest one. That's not mine. That's my girlfriend's. I'm a tiger.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.360
 Mine is 2 liters.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.360
 This one is 14.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:59.360
 But what I'm saying, Dr. Peat, is that by using this and breathing this way, he's getting upwards of 2% CO2. He's breathing.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:08.360
 The difference is in the froloughed device, we have only one possibility to adjust and that's the amount of water used.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.360
 We don't have other possibilities. In this device, we have three possibilities.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:19.360
 We have a possibility to change the diameter here.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.360
 The smaller the diameter, the bigger the resistance.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:32.360
 We have the possibility to change the length of the tube.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:43.360
 Sometimes I do the tube with two diameters, so I put a smaller diameter in this one so we can actually do the different resistance.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:23:00.360
 When we take the standard cap, then we can change the different kind of bottles.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.360
 You have to see that that's open at the end. The bottle is open at the end.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.360
 The bottle is open at the end here.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:21.360
 The fourth thing is, if we do the bottle here, not a clean cut, but a cut that is not clean, then we can also adjust the resistance.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:31.360
 Then the container. This container is the big container. The amount of water can be very different.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.360
 The fifth thing is that when we're training, we can close the container.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:44.360
 The amount of the air that it comes and blends with the CO2 in the container gets minimized.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:52.360
 Actually, that's five levels of adjustment.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:24:17.360
 I do the chair. That's the red column called Frohloff.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:32.360
 What it actually says is that I made my tables in the way that you can see the explanations of all the feelings.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.360
 Frohloff, do-it-yourself device exercise.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:47.360
 Frohloff is a respiration cycle ending average inhale to exhale ratio in seconds. A healthy adult should be able to go 20-30 minutes.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.360
 Why is it there, for example?

00:24:50.360 --> 00:25:08.360
 Here, it started with two-eight. It means two seconds, inhale, eight seconds, exhale.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:14.360
 It's only with the nose closed, so you're breathing like that.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:23.360
 For the nose closed, yes, yes, yes. It's much harder with the nose closed because you're really intensifying the CO2 that way.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:32.360
 You see, the average is taking-because this guy has cancer, this guy has chronic lymphatic leukemia.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:46.360
 You see, this column B with purple in purple, the second column, it's showing the average values for the day of exhalation.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:54.360
 Because what we do, we go down to two and two seconds inhalation, it will remain like that for months.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.360
 Inhalation is always at two, and then we just extend exhalation.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:12.360
 You see what happens. We started working in April, and I introduced him to Frohloff's device in June because he started doing other Botteko exercise.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:28.360
 And you see here, in November, his values are 35. So he's doing 235. Okay? Some other values, you see-

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.360
 Excuse me, that means his exhale is 35 seconds long?

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:39.360
 Yes, 35 seconds, yes. And he does the exercise for one and a half hours a day.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.360
 So that means he's breathing- He's breathing three times half an hour.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:51.360
 So he's breathing less than one liter of air per minute.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:27:01.360
 Yes, he's breathing very, very little. You see then, you see all these yellow columns.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.360
 And yellow columns, it's the columns about sleep hacking.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.360
 All of these values, that's about sleep hacking.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:18.360
 We have evening pulse, we have evening control pause, we have the amount of hours of sleep, we have the waking hour.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:24.360
 Then we have morning pulse, we have morning control pause, and we have maximum pause.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:29.360
 All of these things describe the quality of sleep and the improvement of quality of sleep.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.360
 What do you mean by sleep hacking?

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:39.360
 Sleep hacking means that we try to improve the sleep because in the sleep we gain a lot of energy.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:49.360
 And by hacking the sleep, we can change, really we can speed up the process of recovery.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.360
 Okay, let's stop for a minute and see if Dr. Peat has some questions or some comments.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:03.360
 Do you check their temperature occasionally? Body temperature?

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:10.360
 Body temperature, actually not. I knew you would ask this one.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:19.360
 Yes, no. But I will talk about you, about thermogenesis and the thermic equilibrium.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:27.360
 It's very, very interesting. It's one of the things that you are a lot of inspiration.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:34.360
 And I actually work with generating brown fat. But I'll tell you how.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.360
 Yes.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:42.360
 No, not measuring temperature. No. But maybe you should do that.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:51.360
 What about their pulse temperature or pulse rate before and after the breathing sessions?

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.360
 Do you see a change of pulse rate?

00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:03.360
 Yes, yes, yes. There's always a pulse rate, the different pulse falls after breathing exercise.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 But it's very, very different. It depends on kind of exercise.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:15.360
 Because you see, there's a lot of exercise my clients doing of exercise on full exertion,

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:22.360
 with them making diminished breathing when we actually work on what I call progressive active relaxation.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:29.360
 And progressive active relaxation, that's a breathing retraining based on relaxation of diaphragm,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.360
 on progressive relaxation. And active, it means in movement.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:46.360
 And on this exercise, it's very often the pulse is sometimes the same, sometimes the same.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:51.360
 Sometimes it falls, sometimes it gets a little bit higher, but a little bit.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:59.360
 But this is a very, very good exercise. But what I see after this exercise, the control pause skyrockets.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:08.360
 Yes, but the pulse, it's not always reacting as in the breathing exercise while sitting.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.360
 It's a little bit different.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:18.360
 All right. I have a particular interest. I don't want to make this go on too long because I do.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:25.360
 Maybe we can do this again sometime and go pick up from here. I'll send you both a copy of the video.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:35.360
 But I wanted to get back into, for my own particular reason, how you use the ketogenic diet.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:43.360
 Because as Dr. Peat, as you pointed out, there are some possible significant problems with the ketogenic diet.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:54.360
 And maybe you want to mention some of those, Dr. Peat, and then Misha, you could sort of indicate how you either deal with that or whatever.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:01.360
 So, Dr. Peat, do you want to go ahead then and I'll get back to, Misha, get us off that screen and back onto the regular screen.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.360
 Yeah.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:22.360
 I think the problem is when you go into a lower state of oxidation or excess reductive condition, reductive stress,

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:35.360
 alcohol poisoning can do the same thing, but some people on a high-fat diet go in the same direction as if they had used alcohol.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:46.360
 And that means that they're not oxidizing as fast as they should so that everything shifts.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:32:00.360
 The ketones that are being produced, they talk about the ketone ratio, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.360
 But hydroxybutyrate isn't really a ketone.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:17.360
 And so it's the non-ketone which shows a reductive stress state if it's too high.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:38.360
 And so if something is going wrong and you're tending to make lactate out of your proteins, breaking down your proteins too fast instead of living on your pure fat,

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:50.360
 that's where it becomes catabolic to the protein rather than just producing energy from fat.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:58.360
 How would the issues about prolactin, estrogen, and cortisol play in this process?

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:17.360
 I think those are the ones that rise when you're in reductive stress, and it would show up in the blood as a rise in lactate and a decrease in bicarbonate and carbon dioxide,

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:31.360
 as well as a shift from acetoacetate dominance to a relatively high beta-keto butyrate.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.360
 They don't think of hydroxybutyrate, I mean.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:47.360
 Now it seems to me, Misha, just following what Dr. Peat's saying, that the breathing that you're having these people do ends up protecting them enormously and healing.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:34:02.360
 So my concern was that it seems possible, and this is what I was wanting to point towards, it seems possible that the diet, that is the ketogenic diet,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:14.360
 may be assisting in some ways, but I think that the intensity of the breathing, which is way beyond anything that any of our colleagues do.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:25.360
 And maybe Artur does some of it, but you're really, you're the leader in terms of really pushing people that way, which is what Boteko did too, including the cold water dowsing,

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:32.360
 which you talked about, you wanted to talk about a little bit about the thermothermic effect.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:48.360
 But it's the huge shift in maintenance of carbon dioxide. Do you get blood levels from carbon dioxide and carbonic acid?

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.360
 What do you mean?

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.360
 Well, do they get their blood gases done?

00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:05.360
 Yes, yes, sure. That's what I wanted. I wanted to show you all the sheets. That's one of the 10 sheets. That's only one of the 10 sheets. We have these sheets with blood work too.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:13.360
 Yeah, so I'm just saying that my sense is that the big thing that's making all the difference, because Boteko was able to cure cancers.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:22.360
 Sasha Stalmotsky kept telling me that they had done this, they had done that, and I just never had seen it because I never saw anybody do what you're doing.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.360
 But Boteko did. He pushed people to that level.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:46.360
 But you see, the idea is here that what I really want to promote is, I hate the word holistic because it's really used in some UH aspects that I not always like, but it's really holistic.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:52.360
 I want to promote a holistic view that we have to work if we really want to make a change that will last.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:36:04.360
 We have to both work with diet, with approval, which are the main sources of energy, as I see.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:16.360
 And then we have to also work with the distribution, with the optimization of distribution of energy, with the physical movement, structured movement, and with immunity.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:23.360
 And not manual, you know, lymph drain, but actually with lymph drain in movement.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:28.360
 That's what I incorporate in all the movement exercises.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:37.360
 Yes, the consciousness about how lymph works, how and how immunity works.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:47.360
 And we can really create a very, very strong, synergetic effect by combining these works in one multi-purpose exercise.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.360
 That's what I really believe.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:56.360
 And using a process knowledge, how to establish a strong process, I call it a Kaizen.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.360
 It's a Kaizen idea of making a progress with very, very small steps.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.360
 And that makes a very strong lifestyle change.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.360
 Let's go back to you, Dr. Peat.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:22.360
 Most of what Misha is talking about in terms of the exercise, the mental attitude, the rebreathing training, the intensity of it, I'm totally on board with that.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:48.360
 The problem, the place where I have a problem is the notion that the ketogenic diet is really, as you're doing it, is as useful as a better understanding of the kind of thermodynamic focus on functional and process, structural, functional and structural, from the standpoint of Dr. Peat.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:38:06.360
 So maybe Dr. Peat, you could speak to that a little bit in terms of how you use things like orange juice and milk, in particular, and eggs, as a way of the input of energy.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:19.360
 Dr. Peat's written this beautiful piece about Pavlov, and most people don't even know that the Pavlov's exploration of food was a tremendous piece part of his work, which most people don't even really know about.

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.360
 So Dr. Peat, could you speak to that a little bit, please?

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:39.360
 The thing that got me interested in the ketones was reading about the New Guineans who live essentially on potatoes.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:39:03.360
 51 weeks of the year, they live on potatoes, and one week they feast on pork, and their protein balance was measured, and there didn't seem to be enough protein in the potatoes to maintain such good physique.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:32.360
 And they found that their intestine was, the ordinary E. coli in the intestine were nitrogen fixing, and so they were catching nitrogen out of the air, combining it with something in the potatoes to be equivalent to the normal 7-year-old gram

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.360
 requirement for proteins for maintaining good health.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:54.360
 So I wondered for a couple of years what it was in the potatoes that could be protein equivalent, and it turns out that it's the keto acids equivalent to the amino acids.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:05.360
 All you have to do is find ammonia, fixed nitrogen, and add it to the keto acids, and then you get the essential amino acids.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:29.360
 So it happened right around that time. A nature past sister was wasting away. She had gone down from 135 pounds to 65 pounds and looked like a skeleton. Her thighs literally were no bigger around than my wrists.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:49.360
 She was five feet six or seven tall, and she demonstrated eating, and she ate some scrambled eggs, and she tried to eat a high protein diet because of her wasting condition.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:58.360
 Her nature past brother had tried to run a variety of diets, and she kept wasting.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 And right after, as she was just finishing a big plate of, I think it was ham and eggs, she burped, and the room filled with ammonia.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:20.360
 She said that always happens after eating, especially eating protein.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:31.360
 That made me suddenly remember the New Guineans who were nitrogen fixing in their intestines.

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:47.360
 And so I had a fruit juicer. I sliced up some raw potatoes, put them through this centrifugal juicer, and a slimy translucent liquid came out like egg white.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:42:04.360
 And I scrambled that, like scrambled eggs. And so it was somewhat a protein-y mixture, but it had everything the potato contained.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:17.360
 She ate that and didn't burp and seemed comfortable eating it. So we, for a few days, juiced many pounds of potatoes and scrambled them.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:26.360
 And she was eating everything without a problem, and she started gaining weight.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:37.360
 And just as quickly as that, she was recovered. And next time I heard from her, she was at work, weighing her normal 135 pounds.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.360
 But we never figured--

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360
 What was her condition?

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:45.360
 We never found out. She had been to many doctors who couldn't diagnose anything.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:57.360
 She had a strange moving lump that looked like maybe it was her pantry sticking up to the left of her stomach, like there was spasms in her intestine.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:04.360
 But the main thing was that she burped ammonia every time she ate.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:09.360
 And that just stopped immediately on the first potato meal.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.360
 Interesting.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:28.360
 So that got me interested in the keto acids. But then I saw studies on coconut oil, that the more coconut oil they fed the rats, the leaner they were.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:43.360
 So the high-fat, low-fat, and medium-fat diets, if it was average, unsaturated fat, they got fatter in proportion to how much fat they ate.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:52.360
 But still, they were all very fat rats. The ones that ate lots of coconut oil were the leanest rats.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:44:02.360
 So a high-fat diet made them lean and healthy.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:11.360
 I experimented on myself. I found I could lose weight just by adding coconut oil to my regular diet.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.360
 We use a lot of coconut oil with my work. I use a lot of coconut oil, yes.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:24.360
 I do also for cleansing oil pooling, both morning and evening.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:43.360
 It does something to increase the metabolic rate. I think it's diluting the stored poofa, stored and polyunsaturated, which I think act as a break on the metabolism.

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:54.360
 A fat lawyer was in a hurry. He said, "If it'll help me lose weight, I'll drink a cup of it."

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:59.360
 He said he thought he almost caught fire. He was so hot.

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:09.360
 A couple of people had said that when they drank approaching a cup, they felt dangerously overheated.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:17.360
 Sometimes we would make a batch of ice cream consisting of about 40% coconut oil.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:26.360
 We could each eat a cup of fat at a sitting without overheating because we had been doing it gradually.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:48.360
 I think it's a matter of adjusting to a higher metabolic level. Thinking about the difference between the keto acid equivalents of the protein and the fat metabolism,

00:45:48.360 --> 00:46:05.360
 which can produce some ketones, the RL Veach did research back around 1970, '68, '70, '72.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.360
 Excuse me, Dr. Peat. That's RL. What's the last name?

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:24.360
 Veach, V-E-E-C-H. He was feeding ketone supplements, including ketone acids, keto acids, to kidney patients who had no kidney function.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:34.360
 He found they did fine if he adjusted the diet so that they could recycle their protein and phosphate.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:56.360
 The Burr study that was used as an argument that essential fatty acids exist, that linoleic acid is required for making synapses and brains and so on.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:11.360
 A guy that worked in his lab, I think his name was William Redmond Brown, decided to try it on himself to see if he could live without essential fatty acids.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:29.360
 So they put him on an absolutely chemically purified diet, no fat whatsoever, extracted milk as the protein, added sugar as the only calorie,

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:40.360
 and had his only natural food, I think it was a half of an orange per day.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:49.360
 And he wasn't in perfect health when he started, somewhat high blood pressure and migraines and such.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:48:02.360
 And after a couple of months on this sugar and milk protein diet, his migraine headaches went away, never to return.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:18.360
 And he never developed any signs of fat deficiency, so really he was, for six months, he proved that an absolutely fat-free diet was good for the health.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:28.360
 And the interesting thing that he saw was that his phosphate levels stabilized at a lower level.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:50.360
 And in recent years, a protein called Clotho, K-L-O-T-H-O, has been identified as, in a mutant mouse that lacks it, they prematurely age.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:49:02.360
 So this is called the anti-aging Clotho protein, and what it does is regulate phosphate.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:25.360
 And the interesting thing about William Brown's diet was that his phosphate was regulated downward, and that's the effect of the anti-aging protein, Clotho.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:53.360
 So I think there's something about the sugar diet, which sucrose is half of a keto sugar, and the ketone of the fructose seems to have the same effect as the ketone that's produced in either the potato diet,

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:59.360
 the keto acid-rich diet, or the ketogenic diet.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:04.360
 And when you're healthy, the ketones dominate.

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:14.360
 The acetoacetate, where you have the double-bonded oxygen, is higher than the hydroxybutyrate, which is reduced.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:27.360
 And the keto sugar, fructose, lowers the free phosphate and also the ATP of the cell.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:44.360
 The cell is producing energy very fast, but it is keeping the ATP and the phosphate slightly lower than normal, making the cell run faster.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:51:10.360
 Like the brown fat metabolism, dissipating heat is its function, and the ketones, when they're in the oxidized state, I think are keeping every cell, not just your brown fat, but your brain cells and everything, wasting heat, generating heat,

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:19.360
 and preventing obesity and all of the sluggish slowing down symptoms of stress and aging.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:34.360
 So I see keeping the ketone ratio in an oxidized state, keeping the cell in an oxidized state, no matter how you're doing it, I think you end up in the same place.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:41.360
 So breathing a high concentration of carbon dioxide is pushing the cell.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:59.360
 The intrinsic electron affinity of the carbon dioxide, it's an acid in itself, it affects the cell, pushing it towards the oxidized state the same way the ketones do.

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:07.360
 The oxidized ketones are retracting electrons from the cells.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:28.360
 Well, I'd like to stop here, if that's okay, Mischa, I know you have maybe give you a chance to make one more comment or so, and then stop and I'll send you both a copy of this and then we'll see about maybe if it's okay with you, Dr. Peat, to go forward with this a little bit more, would that be all right with you?

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:33.360
 We'll sit another time. Okay, take it away. Go ahead.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:47.360
 Well, it sounds very interesting, Dr. Peat, and it gives a new perspective of what ketosis is and how we can thrive on different kinds of diets.

00:52:47.360 --> 00:53:08.360
 But you see, I'm trying to do something that is easily understandable and is easily kind of doable by persons.

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:27.360
 And I tried also to cooperate with some paleoanthropologists that are working on what kind of defining what kind of diet the primitive people in the time where our DNA was formed, what they were eating, what kind of diet they were eating.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:54.360
 And it looks like it's not, we cannot be for 100% sure, but it looks like still many primitive people in the world, they use diets that are resembling very much ketogenic diet and the thriving of it and on it and don't have cardiovascular disease, no obesity and no diabetes.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:54:15.360
 And that's why I chose the ketogenic diet and I see there's a lot of scientific research right now on it. And I see myself, the results with, I just had a patient, a client with diabetes one, having diabetes one for 40 years, 52 years old doctor.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:38.360
 And after four hours, four months of work with me, he's a A1, he's fallen 2 millimole per liter under the normal rate in four months.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.360
 And the diabetes one.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:55:03.360
 So you see, this is this rocks, really rocks, what I see now, and I'm really, it's so interesting area because you see, there's a lot of applications and people I can see that people really can thrive on it.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:14.360
 And they shed kilos, like very, very fast, the inflammation stops. And I actually also use ketogenic diet on my dog.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:29.360
 And my dog had an inflammation on the here, a bursitis here, a very, very strong bursitis like that. And the doctors say that he has to be operated. I say no, no operation at all.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:39.360
 So I started massaging him. And then I went to the butcher and said, I would like to have some lamb fat. Please give me lots of lamb fat.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:53.360
 So he, after two months of lamb fat, the bursitis, all the inflammation vanished. And he's not humping anymore. No pills, no surgery, nothing.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:56:01.360
 So he eats lamb fat and lamb, you know, the rest, real meat, real meat.

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.360
 And not just muscle meat, you mean organ meats as well.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:18.360
 Organ meats. Yes. Yes. But mostly fat. Yeah. I give him a little bit of apple, too. During the day, I give him some cabbage, actually, because he's a, yeah, he's a Russian.

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:25.360
 So cabbage, it's, you have to have cabbage. Otherwise, we cannot coexist in the same house.

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:33.360
 Well, I want to thank you. Thank you, Dr. Peat so much. This has just been enormously instructive to me.

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:43.360
 I will send both of you a copy of this. And we'll set up a time that works for both of you in the not too distant future to go further with this, if that's okay.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:50.360
 Would be great. But and Dr. Peat, it was so enriching experience. Thank you very, very much.

00:56:50.360 --> 00:57:02.360
 There's a lot of ideas and views on physiology that I never been close to before. It's very, very interesting. Thank you.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:09.360
 Thank you. Okay, thank you all. Have a great day. Bye-bye now. Bye.
