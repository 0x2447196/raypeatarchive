00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 AUQA. We've got Ask Your DERB Doctor coming right up.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 [Music]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 [Music]

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 [Music]

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 [Music]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 [Music]

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Well, thank you once again. Welcome to Ask Your DERB Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m.,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 And we run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herb supplements and nutritional counseling.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your DERB Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's continuing subject of nitric oxide,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 nitrates, nitrites, fluoride, other components that are in the food chain and decreasing fertility.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 So quite a few controversial subjects. And I guess before I get into the topic here with the first kickoff, which is fluoride and what's been revealed about fluoride,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 I'd like to very much welcome Dr. Peat for giving his time so freely to join us on these shows. Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Oh, yes. Hi.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Thanks so much for joining us. I just want to, as always, give you the opportunity to outline your academic and professional backgrounds.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 So for those people who perhaps have never listened to you, when they hear you talk, I think it's unequivocal that you sound very well informed.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 And a population should always be as informed as possible in order to make wise decisions.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 So if you would first just start up by letting people know your academic and professional background, then we'll get into tonight's topic.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 OK. 1968 to 72, I studied biology, physiology and biochemistry, especially at the University of Oregon for a PhD.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Before that, I was in linguistics, literature, painting and such. And since then, I've been writing newsletters and doing consulting.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 OK. Your background, I think, is very much focused on the energetic state of the organism.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 I mean, you know, you refer to humans and us as organisms, which we are just like.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 I'm not saying we're like yeasts and molds and slimes, but we're all living organisms.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 And in terms of the energy production of an organism and its ability to thrive and survive, that's a very important component.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 And I know that your a lot of your research work with hormones related to fertility, not just fertility, but productivity and energy metabolism,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 mitochondrial energy production have been key in understanding the mechanism by which disease happens.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 And you have some very groundbreaking thoughts and those thoughts towards disease processes that most other people haven't really made the link.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So I really appreciate your genuine passion for your subject.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I had been intending to study brain biology when I went to university and the dogmatism in the biology department made me look elsewhere.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And I found that reproductive physiology was an open, more scientific area.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And so after I finished my thesis on the aging of the reproductive system, I went back and applied that information to how the brain works.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And I spent a year or two writing my book, Minds and Tissue.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Okay. Did you find the subject of reproductive physiology as dogmatic as the other branches of science?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 So no, not at all.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 My thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwal, had been one of the pioneers in exploring the effects of vitamin E as a fertility nutrient.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And in the 1940s, 30s and 40s, actually, it was vitamin E was recognized as protection against polyunsaturated fats and against estrogen.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Both of those were things that interfered with oxidative energy production.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And so vitamin E was preserving the ability of tissues to oxidize properly.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And it has come to be known as an antioxidant, but really it should be thought of as a normalizer of good oxidative metabolism.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Well, that brings me to another point.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 In terms of being informed, most people think that when you hear the word estrogen, and I think this includes me up until about eight years ago,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 having been dogmatically brainwashed, if you like, by the industry providing the education in herbal medicine,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 very allied to regular Western medicine in terms of the physiology, the biochemistry, the pathology and the differential diagnosis, etc.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Very science-based, regular mainstream medical education.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 And it wasn't until I'd left maybe 10 years later after having read different reports and looking very alternatively, as is my profession,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 to look at a holistic way of trying to approach disease that I've discovered the lies, basically,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 that were fed through the system from the top down, from the professors to the students.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 And again, I think without exception, wherever there's prestige, there's a big degree of brainwashing,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 going along with the, you know, whether it's the money from industry that's paying off people to keep things quiet

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 or to produce bogus scientific research to support something so potentially dangerous products can make it to the market,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 whether it's paying off the FDA to allow things to be cleared.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 I think all the way through government, wherever there's money, especially big amounts of money,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 there's a huge amount of corruption that can come through it and most people are not immune to it.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 So I wanted to give a couple of statements, a couple of statements that have been mentioned here,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 just to help people understand this part of the show is much more about what we think we know, we really don't know.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And everybody has access to the Internet now, pretty much, probably more so than ever before,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 and cell phones, etc., that are on the Internet make it all possible if you don't have a desktop or a laptop computer even.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 But the Internet is a huge resource for people to stand up and say what it is that you're probably not going to hear on Fox, CNN, you know,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 or regular mainstream media. I think, and it's a good thing, I think regular mainstream media is dying a very, very slow death here.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 And the Internet, whilst you do find a lot of cranky things on the Internet,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 I think there's an amazing platform for people to spread research and truth and for everybody to find it.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 So I think there's always a self-evident truth that most people, when they hear it, it just rings true,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 rather than someone trying to sell you something or just spin an idea for their own gain or their own profit.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 The two quotes then, "A people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives," number one.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 And then Thomas Jefferson's famous quote, "A nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Just to say that we have some very important constitutional rights in this country that were laid down, 1776, everyone's heard about it.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 I was born in Britain, you know, I'm a US citizen now and proud to be in the US and quite happy to be away from England and its tyrannical control.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And this country has a big history of having a lot of freedom, so that's something that we really need to preserve.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 OK, so let's get into the next question of things that we think are good for us that the government, you know,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 our elected officials who should be doing what we tell them to do, not what goes on now.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Things that get passed in government, that get bought out, lobbyists controlling people in the Senate, etc.,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 and allowing industry to do what they do, but the Internet reveals a lot of the truth about what's being done

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 and the science behind the truth, so people that have any education at all, even uneducated people, can see that it's not made up.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And one of those things, I guess the start of it all, I really wanted just to get into fluoride.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 It was not actually the main topic of tonight's discussion with you, Dr. Peat, because I know you have plenty of research that you're doing

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 and a newsletter that you're writing here on nitric oxide, and nitric oxide being one of those things that I think most people just believe is good for you.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 And I picked up on what you said originally about estrogen and doing what you were doing with estrogen, showing how damaging it is.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 And most people, especially women, they just think estrogen is just completely normal and it's something that they have,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 and it's not harmful, it's not inflammatory, it's not carcinogenic.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 And a lot of this comes through the medical education and the doctors and what they'll tell you,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 what they've been told by the people that are doing the bogus science and/or the profiteering, I'd call it, for a big industry.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 So a lot of what we hear, you cannot just believe it.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 And I would encourage anybody and everybody just to research what I'm saying.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 I mean, I might just be telling you a complete lie, but I'm not that you can find this out for yourself.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 So getting on to fluoride then, I just wanted to say that, I have a little paragraph here I just had prepared for the subject,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 just to show you how, gosh, how evil it all is, really, because it's kind of unbelievable.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 I think the biggest deception is the largest lie you can produce is probably the most easy to hide in plain sight,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 because it's just so stupendously unbelievable that most people just don't even see it.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 It's hidden in plain sight.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 So that the fluoride that they put in our drinking water is not even a pharmaceutical additive,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 a pharmaceutical-grade additive.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 That's the first thing that you should know.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 It's an industrial waste by-product.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And making money from waste products, selling them as additives or food, is big business.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And with increasing aluminum production in the beginning of the 20th century,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 it became necessary to find somewhere to put the fluoride, which was a waste by-product of the industry.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 And manufacturers at this point could no longer get away with just dumping it into rivers or landfills,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 because it was poisoning crops and making livestock sick.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Now, Francis Frary, chief scientist for Alcoa, had an idea.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 He commissioned Gerald Cox at the Mellon Institute, have you ever heard of him?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 Well, to conduct research regarding the benefits of adding fluoride to the water supply.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Now, the Mellon Institute was frequently hired by big business to produce research that supported their industries.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 And for several decades, they produced research showing that asbestos was safe and didn't cause cancer.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Another proponent of the safety of fluoride at the time was scientist Harold Hodge,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 who was later exposed as part of the human radiation experiment,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 where test subjects were injected with plutonium and uranium in 1945 through '46.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And this was documented by the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Eileen Wilson in the plutonium files.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 And you can buy this on Amazon, you can watch it on YouTube.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 So, the plutonium files just basically outlines everything that was done in these hideous experiments

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 on the human radiation project, done by, overseen by Harold Hodge.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Now, Hodge was also the chief toxicologist of the Manhattan Project.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And fluoride was a key component in the production of the atom bomb.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And his studies were conducted with a bias toward proving fluoride safe,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 which would protect the government and industry from lawsuits.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Now, the phony research science done to support water fluoridation was underwritten by these massive companies.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 The Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa, the Aluminum Company of Canada,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 the American Petroleum Institute, DuPont, Kaiser Aluminum, Reynolds Steel, U.S. Steel,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 and the National Institute of Dental Research.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Surprise, surprise.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Now, PR master Edwin, sorry, Edward Bernays, also known as the "Father of Spin",

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 created the PR campaign to sell fluoride to the nation as an additive,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 recommended by a doctor and dentist for healthy teeth.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And he was a pioneer of modern propaganda and used the theories of mass psychology and persuasion

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 to suit the needs of corporate and political organizations.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 And the main fluoride chemical added to water today is hydrofluorosilic, uh, fluorosilic acid.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Uh, it's an industrial byproduct from the phosphate fertilizer industry now.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And fluoride given to rats has been proven to cause bone cancer, liver cancer,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 and a host of other physical ailments.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 So, Dr. Peat, I know I hadn't particularly asked you, uh, about fluoride.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 I know we'll talk into some of the other subjects here that, um, I think we are, uh, prepared for.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 But, um, fluoride, what's your take on fluoride?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 I mean, is there any, any logic to anything they're saying about fluoride in teeth?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 Um, I read a few studies in the 1970s in which they had compared villages that had high fluoride

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 or, uh, zero fluoride added to the water and, uh, it happens that the teeth were healthier in the village

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 without the fluoride.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 And some of the early studies were done in Montana towns where the water was naturally mineralized

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 and they were getting trace minerals, uh, natural in the mountain water.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And they didn't, uh, control for that.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 They blamed the fluoride content for the good dental health.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 But it was probably the, uh, magnesium, molybdenum, uh, other trace minerals in the water

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 that helped the teeth mature properly.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 And that, because I was interested, I went to hear John Yamajanas talk.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And he was very impressive.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 He was supposedly debating with a dentist who claimed to be an expert on fluoridation.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 And he finally got the dentist to admit that his preparation consisted of reading a review article.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Yamajanas had worked for the abstracting service, I think it was biological abstracts,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 and was familiar with 15,000 studies on fluoride.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And so he could make any opponent look ridiculous.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 And so they avoided debating him.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 They just said he was a quack and so shouldn't be even given serious hearing.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 And Yamajanas and Dean Burke did a study in Los Angeles

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 and found that fluoridation before and after fluoride was added,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 the cancer incidence increased.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Dean Burke really was one of the best cancer researchers in the world.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 He was a colleague of Otto Warburg.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 So Dean Burke's reputation was damaged by getting involved with fluoride.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Yeah, it's unfortunate in the geopolitical landscape

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 that people that align themselves with the truth are often attacked and discredited

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 and people that have genuine humanitarian ethics when they go into science and research

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 find things that disturb them and quite rightly they want to blow the whistle on it.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And then obviously they suffer the, you know, the tirade of abuse or discrediting that goes on

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 to make them seem like idiots or quacks as you mentioned.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 And like I said, it's so difficult, folks.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Sometimes the truth is in plain sight, but it's the most difficult to see.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 It's like the phrase "can't see the wood for the trees."

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 But anyway, like I said, the Internet is a great resource to find out lots of stuff

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 that you're not going to find on mainstream news.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 And thank goodness mainstream media is slowly dying a death.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you about something that I know you're fairly recently involved with

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 in terms of the--and I'm not just talking about the additives to food, but it is an additive.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And again, I think this is important that people recognize and wake up to what is allowed.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 If we talk about a government that allows certain things, then obviously the corruption issue comes in

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 where the money is a big part of making the decision to allow it

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 and phony science that seems to support its use or its safety being allowed

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 when that actually isn't the truth and there is no real scientific proof that it can stand

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 and actually be a safe product.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Let's just talk about nitrates and nitrites.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Go ahead.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Around 1970, there were studies of the nitrosamines compounds,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 mostly involving proline or other amino acids reacting with nitrates in the stomach.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 And it came out that they were very powerful carcinogens and that they are formed in cigarette smoke.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 They're one of the major carcinogens in cigarette smoke.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 But the farm industry was forcing greater production by using artificial fertilizers, high nitrate fertilizers.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And spinach produced with those fertilizers will grow very, very quickly, produce a lot of mass.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 But forcing it with the high nitrate causes it to contain several times as much nitrate as normal vegetables would.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 And the cooking process alone forms the nitrosamines, so well-cooked spinach.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Even when you're boiling a vegetable in water, rather than the high heat,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 you typically associate nitrosamines with like bacon or...

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Yeah, but even vegetables which have the reputation for being associated with a low cancer incidence

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 because of the many good nutrients they contain.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 It happens if you choose the vegetables that are industrially over-fertilized with nitrate

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 and then cook them thoroughly so that they're digestible,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 you're producing the same sort of carcinogen that tobacco smoke contains.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Now, presumably, I don't mean to butt in here, Dr. Peat, but presumably, nitrate fertilizers, I mean, are they...

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 I wonder if they're allowed organically.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Yeah, they could be chicken manure that... No, no, I don't think nitrate fertilizers are allowed organically.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 But, I mean, maybe the chicken manure... I don't know, Michael looks like he has something to say here.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Maybe they're over-fertilizing even with chicken manure.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 I mean, in organic farming.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Yeah, the nitrogen could be in the form of ammonia.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 That would be the safe way for the plants to get their nitrogen.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 And there wouldn't be any problem then, but the more they're forced with an excess of nitrogen,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 they simply absorb the nitrate or nitrite in a crude chemical form that isn't doing the plant any good.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 But when you eat it, then it circulates in your body and is then exposed to many layers of enzymic and non-enzymic interactions,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 free radicals, as well as reductases will convert nitrate to nitrite, nitrate to nitric oxide.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And those increase according to your level of stress.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 So when you're eating food that either contains it as preservatives, like in processed meats or the industrially produced vegetables,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 you're creating the conditions for a bad reaction to stress.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 And then if you're stressed out when you're eating, then that makes it even worse?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 I would suppose so.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 It makes all digestion worse, right?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 With old age, the conversion of the ordinary protein arginine to nitric oxide is accelerated by the various things that interfere with your cellular oxidation.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 And then if you add environmental nitrates or nitrites to that, you're making your ability to resist stress weaker and weaker because these things accumulate and become a more abundant source of nitric oxide,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 which then feeds back and blocks the ability to use oxygen.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 So what about the naturally derived nitrates from celery?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Probably just as bad.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 I think they're just as bad.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 Yeah, because it's the bottom line, they're still producing nitrates.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 So does the process of aging then can accelerate the process of nitric oxide or nitrate formation in the elderly?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 The argument that the industry is pushing is that brain circulation supposedly goes with intelligence.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 It does in young people.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 And so if you increase the diameter of the blood vessels by increasing your nitric oxide, you're going to reverse the process of brain aging by getting more blood circulating.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 It does help the brain to function to circulate more blood through it.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 But the problem is that nitric oxide at the same time is blocking the ability to use the oxygen.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 So it's imitating a shock state in which the blood or in cirrhosis, for example, you get an exaggerated circulation of blood,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 which isn't being used because things are inhibiting the oxidative enzymes.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 And in the spontaneously age accelerated rats and mice, they're genetic mutants that age at about three or four times the normal rate.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 They're very old when they're six months old.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 These animals happen to produce tremendous amounts of nitric oxide.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 And so the people arguing for the sale of nitric oxide products say, well, that's because they're defective and they need more nitric oxide.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 So they say that the high concentration of nitric oxide in the prematurely senile animals is there protectively.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 But when you intervene, for example, exposing to overdoses of ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 you create changes similar to those of aging, including gene mutations and so on.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And you can extract the liquid from an organism that has been irradiated and that liquid will produce the same deterioration mutations and so on.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 The bystander effect.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Yeah. And the bystander effect is largely the result of overproduction of nitric oxide.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 OK, you're listening to Ask Your ObDoctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 And from now until the end of the show, eight o'clock, callers are either welcomed and or encouraged to call in with any questions related to this month's subject of what the government don't tell us about what they tell us is good and or the wider subject of nitric oxide and some of the some of the chemicals we're talking about, fluoride here, and then nitrates and nitrites, which are common preservatives in meat.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 The number, if you live in the area, is nine to three, three nine one one.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 If you're outside the area, there's an 800 number, which is one eight hundred KMUD Rad.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 That's one eight hundred five six eight three seven two three.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 And we definitely welcome all those people that call from all over the state.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 So I really appreciate this cause.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 I did actually get a just by the by here, Dr. Peat.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 I got an email from a listener in Germany today who actually asked me a question and wanted to know what your opinion on cannabis was.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 So I don't without getting too geopolitical, because I know this is a kind of a seat, a seat of cannabis and its useful alternative disease and cancers and other things.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 But he he was he was saying that he was kind of frightened by the what he did recognize both himself and in the wider perspective of cannabis is negative effects.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 He wanted to know what your your understanding of cannabis was.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 And I know that you'll come from a purely physiological and fact based perspective.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 So what are your views on cannabis?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 When I was 10 years old, a doctor prescribed it for migraines and I took a glass of the tea every day for about a month.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 A big bag full of cannabis leaves.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 And I didn't notice really any effect.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 So I was never impressed by the claims for its great sedative or painkilling effects or whatever.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 But I know it does have those useful sedative effects.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 What do you think of the potential estrogenic effect of it, given that it's in the same family as hops?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Only two members exist in the cannabinoid, cannabis sativa and then humulus lupulus, the hop.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And I know in England and the summertime, when typically the women would be picking the hops in the hop fields for the beer industry,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 most of these women would skip their menstrual cycle because it was such a disruptor of the menstrual cycle because of its estrogenic activity.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 How about that?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 What do you know about that?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 It does have an antitestosterone effect.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 I think the worst effects are when it's smoked because the smoke itself has an estrogen action.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Okay.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Yeah.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 So from that perspective, I mean, I know that you talk a lot about estrogen as being a very negative pro-inflammatory hormone.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 I mean, that's correct enough, isn't it?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Yeah, in general.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 In general.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 It activates the immune system in a short-term antibody-producing way that is in certain situations useful,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 but it's why women have very high incidence of autoimmune disorders because it impairs the energy resources at the same time

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 that it's making these short-term emergency changes in the immune system.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Right.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Okay.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 So let's move on.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Oh, do we have a caller?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 We have a caller.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Let's take the first caller.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Caller, where are you from?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Well, I also, I'm from Midway, and I found a little information I couldn't find.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 I do believe that all the synthetic fertilizers are not organically listed, and I dove through a whole bunch of things,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 and nothing is saying that it is, although I haven't found something that says it isn't.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 And the highest nitrogen content I have found of the things they're advertising in this quick search has been about 12 percent.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Oh, that's pretty high.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 And I believe you can get a little bit higher.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 Yeah.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 That's higher than chicken manure, isn't it?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Yeah, that was a feather meal.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 And I would wonder about human-based or cow-based urines, too.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 I know in Sweden they're collecting urine.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 I think chemically nitrogen is nitrogen.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 If you have too much, it's bad for the soil and bad for everything, no matter where it's from.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 But I'm not the source on that, and we do have a caller.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 Thank you, Michael.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Okay, caller, welcome to the show.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Where are you from?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 This is David from Missouri.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Oh, hey, David.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 How are you all doing?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Doing good.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 What's your question?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 So I'm glad you're talking about the government, and I guess I want to comment on the fact that there always seems to be a lot of confusion out in the world,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 if you've listened to any of the debates about different political systems, you know, like communism, socialism, democracy, or even some of the terms capitalism.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 And it's just amazing that really our government is such a nebulous term.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 We don't even know what our government is.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 It appears that it's like a corporate structure that's being run by corporations.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 It's just being used as a shell to hide under.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 And we're always baffled by the fact that things like fluoride are being put into our water, and it's an industrial waste.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 And they use these different methods to, you know, conceal things they're doing.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 But then at the same time, it appears that there's something a little bit more evil going on at the same time,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 which, of course, once we start going in that direction, then we're conspiracy theorists.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 But just in general, if you look at the government, with everything to do with our food supply, with the military, the banking industry,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 I mean, what they get away with, corporations that is, supposedly, when we have this government to protect us,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 it's obvious that it's all just a big illusion, you know, a scam.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 And, you know, I keep thinking about Dr. Peat really has awakened me to this idea of learned helplessness.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 In a way, that's what the program is all the time, is trying to get as much of the population to learn helplessness.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 If you are aware of all these different things going on, and you talk to, there's so many people that are just so asleep,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 and have no idea these things are going on, and when you talk about them, they think you're crazy.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 So, it's, you know, I'm glad you're talking about it. It seems like there should be a lot more attention devoted to it,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 because all these different things that we're always struggling with, with why this is being done, why is this going on?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Well, it appears to be a part of a larger agenda, that I'm not sure exactly what the end game is there, but it's not good.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 We mentioned eugenics, or, you know, you could get a lot deeper into this whole political conversation.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Yeah, you know, of course, I've heard you say, Andrew, you know, I don't want to get political here,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 and I understand why you don't want to do that, because people condemn you if you start going down these paths.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 But I'm telling you, we need to start going down these paths. People need to start waking up to what's going on.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 It's been going on a long time, but now it seems like it's really accelerated.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Yeah, well, I think the Internet is largely responsible for making this kind of information possible,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 and radio stations like KMUD that are not controlled to a large extent, and free speech is still allowed.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 And that's why we have Dr. Peat on the show, because he's very grounded in science.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 Yeah, I know, and I appreciate this show so much. It's just unbelievable.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 I mean, you know, again, the idea of the corporations and how they have taken everything over and have such incredible power.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 And, you know, if you think about the banking industry, Southeast corporations are just evil.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 I mean, they are so in control, and people have no idea.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 So evil.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Just like corporate media. I mean, it is a brainwashing program, an extreme brainwashing program.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Yeah, and it doesn't want you arguing or fighting back. It wants you just sitting there, taking it, lying down.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 Well, Dr. Peat.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 It wants to have us all just helpless, you know, to realize that we can't do anything.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 And they're doing a good job.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Well, we can do something. That's the whole point.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 I believe it, too.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 We do have constitutional rights here. So folks, exercise your rights or they are going to be lost.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Yeah, and just, you know, I think we all just need to speak up more to people and talk more to people about, you know, check this out.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 You know, this is not true. We need to get to the truth.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Yeah, it's a great nation we live in, folks.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 God bless America. It's an awesome country, and the rest of the world looks to it to lead the way.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 And if we don't wake up here soon, it's not going to be around much longer.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 So anyway, hopefully people listening to this show recognize the truth that's being told, and they can go check it out for themselves.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 I think we've talked about so many subjects that are controversial, and there is science behind it to show that the truth is there.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 So that's pretty much our thrust.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 Let's get into the rest of tonight's show here.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 I did just want to ask Dr. Peate, since you've been around a little bit longer than we have, what do you see?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 Can I ask you for your comments on this state of our country?

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 Oh, well, I talked to old people when I was young to try to find out what it was like 50 years before my time.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 And my impression is really that it has been declining rapidly for about 150 years now.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 And in the 60 years that I've been studying and talking to people about politics and such, the problems that I saw in the late 1940s and '50s,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 I was one of the few people talking about it at that time, but now it is probably there are millions of people using the Internet to see the same drift of events,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 which basically is corporate control and using education and the media to make the people think that things are progressing.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 The story that lifespan has been lengthened, the cancer war is being won.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 They're simply creating fraudulent statistics. The Romans, the adult lifespan in ancient Rome was about the same as 20th century America.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 And we supposedly have all this technology to help us now and the science to do miraculous things, and yet we really haven't advanced much at all.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 The whole war on cancer is a complete joke.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
 Well, thank you for that, Dr. Peate.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 Okay, so I just wanted to open up another subject here of another food, and hopefully people will wake up to the truth about what's going on here.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 An Austrian study finding that eating GE corn may reduce fertility.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 So a study sponsored by the Austrian Ministries for Agriculture and Health found that mice fed genetically engineered corn developed by the Monsanto company produced fewer offspring than those fed conventional corn.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 The study was led by Dr. Jürgen Zentech, professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Vienna.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 For 20 weeks, Dr. Zentech and his team fed mice diets consisting of either 33% genetically engineered corn or 33% of a closely related non-genetically engineered variety.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 The diets were otherwise nutritionally equivalent.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Mice fed the GE corn diet had fewer litters, fewer total offspring, smaller offspring, and more females with no offspring than mice fed the conventional corn.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 The effects were particularly pronounced in the third and fourth litters after the mice had consumed the GE corn for a longer period of time.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 The authors attributed the reduced fertility to the GE corn feed and said it might be related to unintended effects of the genetic modification process.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 "This meticulous study suggests that a popular type of genetically engineered corn may harbor fertility-reducing substances," said Bill Friess, science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety and co-author of a peer-reviewed study on GE crop regulation.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 "It's no surprise to us that U.S. regulators did not catch this.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 None of our regulatory agencies require any long-term animal feeding trials before allowing genetically engineered crops on the market."

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 So folks, this is another example of big agriculture and big corporate interests lobbying the government allowing these kind of things to come to pass when I think the self-evident truth is that that is not right.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 And that there's something potentially very dangerous about this and we need a lot longer to see the effects.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 So if the litters of mice, second, third, and fourth generation showed increasing declining fertility, then just like the obesity epidemic in America in the last 50 years has caught up to 90% of the population,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 the same thing is probably going to happen with GE foods as the offspring multiply the defects from generation to generation.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 Another comment here was that male corn farm workers who regularly work with atrazine are found to have lower sperm counts, another great chemical to treat your GM corn with.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 And this is a product made by Zentech. So atrazine is another broad spectrum herbicide that is used in these corn fields and again been very closely linked to lower sperm counts.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 "And it's estrogenic."

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 And it's estrogenic, there you go. So another reason for estrogen to be taken cautiously.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 "And if your corn is not organic, you can bet it's GMO."

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Okay, so I think just to continue, I'd heard a mention earlier on, let's just let people know again, you'll listen to Ask Europe Doctor on KME.org, 91.1 FM.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 From now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of food and the additives and nitric oxide.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 The number if you live in the area is 923 3911. The area code for this area is 707 923 3911.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Or if you want an 800 number, toll free, that's 1-800-568-3723.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 So Dr. Peat, I know that you talked about potassium nitrate being a, I believe it was another sperm reducer, sperm count reducer.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Yeah, there was an experiment giving it to full grown bulls and then they analyzed their testicles and found that immediately with a moderate dose, their testosterone production went down.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 And then the sperm count went down and it stayed low. The testicles were permanently damaged after they stopped giving them the doses of it.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Do you know if this product in potassium nitrate, do you know if this is directly added to any foods or if this is a...

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Well, nitrate is actually worse, more toxic because it's chemically closer to nitric oxide.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Oh my goodness. And it's all about the generation of nitric oxide from these nitrites, isn't it?

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 The nitrates and nitrites that form the nitrosamines and nitric oxide.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 Yeah.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Yeah.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 When I was a kid...

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 We have a caller, Dr. Peat. Let's take this caller first.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 But save that thought about when you were a kid. I want to hear that.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 You got to remember that. Okay, caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Hi, I'm from Pepperwood.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 Okay. Hi. What's your question?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Well, actually, I really appreciate you guys having Dr. Peat on. I've always wondered, are multiple vitamins good?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 Should we be taking them as we age? And even though we try and eat healthy, and number two, especially for women, are extra sources of calcium, like a calcium supplement?

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Or should we just be eating rich, you know, calcium foods? I'll take my answer off the air. Thank you.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, give us your views on multivitamins and calcium.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 There are situations where the multivitamins could be useful if you're really in a bad situation for getting good food.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 But the trouble is that they aren't generally well formulated, and even the best formulations are made with somewhat contaminated chemicals.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 About 40 years ago, I found that I was having migraine headaches every time I took certain vitamins, especially vitamin B2, ascorbic acid, and root, and were the most intense for me.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 I found that essentially all of the people that I talked to with serious allergy problems were taking vitamin supplements, and that when they stopped the supplements, they recovered from their chronic allergy symptoms.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 So I'm convinced that unless it's a very special situation, it's better to avoid the supplements and to choose foods for their high nutrient content.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 In all reality, do you know what particular vitamins might be more implicated in deficiency than others in terms of what food they might want to gravitate towards to get these or use a supplement?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 I always recommend eggs and liver as the easiest way to get both trace minerals and vitamins.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 You can look at food charts and find things that are not necessarily as good, but you can put together a diet with a high content of certain vitamins.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Vitamin B2 is one that I've seen lots of serious deficiencies.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 People with red nose, rosacea, nosebleeds, some mood problems, poor memory, and such, you can't use oxygen if you're deficient in vitamin B2.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Besides the fact that the synthetics are so allergenic for lots of people, if you take a very large amount, some of the pills have 50 or 100 milligrams in each tablet,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 it can reach the level in your skin and your eyes where it sensitizes you to the sunlight.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 What kind of dosage would you recommend for vitamin B2?

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 5 or 10 milligrams.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 You mentioned calcium. I know you're a big proponent of milk, cheese, dairy, dairy products in general. Any other sources for a good supply of calcium?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 I was wondering about products that specifically say they'll boost nitric oxide, things like Super Beets, for example.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 Super Beets?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 Like red beets?

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 That's a commercial product that claims to have a highly concentrated effect on your nitric oxide based on extracts from beets.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 It's something that you don't want, though, so presumably you think that you need it?

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 No, I don't think. I was kind of wondering, based on what you said, that it seemed like it would be a bad thing directly.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 It seems kind of odd to be proclaiming it so directly, I would think.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 Well, that's the unfortunate part of the information that most people will receive.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 There's a pretty big campaign here to promote nitric oxide as healthy.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 I know the whole Viagra industry, which is pretty much based on nitric oxide as a means to get that vasodilation and engorgement that the pill is so famous for,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 it actually can promote heart attack, cardiovascular accidents...

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 And atrophy of the testicles.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 And atrophy of the testicles, there you go. So that's not what you want, folks.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Nitric oxide and Viagra are actually very bad news.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 The people that produce the compound are not going to tell you that.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 It's just going to feel good and it's going to come with a lot of cost.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Until it doesn't.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 You're welcome.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 Okay, so if any other callers are listening and you'd like to ask questions about this topic or any other topics,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 toll-free number is 1-800-568-3723.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 And we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat, PhD, who's been studying for the last 45, 50 years almost here, and it's his specialty.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 So, Dr. Peat, are beets red, are red beets high in arginine or something?

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 Yeah, I think they are.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 But maybe they're feeding them extra nitrates so they can claim that they're super beets.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
 Okay, there you go.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 Okay, I think we do have another call coming in, but let's just see if this call is going to materialize into a caller

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 or if it's just someone asking a question offline.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 I know the lights are going here, so do we have a caller on the air?

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 Yes, the first caller just wants to say, "Migraines can be taken care of with two hits of hash."

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 And we have another caller in a second.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 Okay.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 Well, that was what Dr. Peat was saying he had been prescribed a bag of cannabis leaves for.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 Which didn't work.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 Well, maybe that's because it wasn't hash.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 Okay, so, caller, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 Edmstone, in Brigham.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 Say that again. I didn't hear that.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 Humboldt.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 Did you say Humboldt?

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 Yes.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Okay, yes. I think you got some feedback perhaps on the line.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 So, I'm ready to ask a question.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 Anyway, I just wanted to know if something is non-GMO project verified,

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 can they still use glyphosate and natrazine and other crap on there?

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 Or is it also kind of similar organic where they can't have additives like that?

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 No, if it's non-GMO, it doesn't mean to say the farmer doesn't use agricultural--

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Chemicals.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 --agrochemicals on it.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 It's just the fact that if it is GE or GMO, you can be sure they're putting agrochemicals on it.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 If it's not organic--

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 Not a guarantee of it being like chemical-free.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 If it's not organic, you can almost surely guarantee that the possibility is high that agrochemicals are being used.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 The only hopefully--

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Well, that's ducks.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 The only hopefully sure way you can be sure is to use a certified organic product,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 buy certified organic vegetables and meat.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 And according to the USDA, you are not allowed to use any of these chemicals

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 that we're talking about on certified organic products.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 I know they're strict with us about what we use and can only use chicken manure,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 but I don't know if that's just our certifying body.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 Maybe other certifying bodies are more lenient.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 No, I think it's USDA.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 It's the United States Department of Agriculture.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 So, yeah, the only way you can be really sure of getting good, safe food at this point in time

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 before it probably falls to some kind of control will be certified organic.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 Okay, so non-GMO project verified is just kind of like a stepping stone on the way to really good food.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 Yeah, it's on the way because it's non-GMO.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 But what you've really got to make sure is that they're not using any agrochemicals on the product to grow it

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 and that they're actually producing a good quality, holistically oriented, you know, food stuff.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 Glyphosate is a little spooky.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 You definitely don't want to be put on glyphosate.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Thanks a lot. I'm glad for that answer. Thank you.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 Yeah, you're welcome.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 All right, well, it's six minutes to eight, so if any callers would still like to call,

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 very welcome, 923-3911 in the area or 800 number, 800-KMUD-RAD, which is 1-800-568-3723.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 So, Dr. Peat, you were going to tell us something about when you were a kid.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 Oh, yeah, there was the veterans believed that they had been fed potassium nitrate in their food.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 And I read old 17th, 18th century things that described it as a treatment for prisoners and soldiers to decrease their libido

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 so that they could attend a war, not be interested in romance.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 And that was for hundreds of years.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 That was a popular concept.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 People seem to recognize that it actually lowered libido and the recent experiments with a bulls and such show that it does stop the production of testosterone.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 But if you look on the Internet, all of the popular medical sites are saying that's a big myth.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 The Army would never think of doing that.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 Prison officials would never think of poisoning their prisoners or soldiers.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 They forget that for hundreds of years, people were recognizing the effect.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 And for it to be such a historically unknown fact that it suppresses libido, it's strange that everyone is so enthusiastic about denying that it has ever happened.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Yeah, sounds a little bit like the Nazi concentration camp experiments that were done, basically using people's human guinea pigs to conduct the research that supposedly has led us to great advancements in science.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 Barbara Seaman, who was a great researcher on estrogen in one of her books, gave the story of the German experiments in the concentration camps using estrogen to control prisoners passive.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 She was comparing the American medical practice of prescribing estrogen to practically all the women in the country.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 Yeah, yeah. Well, it's let me see here. It's almost coming up for two minutes to the top of the hour.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 So let me take this opportunity to thank you so much for giving your time like you do.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 I know you're very busy and very involved with what you do.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 So I appreciate that time.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 I do want to ask you one more question.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 So, Dr. Wheat, potassium nitrate, is that found in specific foods or is it just part of the meat preserving food additive?

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Yeah, it's just for an additive.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 Mainly in meats or is it in other foods?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 Oh, well, the nitrates, I think, are used in some other foods. I think it's mainly for making meat red.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.000
 Okay.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000
 For keeping it red, right.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 It functions as a substitute for oxygen in the hemoglobin.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 Hemoglobin.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 Yeah.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 So, is it making the meat red that's just in the counter, like packaged up? Do they have to list it as a food additive?

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 Yeah. Why does meat look so red on the meat counter in the supermarket?

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 Anyway, I know, listen, it's two minutes to, let's give people the information to get to you that's more important.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Thanks so much for your time.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:06.000

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 I know he gives a lot of his time to a lot of people for nothing and he's very altruistic.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 He produces research because he's passionate about it, folks.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 It's not his business. He's passionate about it.
