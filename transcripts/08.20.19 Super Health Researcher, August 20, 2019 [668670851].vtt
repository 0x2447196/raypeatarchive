00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 "Here it is."

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.400
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is one RadioNetwork.com.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.280
 Well, we're happy to tell you that for the time being, until he doesn't want to do it

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.400
 anymore because he has free will, Dr. Peat says, "Yeah, I can come on once a month."

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 And we're going to do the first or the third Tuesday, and that's today.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 So we're excited about that.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.040
 Dr. Ray Peat, PhD, University of Oregon.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.040
 He's specialization in physiology.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.760
 Started his work with hormones back in 1968.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.120
 Man, that's when I started in radio in the Navy.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.120
 '68.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 I'll be darned.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 He wrote his dissertation in '72, which he outlined his ideas on progesterone.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 Progesterone.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 And the hormones closely related to this.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 Something else clicked.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 I want to make sure you're on.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.360
 You're on, sir?

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 Yes.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
 Hi.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.360
 Hi.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 Good morning.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 Good morning.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 Have we had our coffee today?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 Yep.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.360
 Had two cups already.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 Wow.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 Wow.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360
 What time do you generally get up?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 Oh, generally 8.30.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.360
 And you live on the West Coast, huh?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 Yeah.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 Yeah.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 You lived down in Mexico for a while?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 Years down there.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:31.960
 The first time I went down was 1955 for summer school studying painting.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.960
 Many times since then.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 And had a school down there for a few years, like college.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 Were you taught?

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 Yeah.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 It was an experimental college from 1961 to '65.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.800
 And what kind of things were you teaching down there?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 It was intended to be in sort of open curriculum in which teachers could teach anything they

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.080
 wanted and students could study anything they wanted.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.000
 And the student would propose an idea and try to get teachers interested or the teacher

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.960
 would give a lecture and see what the students thought.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.960
 College level?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960
 University level?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.960
 Yeah.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.960
 Uh-huh.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 What kind of things were the students most interested in?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 What is that, 40 years ago?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 Wow.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 50 years ago.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
 Literature, philosophy, and painting.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 Really?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.600
 It was sort of a matter of who the teachers were, I think.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 Yeah.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.160
 Do you still spend time painting now?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 Almost every day.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 Really?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200
 Yeah.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 What kind of things do you paint?

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.000
 Oh, a few landscapes, lots of faces and figures.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Sort of integrating figures in the landscapes.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Oh.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.840
 That must be a nice meditative thing to do for you.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 It is.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.320
 It constantly gets me out of the words from reading too much.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320
 Yeah.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320
 That'll do it.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.560
 I don't know how your head explodes now.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 Not explodes, but...

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.920
 Talk a little bit about your research now, your ongoing research, finding research that

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.640
 you think is valuable, to even retain that information.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.760
 How do you do that?

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:48.280
 I have a general thought in mind, understanding how everything works.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:59.360
 And things that don't fit the established theories or paradigm just stick with me.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.160
 Some of them, for 50 or 60 or 70 years, have been in the back of my mind.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:15.800
 And that was what finally shifted my main activity from painting and literature to biology,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.360
 was these unanswered questions that no one was working on.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:39.720
 And currently, the idea is around the idea of stress and energy and structural development.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:49.680
 There's a young professor at MIT, Jeremy England, who a few years ago proposed a new way of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.480
 looking at the origin of life, rather than being governed by chance.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.760
 The really kind of silly idea that is behind neo-Darwinism, that everything is random,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.760
 that life developed by chance.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:18.200
 Jeremy England is saying that the flow of energy, very quickly, on a time scale relative

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:27.680
 to the conventional beliefs, very quickly will create order, and that the order will

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.160
 begin self-organizing.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:41.920
 His idea really is just a new mathematical version of the Russian Vernadsky, who started

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:53.200
 that same idea at the end of the 19th century and tried to convince, he applied for research

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.320
 support at two or three American universities, who told him to go away.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:10.560
 But he was integrating the development of soil with the development of organisms in

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.560
 the context of the continuing flow of energy from the sun.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:30.040
 And he showed very clearly why organisms develop big brains, simply responding to the flow

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.200
 of energy from the sun.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.080
 Oh, and that's how the evolutionary, that's how we evolved, is what he argues.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.520
 That's how we as a species...

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:50.280
 Yeah, but my interest is in how it governs development from the ovum up through the adult

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.280
 form.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:07:01.320
 It's really the same sort of principle, that it's the flow of energy ultimately derived

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:12.080
 from the sun in the form of the sugar made by plants, and then the sugar which the mother

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:23.080
 consumes is provided to the fertilized ovum, and in proportion to the oxygen and sugar,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.800
 basically the source of energy and the recipient of the energy on oxygen.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:43.120
 It's that flow from glucose to oxygen that shapes the human organism or any animal organism.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:50.240
 And it follows that same principle that the flow of energy through the system creates

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.960
 order.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:08:03.400
 And those observations that have been sitting around for a hundred years are just now starting

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:11.760
 to show up again in the science culture with people like Jeremy England.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.120
 So would that argue then that the energy, whatever this energy is that drives everything

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.120
 called spirit or whatever, has an order to it?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.360
 It is an orderly energy.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:32.160
 Yeah, and that's what really went wrong with Neo-Darwinism.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:39.320
 They were horrified by the idea of spirit guiding things.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.880
 So they said, "No, it's all blind and random.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.560
 Matter is utterly stupid and mindless."

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:55.760
 And the alternative is that matter isn't alien to spirit.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.960
 That matter isn't alien to spirit.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.880
 So it would pretend then that we can utilize spirit, this energy, to our greater good and

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.240
 to everyone's greater good, becoming more conscious of what he's arguing, right?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.120
 What Mr. England's arguing.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.440
 It implies that there's a basic goodness in existence.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440
 Yes.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440
 I like that.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.440
 It feels right.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:30.840
 I mean, that spirit, we take all the beautiful attributes of goodness and love and abundance

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.840
 and beauty, right?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840
 Balance.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.160
 All those words, it feels like that's what spirit's really made out of, if you had to

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.280
 describe it on a game show or something.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.280
 Yes.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:49.480
 And philosophers, since before Plato's time, have been under that.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.040
 It's fairly continuous through philosophy and all the cultures.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:04.480
 And it's only this fairly recent Neo-Darwinist worldview that has put things off the track.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.360
 So I don't really understand Neo-Darwism.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360
 What is it exactly?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.600
 What are they arguing, the Neo-Darwinists?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.520
 The basic horrible assumption is that the universe is random.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.320
 How random?

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.960
 And that variation happens only by chance.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:35.520
 And so they see evolution as something involving roughly a billion years.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:48.320
 But Sidney Fox, a biologist about 40, 50 years ago, doubted that time scale had any reality.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:11:00.520
 And he put, instead of thinking of random changes in a primordial soup of an ocean,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:09.520
 he said, "What if it was just volcanic energy, like these volcanic vents under the ocean?"

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520
 Yeah, just coming up.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.680
 "What if it was very high temperature?"

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.840
 He took some hot lava and dropped some amino acids on it, and then splashed water on the

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.800
 hot rock and amino acids, and looked under the microscope, and he had what looked like

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:35.280
 bacteria, and in an afternoon he developed a process so that high school students could

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:48.080
 create self-replicating, energy-consuming cell-like structures in an afternoon lab class.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.200
 So basically he demonstrated that chance is not at all involved in making proteins and

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200
 DNA.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:06.400
 He added the bases that are used in making up DNA and RNA, and these protein microspheres,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:18.760
 self-organizing, integrated and made chains, made DNA-like chains out of the base precursors.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:29.720
 So it's sort of a self-guiding, or cosmically guided process rather than random chance over

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720
 time.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.800
 Yeah, somewhat more like maybe free will and God's will, or maybe the same thing in a way.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.040
 Wow, that's pretty cool stuff.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.840
 So on the bacterial level, we always hear about how much bacteria.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.280
 We've been talking a bit about parasites, Dr. Peate, in the last couple of weeks.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.400
 As a biologist, are we just a lot, is there just a lot of bacteria everywhere in our body

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.200
 that our body is really made up of a lot of bacteria?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.800
 How does that work?

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:07.320
 No, but they can coexist with us harmlessly.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:14.080
 One of the people I got interested in in the 1940s, one of these anomalies that has been

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:21.000
 excluded from biology and medicine was Frederick Koch.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:30.320
 He developed a cancer treatment about 1915 to 1920.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:39.880
 He was a professor at the University of Michigan, and the AMA didn't like his attitude.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:50.880
 So after one or two papers were published describing his work treating cancer successfully,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.760
 no one would publish any more of his papers.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:04.240
 He lived decades after that doing his own work, but he was written out of science and

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240
 medicine.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:15.080
 And he showed that the treatment that he used for cancer patients worked for infections,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:25.400
 and it worked simply by activating the oxidative energy system, restoring mitochondrial energy

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:32.520
 production, which activated the immune system and prevented inflammation.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:41.000
 And in the process, it made any bacteria which were present, made them harmless by providing

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.920
 them what they needed, preventing stress to the bacteria at the same time that it prevented

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.080
 stress to the host organism.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:15:03.960
 Some of his followers in Canada tested his materials on cows with infected udders, mastitis,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:13.800
 and showed that they could demonstrate the infecting organisms coming out in the milk.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:23.160
 And when the cow was treated, their oxidative metabolism improved, and the infection disappeared.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:30.720
 Their udder became uninflamed and normal, but the number of bacteria present increased.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.960
 The bacteria had become harmless and thrived without hurting the organism at all.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:46.400
 So what does that mean for us when we think about oxidative stress?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.760
 It's exactly the wrong idea.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:16:03.640
 People in the 1960s had already demonstrated that it was a wrong approach, but for 50 years,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:12.840
 the mainstream has gone crazy on the idea of preventing oxidative stress with antioxidants.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:26.480
 Vitamin C was sort of a cultural icon, the basic antioxidant, but in cells, it is present

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.640
 in an oxidized form.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.720
 I experienced this myself in the 1960s.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:43.880
 I decided to stop eating all vitamin C-rich foods or supplements and analyzed the amount

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.400
 of vitamin C in my urine.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:57.360
 It dropped slightly, but I was still putting out 2,000 milligrams a day in my urine weeks

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:07.360
 after I had stopped eating any, and that got me interested in what's going on energetically

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.920
 and oxidatively with the vitamin C.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.480
 Where was it coming from?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:22.900
 Meat and milk turn out to have a lot of vitamin C in them, but it isn't present in the form

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.920
 that the ordinary tests can detect.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:40.040
 In meat, it's almost all, ten times more vitamin C is present in the form of dehydroascorbate,

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.480
 a fully oxidized form of the molecule rather than ascorbic acid.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:54.440
 So the tests simply are blind to the amount of vitamin C in our diet because they think

00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:02.240
 it should be in the reducing antioxidant form, but it functions in the cell as an oxidant

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:10.700
 protecting against oxidative damage by maintaining normal oxidation, which is the flow of electrons

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.380
 all the way down to oxygen.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:22.100
 As long as the oxygen is sucking up the excess electrons, they won't go wrong and produce

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.100
 damage.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:29.700
 So you want to intensify normal oxidation.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:37.540
 If you cut off the oxygen supply, that's where you get the so-called oxidative damage because

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:47.140
 the reductive pressure, the excess of electrons, shifts senders like ion atoms.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:55.140
 It reduces them, gives them an extra electron, which they will donate to just about anything,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.780
 including water, making the water toxic.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:11.260
 So when you cut off the oxygen as the oxidizing source, then water becomes a random oxidizer

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:17.760
 and you get what they call oxidative damage, but it's really the result of just exactly

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:25.380
 the opposite, too much reduction for our oxidative capacity.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.380
 So what's that sounds, that's pretty geeky.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.220
 I wasn't able to follow all of it.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:35.980
 So what's the takeaway for us, our listeners, and with vitamin C, say, example.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.020
 So you say our body, we're making all that we need?

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.740
 No, but we're getting it from unsuspected sources.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.540
 Unsuspected sources like the meat and milk?

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:52.140
 Yeah, meat and milk and eggs, all the organism is making it themselves and having it right

00:19:52.140 --> 00:20:00.580
 inside their cells, but in an oxidized form, which is stabilizing their oxidative system.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:05.940
 So it's stabilizing their oxidative system and it goes in as an oxidative form.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.140
 So that is no way detrimental to us, right?

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.700
 No, that's the form we use.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.100
 That's the form we use.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.740
 But that's not the form that the scientists say, you got to have so much vitamin C and

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.940
 blah, blah, blah and oranges and whatever.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:28.740
 Yeah, they're saying it acts as an antioxidant, but its real function is as an oxidant.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:36.060
 The system where proteins are put together in the cell, they call it the endoplasmic

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:43.260
 reticulum, but it's just a location or system that forms proteins.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:51.980
 One of vitamin C's main functions is to keep the oxidized state there for folding the proteins

00:20:51.980 --> 00:21:00.980
 properly, keeping the sulfur atoms in the proteins in a ready to be oxidized state to

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.220
 lock the protein into a stable condition.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:12.700
 Without the vitamin C, the protein folding goes wrong and too many electrons, too little

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:21.020
 oxygen will overwhelm that oxidizing function of the vitamin C.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:27.820
 So what happens when folks take ascorbic acid or other forms of vitamin C supplementation?

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.540
 What goes on in the body?

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:38.060
 If it's the right amount in a well-nourished person, it goes into the cell and is used

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:50.740
 as a dehydroascorbate and some of it circulating as the reduced form will protect as an antioxidant.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:58.940
 It will, for example, put mercury into a reduced form which isn't dangerous, but it also can

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:07.420
 put iron and copper into a reduced form which is dangerous in those molecules.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:15.460
 In the Journal of Free Radical Chemistry, I think it was about 20 or 30 years ago, someone

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:24.940
 noticed that there were trace impurities even of iron in commercial pure reagent grade or

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:33.580
 USP grade vitamin C. He put, I think it was a gram of it in a liter of multiply distilled

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:40.860
 very pure water and then put that in a machine that detects free radicals, electron spin

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:52.100
 resonance and showed that if an x-ray machine had been producing that amount of free radicals,

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:57.420
 it would have been enough to kill an organism in a few seconds.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:06.460
 But he said that shows something about our organism that we can eat a gram of vitamin

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:13.980
 C without dying of free radical poisoning as if x-rayed to death.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:23.460
 But it was the trace elements of heavy metals apparently causing the production of free

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:33.260
 radicals with that concentrated vitamin C in the body that's quickly disposed of and

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:41.340
 the vitamin C is eliminated as a reductant and turned into a protective oxidant.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.740
 So the takeaway for you, do you take any extra vitamin C supplementation?

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.380
 No, I stopped in 1967 or '68.

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:57.100
 I used to stop, nothing at all.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:07.900
 And I stopped having a habitual cough right after I stopped taking the vitamin C and so

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:13.940
 after that one I would see someone with a habitually runny nose or cough, I would suggest

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:19.740
 they stop the vitamin C and it generally worked almost always.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.740
 Is that right?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.340
 Man, from the motion picture nothing is as it seems.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.620
 Just curious.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:33.020
 So much talk about different things on the planet these days, isn't there?

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.780
 It's pretty fun.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:40.660
 We've been discussing the vitamin D thing and we talked to Professor Michael Hollick

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.820
 at MIT, he's a pretty cool guy.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.820
 He was on the show and Stephanie Sinef was on and she had an idea.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.100
 You know, Hollick, I think his takeaway thing was you should take about, I don't know,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.380
 what 6 to 10,000 units would be a reasonable thing.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:01.500
 And Dr. Sinef, she was just wondering and she wasn't basing this on any science but

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:09.220
 she was really curious that does the supplemental vitamin D actually do something totally different

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.580
 than what the sun does as far as helping us.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.140
 So I'd like to get your thoughts on vitamin D in general.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.140
 I think she's very wrong and he's very right.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.140
 Oh really?

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.140
 Okay.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:29.260
 He has pretty much turned the culture around on the issue of vitamin D. I think its main

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:39.340
 function, not the calcium bone building function that they talk about, I think its even more

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:51.700
 basic function is that it reduces the parathyroid hormone and the parathyroid hormone is an

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:59.180
 activator of the kidney production of what they call activated vitamin D, 1,25-hydroxy.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.500
 The one they measure, the one they measure on the blood test.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:11.540
 Well sometimes they measure that but the usual one they measure is 25-hydroxy.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:20.940
 And they call the one made in the kidney the activated vitamin D and people who study that

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.460
 go off on a separate line of thinking.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:37.020
 But several years ago a mutant mouse was found that aged very fast in all of the standard

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:43.300
 ways, osteoporosis, dementia, wrinkles, gray hair and so on.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:58.500
 And the mutant gene was called Clotho or Clotho after a Greek goddess or some mythological

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.820
 figure.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:12.380
 And the Clotho gene now is recognized as a regulator of calcium metabolism and it has

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:19.780
 an anti-parathyroid hormone effect in many parts of the system.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:28.500
 And the vitamin D that we take or that we get from the sunlight works to reinforce Clotho,

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:39.660
 the anti-aging gene or protein and at the same time it's lowering the parathyroid hormone.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.380
 And in the process it lowers the so-called active vitamin D.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:55.260
 And I think the failure to look at the relation of the so-called active vitamin D to the circulating

00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:03.740
 25-hydroxy form and see how that compares to all of these indicators of health that

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:10.140
 have been neglected, not just the bones, but the rate of aging.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:20.020
 And that will help people to unravel things and see why the strange range of health issues

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:25.780
 that Holick talks about, how they really fit together.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:36.060
 And it all has to do with this reductive oxidative balance, the flow of energy.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:44.100
 And the parathyroid hormone rises when we're deficient, when our diet is deficient in calcium

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.940
 and magnesium and vitamin D or we aren't getting enough sunlight.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:29:02.740
 And it's part of an emergency system that creates tissue repair and regeneration on

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:12.300
 an emergency scale that diverts energy from the long-range purpose of the organism.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:19.060
 The overriding large purpose is to be conscious.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:24.300
 The emergency purpose is to repair tissue damage.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:32.340
 And these hormones, such as parathyroid hormone, are working on the emergency scale and diverting

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:39.300
 energy from our big biological function, consciousness.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:49.460
 And an example, many people have noticed that after doing surgery, for example, someone

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:57.260
 with a kidney disease, if they remove their parathyroid glands, they will have a remarkable

00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:04.540
 improvement in their health without these supposedly essential glands.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:15.340
 Because on, I think it was mice, maybe rats, anyway, a rodent, about a fourth of the way

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:27.740
 through their pregnancy, about five days pregnant, they removed the mother's parathyroid glands,

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:34.980
 so the baby's developed pretty much in the absence of that hormone.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:43.300
 And then several generations later, as much as eight or ten generations later, these offspring

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:50.620
 of that one exposure to a great deficiency of parathyroid hormone, these animals were

00:30:50.620 --> 00:31:00.220
 fertile in old age, at the age that normal rats have become sterile and ready to die.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:10.980
 The old rats, descendant of the parathyroid deficient mother, were still working and reproducing.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.860
 So what are we learning from this then?

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.300
 Let's break this down a little bit to better understand the vitamin D thing.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.580
 So are you on board then, agreeing with Hollick, where you're saying at the end of the day,

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:28.980
 maybe six to ten thousand vitamin D supplement would be a reasonable thing.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:35.580
 He also said that if you look at the 25-hydroxy on the blood test, that the upper scale would

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.820
 be preferable to him as far as the lower scale.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.420
 I think the range, Dr. Peter, is somewhere between 30 and 100 on the blood test?

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.380
 Yeah, I think the upper end of the scale is right, 80 maybe.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:55.260
 So you kind of go along with him, where you think an 80 thing might be better served for

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.420
 humans to be around in that level.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:05.300
 Yeah, 50 to 80, I think there's pretty consistent evidence that that's good.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.860
 How is it, I wonder, a fellow like me, I get out in the sun every day, every day, every

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.860
 day.

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:10.860
 I just do.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:16.900
 I just love sitting out there, especially midday, with no clothes and stuff.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.180
 My level was like 38 when I took it about a month ago, which is kind of on the lower

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.180
 end.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.340
 How can I explain that to myself?

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.140
 The older you get, the less cholesterol there is in your skin.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.940
 Oh, your cholesterol.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:37.700
 Yeah, basically a cholesterol deficiency in the skin that makes older people need much,

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.260
 much more sunlight.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.140
 Oh, so you can take more and you're not absorbing as much.

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:49.900
 Yeah, there just isn't as much cholesterol in the skin to be turned into vitamin D.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.340
 Right, okay.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.180
 So that's the whole mechanism of the cholesterol.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.580
 But my cholesterol level is way up high in good ones, but it's just maybe has left my

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.580
 skin a little bit.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.660
 Yeah, the skin aging.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:08.900
 So I wonder then if I would take supplemental D, would that number go up and would that

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:14.700
 be a good thing for someone like me and other people?

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:20.500
 Cholesterol can be rubbed into the skin and helps restore the youthful function.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.940
 Oh, you mean to do it more normally than taking the supplements?

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:35.380
 I don't know of any good sources of pure cholesterol, but rubbing it into the skin, slight impurities

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:39.380
 aren't likely to be as much risk as taking it orally.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.060
 Oh, I wonder what you would use pure cholesterol, I don't even know if it's possible.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.060
 Just eat meat and eggs, right?

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.580
 Yeah, eggs are a very good source of cholesterol.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:34:02.580
 So what is it doing when the levels are good on the 25-hydroxy test at the levels 50 to

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:07.660
 60, like you and Alejandro are proponents of, what's that doing for the bodies of the

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.100
 people that have those levels?

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:20.740
 It's on one side of the research, it's helping the clotho protein to work, but the side that

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:27.020
 I've been paying more attention to is lowering the parathyroid hormone, which is the other

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:33.060
 side of the rising function of the clotho.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:40.980
 All kinds of stress increase to a toxic effect the parathyroid hormone.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:52.220
 A deficiency of salt or sodium in your diet or the inability to retain sodium properly

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:58.220
 causes the parathyroid hormone to rise the same way a calcium deficiency does.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:06.460
 And so the adrenals under stress or especially in a sodium salt deficiency, the adrenals

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:16.120
 produce aldosterone at a higher level and aldosterone directly blocks your mitochondrial

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:24.860
 energy production and increases the parathyroid hormone activity, which itself functions by

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:36.220
 blocking your mitochondrial oxidation and making up for it with glycolytic energy production,

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:43.940
 which shifts you over into the reductive stress, the failure of oxidation.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:51.300
 How does the parathyroid hormone lowering and raising tied in with the TSH levels that

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.500
 people get on the thyroid test?

00:35:54.500 --> 00:36:03.740
 TSH is increased by stress hormones.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:12.360
 So a person with low thyroid doesn't make their oxygen turn into carbon dioxide.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:19.680
 They don't have the carbon dioxide needed to retain sodium, and so they lose sodium.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:30.380
 That activates the adrenals to produce aldosterone, and the aldosterone interferes with the mitochondria

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.860
 and increases parathyroid hormone.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:50.300
 The TSH being activated by stress is a signal of stress as well as being a product of stress.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:59.340
 The TSH goes around irritating or creating inflammation, for example, in the blood vessels,

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:05.020
 tending to work with parathyroid hormone.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:12.580
 Parathyroid hormone shifts calcium out of the bones into the blood vessels, and TSH

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:19.100
 in excess works in that same direction, calcifying the blood vessels, increasing blood pressure.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:31.500
 So the traditional recognition that hypothyroid people with the diagnostic high TSH, hypothyroidism

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:39.140
 goes with a great risk of hypertension and related diseases, but it turns out that it's

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:48.760
 the TSH directly creating much of that damage to the circulatory system, and it has inflammation

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.540
 promoting effects in the bone marrow.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.980
 Everywhere it has been studied, it has a tissue irritating effect.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:10.740
 So the stress condition creating more adrenaline and cortisol, for example, these can compensate.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:21.180
 The hormones will suppress the TSH and reduce inflammation, so that the stress which is

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:30.920
 creating the hypothyroid need for more thyroid production, tending to increase TSH, it will

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:38.600
 also produce more cortisol and adrenaline to lower the TSH defensively.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:45.160
 So in the defensive condition, you will look like your thyroid is normal because the cortisol

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:54.760
 is holding the TSH down, protecting against inflammation, but it makes TSH useless as

00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:01.240
 an indicator of your thyroid status because it's just as much an indicator of your stress

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.240
 status.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.400
 Wow, boy, really tricky business.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.520
 So when folks are taking, say, a little bit of Nathriathroid or one of those guys, and

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.840
 they're getting their TSH level to lower, they're on the right path, they're doing good

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.840
 things, right?

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:23.200
 Yeah, I think it's good to have close to zero on TSH as long as everything else is going

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.360
 smoothly.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.880
 And how do you know if everything else is going smoothly?

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:37.920
 Stable blood sugar, feeling good, all the good functions, good sound sleep, for example,

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.840
 takes energy to the brain to make the brain relax and go to sleep.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:53.920
 The traditional diets used to contain the equivalent of these natural desiccated thyroids,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:01.680
 maybe something like an average of half a grain in the daily food.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:10.080
 The Europeans used to make sausages, for example, out of all of the glands of an animal.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:19.520
 They would make stew or something out of muscle meats, but for the flavor, they would put

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:29.920
 liver and thyroid glands and other tissues in some type of sausage, usually.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:35.520
 Sometimes the whole thing would just go in a big stew pot, and so they would get muscle

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.280
 and bone and skin and thyroid gland.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:45.440
 And if you eat the whole animal that way, you're getting your little daily dose of desiccated

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.440
 thyroid equivalent.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:51.320
 Yeah, and you had said, and I wanted to kind of retrace before we do a little break here,

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:56.480
 is that when folks start off, you thought if they were doing it themselves, and you

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:01.400
 can get these thyroid things now overseas, the clean stuff, to do a little bit at a time,

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:06.800
 maybe do what, a fourth of a 60 tab or a grain or like 20, let's see, what did you say, like

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:13.280
 15, would it be 15 milligrams or so, and start slow and kind of teach the thyroid to be happy

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.480
 with that and work your way up?

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:22.600
 Yeah, traditional thyroid doctors like Breda Barnes usually started with 30 milligrams

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:28.720
 of a well-standardized product, like at that time it was Armour thyroid.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:42.320
 But I have seen two people who reacted very surprisingly to 15 milligrams, a fourth of

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:52.280
 a grain, with heart pain, and I realized what's happening is that your cells, especially your

00:41:52.280 --> 00:42:02.360
 big muscle cells, retain magnesium and calcium in a balance.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:12.720
 Calcium is a relaxant, and thyroid is needed for the muscles to retain the proper amount

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:20.840
 of magnesium, and your heart has that same magnesium-retaining, stabilizing effect when

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.920
 your thyroid is good.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:31.520
 But if you're suddenly increasing the thyroid when you've been deficient, your muscles,

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.440
 your leg muscles will compete with your heart muscles for that trace of magnesium in your

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:43.000
 diet, and your heart arteries will constrict and you'll get a heart pain.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:51.600
 So it's very important to make sure that your diet includes plenty of magnesium when you're

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.120
 starting to use thyroid.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.560
 Just magnesium-rich foods?

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:04.440
 Yeah, for example, milk has a good amount of magnesium, and milk and meat will provide

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:12.320
 the magnesium, but many people have a low intake of those.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:18.480
 It's only two people that I've seen out of about 1,000 who had that reaction, but it's

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.560
 something to keep in mind.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:27.600
 So have you seen people that actually have felt better and then thus lowered their TSH

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:35.920
 number down closer to zero just on 15 or even 30 milligrams of the thyroid meds, the natural

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.920
 stuff?

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.400
 The ones that said T3 and the T4, I guess, is the one we're talking about, right?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:53.640
 Yes, 30 milligrams will do it, but historically, it usually is around 100 milligrams or 120

00:43:53.640 --> 00:44:00.240
 of the desiccated stuff to reach a stable anti-inflammatory level.

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:04.240
 But you still like working your way up there?

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240
 Yeah.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:10.720
 Traditionally, they would take five or six months of increasing it 30 milligrams at a

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.520
 time before they would be...

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:18.480
 Oh, so over a long period, just a little bit, 15, 15, yeah, and just slowly.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.760
 That makes a lot of sense to help the body to figure out what's going on.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.760
 Stay right there, Dr. Peat.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.160
 Boy, we have lots of emails.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.840
 Holy cow.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.600
 So we're going to get to them all.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.200
 And Dr. Ray Peat is with us, and he said, "Yeah, for the time being, as long as the

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:40.520
 creaks don't rise, I can come on once a month, and that would be the third Tuesday of the

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:41.520
 month, and that's today."

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.800
 So we appreciate him doing that.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:48.080
 And we're going to get your emails, all of them, and we're going to do it.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.080
 Hold on.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:55.000
 Daniel Vitalis talks about his two premier medicinal mushroom products, Chaga and Reishi.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.600
 Because Reishi and Chaga are considered not just adaptogens, but they're also considered

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.040
 immunomodulators, they're safe for daily consumption for a lifetime.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.360
 There's a lot of herbs, as you know, Patrick, a lot of herbs are not that way.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:11.320
 So many medicinal herbs are meant to be used for short periods of time, but there are those

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.440
 few that can be used daily forever, and medicinal mushrooms are that way.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.240
 So these would be called the tonic herbs?

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.280
 Yep, they're essentially tonic, but if we wanted to get even more specific, they're

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.280
 adaptogenic.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.140
 I feel like we've set a new standard, and it's going to...

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.960
 We raised the bar, but check it out, see where the bar's been risen to.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:34.040
 You can learn more about these great medicinal mushroom products on Daniel's site.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.800
 Tonic herbs, adaptogens, dual extraction, fruit bodies, and they're tonics and can be

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.480
 used every day.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.720
 Modulates the immune system.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:49.880
 Chaga and Reishi, special Myron Glass, from Sir Thrivill on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:55.180
 These are very nice, and a lot more, you know, more and more people are kind of jumping in

00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:01.160
 on the medicinal mushroom idea that's been used for a long time in Chinese, or you've

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:06.120
 had a medicine, and it might be something you want to pick up on and play around with,

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.200
 and Daniel Vitalis has got a good one.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:16.480
 The Flora PM, all the different probiotics from Living Streams, these are really powerful.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.680
 I've never experienced probiotics like this ever, and I've messed around with a lot of

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.720
 them, as you can imagine.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.160
 Even the fancy expensive ones in a refrigeration case and all that, and these don't require

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.160
 refrigeration.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.680
 You don't want to let them get real, real hot if you don't have air conditioning in the

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.680
 summer.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:38.840
 I put mine in the fridge because I don't do AC here, but you can play around with them

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:46.920
 and put some in your ears and put some in your eyes, the Bifido II in your eyes, a few

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.880
 drops and also the Flora PM in your eyes, and you'll see little gunky stuff in your

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.960
 eyes kind of brighten up and clear up.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.760
 I don't know what's in there, what's coming out of there, but you can then do the Bifido

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:01.080
 II in your ears, and it'll go all the way down to the small intestine through the lymph

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.080
 system.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:04.920
 You can put them in your belly button.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:12.000
 We like to use the Multi-Blend in our water after we've put some hydrogen in there and

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.440
 structured it up in the Multi-Blend and the minerals.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.200
 It's a wonderful way to get minerals.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:22.120
 I think Brian Wayne says there's about 87 minerals or so that showed up.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:27.600
 When they have these guys tested, it's a nice way, probiotics, to help to absorb the minerals.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.200
 We think you're going to like this product.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:35.120
 If you don't think they'll work, just take a little bit more.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.200
 Take a little bit more than what they recommend, and you'll see the difference.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.740
 Things kind of move in your body like, "Whoa, what's going on here?"

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:43.740
 They're powerful.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.760
 You start small, but then you can take more and more and really build up some good things

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:50.320
 going on in your stomach.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.320
 I'm really enjoying taking them.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.080
 These work like probiotics are really supposed to work.

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:58.920
 They just work like probiotics are supposed to work.

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:03.560
 Living Streams probiotics in our store at OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.560
 Lots to choose from.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:09.280
 Previously with Mr. Oxygen, Ed McCabe, we asked him this.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.160
 Does sulfur, does it bring oxygen to the cells as well?

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.280
 Yes, that's what oxygen, sulfur, are just kissing cousins.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.640
 They love each other.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.000
 The sulfur takes the oxygen.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.120
 Now, in the beginning, we would have people stuff themselves with oxygen, either ozone

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.600
 or transport for oxygen in the air.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:37.000
 Not the burnt out, dead MSM that sells millions and billions of dollars worth at the health

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.760
 food stores and other places all over the world.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.760
 It's worthless.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:46.160
 You have to get the real organic, so don't ever shop price at MSM because you're just

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.440
 going to get garbage.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.640
 You need the organic super sulfur.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.040
 Real pure living sulfur, organic sulfur.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.720
 That's what we sell right here.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.360
 Three prices depending on where you live.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.960
 If you'd like more than four pounds, email me, Patrick, at OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.960
 We'll give you a discount.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.320

 Patrick, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:15.440
 One of the ways you can really tell is you leave some of the bottom of the glass, just

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:20.400
 a little fine film of water and sulfur, and you'll see they'll grow crystals in the next

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.400
 day or two.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.400
 Pretty trippy.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.120
 It's alive in there doing something.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.120
 We really like it.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.240
 We've been working with this product for, gosh, a long time.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.840
 It's on our store and on the front page, too.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.840
 Check it out.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:38.320
 We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.120
 We're talking to Dr. Ray Peat, a nutritional counselor.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:48.800
 Been around for a long time working with this back in the '60s.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.800
 Pleasure to have him here.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.520
 From now, we're going to get him on once a month, so that's cool.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.600
 Dr. Peat, you want to take some emails here?

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.600
 Sure.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.600
 Sure.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.600
 Why not?

00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.600
 Let's have some fun.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600
 This is from Masha.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:08.800
 What is the purpose of the endogenous unsaturated fats, and why are they, like meat acid, not

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:17.120
 harmful contrary to ingested proofers such as omega-3s or omega-6s?

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:31.720
 The omega-9 series that we manufacture out of saturated fat or sugar or starch, the omega-9

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:42.120
 means that there are nine saturated carbons lacking double bonds at the tail end of the

00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.640
 molecule.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:57.440
 The acid end is the chemically manipulable end that the body handles with enzymes and

00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:03.400
 adds to the length of the chain at that end.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:16.680
 The omega-9 series, the unstable, relatively water-loving unsaturated carbon bonds are

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:30.080
 closer to the active end of the molecule where the acid end is creating a slight shift away

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:36.760
 from electron activity.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:47.420
 The oxygen groups cause a retraction of electrons wherever this acid touches.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:57.040
 Carbon dioxide is the basic acidic group that stabilizes the electronic system of proteins

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:05.920
 and other molecules, and the acidic end of the fat molecule is like a carbon dioxide

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:14.240
 group which is protecting against free toxic electrons.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:22.080
 These unstable double bonds are close to the protective acidic end of the fat molecule,

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:39.640
 giving the stable oily, oil-loving part of the molecule to have a surface-creating effect

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:45.560
 on the water that is exposed to it.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:55.280
 When water is at a surface, whether it's air or oil, the film that you see on a cup

00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:06.120
 of water that you can balance a float pin on is so tough that it can support a considerable

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.280
 object like a water skater bug.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:19.000
 The oily end of the molecule puts water into that tough, stable condition, and the acidic

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:31.160
 end protects the water, relatively hydrophilic unsaturated ends.

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:45.560
 So the overall picture is that the unsaturated fats that we make have some affinity for water,

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:55.440
 but it's held under control and protected against oxidation by the carbon dioxide integrated

00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:05.360
 close to that unsaturated part of the molecule, allowing a nine-carbon tail to have a strong

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:12.920
 influence in toughening up the water surrounding this protein-fat system.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:29.520
 The omega-3 system is the least stable because it has only a short three-carbon hydrophobic

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:37.400
 tail, so it has less contribution to the film property of water.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:48.560
 The water is less tough and protected when you have these fats, and at the same time,

00:54:48.560 --> 00:55:02.360
 the risky, easily oxidized double bonds are farther away from the protective acid group

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:09.160
 at the other end of the fat.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:17.040
 We humans, then, I guess olive oil is one of the safest oils?

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:29.760
 Yeah, because it has only 8 or 10 or 12 percent of the omega-6, which they are more stable

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:36.680
 than the fish oils, but not as stable as the ones we make.

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:55.280
 We can turn the bulk oil is an omega-9 monounsaturated fat, and so olive oil is providing pretty

00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:01.840
 much the same fat composition that sugar would provide.

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:09.480
 Sugar would be turned, any fat we make from sugar is all omega-9.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:18.960
 Olive oil, something like 60 to 80 percent is this safe monounsaturated.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:24.880
 And that's the one that theoretically raises the HDL levels, which we like, is that correct?

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.680
 No, not necessarily.

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:29.680
 Stress raises HDL.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:35.280
 I thought HDL was good to have that number high.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.480
 It often turns out that way, but there are many situations in which it's a precursor

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.480
 to cancer.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.480
 Oh, I see.

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.480
 So it's not that simple.

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:47.720
 I guess we went through a lot of years saying, "Take olive oil because it raises your HDL,

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.280
 and the higher your HDL, the healthier you are."

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.000
 Remember, we went through that phase.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:04.440
 The HDL is a protective reaction to stress, but if it's too high for too long, that is

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:07.560
 associated with some degenerative problem.

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:12.480
 Do you think we're ever going to know, I mean, in our lifetimes, the really nitty-gritty,

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:20.640
 Dr. Peat, of what goes on when we react to a stressful situation on planet Earth?

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:27.200
 It's probably pretty difficult to tell exactly all the negative things that go on.

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:37.160
 Well, I think that's the thing that Jeremy England and others working in the tradition

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.000
 started by Vernadsky.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.440
 I think that's basically what they're working on.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:51.560
 Linda writes in, "Babies are generally given vitamin K, a synthetic form right after birth.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:56.560
 Newborns are generally deficient in K. Is there an oral form that can be administered

00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:00.720
 instead of the injection, which is aluminum in it, among the other things?"

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:05.760
 I didn't know they did that to babies.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:14.640
 For a long time, they were using the very toxic, I think it's K3 synthetic vitamin K,

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:22.880
 but at least now they're using a non-toxic form, adding toxins to it.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.880
 It works.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:31.920
 Even transdermally, you need a bigger dose, but it is absorbed through the skin.

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:40.240
 If a mother was eating vitamin K while she was pregnant, the baby wouldn't need the supplement,

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:46.920
 but it can be supplemented on the lips orally or on the skin.

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.920
 What about K2?

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.920
 Do we need K2?

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.600
 Is it good to have that with the vitamin D?

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.040
 Yeah.

00:58:55.040 --> 00:59:00.720
 It's involved in energy production, not just clotting.

00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:08.720
 In the clotting system, it's actually needed to make anti-clotting proteins, protein C

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:16.200
 and protein S are intrinsic protection against abnormal clotting.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:26.120
 So a vitamin K deficiency can cause excess bleeding, but also leads to abnormal clotting

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.920
 and strokes.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:38.520
 It's involved in calcium metabolism, protecting the blood vessels against calcification, the

00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:44.520
 same way that vitamin D and calcium in the diet do.

00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:51.440
 And it's involved in synthesizing brain chemicals, but actually in the mitochondrion, it's working

00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:57.760
 with coenzyme Q10 to produce energy, stabilizing that system.

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:03.880
 When we use the term strokes in our culture, just generally people, is it the idea that

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:09.720
 at some point something happens in the blood clots and it'll just cause big problems in

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.760
 the brain and strokes and heart?

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:15.240
 Is that what we generally say strokes are?

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:18.080
 Yeah, officially.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.080
 Officially?

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:29.440
 There are several times as frequent clotting type strokes as bleeding type strokes.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:39.320
 But if you actually look at the data, any extremely old person is likely to be having

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:50.880
 small bleeding strokes, microscopic capillary level bleeding in their brain and other tissues.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:57.040
 And I think vitamin K and progesterone and thyroid and vitamin D and all these things

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:03.480
 protect against that multiplicity of small bleeding strokes.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:17.880
 And the so-called transient ischemic attack is a constriction of small arteries caused

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.000
 by reduced energy production.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.600
 Carbon dioxide is the normal vasodilator in the brain.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:34.600
 And if your brain is just not getting enough sugar or oxygen, it stops making enough carbon

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.960
 dioxide.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:42.400
 And so the arteries constrict and shut off completely.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:50.560
 And taking extra carbon dioxide or extra sugar can sometimes break the transient ischemic

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.320
 attack.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:02:01.800
 The stress hormones providing increased blood sugar will usually stop that transient constrictive

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.080
 effect.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:16.160
 The stress hormone, one of the basic triggers of the stress system is serotonin.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:23.600
 And under stress, the brain concentration of serotonin increasing is what turns on the

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:29.600
 ACTH cortisol stress hormone system.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:38.680
 But in the process, the increased serotonin in the brain reduces circulation of the brain.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:46.600
 And I think it's one of the constrictive factors that reduces the production of carbon dioxide

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:55.160
 and tends to tighten up blood vessels and reduce oxidation and the use of glucose in

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160
 the brain.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.680
 And how do we increase this carbon dioxide?

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:10.040
 In an emergency, re-breathing in a paper bag, I've seen people lower crisis level blood

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:19.960
 pressure in just a few hours by every 30 minutes or so, breathing as long as they can in a

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:27.000
 paper bag, breathing for one or two minutes in an average size paper bag.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:36.080
 You run out of oxygen and have to stop, but then resting a while, you can do it again.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:43.480
 And the increase in carbon dioxide by recycling it will relax blood vessels, especially in

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:46.360
 the brain, but throughout the system.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:54.080
 And so the resistance to circulation of the blood drops as the carbon dioxide opens up

01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:03.800
 the blood vessels and that can restore functions of the brain, breaking a transient stroke

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800
 effect.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:15.120
 But it also, by reducing the resistance to circulation, makes your heart able to produce

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.400
 a bigger stroke with less effort.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:26.520
 So it can reduce the strain on the heart while the heart is pumping much more efficiently.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.360
 Dr. A. Peat is with us.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360
 Interesting.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:36.080
 Dr. Peat said that a processed liver supplement was not a good thing.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.560
 Could you ask him if a processed thyroid supplement is good, bad?

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:46.320
 I did not get results from the desiccated thyroid prescription, so I went to a grass-fed

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.120
 thyroid supplement out of New Zealand.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.440
 He suggested a desiccated thyroid product of Mexico maybe.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.720
 Hope to find that info on your site.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.360
 No.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:09.020
 About 30 years ago, the standard for almost 100 years was Armour thyroid, but the Armour

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:19.600
 company sold their trade name and business and immediately the formula started changing.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:30.280
 It went through about 10 years of periodic changes of the recipe, so I lost confidence

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.960
 in that one.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:41.620
 Before that happened, there had been several thyroid products sold through pharmacies for

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:44.920
 about 30 or 40 years.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:56.680
 Someone sent 10 of these products to an analytical lab that could detect tissue, an immunological

01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:02.960
 test, and they found that eight of the 10 samples bought in a drugstore as prescription

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:14.560
 thyroid USP, eight of the 10 contained no thyroid tissue at all.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:26.240
 That was probably deliberate fraud, but it's somewhat of a refined technology of making

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.200
 good thyroid product.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.840
 You have to know that you're getting the actual thyroid gland.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:41.520
 I've seen people mistake lymph nodes for thyroid gland, so you have to know that the person

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:48.520
 producing the thyroid gland crude product knows what they're doing.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:53.520
 Then you have to know that it's being processed carefully.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.560
 You have to know that you're removing the fat with a solvent so that it's stable and

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:06.720
 doesn't deteriorate with oxygen exposure, and then that they don't extract part of the

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:11.920
 chemistry before they sell it as a thyroid product.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:18.320
 Some of the companies are taking out thyrocalcitonin, which is one of the natural hormones that

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:28.440
 should be in the thyroid product, and almost all of the thyroid products made in the US

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:38.560
 now claim that they contain a certain amount per grain, a certain amount of T4 and a certain

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.520
 amount of T3, but there should be none of those.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.360
 They shouldn't be in there?

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:53.640
 No, it should be thyroglobulin with only the slightest trace amounts, if any, of the actual

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.640
 hormones.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:08:03.160
 That's the characteristic of a thyroid product is that it's almost pure protein, defatted,

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:12.800
 and we digest it, and in the process of digesting the thyroglobulin, our enzymes release the

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.360
 T4 and T3 and some T2 hormone.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:25.560
 It shouldn't be in the product, but I think the FDA encouraged this misleading, really

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560
 false labeling.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560
 Wow.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.440
 So where can we get this good old just thyroglobulin?

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440
 Is that even available?

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:39.600
 That's in all of the true desiccated thyroid products, but it shouldn't be labeled that

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.680
 it contains the hormones.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:48.600
 It should be labeled according to the actual protein content.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.680
 Are you familiar with this one that's made in Thailand?

01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:04.400
 A chemist contacted me, said he had done tests on it and it was labeled as containing so

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.160
 much T4 and T3.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.880
 He said he couldn't find a trace of these hormones in it.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.560
 Was it a fraudulent product?

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.120
 I said, "No, it shouldn't contain those hormones."

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:17.120
 It shouldn't, right.

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:25.960
 And so he hydrolyzed the product with hydrochloric acid and wrote back a few days later and said,

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.920
 "Now it contains full amount of the hormones."

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.240
 He hydrolyzed it the same way our stomach acid would.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.240
 Wow.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.040
 So maybe that's a pretty good product.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.200
 There was a fellow, I guess he went over to Thailand because he was tired of this nonsense

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.880
 going on with thyroid and he's making this and you can actually buy it.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:49.920
 I think it's like he goes by something like postage stamps or something.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.920
 You know the product I'm talking about?

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920
 No.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920
 No, you don't?

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920
 Oh well.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.920
 Oh well.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:02.120
 So if I'm going to go out and get a hold of the good stuff now, where would they go,

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.520
 the good stuff?

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:12.720
 I'm not sure which to recommend, but people have told me in the last few months that they

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:21.080
 were having good results from I think the Nature Throid and WP.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.920
 I think they said they were getting consistent results.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:30.840
 But for about 30 years I've been using the synthetic equivalents that were based on the

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.280
 old armor composition.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:44.640
 Thyral R was their company's formula for a synthetic equivalent and then Sino Plus exactly

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.480
 copied the Thyral R proportions.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:59.200
 And so I've been using Sino Plus now for about 35 years and it's very reliable and consistent.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.280
 The Sino Plus, that's T3, right?

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.280
 More T3?

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.920
 No, it's a mixture of a 4 to 1 ratio of T4 to T3.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.200
 And the same company makes a pure T3 called Sino-Mal.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:18.120
 So the Sino Plus, you get that out of Mexico, right?

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120
 Yeah.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:25.120
 They're constantly being interfered with by American drug company competition.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:31.120
 Yeah, I bet they are.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.440
 I lost my place here, sorry.

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:41.440
 Bear with me a second.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:45.800
 Okay.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:52.360
 Dr. Peat has talked about, before on your show, about how tyrosine is a protective protein

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.680
 and it's found in gelatin.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.320
 Are there any good food sources of tyrosine, plant-based sources?

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:07.640
 Oh, I think, did you say tyrosine?

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.840
 Tyrosine, right.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:18.480
 Glycine and proline, I think, are the main reasons for using gelatin.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:26.520
 Glycine is something like 35 or 40% of the amino acids.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:33.960
 And glycine and proline have a cell-stabilizing anti-inflammatory effect.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:43.480
 And gelatin is completely free of the amino acids that are pro-inflammatory.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:54.600
 Antithyroid and even carcinogenic tryptophan is a carcinogenic amino acid promoting inflammation.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:13:02.200
 Excess serotonin, for example, and cysteine can be pro-inflammatory.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:11.320
 Methionine is another amino acid that is not in glycine.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:17.960
 Methionine is a longevity and shortening amino acid.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:27.760
 So, gelatin being free of those three potentially toxic amino acids is a very protective protein

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:34.560
 for a mature person who isn't growing.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:39.920
 So that's one of the reasons why you like the gelatin product, if you want to do a protein

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:45.480
 powder rather than something else, a whey or bean or rice or whatever.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:52.840
 Yeah, and these amino acids that have the toxic effect are also very susceptible to

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.640
 oxidation.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:04.280
 Tryptophan and cysteine can become more toxic than normal when they're dehydrated and exposed

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.720
 to oxygen.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:14.840
 So almost all proteins are degraded and made pro-inflammatory by dehydration, even with

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.080
 so-called freeze-drying.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:23.840
 The drying process itself tends to create oxidation of those amino acids.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:31.520
 So gelatin is unique, as far as I know, in being pretty stable to dehydration.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:40.480
 Dear Dr. Peat, if powdered eggshells is pure calcium carbonate, why not just buy calcium

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.840
 carbonate tablets from the store and forget the process of boiling the eggshells and then

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:51.320
 grinding them to a powder to increase one's calcium intake?

01:14:51.320 --> 01:15:03.360
 If the manufacturer of the powder or the tablets used oyster shells or eggshells, they would

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:11.320
 get a pure, safe product, but you can't count on that.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:18.640
 When people have analyzed various calcium carbonate products, the eggshell was always

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:23.920
 the purest, very close to oyster shells.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:32.920
 If the oysters are taken from a polluted part of the ocean, they can have some contaminants.

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:43.080
 But eggshells are consistently the least chemically contaminated source of calcium carbonate.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:48.200
 Second point of his question, he says, "My joint pain has greatly subsided simply by

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.400
 putting a quarter teaspoon of baking soda in my coffee each morning, as well as drinking

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.080
 a half teaspoon in water before I go to bed in the evening.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.760
 Do you see any issues with this routine of mine?"

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:07.560
 It's actually filling in for a potential calcium deficiency.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:17.480
 The sodium is tending to lower your adrenal aldosterone production, and aldosterone is

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:24.640
 an age-promoting, inflammation-promoting, fibrosis-promoting hormone, so keeping that

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:29.080
 low by a little supplement of sodium is good.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:34.680
 The bicarbonate is churned once it gets in the bloodstream.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:37.280
 It's absorbed by cells.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:44.640
 If they happen to be deficient in carbon dioxide, they can turn the bicarbonate into carbon

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:52.400
 dioxide, acidifying cells, keeping them in the protected, oxidizing state.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.320
 So a little baking soda is generally very protective.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:06.760
 Athletes at the start of a marathon, a bicycle race, for example, have taken a tablespoon

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:13.880
 of baking soda and greatly increased their endurance.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:20.160
 Lots of people take a teaspoon at a time, but even a smaller amount can be protective.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.520
 Very interesting.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:28.920
 "Is sulfated castor oil safe to use as soap?

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.560
 Is lanolin a safe moisturizer?"

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560
 Two questions there.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.800
 Turkey oil, turkey fat.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.800
 For soap?

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.800
 Yeah.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.800
 I don't know.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.800
 Yeah.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.040
 I think it's probably okay if it doesn't smell like turkeys.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040
 Yeah.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.200
 You don't want to smell like turkeys.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:52.760
 Because lanolin, it's a very stiff oil, so it helps to thin it with a little coconut

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.760
 oil or MCT or something to make it spreadable.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:06.480
 But besides being a protecting sealing agent so your skin doesn't dehydrate, it tends to

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.120
 hold moisture in the skin just by forming a seal.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:21.480
 So at the same time, I think it's more than 50% of a precursor steroid to cholesterol.

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:28.960
 So I think to the extent that it can be dissolved, like if it's maybe olive oil or MCT or something

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:37.360
 thinner, to the extent that it can dissolve into the skin, it's going to have an anti-aging

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.840
 effect by supporting the local production of cholesterol.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.320
 I read that Mr. Peat is not a fan of whey protein powders.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.800
 I was wondering if he could recommend other form of protein powders that could use.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.880
 So would gelatin for you?

01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:00.400
 Gelatin is the only protein I know of that is stable during dehydration.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.400
 Can you take a lot of that?

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.520
 I mean, if you want?

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520
 People want to eat a lot of it?

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:05.520
 Is it okay?

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.520
 Yeah.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:10.000
 It's about 30 grams.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:20.560
 The book on the medical use of gelatin that was published, I think, about 1940 and distributed

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:28.840
 by I think the Great Lakes Gelatin has been distributing the book.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:37.480
 It described treating diabetes and colitis, for example, with I think 30 grams a day was

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.280
 the most they recommended.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:45.960
 But I've known people to use 60 grams a day with very good results.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.920
 I think I have to look at the can, but isn't it about 10 grams of protein per tablespoon?

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.200
 That'd be a lot if you wanted to get 60.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:57.160
 It'd be six tablespoons, but you know, I don't know if it works.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.880
 It seems weird though that, and they say it's grass-fed and organic.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.800
 Well, grass-fed on the label, but they use the hide of the cows, right?

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.440
 That's where it comes from.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.440
 Yeah.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:16.920
 And pork and beef gelatin is, as far as I can tell, there's no difference, but some

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:23.760
 people think they have digestive irritation from the pork gelatin.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.040
 So you can specify if you want beef or pork.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:34.160
 So now when you take beef or pork bones, you can different pigs feed and ham hocks and

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.240
 stuff and make your own bone broth, there's a lot of gelatin in there, right?

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.360
 Oh yeah, if you cool it and it becomes solid.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360
 Yeah, just solid.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.080
 Yeah, that's what you want.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.640
 I did that with chicken feed, some organic chicken feed, Dr. Peat.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.160
 And after I took, you know, I had a nice bowl of it with some carrots and onions and garlic,

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:59.640
 and then I put it in the fridge, it was so thick, you had to take literally a big spoon

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.640
 to get it out.

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.840
 That's how much gelatin was in there.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:03.840
 Wow, man.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.200
 Yeah, it should bounce.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.800
 Yeah, it should bounce.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:12.560
 So this would actually be maybe even a step up from doing a Great Lakes or similar in

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.280
 its efficacy?

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.600
 You get some of the chicken flavor when you use wings and feet, so it's tastier.

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:23.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.160
 You want to hear a potato story?

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.600
 You're a fan of dextrinization, right?

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.600
 Dextrinized foods?

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.600
 No, not especially.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.160
 Oh, I thought you were.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:38.520
 Anyway, I dextrinized a potato in a crock pot for about 12 hours yesterday, we were

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:44.160
 talking on the show, and boy, it really came out good, just in a crock pot.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:52.080
 Long cooking breaks down the starch, so it's easier to digest.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.200
 Usually 40 minutes to an hour is safe enough.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.200
 Plenty, yeah.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:01.560
 Yeah, but you do it like 375 or something, or 400?

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:07.040
 I never thought of just boiling temperature was all I used.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.440
 Just to boil it, just to boil it.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:14.520
 Mr. Peat has said in a young person, "Good food, sunlight, and high altitude can often

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.080
 overcome severe inflammatory conditions."

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:22.760
 And then when an older, in quotes, person whose tissues contain larger amounts of polys

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.960
 and they break down products, it takes more environmental support to get them out of chronic

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.880
 inflammatory pattern.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.360
 Such as aspirin and coffee.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.800
 Oh, such as aspirin and coffee.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.080
 That's what he said, some specific remedies for folks that can do to break out the chronic

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.680
 inflammation pattern.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.920
 Yeah, and vitamin D and thyroid.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.560
 That'll do it, huh?

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:55.520
 What's the difference, folks who want to live in a very low humidity, high altitude, like

01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:02.160
 a Colorado compared to equator stuff, is there any of those living conditions that are more

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.280
 conducive to longevity and health, in your opinion?

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:15.000
 Yeah, studies in New Mexico and Switzerland have shown heart disease decreases in proportion

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.800
 to increasing altitude.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:23.920
 Every thousand feet they saw, I think it was about a 2% decrease in mortality.

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.360
 Every thousand feet you end up.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360
 I wonder what that's about.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.880
 I wonder what, did they say why that was?

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.280
 Your body retains more carbon dioxide when you adapt slowly.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:45.520
 If you rush up to 8,000 feet in a day, you might get altitude sickness.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:51.200
 But the people who are low thyroid at sea level and think they're breathing okay are

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.280
 really hyperventilating chemically at sea level.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:02.560
 And when those people go suddenly up to high altitude, their hyperventilation shows up

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.240
 and they get swelling of the lungs and brain and get sick.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:12.480
 But if you adapt slowly, it will tend to correct hypothyroidism.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:22.800
 Your T3 production goes up and your blood becomes more fluid, even though more concentrated,

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.920
 carries oxygen more effectively.

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:30.120
 And inflammation goes down.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.040
 That's the main thing.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:42.520
 The Russians for about 50 years were doing high altitude therapy for allergies, arthritis,

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:53.360
 heart disease, and they even did studies in animals at least, in which sending the cancer

01:24:53.360 --> 01:25:03.480
 treated animals that should 100% die of cancer to 17,000 feet altitude, about 50% of them

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.320
 threw off the cancer.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.320
 Interesting.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:13.440
 On the heart study thing you mentioned on the high altitude or the dryness, lower humidity,

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:19.400
 was that looking at myocardial infarctions and actually heart muscle or the atherosclerosis

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.400
 idea with heart disease?

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.640
 They were just looking at the deaths from heart disease.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.800
 Heart disease, death in general, right.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.560
 Very great reduction.

01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:33.640
 And insurance companies have seen for more than 100 years, they've seen a great reduction

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:37.200
 in cancer mortality in high altitudes.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.080
 And there has been some publicity in the last several years.

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:49.720
 It just came on the news again yesterday or the day before about high altitude causing

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:54.960
 suicide by lowering serotonin.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:03.400
 Several people have been researching this in Colorado, which does have a high suicide

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:09.720
 level and they noticed that serotonin goes down as altitude goes up.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:19.840
 And so they said if serotonin is the happy hormone and you have less, then maybe suicide

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.840
 occurs at high altitude because of loss of serotonin.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.760
 But actually that is totally wrong.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:27.760
 Totally wrong.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.760
 Yes.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.160
 Serotonin does go down as altitude goes up.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:40.920
 And that's why the mortality from heart disease and cancer goes down.

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:50.560
 But if you look at suicide rates in relation to altitude and forget about Colorado, the

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:59.720
 very low countries, if you look at the three countries that have been number one for suicide,

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:08.960
 extremely high suicide rates in the last 10 or 20 years, South Korea, I think it was Lithuania

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:17.320
 and Bangladesh, very low altitude countries, extremely high suicide rates.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:26.640
 And then the lowest suicide rates in the world have generally been Mexico, Colombia and Bolivia.

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.840
 High altitude countries, yes.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.360
 I think that's the actual effect of altitude.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:35.800
 It improves health and reduces depression.

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.720
 Any challenges with living in low humidity, places like Colorado, for over many years?

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.880
 I mean, does that pose any health issues or challenges?

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880
 Yes.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.440
 It seems to make your skin drier.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:48.440
 Drier.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.960
 You just got to put more gooey stuff on it or something.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.960
 Yes.

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:54.960
 Yes, probably.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.760
 Or eat more chicken, Peat.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:04.200
 Would you ask Dr. Peat what he thinks regarding a carnivore or strictly animal foods diet?

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:07.560
 Yes, she's got two parts.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:08.560
 Let's do that one first.

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.120
 Yes, that's kind of big now.

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.120
 It's another fad.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:16.080
 Carnivore or just all animal foods diet?

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:25.440
 If that includes milk and cheese and eggs and oysters, that's a pretty good diet.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:36.400
 But if you don't include the bones or the milk and cheese, then it can be a dangerously

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.800
 high phosphate-rich diet.

01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:47.120
 You should take in about equal amounts of calcium and phosphorus.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:56.400
 If you eat only the muscle meats, then you have something like a 10 to 1 ratio of phosphate

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:03.160
 to calcium, which is very pro-inflammatory and pro-degenerative disease.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:08.400
 That could be a challenge with the classic paleo diet, right, that they don't like dairy

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.400
 or stuff.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:10.400
 Yes.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.400
 Just in general, do you think...

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.800
 I don't know if we've probably talked about it, but I can't recall.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.680
 Like just brown rice or organic brown rice or jasmine or even quinoa or these kind of

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:30.120
 things, millet, these things that we need, are they just something extra to eat?

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.760
 Are they valuable to us?

01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:43.400
 The reason the Chinese developed the white rice product thousands of years ago is that

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:53.160
 the fats in rice are very highly unsaturated and get rancid almost immediately in a warm

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.160
 temperature.

01:29:54.160 --> 01:30:02.680
 In a cold climate, they fall off the plant when the weather is cool, and they live during

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:07.520
 the winter and then sprout when the weather is warmer.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:16.920
 So the polyunsaturated fat is not harmful to the plant, but if you store it in the unprocessed

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:24.280
 condition, then it's very likely to be rancid by the time you eat it.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:33.240
 And then when you assimilate those fats, they proceed to become more oxidized in your body.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:40.280
 So I think the traditional Chinese way of making white rice and then cooking it thoroughly,

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.880
 it's a good source of carbohydrate.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:51.400
 Oh, I'm sorry, the last part, I missed the last part you say.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:54.600
 The way you mean soaking and all of that?

01:30:54.600 --> 01:31:01.240
 Yeah, but processing it, removing the bran and the germ.

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:13.000
 And they also, thousands of years ago, developed the process of soaking it in lime or ashes,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.440
 for example, which form lime when they're wet.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:32.120
 It will digest the starch and convert the tryptophan to vitamin B, deniacin, and make

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:35.880
 much of the fat go off in the solution.

01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:42.880
 So the ideal way to eat rice or corn is the lime processed.

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:51.160
 The Mexican form is called nixtamalized corn or nixtamal.

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:57.600
 Also what are your thoughts, writes an emailer, on high oxalate foods such as potatoes, nuts

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:05.680
 and seeds, darky leafy greens, causing oxalate toxicity?

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:15.160
 I don't think it's a problem if you have good digestion and good thyroid function.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:22.560
 It's a potential problem if your calcium metabolism is going haywire.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:32.360
 You can form calcium oxalate stones, but calcium deficiency in your diet is one of the things

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:40.400
 that increases the stress hormones, parathyroid hormone makes you mishandle calcium.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.880
 That increases the tendency to form stones.

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:44.880
 I see.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:49.240
 Here's an email, "I've always pasteurized milk, especially like ultra-pasteurized."

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:55.400
 I've always heard pasteurized and ultra-pasteurized was not good because the high heat damaged

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.240
 the fats and proteins, and this is what caused the allergic problems and everything else.

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.560
 Is this true?

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.200
 How can we heat and eat meat and fish?

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.800
 Is that a problem also?

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:11.720
 So cooking, let's start with the milk.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.120
 You said that pasteurized milk, that's not a problem.

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:17.160
 Is that correct if I understand?

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:25.960
 The ultra-pasteurized tastes funny, and that goes with a slight loss of vitamin A, for

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:37.360
 example, and vitamin C. I think it's about a 20 or 30% loss, but mostly it's a taste

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.960
 problem when it's ultra-pasteurized.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:50.280
 But the good-tasting pasteurized milk, I think it has been held at the temperature only for

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:58.560
 a few seconds and then quickly cooled, and it can taste just as good as unpasteurized

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.880
 milk.

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:07.000
 But even unpasteurized or raw milk, if you want to heat it up to 160 and bring it back

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
 down?

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:15.440
 Yeah, the longer it stays at 160, the more flavor it loses.

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.940
 Right, right, right.

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:21.440
 So any issues on this email with when we cook meat and fish?

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.200
 Is that a problem for us?

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.200
 Similar.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:31.040
 If it's overcooked, the cholesterol is progressively oxidized.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:39.120
 So quick cooking at high temperature, for example, they've compared different meats.

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:48.280
 Salmon was the most interesting because poached salmon had many times more toxic oxidized

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:54.820
 cholesterol than quickly broiled salmon.

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:55.820
 Same with steak.

01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:03.220
 If you slow cook a steak, it tastes bad, and part of that is your fats and cholesterol

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.100
 have been seriously oxidized.

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:12.780
 So that's what the kind of overcooked flavor is when you overcook meat.

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.700
 It's an oxidation of the fat in there?

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:23.760
 Yeah, and if you can bring it up to temperature in just two or three minutes, that's best

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.100
 like pasteurization of milk.

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:30.540
 It preserves the flavor and the nutrients.

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:34.500
 Ellen writes in, "Can Dr. Peat recommend a safe cholesterol product to rub into the

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.500
 skin?"

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.500
 No.

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:39.500
 I don't know anything about what's available now.

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:42.540
 Just do butter or something.

01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:58.860
 My daughter has a condition called EPP where her liver doesn't flush out porphyrins as

01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:03.460
 they build up in the body and causes sensitivities to the sun.

01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:10.340
 EPP experts recommend a higher carb diet as they say there is an enzyme in the carbs that

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:12.100
 cleans out the excess porphyrins.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:17.540
 Is Dr. Peat aware of anything like this and what I could do to help her?

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:19.180
 Yeah.

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:27.420
 Sugar is the protective thing, and when your sugar is low, your free fatty acids go up

01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:33.380
 and poison all of your tissues, not just the liver, but your brain.

01:36:33.380 --> 01:36:42.900
 Everything is exposed to stress when the sugar is low, and those people with that slight

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:51.260
 shift in the balance of porphyrin metabolism, estrogen causes a drop in blood sugar and

01:36:51.260 --> 01:37:00.060
 a surge of porphyrin, and just having consistent sugar intake, keeping your thyroid steady

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:08.900
 so that your blood sugar doesn't drop easily, and having a frequent orange juice, for example,

01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:16.380
 as a source of sugar is usually all it takes to prevent the attacks.

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.900
 And fruit, of course, and I guess anything that's going to turn to sugar, right?

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:23.020
 Potatoes or orange juice, or just anything.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:26.260
 Honey, maple syrup, that kind of stuff?

01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:27.260
 Sure.

01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:28.260
 Boy, I like honey.

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:29.260
 Man.

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:33.420
 We just got an email, a fellow just wanted to thank you for your idea.

01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:36.660
 He says when he does a couple teaspoons of honey when he wakes up in the middle of the

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:39.180
 night, it goes right back to the bed.

01:37:39.180 --> 01:37:40.620
 I think you mentioned that on a past show.

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:43.860
 He just wanted to thank you for that.

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:51.860
 People have told me that they have taken honey secretly to the hospital where someone was

01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:57.860
 in serious condition, gave him a couple of tablespoons, person got up and left the hospital.

01:37:57.860 --> 01:37:58.860
 Yeah.

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.340
 Well, it's pretty magical, some of it.

01:38:00.340 --> 01:38:06.140
 Dr. Peat stated that the omega-3s is less stable.

01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:17.380
 What that really means is that it is more sacrificial, it oxidizes instead of your tissue

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.380
 being oxidized?

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:20.980
 Do you know what he's saying here?

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:21.980
 I'm sorry.

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:26.420
 Yeah, that's been the basis for a lot of the claims.

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.780
 One thing it does is lower your prostaglandin production.

01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:38.620
 It competes with arachidonic acid for making the pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, so it

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:43.340
 can reduce inflammation.

01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:49.540
 But when it's taken into the bloodstream, by the time it gets to the bloodstream, it's

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:50.540
 oxidizing.

01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:57.300
 A large percent is oxidized before it gets into the tissue.

01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:03.900
 Some of it does reach the brain, but much of it circulates as breakdown products, and

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:13.780
 these poison the immune system, interfere with white blood cells, and that can powerfully

01:39:13.780 --> 01:39:16.420
 stop an inflammatory process.

01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:26.100
 But if it continues for more than a few days, that suppresses your resistance to bacterial

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:28.220
 or fungal infections too.

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:35.140
 So after a period of about six months, you start seeing serious damage to the immune

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:40.780
 system when people are eating too much fish.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:46.740
 This fellow actually is a doc, and he says, "I know of a Dr. Trempe, T-R-E-M-P-E.

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.660
 He had benefits of seeing cause-effect in the eyes, and there's no doubt that omega-3

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.180
 is protective to the retina."

01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.340
 He sends a link here.

01:39:55.340 --> 01:40:03.180
 So I wrote a newsletter about that, and there is a lot of literature showing that babies

01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:15.420
 in particular, it's the omega-3 fatty acids that are damaged by blue light or ultraviolet

01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:24.140
 light, but bright light in general, causes retinal damage specifically by the changes

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:28.500
 in these highly unsaturated fats.

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:34.460
 So there's a lot of literature showing that they are damaging to the retina.

01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:35.460
 The threes are?

01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:36.460
 Mm-hmm.

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:37.460
 Wow.

01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:40.980
 A couple more, then we'll let you go to work.

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:47.140
 Could breathing hydrogen gas help regulate the thyroid?

01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:51.620
 Probably but I haven't seen any research on that.

01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:56.660
 It's very interesting stuff, but I don't know exactly what it would be doing to the

01:40:56.660 --> 01:40:57.660
 thyroid.

01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:58.660
 Gotcha.

01:40:58.660 --> 01:40:59.660
 I understand.

01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:05.980
 An American Indian friend keeps bear fat in his fridge for internal and external use.

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:11.180
 Is this a good fat to have if you can catch a bear?

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.860
 Let's get some bear fat.

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:17.460
 I think it would depend a lot on what the bear was eating.

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:26.340
 Some bears eat lots of berries, lots of fruit, and others load up on salmon when the salmon

01:41:26.340 --> 01:41:28.420
 are running.

01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:34.100
 So if they were eating berries, I think it would be pretty much like beef fat.

01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:38.860
 Dr. Peat, have you ever heard of a fellow by the name, I think it's Morris Croc?

01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:39.860
 No.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:40.860
 No.

01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:43.780
 He wrote a lot of books about just eating fruit.

01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:48.620
 You read these things and it's like if you just eat fruit, the whole world is going to

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:50.820
 open up and you're going to be in heaven.

01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:54.780
 Have you ever experienced anybody that's really done the whole, just a lot of fruit, a lot

01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:55.780
 of fruit?

01:41:55.780 --> 01:41:58.860
 Do you see possible advantages?

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.980
 I feel so good when I just eat a lot of fruit.

01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:01.980
 I don't know.

01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:06.820
 Talk a little bit about that with what you know about diet.

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:12.500
 Part of it is that lots of fruits stimulate the intestine and accelerate the movement

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.540
 through the intestine.

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:24.140
 So they can keep the bacteria happy and harmless.

01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:31.260
 One of the problems with a pure fruit diet over the long run is that most fruits are

01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:34.500
 very low in iron.

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:39.980
 There was a study in California of migrant fruit picker families.

01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:49.460
 The kids found that their average hemoglobin was at 10, way down in the anemic range because

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:53.060
 they were eating lots of oranges.

01:42:53.060 --> 01:43:03.060
 But they were extremely free of disease and infection, healthier than their well-fed neighbors.

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:12.460
 So I think you can tolerate a fairly low iron intake if everything else is good.

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:19.940
 There isn't enough availability of a variety of fruits, I think, for people in the United

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:22.100
 States.

01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:33.580
 You might end up eating a lot of bananas and dates and easy to store and ship fruits.

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:37.860
 Those happen to be high in serotonin and can create problems of inflammation.

01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:40.700
 Why are they high in serotonin?

01:43:40.700 --> 01:43:46.940
 Just because they've hybridized them and stuff like that to make them ripe at a certain time?

01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:53.780
 I suspect that is a part of it because when you stress a plant, it produces defensive,

01:43:53.780 --> 01:44:00.580
 irritating chemicals intended to kill insects or predators.

01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:08.020
 I think the way bananas are grown is very stressful to the plant.

01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:11.300
 If you were to do a lot of fruit, how would you get more iron in there to help balance

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:12.300
 that out?

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:15.580
 People that love fruit, where would you get that from?

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.580
 I'm not sure.

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:26.220
 In some of the studies of the Pacific Islanders who live on a potato diet, once a year they

01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:32.180
 have pork feasts, one week a year, and that's enough iron apparently.

01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:36.140
 My goodness, isn't that funny?

01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:38.300
 One day a year?

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.300
 One week a year.

01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:42.140
 One week a year, they just eat a lot of pork.

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.460
 But let's see, doesn't molasses have a lot of iron?

01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:45.460
 Blackstrap?

01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:54.900
 Yeah, but it also has some irritants that I don't think it's a safe, regular source

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:55.900
 of iron.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:45:04.980
 It's better than an iron deficiency, but I think eggs or oysters or something would be

01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:09.500
 a much safer way to do it.

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:12.420
 You know, when you're in the business like this, I talk to all these people, all these

01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:18.980
 different carnivores and paleo and keto and, I don't know, vegan and vegetarian.

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:26.860
 Do you think these are always going to be with us, you know, 10, 20, 30 years from now?

01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:35.500
 I think the information is gradually getting organized to the point that we'll be able

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:42.820
 to understand which fruits, for example, complement each other.

01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:46.260
 You can get all the protein you need just from fruits.

01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:53.060
 Potatoes are extremely good as a protein source, but with the right choice of fruits, you can

01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:56.180
 get your protein just from fruits.

01:45:56.180 --> 01:46:06.740
 But it involves choosing with information about which fruits should balance your whole

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.500
 nutritional pattern.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:14.540
 There's places you could actually research and just research protein and fruits?

01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:20.460
 Yeah, it's very scattered and hard to put together, but it's possible.

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460
 Kind of fun, though.

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.340
 Fruits are fun, yeah, and they feel good.

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:25.700
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks for being here this morning.

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.180
 What are you going to do today for fun?

01:46:27.180 --> 01:46:28.180
 Anything?

01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:29.580
 I think I'll paint a little.

01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:32.740
 Yeah, well, it's not like a good day to paint.

01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:34.620
 You're up in the Northwest, right?

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:36.300
 What's the weather like?

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:39.260
 I'm cooling off a little.

01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:40.260
 Yeah.

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.300
 Well, thanks for being here.

01:46:41.300 --> 01:46:42.300
 We appreciate it.

01:46:42.300 --> 01:46:50.140
 Tell folks now, we have it on our show page, they can get your newsletter, and if we click

01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:54.620
 on it, I think it just takes you to, oh, good, it takes you right to the right spot if you

01:46:54.620 --> 01:47:00.700
 like to get Dr. Peat's newsletter, it'll take you right to a Gmail, raypeatnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:02.180
 So we have that up there for you.

01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:03.180
 Oh, thanks.

01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:06.740
 Yeah, sure, and that one, PayPal just joined up for two years.

01:47:06.740 --> 01:47:08.740
 Is that right, two years?

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:09.740
 Yeah.

01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:12.580
 Two years, and that's not very much, that's cool.

01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:16.700
 And another one, final email, somebody wants to know where they can get your books.

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:18.900
 It's a good way to...

01:47:18.900 --> 01:47:19.900
 Same place.

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:20.900
 Same place.

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:21.900
 Oh, same place.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:25.060
 And they email you and they... and you have three books?

01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:30.860
 I think those... there might be five available electronically now.

01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:31.860
 Oh, I see.

01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:35.980
 So people can do it on their little fire readers and all that stuff.

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:36.980
 That's cool.

01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:38.420
 All right, sir, thank you so much.

01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:41.580
 We appreciate your being here, and we'll see you next month.

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580
 Okay, thanks.

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:43.580
 Thank you.

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:46.100
 Dr. Ray Peat, and yeah, click on that.

01:47:46.100 --> 01:47:50.620
 I've been meaning to join, and I'm going to join right after the show and get his newsletter

01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:54.780
 because, I mean, come on, what's up with that?

01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:59.020
 Yeah, this... it'll take you right to a Gmail and just Ray Peat's newsletter.

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:01.140
 All right, kids, we'll see you tomorrow.

01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:03.660
 We have a good show for you on Thursday.

01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:09.180
 Dr. Rulon Shu is going to be here, and we got a Pearlseum back in stock, so we can start

01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:10.900
 ordering that, the powder.

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:16.860
 I wonder if it's on the... if it says in stock, because they say it is.

01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:21.460
 Man, we had a dry run there.

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.060
 So sorry, we're getting all kinds of emails.

01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:25.980
 Where's the Pearlseum powder?

01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:31.060
 It still says out of stock, but I need to check, because I talked to them yesterday,

01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:34.140
 and they said it was in stock.

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:36.940
 So maybe they just haven't taken that little thing off.

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:40.100
 Anyway, she's going to be here, and we're going to catch up with her.

01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:41.100
 She's great gal.

01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:49.100
 I'll figure it out and make sure it says the right thing on the website.

01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:53.660
 And then also a fellow that I think we're going to have fun with, Dr. Ferdinando Pisani

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.900
 Massimoli.

01:48:54.900 --> 01:49:00.580
 He's South American Resource Coordinator for the Foundation for Alternative and Integrative

01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:01.900
 Medicine.

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:02.980
 Wow.

01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:06.460
 And he's really got some... he's got some interesting stuff.

01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:13.860
 He's worked with barefoot doctors in different places all around Europe with aromatherapy

01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:17.660
 and Amazonian traditional medicine.

01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:18.660
 Cool stuff.

01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:19.660
 So he's going to be fun.

01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:20.660
 He'll be here on Thursday.

01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:22.980
 Fred and the Real World of Money tomorrow.

01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:23.980
 So we'll see you tomorrow.

01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:25.500
 Thank you for your ongoing support.

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:30.060
 If you have questions about any of the products or services that we promote, get a lot of

01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:34.580
 questions on the hydrogen machine, send them to me, and I'll get them to George, or you

01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:40.300
 can go right to his website, which is EGLE, EGLE, whatever that is.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.300
 You'll find it there.

01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.300
 EGLE something.

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:45.940
 But you'll see it there when you go on our website.

01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:46.940
 And answer...

01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:51.220
 George answers a lot of questions, and he sends me copies of the emails that he sends

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.940
 out, so I kind of keep up with all the questions.

01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:57.180
 Good questions, so don't be shy about asking questions.

01:49:57.180 --> 01:49:58.460
 So I'll see you all tomorrow.

01:49:58.460 --> 01:49:59.740
 Thank you for being here.

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.340
 I love you all very much, and you're doing good.

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:03.660
 You're doing the best you can.

01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:05.820
 I don't care what anybody says.

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:06.820
 You're doing the best you can.

01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.420
 This is Patrick Timpani.

01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:11.740
 May the blessings be.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.660
 We are listener supported.
