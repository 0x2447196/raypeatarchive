00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.960
 We are listener supported, One Radio Network.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 - Well, good morning, welcome to part two

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.600
 of our little show, running just a few minutes behind.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.720
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.320
 with Dr. Ray Peat, he's a PhD,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.520
 and he's on the show with us on the third Monday

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.360
 of each month at around 10.30 central time,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.360
 and he's been at this for, Doc, what now, 35 years?

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.000
 You've got, has it been?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.960
 - 40, 45.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.960
 - 40, 45 years, and you're, wow, wow.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.920
 And you're feeling good?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.000
 You're, did you say you're 83 revolutions around the sun?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.880
 83 revolutions around the sun.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.680
 - Yeah, and Dr. Ray Peat drinks milk and has sugar,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.480
 so you might wanna listen and see how he does that.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.160
 Dr. Peat, good morning.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.280
 - Good morning.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.380
 - So I was just kinda asking you off the air for a second,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.280
 but let's dig into this, 'cause we just had a guest

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.840
 who was talking about the idea that these viruses,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.080
 measles and herpes and all these things,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.720
 we actually have, his conjecture is that we have these

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.560
 in our bodies already.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 The root canal people that we've had on have proven

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.960
 through biology and peer-reviewed studies

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.200
 that they open up these root canals, Doc,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.040
 you know, these infected guys,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.580
 and they find things in there like all kinds of things,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.580
 from herpes to syphilis to all kinds of crazy stuff

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.700
 that's already in the body.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 Does any of that kinda balance with your whole thing?

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840
 You've been at this a long time.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.720
 - Yeah, have you heard of Peter Duesberg

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.600
 and the HIV critics?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.000
 - Yeah, I mean, a little bit.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.320
 Tell folks who he is.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.360
 - I started graduate school in biology in 1968,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.160
 and I think it was in '69,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.960
 Temin and Baltimore published an article

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.760
 saying that they had evidence that DNA

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.680
 could be transcribed into RNA,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 and RNA could, a virus could,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 according to the existence of that enzyme,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.400
 there was a possibility for a virus to insert

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.060
 its, from RNA to DNA,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.680
 it could leave its trace, its genes in the nucleus.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.160
 And at the time, all of my molecular biology professors

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.440
 denied that that was possible

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.680
 because they had the dogma that genetic information

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.400
 goes only from DNA to RNA to protein.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.240
 And so the idea that protein could be a virus

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.240
 or that RNA could be integrated into the genes

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.200
 as a virus, RNA was not supposed to be translatable

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.520
 in the DNA, but it turns out that we're full of retroviruses.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.400
 Some people say a huge proportion of all of our genes

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 consist of retroviruses, and that during stress,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.080
 we emit these as possibly part of a curative system.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:02.040
 In, around just a little while after that,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.080
 there was an acupuncturist lent me a pamphlet

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.800
 he had written by a North Korean,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.880
 claiming he had evidence of particles of nucleic acid

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.720
 circulating in our lymph, well, he said it looked like

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.720
 our lymphatic system, but he said it was a completely

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.200
 separate circulatory system, a third circulatory system

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.080
 carrying these virus-like particles

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 that were actually emitted by cells to repair cells

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.480
 in other parts of the body.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 That was, he wrote that around 1965, I think.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.400
 And just in the last, oh, 10 years or so,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.880
 it's now recognized that we are full of these

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.080
 tiny particles carrying RNA and DNA and proteins

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.080
 emitted under stress, aging and any sort of sickness

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.520
 or stress cause our cells to emit particles that circulate

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.960
 so that they can come out of a stress tissue,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.040
 carry, be carried in the blood to the bone marrow,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.040
 for example, and change cells in the bone marrow

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.540
 so that they are able to repair the injured cell,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.160
 a two-way communication of viral-like particles.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.920
 And since our genome is fairly full of these

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.520
 viral-type particles, retroviruses,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.600
 that's a very plausible idea that viruses

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 could originate from stressed organisms.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.960
 We know that epidemics originate in famines and wars

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.400
 and conditions that are stressing organisms.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.920
 And they don't necessarily have to travel

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.920
 only from like the green monkey theory of AIDS,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.560
 traveling to humans or the snake to monkey

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.100
 to cats and humans of the Chinese virus.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.400
 Like 40 years ago, there were two botanists

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.240
 researching plant viruses at Oregon State University.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.240
 And they would use pumice powder on their fingers

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.640
 and rub the solutions of plant viruses

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.440
 into the leaves of plants to create

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.840
 the viral disease they were studying.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.020
 And within a short period of time,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.680
 both of those researchers came down

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.680
 with the same kind of rare degenerative brain disease,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.200
 which to me was very suggestive

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.200
 that a plant virus had invaded their system.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.580
 And I stopped eating raw vegetables at that point.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.160
 - So if I have a virus that manifests itself

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.080
 to help repair something in my body,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.660
 our previous guest was talking about how herpes will do,

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:35.720
 the lips may do some things like chapped and everything

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.860
 because the person, well, his whole thing

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.980
 is like the person was saying the person wants to be kissed

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.980
 so the lips will try to put more of these

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.040
 little sensitive particles out there and all that.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.420
 And the herpes will actually come in

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.060
 and try to heal that up kind of thing.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.580
 But if this is true and some of these things

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.420
 like come out of Patrick that are already there,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.260
 they've been there forever and they manifest

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.460
 for a healing process that I need to go through

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.200
 karmically, spiritually,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.260
 I can't pass those on to somebody else, can I?

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.660
 - Yeah, a couple of-- - Can you?

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.380
 - Publications in the last few years

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.020
 have found that within the body,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.620
 it's now known that they not only go to the bone marrow

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.760
 to change our immune system cells,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.060
 they can actually go to the gonads

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.980
 and enter our germ cells so they can be passed on.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.980
 So it's exactly the situation that Darwin proposed

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.700
 with his gemules coming from all of the body parts

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.580
 going in to the gonads,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.580
 modifying them for the inherent acquired characteristics.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:03.240
 But in this recent research,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.300
 they've just demonstrated that the microvesicles

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.860
 do enter germ cells among other cells.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.860
 And 80 years ago, people were talking about

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.140
 the strange properties that exist within a continent.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:31.620
 They see similarities between plants

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.020
 and invertebrate insects and such,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:41.020
 and the various mammals,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.140
 all varieties of organisms share some properties

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.140
 within the continent that evolution doesn't explain those.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.820
 And so they've proposed that long ago

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.040
 that particles, pollen, for example,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.440
 carries genetic information and we breathe it.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.440
 And a lab in Germany for, I guess,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.220
 going back 15 years at least,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.220
 has demonstrated that if you eat beef, for example,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:26.460
 you can trace the genetic DNA patterns,

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:34.180
 actual long pieces of DNA from the beef that you ate

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.780
 into your bloodstream and into your cells.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:42.020
 We're incorporating not only viruses

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.020
 but just cellular DNA from the various species that we eat.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.820
 So it's entirely possible that when you cough on someone,

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:58.980
 for example, that they inhale not only viral infections

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:05.640
 but your DNA is all around you

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.060
 and anyone who contacts you is assimilating that.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.540
 They've now demonstrated that a good number of people

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:23.660
 have been tested and after death,

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.660
 they can test a woman's brain tissue, for example,

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:34.140
 and find the DNA traces in her brain and other tissues

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.260
 of each of her previous husbands.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.100
 - Wow, wow.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.300
 - So DNA is much more pervasive than we usually think.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:52.460
 - Well, spiritually, it really kind of makes sense,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.060
 isn't it, if you have the idea,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.500
 if you believe in reincarnations,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.460
 I do, in past lives, in karma,

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.780
 and we reincarnate with somebody for a certain experience

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.900
 and they have these things that we share.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.180
 I mean, that all kind of makes sense to me.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.940
 - Yeah. - You know what I'm saying?

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.220
 It kind of makes sense.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.620
 It's like there's no accidents kind of thing.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:17.180
 - It's pretty much a continuous string

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:20.240
 of information, of genetic material.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.260
 (laughing)

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.420
 - So was Darwin onto something or how far off was he?

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.860
 - Oh, he had all of the principles down.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.060
 He just didn't know the details,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.300
 didn't know there was such a thing as DNA,

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.740
 but he had the idea right.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.380
 - Yeah, he was onto it.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.300
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.700
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.740
 We have lots of questions, we always do.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.220
 He has a PhD in biology, University of Oregon,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.100
 way back where he specialized in physiology.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.620
 He taught University of Oregon,

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.860
 Urbana College, Montana State University.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.700
 He's down in Mexico, nutritional counseling,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.580
 and so he's been around for quite a while,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.160
 for 45 years, if you have a question or two.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.980
 So what kinds of questions have you been getting

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.260
 about this whole corona thing

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.380
 and what kind of insights do you have

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.620
 for our audience for March 16th?

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.340
 Looks like, who knows, could be the still long time

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.380
 to go with this country.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.520
 Do you have any opinions on that,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.980
 where you think this thing is going?

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:32.580
 - Oh, yeah, I sort of sympathize with Trump

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.580
 that I think the CDC has been helping

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.280
 a couple of drug companies to increase

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.740
 their share of value, skyrocketing share prices

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.220
 of the vaccine maker.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.660
 And both World Health Organization and CDC

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.660
 have that connection with the vaccine industry.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.500
 And a lot of people have been exposed for corruption,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.740
 but no one is doing anything about it.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:13.580
 So in a typical year, the CDC has said

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:18.580
 that an average of about 40,000 Americans die of the flu.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.820
 So now they're getting excited when a few dozen people die.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.260
 It is out of proportion to what they claim

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.420
 to be the usual annual mortality from flu.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.660
 - Yeah, and is it true that most of these people,

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.180
 when they call the flu, it's really, it's a pneumonia,

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.780
 kind of goes in the lungs and does that whole thing?

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.780
 - Yeah, and the way the CDC has built up the market

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:54.060
 for flu vaccines is to call anyone who dies

00:14:55.060 --> 00:15:00.060
 of pneumonia a death from influenza.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:05.180
 But a very old person, say a hundred year old person

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:11.460
 without any particular sickness might just eat

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:17.540
 too much raw cabbage or something that gives them gas.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.780
 And that will cause pneumonia.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.220
 So people dying of pneumonia can't be counted as flu death.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.940
 So CDC has been fudging on that.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:37.020
 But it happens that over 10 years ago,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:42.620
 the coronavirus was known to simply activate

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:49.420
 the well-known inflammation systems,

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.180
 the angiotensin system.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:58.180
 For decades, we've had the angiotensin receptor blockers

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.640
 and ACE inhibitors.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.540
 The angiotensin converting enzyme produces

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:14.580
 the inflammatory protein that causes blood pressure

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.740
 to rise and so on.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.020
 And there's a close interaction between serotonin

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.700
 and angiotensin.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.580
 And those are both well-studied causes

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:34.500
 of aging-related inflammation.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.500
 So your angiotensin exposure and production

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:44.020
 will increase in old age.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.700
 And that increases your likelihood

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.420
 of getting pneumonia from anything.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.300
 It's a general inflammatory system

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.580
 that increases contraction of blood vessels

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.580
 and risk of clotting and fatigue,

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:09.100
 interfering with energy production and so on.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.180
 And the people who are dying at a very high rate

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:19.020
 from the coronavirus are those who already are suffering

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.780
 from circulatory disease, hypertension,

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.940
 heart disease, and stroke.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.940
 And so they already have an active angiotensin system.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:36.380
 And the virus finds an environment

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.300
 already going in the direction.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.300
 It happens that the angiotensin converting enzyme number two.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:51.180
 - Yes, ACE2, ACE2, yeah.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:56.180
 - It's the receptor for the virus.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.220
 The virus attaches to that in the process

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.700
 of entering a cell and becoming infective.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.700
 And ACE2 is the enzyme that undoes the infection

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.780
 and does the work of ACE itself.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.780
 ACE produces angiotensin,

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.980
 and ACE2 then destroys angiotensin.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.780
 So what the virus does in binding to ACE2

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.780
 seems to be inactivating the inactivator of angiotensin.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:38.180
 That leaves ACE free to make angiotensin,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.180
 which then doesn't have any way out.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:48.900
 So it accumulates, causing all of the dry cough,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:54.540
 the high fever, increased hypertension,

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.540
 and stroke, and so on.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.620
 - Someone was on the show conjecturing

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.620
 that Oriental people tend to have more of these ACE2 guys

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.500
 in their body.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.160
 Is it possible?

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.160
 - If it's ACE2, yeah, that would let them--

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.340
 - Be more vulnerable.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.820
 - Be a better target for the virus,

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:21.820
 but it would also suggest that having that without the virus

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:29.220
 would be more resistant to the age-related inflammation.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.060
 - I kind of lost you there.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.860
 - Since that's the protective enzyme,

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.620
 the ACE2 destroys angiotensin,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.720
 if you have a lot of it, you're like a young person.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.220
 Young people have more of that,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.080
 and so are less susceptible to the virus,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.140
 but also to age-related degenerative diseases.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:57.760
 - So why do you think there was so much going on

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.260
 in this Wuhan place?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.300
 I mean, can we conjecture that from where you sit?

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.620
 - What was the question?

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.300
 - Why was there so many people affected,

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.660
 like in this Wuhan city where--

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.900
 - Oh, well, have you heard about the military games?

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.100
 - Of course, yes, of course.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.700
 - Yeah, the American soldiers left

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.180
 exactly 14 days before the outbreak.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.140
 - Oh, I hadn't heard that, really?

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:33.060
 - South Korean and Taiwan virologists

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.820
 have traced the gene pattern back,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.180
 find that in the US,

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.380
 there are five different strains of the coronavirus.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.880
 The Wuhan strain is just one of those,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.780
 and they say logically,

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.900
 you can have derived the Wuhan

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.540
 from one of those pre-existing five strains,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:06.380
 but you wouldn't have, at this time,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:12.420
 five descendants, and the inheritance goes the other way,

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:17.460
 that the Wuhan strain is like a branch on the tree,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:24.580
 and the preceding varieties of the virus

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.380
 were existing in the US.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.140
 - Already. - Already.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.900
 - And many of us already have these guys in there, right?

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.740
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:41.260
 - And you know the CDC patented the coronavirus 17 years ago.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.240
 - Oh, they did, good for them.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.300
 - And research was being done at Fort Detrick,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:52.100
 supposedly creating pathogens

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.740
 to create vaccines to counter them.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.100
 So the suggestion has been made

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.060
 that there was an accidental release of that,

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:08.060
 and an article in Nature years ago said,

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:13.180
 people have been quoting,

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.740
 well, the recent comment on that old article

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.360
 was that people are citing this article

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.740
 to indicate that the virus originated

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.780
 at the Fort Detrick lab.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.900
 That couldn't be possible

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.900
 because it would incriminate Fort Detrick, basically.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.620
 - Sure, right, but it's possible, in your opinion,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.380
 that it was a bioweapon thing.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.180
 And I guess it could be very possible

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.260
 that this was a whole controlled release thing

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.660
 for all kinds of political reasons.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.660
 - Yeah, yeah, they shut down the lab in July or August,

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.900
 and then there was the epidemic of lung damage

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:05.540
 or pneumonia blamed on vaping poisons,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.540
 but then shortly after that, the Wuhan episode.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:15.780
 - So some of these strains were lab-created.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:21.180
 Does that pose a more substantial problem

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.560
 for the human immune system to deal with it

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.660
 if it's coming from outside of them?

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.780
 But it could be already in there anyway.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.660
 I'm kind of confused.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.660
 - Well, in the lab, you can accelerate

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:40.860
 evolutionary changes and make very improbable things

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.740
 that might never statistically happen in a living organism.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.180
 - Which makes it just not easy

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.060
 for the human body to work with it

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.420
 because evolution, you just kind of figure it out

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.340
 as you go with these viruses

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.540
 that are theoretically everywhere, right, these viruses?

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.540
 - Yeah, and in these labs, researching pathogens,

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.940
 creating pathogens to imagine an attack

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.020
 and how to create a vaccine to it,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:21.160
 the pathogens they create are more imaginative,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.500
 I think, than nature.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.340
 - Yeah, I mean, so I guess it's evident

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.980
 that somebody's gonna come out

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.460
 with a vaccine for this thing soon, right?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.820
 And they'll probably then want everybody to get it

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.300
 or sell it or--

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.700
 - Yeah, that's why the stock prices

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.260
 of that vaccine company have gone up so much

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.300
 because they say they're close to coming

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.820
 to the market with it.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.820
 But the trouble is that ever since before the swine flu,

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:03.700
 the guy that got fired for exposing

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.600
 the non-existence of the swine flu,

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.900
 he was warning that the whole thing is pointless

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.300
 because flu viruses mutate faster

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:22.220
 than you can create a vaccine and test it for safety.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.940
 So by the time you can show that a vaccine

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.660
 is effective and safe, there'll be no flu left to--

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.580
 - To do, to do anything with.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.420
 - Yeah.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:41.260
 - So, I mean, because you would have to make a flu virus

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.740
 a year before the flu season anyway, right?

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.660
 - Yeah, yeah, so if the lab was very clever,

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:54.660
 they could produce the disease a year ahead and then--

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.900
 - Put that one out there.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.740
 - Yeah.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.020
 - What do you think, there's been people around

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.420
 over the years that have conjectured

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.460
 that this HIV thing is not really a virus

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.420
 that you can see and it's just not there.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.900
 And there's a German Supreme Court

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.420
 that just uphold a biologist's claim,

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.460
 this article that we put on our website,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.460
 that measles virus does not exist.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.500
 It just doesn't exist.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.500
 - Yeah, but I've followed Peter Duisburg's argument closely

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.940
 now for 35 or 40 years.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.460
 He has never been proven wrong.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:38.340
 He lost his research grants and is now officially

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.460
 out of the science world because he persists

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.580
 with his evidence.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.020
 - And what evidence is that?

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.660
 Let's recap, what evidence has Duisburg said

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.940
 for the last 40 years?

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:59.380
 - He says it's the genetic DNA strip is a retrovirus.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:05.980
 He says it's a harmless retrovirus

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.620
 and we're full of such DNA.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.260
 When we're under stress, it shows up in the blood.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.520
 So you can have a blood test for it,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.780
 but all it's showing is that you're a stressed individual.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:25.140
 And that's just one of many pieces of DNA

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:31.540
 that shows up in this cloud.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.140
 At the time he was presenting his argument,

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.900
 this other information of microvesicles carrying DNA

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.420
 and RNA all through the body every time we're under stress.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.880
 That just wasn't known except to the acupuncture world.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:56.360
 But it's now a common knowledge that stress causes

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:01.240
 retrovirus material to explode into the bloodstream

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.360
 so you can find it and sell a blood test

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.920
 for just about anything you can imagine.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.020
 - So which follows then with some people,

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:15.480
 they go through this quote, flu season unquote,

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.660
 and they're stressed or worry and angst

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.880
 and they'll come up with something

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.840
 where somebody else won't because it's already there

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.780
 and it just manifests itself.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.780
 - Yeah, and people have tested blood samples taken

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:35.760
 in army recruits decades before anyone suggested

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.820
 that there was AIDS or HIV virus.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.080
 From the 1960s for example,

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:48.080
 and giving the standard DNA analysis to those blood samples,

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:55.800
 every year tested, half percent of the population

00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.100
 tested positive for AIDS.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:05.460
 Every year, as far back as they had blood samples,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.860
 0.5% has tested positive.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.140
 And more recently, when you go across

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.740
 and actually look at random blood samples,

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.400
 it's still half a percent is infected.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.380
 But if you pick out sick people,

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.440
 you'll find a very high percentage.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.580
 - So I guess it's possible, this is all conjecture,

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.280
 but the whole thing with the gay lifestyle

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.780
 could have been, I don't know,

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.900
 just fear and angst and maybe guilt.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.900
 - Peter Duisburg said it correlated exactly

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.940
 with their use of particular drugs.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.420
 The drug causes stress and causes the virus to come out

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.860
 as well as causing the sickness.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.240
 So there was a correspondence,

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.660
 but it was caused by drug use.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.740
 - Oh, by giving the drug to the people.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.660
 - Oh, yeah.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.420
 - Who tested positive.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.380
 - After the treatment came out,

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:17.060
 Duisburg said, "You're creating the virus

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.660
 "that you're treating."

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.340
 But before that, he correlated

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:26.820
 the Bay Area in particular.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.820
 There was a fad of using particular vasodilator drug

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.620
 for a pleasure experience.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.180
 - Yeah, like a poppers.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.140
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:41.980
 - Right, right.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.900
 And how did that tie into it

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.300
 with the gay community, with the poppers?

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:52.300
 - That particular drug creates a very intense

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.580
 stress reaction that causes the release

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.460
 of these retroviruses.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.780
 - So Duisburg argument, and you've been following him

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.620
 for 40 years, Duisburg?

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.940
 - Yeah, from his first arguments around 1982,

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.780
 I think it was.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.860
 - My goodness.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.620
 And so people that test positive,

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.560
 and that's a certain percentage,

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.060
 then they would take the AIDS drug

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.220
 and then that would blow the thing up.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:26.380
 Could they pass on this thing to somebody else

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.860
 through sexual encounters?

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:32.140
 Probably, I guess.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:37.140
 - The same way a mother passes on these microvesicles,

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.300
 it's a normal thing.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.140
 - To pass them.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.220
 - Whatever is circulating in your bloodstream

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.540
 to show up in the egg or the sperm.

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.380
 - Right.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.380
 Whoa.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.020
 Dr. Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone.

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.460
 Dr. Peat, stay right there.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.620
 We're gonna take a quick little break here.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:02.020
 Well, please tell folks about One Radio Network,

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.060
 'cause you heard the last show,

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.740
 and now this show, you hear things that are just different

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.780
 from what you hear around the rest of the world,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.860
 and we like that, because that's where we're trying

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.860
 to just keep digging and digging.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.700
 We're not saying that every guest has the truth,

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.140
 the whole truth, nothing but the truth,

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.860
 but it's up for you to make your own decision about that,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.380
 judge the people and their experience and where they've been

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.580
 and how this might fit into your life or not.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.300
 Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.980
 Previously with Peter Ragnar,

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.420
 who's a great example of staying young and healthy,

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.380
 we asked him what kinds of things he takes.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.380
 - Personally, for myself, I look at all of the supplements

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:51.020
 that help bolster and harmonize my hormones,

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:56.380
 and this is both for men and for women,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.740
 and when you go online,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.220
 there's so much information about that out there.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.260
 I've actually, I heard on one of your advertisements there,

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.100
 Patrick, about the pine pollen.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.900
 I personally take pine pollen,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.900
 which is, I think it's an amazing product,

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.660
 has an amazing effect upon the body.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.780
 - Peter, it's one of our favorites, too.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.780
 Pine pollen, any of these are Thrival Links.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.020
 You have the Pine Pollen Pure Potency, Pine Pollen Gold,

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.260
 and if you'd like to get it every month,

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.300
 the auto ship is the best price.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.260
 Also, Steven Buehner's book exclusively on pine pollen

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.940
 is right there on the site, too, Daniel's site,

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.300
 right here on oneradionetwork.com.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.820
 Brian Clement, who heads up

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.580
 the Hippocrates Institute in Florida,

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.300
 talked about saunas here.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.660
 Elke writes in for Brian Clement,

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.500
 "Would Brian give us some tips

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.500
 "on what supplements we would need to take

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.960
 "if we do saunas several times a week

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.940
 "to replenish lost minerals from sweating?"

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.700
 - Well, Dr. Rao, who you had on as a colleague and a friend,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.740
 we do often conferences together in Europe,

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.940
 and I agree, we have saunas here.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.380
 I take a sauna, so you know this,

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.540
 no matter where I travel in the world, 365 days a year.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.540
 I think it's mandatory.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.380
 - Really?

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.380
 - 87%, listen closely, 87% more heavy metals

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.660
 and chemicals come out in an infrared.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:21.060
 - Well, no wonder we feel better when we take these saunas.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.900
 We have to relax.

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.260
 - Yes, we do.

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:26.620
 And there's also scientific proof,

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.620
 if you believe in any kind of science,

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.940
 that you can do, say, a urine push.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.780
 In other words, you can do some ETDDA

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.820
 or something like that, and pee,

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:41.100
 and then test your metals that come out.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.340
 There could be some, you know, whatever,

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.140
 mercury or arsenic, stuff like that, lead.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.740
 And then you can do a far infrared sauna

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.500
 for about 30 minutes.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.780
 You do the test, the pee test again,

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.580
 and actually more of these guys come out

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:59.320
 through the kidneys, for sure.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.280
 And I would just conjecture, I guess,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.260
 then the feces as well.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.300
 So not only are we getting a lot of stuff

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.540
 out through the skin, but then, you know,

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.320
 the heavy metals which go in,

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.220
 this toxic stuff which has been shown to be in the fat,

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.620
 it'll come out the pee and poop as well.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.220
 So these things are really helpful for you to detoxify.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.900
 For what it's worth, I do one almost every day of my life.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.740
 I just do it.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.580
 They've been incredibly helpful for me

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.280
 to stay well and happy boy.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.100
 So if you'd like to get one,

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.780
 we have the Relax Far Infrared Sauna.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:39.040
 They're made in Taiwan, Medical University.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.940
 They've won several awards for the technology.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.880
 The far infrared rays, you sit in there,

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.420
 you see the picture.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.060
 If you're listening to the show on video this morning,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.480
 you see the picture there,

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.260
 and you can just email me and we'll give you one

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.260
 for $1,150, delivered lower 48,

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.380
 and we ship them all over the world,

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.820
 all over the world, the lower 48.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.820
 And if you live in the EU, for example,

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.620
 it'll come with the proper plug.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.700
 It'll just work just fine for you.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.540
 So that's the Relax Far Infrared Sauna.

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.860
 I think the retail is about 1,300 bucks.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.220
 I don't think you can calculate a dollar figure

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.900
 to what this, the goodness it can do for you

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.120
 to help detoxify whatever, you know,

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.860
 is going on around there and planet Earth,

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.020
 which is kind of strange these days.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.140
 So it's a great investment,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.880
 but you have to email me to get the deal

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.360
 'cause we can't put it in print.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.300
 Patrick at one radio network desk com.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.100
 Just a quick plug here on the AquaCare hydrogen machine.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.820
 Folks have been asking if they can get these

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.100
 shipped to Europe.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.500
 You see the picture here if you're listening on video.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.500
 Yes, you can.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.580
 George sent it with a little adapter.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.060
 So if you live in the EU, anywhere in Japan,

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.020
 this'll work for your particular plug.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.860
 They do ship them all over the world.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.440
 And the one year, no questions asked,

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.500
 money back guarantee for this hydrogen

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.660
 Browns gas producing machine works

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.860
 for the Promo Code One Radio.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:15.240
 And then the one year, no questions asked,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.720
 money back, and then a lifetime warranty

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.220
 just so you know on oneradionetwork.com.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.780
 You can click an order if you wanna get one of these guys

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.340
 and we think they're just really cool.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.820
 Just pretty amazing technology.

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:32.580
 And just email me if you have any questions

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.760
 or use promo code one radio on the machine.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.380
 - We are listener supported.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.380
 One Radio Network.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.540
 - We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.540
 And he's here the third Monday of each month

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.020
 at 1030 Central.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:52.540
 So we're real grateful you take the time to do this,

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.720
 Dr. Peat, thank you.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.920
 People really enjoy hearing from you.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.600
 You wanna do some emails?

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.600
 You wanna do some?

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.440
 - Okay.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.480
 - Okay.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.000
 Here is from Amy.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.520
 I broke three bones on my left shoulder on Friday,

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.240
 March 6, fractured the right knee.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.140
 I used Tabasco for topical pain relief.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.320
 It's working for me.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.520
 What can I do to aid in the speeding up of healing?

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.360
 I'm not planning on surgery.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.360
 Have you used any magnets, Dr. Peat?

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.420
 Have you ever used magnets?

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.660
 And what else can she put on this guy topically

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.200
 to help heal or internally?

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:31.840
 - The Tabasco idea is a traditional medical idea

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.020
 to increase circulation.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.480
 I think it does work.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:42.620
 Ultrasound, gentle, low energy, low frequency ultrasound

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:48.980
 greatly accelerates bone healing.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.980
 You can get a cheap apparatus for,

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:56.220
 I think, around $100.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.480
 - Yes, yes you can.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.340
 - And applying that a little bit every day

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.980
 does internally, it probably imitates

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.140
 the action of the Tabasco sauce.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:15.140
 And red light has a similar increase.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:22.020
 Open blood vessels and accelerate energy production

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.720
 and speed healing.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.280
 - Does it have to be some fancy red light

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.940
 with the particular, or it could just be the chicken lamps,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.660
 the ones that we use, right?

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.680
 - Yeah, sunlight is best because it increases

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.580
 your vitamin D, which is the other

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.060
 essential bone healing factor.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.140
 - Yeah, I was diagnosed with an X-ray

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:50.140
 with a little bone spur on C4, C5 kind of thing.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.300
 And one of the chiropractors recommended

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.660
 one of those ultrasound machines

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.700
 to help that whole thing just kind of normalize itself.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.100
 And I don't know, I think it was like 150 bucks.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.020
 It was really nice.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.860
 And they're easy to use too, aren't they?

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:11.860
 - Yeah, they accelerate wound healing in general.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.380
 Someone found that infected tonsils healed up

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.780
 when they put an ultrasound probe on them.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.140
 - Pretty interesting.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.340
 Here's an email.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.260
 Dr. Peat, you said that potatoes, rice,

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.460
 and hominy are good foods.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.320
 So does that mean that you don't care

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.100
 about the glycemic index or load

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.200
 that it may be on our body?

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:40.340
 - Yeah, I'm cautious about the starches.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:47.980
 Any starch, if you take it, even when it's well cooked,

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.020
 a load of starch can pass directly

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.500
 into your bloodstream.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.680
 In mouse experiments, they could show

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.800
 that any of the starches with grains

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.160
 ranging from five microns to 100 microns,

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.560
 all of those could pass through the wall

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.080
 of the intestine into the bloodstream

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.080
 unless there was a lot of fat and fiber taken with it.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:22.760
 Once these get into the bloodstream,

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.000
 the particles might be bigger than capillaries,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.320
 and depending on the size, they can plug blood vessels

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.220
 and cause tissue cells to be deprived of blood supply.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.560
 So I stopped eating most starches

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.240
 about 40 years ago when I read that research.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.800
 The research has been repeated many times now,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.800
 so it wasn't just one person's exceptional--

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.800
 - And so then what kind of foods did you drop out

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.560
 after believing this research to be accurate?

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.560
 - Rice, wheat, potatoes, primarily.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.080
 The only starch I eat now, hominy,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:16.080
 or tortillas made with the lime process

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.680
 called nixtamalized corn.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.400
 - Nixtamalized, yeah.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.840
 What's hominy?

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.400
 Of course, we've heard of hominy grits.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.100
 Can you actually buy hominy?

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.740
 That's kind of a, you could make a little cereal

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.320
 with butter or whatever and be good for you?

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.360
 Can you buy it?

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.560
 - Yeah, the lime breaks down the starch

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.480
 so that I had students experiment with it,

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.480
 and it didn't have any of those harmful effects

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.340
 that we could identify.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:50.520
 The lime also digests the protein,

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.800
 makes it more nutritious.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.840
 - Can you purchase hominy

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.300
 that's already been all limed up and ready to go?

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:02.200
 - Yeah, except the tanned, whole, wet hominy

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:08.000
 almost always comes with additives to keep it white,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.200
 and the sulfite can be dangerous for a lot of people.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.680
 - Can you buy organic, dry hominy that's been--

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you just cook it up.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.200
 It's the same as hominy grits, only in big pieces.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.840
 - And so generally, they've all been,

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.200
 that nixtamization thing has already been done?

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.200
 - Yeah, it isn't hominy unless it's been cooked in lime.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.840
 - Do you think that Bob's Red Mill guy,

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.280
 does he do hominy, the pretty good place

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.880
 that does these kind of products?

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.720
 You know him?

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.680
 - I don't know about it.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.160
 - But you can actually buy, if it's hominy,

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.440
 it's been, what's that word, nixtamized?

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.360
 - Nixtamalized.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:58.360
 - Nixtamalized, and that takes away the whole fat thing.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:04.680
 - It takes out most of the polyunsaturated fat,

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.860
 it increases the niacin content,

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.960
 and it predigests the starch to a great extent.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.440
 - Could that be part of the issue

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.480
 that all of the no-grain people

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.400
 are not really talking about,

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.880
 but could be an issue with people

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.840
 having a hard time with eating these grains?

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.880
 You know, the Gundry's with the lectins

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.760
 and all these people.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:31.720
 - Oh yeah, in the US Southern states,

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.820
 pellagra was a big problem,

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.240
 but because they were eating corn

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.640
 without the lime treatment,

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.960
 the Central Americans, Mexicans, South Americans,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.960
 Chinese, everyone for thousands of years

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.560
 were cooking their grains in ashes,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.560
 producing sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide,

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:06.960
 or burned limestone for the lime,

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.020
 and they were detoxifying their grains,

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:14.860
 but at the same time that would produce

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.860
 a lot of niacin and reduce the leucine content.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:28.040
 Without that, people were getting very sick with pellagra.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:36.520
 - Can you lead us to a concise, clear way

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.860
 that we can do this whole lime thing at home

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.960
 if we want to eat some of these starches?

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.960
 - Yeah, you can buy powdered lime at any,

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:54.360
 I think some of the big markets like Whole Foods

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.860
 are probably selling it now,

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.840
 but for sure at any Latino market.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.500
 - Powdered lime, right?

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:06.500
 - Yeah, and then if you want a big kettle,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 like a gallon of water, you put in maybe a pound or two

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.220
 of corn kernels and a big heaping tablespoon

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:26.660
 or two of the lime and boil it until the seeds swell up

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:33.140
 to about the size of an olive and get soft,

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:38.140
 and that's how many the cellulose coating

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:43.280
 separates from it at that time,

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.280
 so you can stir it and strain off the flaky material

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.200
 that isn't pleasant.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.840
 - And that's how they do it in Mexico, right?

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:57.520
 'Cause they kinda know, they kinda know

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.600
 that it works better for the body in tortillas.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.560
 - Yeah, and tastes much better.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.460
 It's interesting, ordinary bread,

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.880
 even if you chew it for quite a while,

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.760
 you don't notice the sweetness from your saliva acting on it

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:19.760
 but with a tortilla or hominy, in just about 30 seconds,

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.320
 you can taste the sweetness appearing.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.260
 - Interesting.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.240
 Can you, what if you liked to make your own bread

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.120
 and use some heirloom wheat like einkorn or something?

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.600
 Could you do the whole lime thing with that?

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.600
 - Yeah, someone has been emailing me from Italy

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.040
 trying the process on all the different

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:46.000
 old traditional grains, and she says they all work very well.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.200
 - So you could do the same thing,

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.280
 you do a gallon maybe of water,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.600
 a pound of the wheat berries, einkorn,

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.440
 would be the old traditional one,

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.640
 and you do the same thing with a tablespoon of lime

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.720
 and boil it, and then could then make your bread from that?

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.720
 - Yeah.

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:04.560
 - Wow, pretty cool, pretty cool.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.200
 You learned this down in Mexico, right,

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:08.640
 when you were down there for a long time?

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.480
 - Yeah.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:13.280
 - So you said fat and fiber,

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.000
 so what if you do a baked potato and put a lot of butter

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 and eat some fiber, some kind of psyllium

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.040
 or something like that, would that make it easier?

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.760
 - Well, the potato itself, especially if you eat

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.960
 the peeling, there's enough fiber in that

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.560
 if you have lots of cream or butter on it.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.600
 - Oh, so that helps it to be more digestible.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.440
 - Yeah.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.920
 - Yeah.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.560
 Dr. Peat, that's great stuff.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.920
 Dr. Peat, should we be worried about melatonin in our food?

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.800
 Melatonin in our food.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.240
 - No, not that I know of.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:51.400
 It can be toxic if you buy it in a pill

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.800
 and take outrageous doses.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.560
 10 milligrams, I think, can upset your hormones,

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.920
 but the physiological amount of melatonin,

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.840
 one milligram is safe.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:11.160
 - Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone,

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.680
 OneRadioNetwork.com, March 16th.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.300
 Please pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:19.000
 Dr. Peat, you recommended drinking kale broth,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.840
 but what about herbs such as tarragon or parsley

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.080
 or dill and so on?

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.640
 - Many of those are very full of allergens,

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:33.680
 so if you have any digestive problems

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.840
 or respiratory congestion, you should check

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:42.160
 your sensitivity to those foods.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.440
 - Here's another email.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.720
 You have mentioned that our teeth absorb calcium.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:51.840
 Would washing our mouths out with lime water

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.200
 help restore our enamel?

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.600
 Well, that's a good question.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.960
 - Yeah, superficial cavities, not cavities,

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:04.960
 but superficial imperfections

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.120
 will pick up calcium right out of the solution.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:15.360
 Calcium phosphate crystallizes right into the solution.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.880
 But the same lime solution you cook the corn in

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:28.240
 probably won't help except as a detergent effect.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:33.120
 Baking soda is a good detergent to clean,

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:39.080
 remove the starch or sugar particles.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.440
 But it needs the phosphate with the calcium

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.600
 for these repair processes in enamel defects.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.680
 - We've been promoting a product called Pearlseum,

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.960
 which is from real pearls, and they seem to do that.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.120
 I've seen it in my own teeth

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.400
 where it actually fills up little ridges.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.240
 'Cause it's the kind of calcium you said it works,

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.160
 and I forget the name of it.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.000
 - I think that's calcium carbonate.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.400
 - Calcium carbonate, right.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:12.720
 - Yeah, the first calcium to be laid down in the bones,

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.280
 for example, is calcium carbonate.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.280
 And then as it ages and matures, it takes up the phosphate.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.560
 - Wow, interesting.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.160
 Cody writes in from Florida, I was listening to the show,

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.160
 I heard Dr. Peat O mentioned that he doesn't eat potatoes.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.120
 I'm interested to know why.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.520
 And I think we covered that one, right?

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.360
 We've already covered the potato thing.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.360
 So even though potatoes with a lot of cream in the skins,

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.280
 you just still pass on those, knowing what you--

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.600
 - Yeah, mostly for the allergenic effect

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:49.400
 of that whole family, tomatoes, eggplant,

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.720
 bell peppers, for example.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.880
 - Oh, the whole nightshade thing,

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:56.200
 do you think there's something real with that?

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.840
 - Yeah, quite a few people

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.340
 have an allergic sensitivity to it.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:06.560
 - Dr. Ray, Peat, here's Beth in Norton, Illinois.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.000
 Do you have any theories on what would make a person

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.840
 susceptible to getting shingles

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.700
 or thoughts on how to prevent them, shingles?

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:22.880
 - Yeah, it's a stress breakout of the chickenpox virus

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:26.560
 of the herpes family.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:32.520
 And it's probably involving those micro particles

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:37.160
 that are shed by cells under stress.

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:42.160
 And aspirin, by reducing stress and inflammation,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:47.800
 all of the anti-inflammatory things

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.000
 help to prevent the cycling,

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.560
 recurring episodes of shingles.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:02.800
 Once it starts, then it just has to play out

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.280
 over a period of a week or so.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.200
 But during that time, if you do all of the anti-stress

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.200
 things, vitamin D, lots of milk and orange juice,

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:22.520
 some aspirin, vitamin K has some anti-inflammatory effects

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:27.680
 that protect the blood vessels.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.840
 - Good old aspirin does that.

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.920
 So I know some of my friends out of town

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.520
 who go to traditional doctors,

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.760
 they have them on these little aspirins

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.920
 for this or that.

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.920
 Not a bad idea then?

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.720
 - Yeah, aspirin actually has germicidal,

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.040
 antiviral properties.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:52.600
 There was a study done in Washington, D.C.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:57.600
 of AIDS patients, giving them big doses of aspirin.

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.680
 And they were improving.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:05.680
 And the study was called off despite the disappearance

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.240
 of the AIDS symptoms.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:15.600
 - But going back though, if these viruses,

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.920
 like you've been talking about and our first guest

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.080
 are really doing a lot of things they're supposed to do,

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:25.320
 what would be a situation where we wanna go in

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.160
 and try to kill them with this or that?

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:34.160
 I'm kind of confused with that idea.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.560
 - Kill which virus?

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.060
 - Yeah, kill the virus, right.

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:48.040
 - When your body can't integrate them,

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.880
 the body starts to disintegrate.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:55.340
 It's a matter of energy.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.240
 You can repair yourself and advance

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.000
 to the next stage of functioning

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.280
 if you have the energy to do it.

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.100
 But when you're just not using oxygen properly,

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.920
 so the things that create stress

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.400
 are those that block oxygen use

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.680
 and you end up producing lactic acid instead,

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:26.160
 wasting the glucose, making lactic acid.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.720
 And the lactic acid accelerates the process,

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:36.240
 producing inflammation and further reducing

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:41.100
 the ability to use oxygen because that process

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:45.980
 is part of wound healing, which is a reversion

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:50.980
 to a primitive, like in the first stages

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:57.360
 of growth of the fertilized egg.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.360
 It relies on a very energetic use of the energy supply,

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:11.280
 a wasteful use of oxygen to produce intensely fast growth.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:18.960
 The lactic acid production is good during wound healing,

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.160
 but for the whole organism, you want to get quickly

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.840
 out of that stage and back to oxygen use

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:30.000
 for full energy production.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 And with aging and accumulated toxins and such,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.640
 it becomes harder to restore the full oxidative metabolism

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.880
 so any little viral threat can become permanent.

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.360
 - So that's the argument for people in a weakened condition

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.520
 on meds and nursing homes and all that,

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.320
 that might be a case to go in and try to manipulate

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.640
 'cause they don't have the energy to deal with it.

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:07.640
 - Yeah, and carbon dioxide is what should be produced

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.960
 in producing energy rather than lactic acid.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:16.680
 One of the things that will make it easier

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:21.680
 for, for example, a wounded or sick or aged person

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:26.760
 to restore their energy is, for example,

00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:33.360
 bathing in carbon dioxide in a bathtub or a bag.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.480
 You absorb it through your skin,

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.880
 and that increased level of carbon dioxide

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.160
 turns off the inflammatory process,

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.520
 suppresses the wasteful production of lactic acid,

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:55.520
 and the reduced lactic acid tends to turn off

00:57:55.520 --> 00:58:00.240
 all of these virus release processes.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.480
 - And how do we, what do we put in the bath

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.360
 to do the whole thing through the skin

00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.080
 to create more carbon dioxide internally?

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:14.160
 - You absorb, they've known that in mineral springs

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.200
 that are rich in carbon dioxide and bicarbonates,

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:24.840
 the bicarbonate itself is turned in the surface of the skin

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:31.160
 into carbon dioxide and is absorbed into the skin

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:35.600
 even though the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:38.760
 is very high normally compared to the water

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.360
 you're bathing in.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.920
 The body has such an affinity for it,

00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:45.360
 it will pull it out of the water,

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:49.080
 converting bicarbonate to carbon dioxide at the surface

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.920
 and then absorbing the carbon dioxide.

00:58:51.920 --> 00:59:00.080
 The pure gas likewise enters the skin,

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.760
 dissolves in the body fluids very well.

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:08.000
 - So you're talking about actually putting baking soda

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:08.920
 in your bathtub?

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.440
 - Yeah, that traditional thing,

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.960
 a pound or so of baking soda

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:20.020
 and maybe some Epsom salts with it.

00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:25.020
 But both of those, the magnesium will be absorbed better

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:29.800
 for the bicarbonate that goes into the body with it.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.280
 - And that would be the argument too

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.240
 for a little bit of baking soda even internally

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.760
 if you want it.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:36.440
 - Yeah, and on the skin.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.760
 It's remarkably therapeutic.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.400
 - Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone,

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.880
 it is March 16th.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.480
 Please tell folks about our show here

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.760
 and we have a lot of very interesting people

00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.280
 as you can hear.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.600
 What does Dr. Peat from Chris in Canada

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.720
 think about hearing loss?

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.560
 My doctor said, well, we just kind of lose

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.800
 some of our hearing as we get older.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.320
 Is there anything I can do to reverse this?

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.460
 - Thyroid is the single most important thing.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:15.840
 There have been a couple of publications

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:20.120
 showing that high estrogen damages

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:25.120
 the hair cells in the hearing apparatus.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.480
 And I think prolactin along with the estrogen,

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.800
 you want to make sure those aren't elevated.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.280
 They tend to go up with aging.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:40.080
 And thyroid and vitamin D are among the things

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.760
 that prevent those types of damage

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.760
 to the apparatus of the inner ear.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.600
 - Larry writes in, 73, male, atherosclerosis,

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.360
 my left carotid, how do you say that?

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.960
 Carotid artery, how do you say it?

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.800
 C-A-R-T-I-D.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.640
 - Oh, carotid.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.080
 - Carotid artery, sorry.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.720
 100% occluded.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.160
 And a year ago, my right carotid was 70% occluded.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.080
 According to last week's ultrasound,

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.760
 my occlusion is getting worse

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.720
 and my doctor wants me to have an angiogram.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.160
 Does Dr. Peat have any suggestions

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:23.160
 for maybe non-invasive alternative tests and or issues?

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.780
 He said I've used liquid ETDA, vitamin D3,

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.940
 vitamin DK2, nanokinase, liposomal magnesium,

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.940
 and but that's not helped the condition.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:40.500
 - The process we were talking about

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.660
 in relation to the virus,

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.660
 the angiotensin system is at the root

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.540
 of the development of atherosclerosis.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:57.140
 And experiments in animals and people

01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:01.100
 show that you can reverse the process

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:05.620
 and start getting the plaques unloaded

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.220
 using the ACE inhibitors

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.100
 and the angiotensin receptor blockers.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.780
 - What's an ACE inhibitor?

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.260
 - Oh, the enzyme that makes angiotensin,

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.660
 the first approach they had was

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.660
 a molecule that blocks the function of that enzyme

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:29.060
 so you don't make angiotensin

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.460
 but it's more immediate and complete.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:38.460
 You can get 100% blockage of the receptor

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:45.460
 so the angiotensin stops having its harmful effect

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:49.620
 with the blocker, Losartan, for example.

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:55.340
 A recent, last week I think, article in Lancet magazine

01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:01.540
 by three European doctors researching lung function

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:06.180
 warned the public not to use Losartan

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.740
 as the Chinese had recommended.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:13.740
 And these European doctors, I think,

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:17.260
 failed to read enough of the research

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.180
 of the preceding 10 or 15 years

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:26.100
 because Losartan protects,

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:30.020
 the Chinese have good evidence that it's protective

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:34.780
 against the inflammatory processes of the virus

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:39.780
 but separate research, completely unrelated virus,

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:44.220
 shows that the molecules like Losartan

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.620
 help to reverse atherosclerosis.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:51.500
 Have a very general anti-inflammatory process,

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.860
 even migraine headaches,

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:57.140
 it's now recognized as a very helpful thing

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:01.300
 along with serotonin receptor blockers.

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:06.180
 Serotonin and angiotensin and histamine

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.700
 are very closely interactive with processes

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.660
 like migraine and atherosclerosis.

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.020
 - And is Losartan a pharmaceutical med?

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.860
 - Yeah, it's I think the cheapest of them

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:24.140
 and among the most effective.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.180
 - Can you buy like natural

01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:30.860
 or take natural ACE inhibitors or angiotensin guys?

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.580
 - Progesterone is, the body's natural,

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:39.580
 it lowers the receptor production

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.500
 so it's not as immediate and powerful

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:47.260
 as these pharmaceutical drugs but--

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.100
 - It works.

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.180
 - Yeah, it works.

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:51.540
 - So actually a progesterone cream even for a guy

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.520
 would help to de-plaque the body?

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:59.340
 - Yeah, slightly, not as powerfully.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.900
 - How about high dose vitamin C?

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.540
 We've often heard that that'll do it.

01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:04.860
 Any research showing that's true?

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:10.100
 - A little but it has its side effects too.

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.700
 - Too much, I mean what?

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:17.700
 - Yeah, the manufactured stuff is never absolutely clean

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:24.740
 and an experimenter using distilled water

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:29.860
 put a gram of reagent grade highest purity

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:32.140
 ascorbic acid into it and then put it

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:37.140
 in an electron spin resonance apparatus

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:42.140
 and showed it was as full of free radicals

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.380
 as a killing dose of x-rays.

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.440
 - Wow, really?

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.700
 Speaking of x-rays, if one does an x-ray

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.940
 or has to do or guys go out and do CT scans,

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.460
 are those things that we could, if we wanna do that,

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.180
 to minimize the ill effects of x-rays

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.620
 or it's just something that happens

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:05.500
 and will the body repair from any damage x-rays do?

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:10.860
 - All of the anti-inflammatory things do help.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.060
 - Do they?

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.580
 - Losartan included.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.420
 - Losartan.

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.940
 - It's protective against x-rays like progesterone.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.900
 - Even turmeric and things like aspirin, turmeric.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.940
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:28.860
 - Here is an email from Ty, 65 year old,

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:31.940
 taking two grains of natrithroid daily.

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.380
 He could foods have experiment with many approaches

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:39.580
 to reverse type two diabetes level.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.280
 Don't want sugar meds, some ideas of what I can do?

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:48.820
 - Well, vitamin D is helpful.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:53.820
 Vitamin K is another thing that helps to handle the calcium

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:58.720
 which helps to handle the sugar.

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.660
 Thyroid and vitamin D work so closely together

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:07.180
 that you can't really separate their effects.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:13.060
 - A little plug here for Sir Thrival, Daniel Vitalis,

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:18.060
 they have a vitamin D K2 product on through any Sir Thrival.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.840
 Link, very, very clean ingredients,

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.740
 nothing yucky in there, very good.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.420
 So you get the vitamin D and the K2 as well.

01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.300
 Some folks take these big doses of vitamin D

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.340
 and there's actually a company that's putting out

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.980
 a 50,000 kind of unit thing.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:39.980
 In general, how do folks kind of figure out a vitamin D

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.980
 dosage if they want to take extra vitamin D?

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.060
 - During the winter, 5,000 units a day

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:52.060
 is able to bring most people up into the middle of the range.

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:58.340
 50 nanograms per milliliter, 50 to 60

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.360
 is a good healthy range.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:05.940
 And for some reason, I guess doctors don't figure

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.020
 people are gonna take their daily vitamins

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:13.580
 so they like to prescribe these 50,000 unit doses

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.540
 once a month or once a week until

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:18.140
 the person gets the level up.

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:21.840
 - But would it actually hang in there all that time?

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.940
 I mean, 50,000?

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:27.980
 - Yeah, it's oil soluble so one dose

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:32.980
 will increase your blood level gradually

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:36.700
 because it goes first into your fat tissues

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.620
 and then is gradually assimilated

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.900
 into your circulating blood.

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.060
 - Downsides to having too much D?

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:53.300
 - Yeah, but it's highly exaggerated in the experiments.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:09:00.380
 It takes a million units a day for many days

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.980
 before you get the real calcification.

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.380
 But a lot of people try to discourage its use

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:14.380
 by saying that you can get calcified blood vessels

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.460
 with fairly moderate doses.

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:23.460
 But I think the biggest misunderstanding

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.980
 of vitamin D and calcium is that

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:32.580
 they think that the calcium you eat

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.620
 and the vitamin D are going to go right

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.380
 into your soft tissues.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:40.180
 But what causes calcification of the soft tissues

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.820
 is a failure of energy, exactly the--

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:43.660
 - Energy.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.380
 - Process that causes atherosclerosis

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:50.060
 and all of the inflammatory processes.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.620
 The parathyroid hormone and aldosterone,

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.620
 aldosterone is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.940
 system, increasing your blood pressure

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.940
 and all of the stress-related, virus-related conditions.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:17.300
 Parathyroid hormone and aldosterone collaborate

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.940
 to knock down your energy production

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.260
 and shift you over to lactic acid production.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:26.980
 Parathyroid hormone, its main function

01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:30.100
 is to pull calcium out of your bones

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:34.020
 for emergency use in the bloodstream.

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:39.020
 So when your aldosterone and parathyroid hormone are high,

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:43.980
 you will have increased blood calcium

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.140
 and the calcification of the soft tissues,

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:51.580
 which is a precursor to atherosclerosis

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.260
 and hardening of the arteries.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:59.340
 But if you lower your aldosterone and parathyroid hormone

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:03.260
 by having enough calcium and salt in your diet,

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.420
 lots of calcium in your diet,

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.860
 it can be thousands of milligrams a day,

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:12.380
 will tend not to calcify your arteries

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:15.220
 but to lower the parathyroid hormone

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:20.100
 along with vitamin D, lowering the parathyroid.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.060
 And when the parathyroid is lower,

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:28.060
 your mitochondria are able to work full speed

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:33.700
 to produce energy, which keeps calcium

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:37.100
 where it belongs in the bones, not in the blood vessels.

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.980
 So warning people not to eat calcium

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:42.420
 and restrict their vitamin D

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.940
 is exactly what's going to increase your blood calcium

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.420
 and your blood vessel calcification.

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:51.820
 - Whoa, so these dark greens are good, right?

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.340
 Collards and all kale cook these babies up, right?

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.860
 They're good for you.

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.420
 - Yeah, because they have the highest ratio

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.380
 of calcium and magnesium to phosphate.

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.380
 Phosphate, phosphorus in nuts, seeds, and meat and fish,

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:11.260
 the high phosphate to calcium ratio

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.560
 increases your parathyroid hormone,

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.420
 damages your bones,

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:21.220
 and puts the calcium into your blood vessels.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.620
 - Oh, and nuts, seeds, and meat.

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:25.100
 - Yeah, it's the high calcium.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.420
 - So are you making an argument

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.020
 for like just a vegetarian greens thing?

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.860
 - Well, it's best to let the cow eat the greens

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:37.060
 and then drink the milk and eat the cheese.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:43.020
 Because the cow has the apparatus to detoxify the greens.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:48.380
 The greens, the plant doesn't want its leaves to be eaten,

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:53.380
 so it puts irritants and digestion blockers into the leaves.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:59.340
 The leaves and seeds have defensive toxic chemicals

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:04.340
 to prevent being eaten by insects and cows.

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:09.700
 And so the cow has the extra stomach

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:14.700
 which favors the growth of microorganisms

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:20.260
 which destroy those toxins and release the amino acids

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:25.420
 and other nutrients to form the milk.

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.160
 So a cow is a detox factory.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:34.100
 - Have you ever had the Basque,

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.860
 I think it's sheep cheese, the Basque cheese, Bosphorus?

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:37.700
 - Oh yeah, I use it every day.

01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.180
 - Wow, man.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.140
 Is that the best ever cheese or what?

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.300
 - I like it.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:45.300
 - Wonderful.

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.140
 - I like almost all cheeses,

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.740
 but every day I do eat the sheep cheese.

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.500
 - That's funny, that's great.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.860
 Yeah, sheep cheese, good stuff.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.020
 Okay, let's go to the phones.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.780
 Good morning, you're on the air with Dr. Ray Peat.

01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.940
 Who's this?

01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.820
 - Hi, good morning.

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.500
 My name is Mo, I'm from Fort Worth, Texas.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.260
 Dr. Peat, thank you for being here for us.

01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:09.100
 I hadn't drunk orange juice in 20 years

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.540
 and after listening to your show,

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.660
 I started to drink the orange juice

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:15.940
 and for the first time in 25 years,

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.140
 my hands and feet for the last six months

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.180
 were nice and warm and now they are back to being cold.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.140
 So I don't know what the deal is here.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:31.140
 And also the first time my thyroid test came out 0.1

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:35.780
 and it was always two and three

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:39.420
 and the doctor kept saying it's normal, it's normal.

01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.700
 So I'm wondering what's going on

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.420
 and also I want to know about your formulation

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:47.740
 for progesterone cream.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.740
 Is it done by one company or the same formula?

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:54.700
 - Okay, let's do all those.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.620
 So you're saying that at first when you did the orange juice

01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:01.220
 then your hands got warmer and then they didn't

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:02.380
 and then you said the titer,

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:05.180
 you mean you're talking about your TSH?

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.020
 - Yeah.

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:08.380
 - Okay, your TSH went from where?

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:11.140
 - From two and three to 0.1.

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.620
 I was thrilled to be there.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:14.460
 - Well, that's good, right?

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.620
 It goes down, Dr. Peat, right?

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:17.980
 Her TSH went down, right?

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.580
 - Yeah, normally when you look at healthy people,

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:24.100
 they have the lowest TSH

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.260
 but also stress hormones can lower it.

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:31.340
 So if something caused your cortisol and adrenaline

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:33.020
 to go sharply up,

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:37.220
 that also could account for lowering the TSH.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:42.220
 So in that case, it's important to look at your temperature,

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:47.140
 heart rate and also if you have a blood test for T3,

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:51.380
 the T3 is the active hormone that produces the heat.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:57.620
 - How could the orange juice help her thyroid

01:15:57.620 --> 01:15:59.860
 must have started working better

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:02.500
 to get more circulation in her hands and feet?

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.020
 - It does contain, the reason I recommend it

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:11.020
 as a favorite carbohydrate is that it comes

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:16.220
 with many very powerful anti-inflammatory flavonoids,

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:24.220
 naringenin, nobiletin and a whole variety

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:28.780
 of very anti-inflammatory things

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.580
 that can help your thyroid work.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:37.060
 But when your hands suddenly get cold,

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:40.820
 it's very important to look for what's happening.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:44.260
 Sometimes it could be a calcium deficiency

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:47.500
 or a vitamin D deficiency interfering

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.780
 with energy production by increasing parathyroid hormone.

01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:56.380
 Not getting enough salt in your diet is another thing.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.060
 Salt and calcium work closely to hold down

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:03.940
 the aldosterone parathyroid system.

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:07.180
 - Wow, so it gets a little complicated.

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:11.420
 So you, my dear, you were interested in knowing

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.380
 something about a progesterone formula?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.420
 - Yeah, Dr. Ray Peat has.

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:21.820
 Where could I get it and are they all same,

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.220
 whichever company?

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.300
 - Yeah, he'll tell you here, just listen, okay?

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:30.260
 - Yeah, the formula I designed in the 1970s,

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:36.180
 progesterone in vitamin E and natural coconut oil,

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:44.260
 that has been made ever since by a company called Kenogen.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.060
 - Ketogen, keto?

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:51.060
 - Kenogen, yeah, the email is kenogen@gmail.com.

01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:55.660
 - Is that K-E-N like Nancy?

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:58.500
 - Yeah, K-E-N-O-G-E-N.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:01.100
 - And so that's just progesterone, vitamin E,

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:05.220
 and coconut oil, Kenogen, and you like that product

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.140
 'cause you developed the formula.

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.220
 - Yeah.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.260
 - And so there you go, does that help you?

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.260
 - Is it just that one company that does that,

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.380
 Ketogen, whatever?

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:18.620
 - Yeah, that's the same company

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:20.740
 that I licensed it to long ago.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.020
 - Oh.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.500
 - Okay, thank you so much.

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.340
 - You're quite welcome.

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.180
 - I appreciate all your help.

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.740
 - Wow, very interesting, Kenogen.

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:32.140
 So you believe that that's a better choice

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:35.540
 than just doing the progesterone cream a la carte,

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:38.060
 you know, like from the wild yams or something?

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:42.740
 - Yeah, if you wanted to use it on your skin,

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:47.740
 it spreads more easily if you add some coconut or olive oil

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.420
 because it has so much vitamin E in it

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.820
 that it's very viscous and can be diluted

01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:00.180
 with about an equal part of olive or coconut oil.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.540
 - Oh, cool.

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.220
 Here's one for you, boy, this is a new one.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.180
 I'm very interested, are there any movies

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.140
 that Dr. Peat found enjoyable or noteworthy

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:11.300
 as a positive experience for him?

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.120
 Also, any fiction books?

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:19.820
 - Oh, none, I would have to think about that.

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:26.140
 I have occasionally read fiction

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:28.940
 and now and then I see a good movie,

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:32.180
 but they aren't on the top of my head.

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.180
 - Nothing that comes to the top of your head.

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.860
 Doc, we ran a little late,

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:37.860
 can you stick around for a few more minutes?

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:38.700
 - Okay.

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:39.700
 - Okay, stay right there.

01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.300
 Yeah, guys, we normally end at noon

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.940
 and just keep 'em 90 minutes,

01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.540
 but we got a lot of emails and we got started late,

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:49.220
 so I'd like you to stay right there, please.

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.420
 Previously with the highly credentialed

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:56.140
 Dr. Thomas Levy, he argues because the literature shows

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.420
 that oxidation is the cause of disease.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:03.300
 - But the whole point is the location,

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.480
 the concentration, the duration,

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.500
 the distribution of oxidized biomolecules

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:14.220
 determines 100% of all diseases.

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.620
 And so that's why I say oxidative stress

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.900
 doesn't cause disease, oxidation is disease.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:20.860
 - Is disease.

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.700
 - If there's no oxidized biomolecules,

01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:24.820
 you don't have a toxin.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.700
 The toxic effect is oxidation of biomolecules.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:30.860
 That's the entirety of it.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.060
 - And by the grace of God, several months ago,

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.900
 George Wiseman said this about hydrogen.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:40.900
 - Hydrogen is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.280
 First of all, it's 700 times smaller

01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.140
 than something like CoQ10,

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.340
 400 times smaller than vitamin C, things like that.

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:52.500
 So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:54.780
 can literally go through everything in your body

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.260
 and go right into the very DNA and repair it.

01:20:57.260 --> 01:21:01.380
 - So now it makes sense why George was able to say this

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:05.180
 back in August, 2019, with such conviction.

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:08.640
 - The body accepts that gas

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:12.020
 and uses it to heal everything.

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.940
 It's like the fountain of youth.

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:17.020
 It's astonishing the amount of ailments.

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.540
 In fact, in scientific studies,

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.180
 and they have over a thousand scientific studies now,

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.340
 they are showing that it either helps the body heal directly

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.760
 or indirectly from virtually every ailment

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.180
 that ails any water-based life form.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:30.460
 - Okay, I'm sold.

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:32.420
 And I was able to get one a couple of months ago,

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.860
 thanks to your support.

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:36.940
 It's called the Aquacure Hydrogen Machine.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:39.320
 Breathe the gas and bubble the water.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.260
 There's a promo code OneRadio for 10% discount.

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.180
 I think a great investment for you,

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.180
 knowing what we know now.

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:48.420
 On OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.740
 About a year ago, I was in the throes

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.620
 of this little tummy karma thing that I've had,

01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:00.580
 and I was drinking just a whole lot of this pure,

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:04.620
 fresh, frozen aloe from one of our sponsors,

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:08.160
 Stockton Aloe One, and it was great,

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:11.600
 and it kept me kind of on track,

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.740
 but it really didn't heal the tummy,

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:17.260
 which, you know, there just had to be

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.460
 some kind of a gastritis thing going on,

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.980
 or ulcer or something.

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.420
 And, you know, I was very curious about that.

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:28.420
 And so, as of late, we found that there was

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:33.560
 some subluxation in C4-C5, which is directly tied in

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:37.820
 with the stomach and the vagus nerve,

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:42.820
 and that has been worked on over the last month,

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:45.300
 and now I'm back, I ordered three or four

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:50.300
 of the Stockton Aloe One, and just amazing, really.

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:56.100
 So, this aloe product can really heal things

01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:00.100
 in your tummy, all small intestine, things like that.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:05.100
 Now, I had this energy with the subluxation,

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:07.380
 and, you know, if you got the nerves pinched

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:09.580
 and all that, you know, the stomach is not gonna do

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.100
 much of anything except survive.

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.320
 So, it helped me survive, but it didn't heal,

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:15.540
 not like it's doing now, and I'm only doing

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.020
 two, three, four, five ounces a day,

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:22.340
 and wow, I'm just so grateful.

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.900
 So, this Stockton Aloe One, if you'd like to try some aloe,

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:29.900
 this is pure aloe, they just take out the meat,

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.260
 and then they put it in the bottle,

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:35.580
 and they flash, I can never say that,

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.820
 flash freeze it, and then that's it,

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:40.060
 and it comes in frozen, it's all packaged up

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:42.780
 in nice styrofoam, you just thaw out what you need,

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.780
 put it in a glass thing and drink it,

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.460
 and if you want some, there's no sodium benzoate,

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:52.180
 there's nothing in there except healing potential of aloe,

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:54.420
 and it's very, very powerful.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.900
 You can put this on your face, you can do

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.460
 a lot of stuff with it, but just drink it,

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.580
 and I would conjecture, and I'm just making it up,

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:04.940
 I don't know if it's true, but virtually anyone

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.340
 could have a good time with their stomach,

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.220
 their small and large intestine,

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:12.820
 to having aloe in your body, it's just pretty,

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.100
 pretty miraculous.

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.760
 and he's gonna give you the email here of how to do that,

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.260
 and then it's every other month for a year or so,

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.820
 and it's really a great price.

01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:58.180
 What's that newsletter, Doc, that email?

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.100
 - RayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:04.460
 - RayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:05.980
 What was your latest one on?

01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:07.860
 - It has an S, Ray Peat's.

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:10.300
 - Oh, Ray Peat's, Ray Peat's newsletter, yeah,

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.220
 we always put that on our front,

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.300
 we have a hot link there right on the show.

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.700
 What's your latest newsletter about?

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:21.500
 - Gilbert Ling's work, he died last fall,

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.880
 about a month short of 100 years.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.820
 He was one of my early influences in biology,

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:35.700
 my first couple of weeks in graduate school.

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:39.940
 I realized my professor was talking hot air

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.620
 and started reading the background

01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:48.620
 and found that every time he cited a source for his beliefs,

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.380
 if I read in the same journals,

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.500
 I found better contradictory work

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:58.700
 that had been published by Gilbert Ling,

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:03.700
 and so I contacted him and had been following his work

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.300
 steadily since 1968.

01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:12.940
 So this newsletter is explaining the meaning of his work

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:18.780
 and how a sort of insanity took over biological,

01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:28.020
 especially nerve function, electronic functions of cells.

01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:36.660
 He gave an actual clear, consistent explanation

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:40.580
 where all of the standard things

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:43.620
 that people are still pretty much talking about

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:47.320
 are essentially impossible fantasies.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.940
 - Very interesting.

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:52.300
 Here's an email from Joyce.

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:57.300
 I heard an old show with a guest that Patrick had on,

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:02.480
 Jonathan Wright, that suggested estriol, E-S-T-O-R-I-O-L,

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.860
 could actually be used topically on the face for wrinkles.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:11.520
 Does Dr. Peat think that's possible?

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:15.360
 - It makes the skin take up water,

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.440
 and so it will plump up the skin,

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:23.520
 but meanwhile, it's altering the collagen.

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:28.120
 Estriol is the weakest estrogen,

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.160
 10 times weaker than estradiol,

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:36.160
 but people need to use 10 times more to get the effect,

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.160
 and the effect is exactly the same as estradiol,

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.600
 the powerful, dangerous estrogen.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:49.120
 They like to use it.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.840
 I don't know if it's still practiced,

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:57.120
 but for many years, they used it on cattle

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.320
 because it made them take up water.

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.320
 - Wow.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.240
 - When they started doing that, a steak,

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.240
 when you put it on a frying pan, it tends to exude water,

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.080
 and so it boils instead of frying,

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.760
 but estrogen does that to your skin, too.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.720
 It makes it swell up with water,

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.040
 and so it looks smooth and shiny.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.480
 - Is that good?

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.320
 - No.

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.000
 - Oh, it's not good.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.080
 So you don't want to put estriol on your skin.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.960
 It's just not a good idea.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:29.800
 - Yeah.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:30.640
 - Okay.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.680
 - It's pro-aging.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.640
 My dissertation was on the age-accelerating effects

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:36.920
 of estrogen.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.600
 - Oh, you don't want to do that.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:42.200
 And estrogen is what we get from, what, soybeans

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.840
 and things like that, correct?

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.680
 - Yeah.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.240
 - So we don't like those guys.

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.480
 I'd like to know what soap Dr. Peat uses.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.000
 Many of the natural soaps are full of Pufus.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.880
 - No, I use pure coconut soap.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.560
 - Coconut soap, yeah, yeah.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.880
 I have two questions.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.840
 This one is from Mary.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.760
 Can Dr. Peat talk about physiologic role

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.760
 of norepinephrine and noradrenaline?

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.040
 Wow.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:19.360
 - The adrenaline system has been maligned

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.680
 it's the fight or flight immediate response

01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:32.120
 stress hormone, but it does activate

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:36.920
 other stress hormones, cortisol and so on.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.920
 So it can, if it persists, it can be harmful.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:46.920
 But the history of it maligning that has led people

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:53.440
 to overemphasize the opposite parasympathetic

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:59.200
 part of the nervous system, which with severe stress

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:05.080
 and aging, the parasympathetic overtakes the other side

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:09.940
 and creates the degenerative processes.

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:16.080
 So things that momentarily increase the epinephrine

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:22.880
 or adrenaline side can be very, very helpful

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:28.520
 if they are stopped soon enough.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.520
 And sugar and salt happen to be two of the nutrients

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:40.280
 that will limit uncontrolled production

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.680
 of the adrenaline system.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.800
 Thyroid, I've seen hypothyroid people

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:51.800
 who had just hour after hour,

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:57.800
 their blood would be saturated with as much as 40 times

01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:02.040
 the normal level of adrenaline compensating

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.140
 for the low thyroid function.

01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:08.720
 And so when you first take thyroid,

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.440
 if you have been overproducing adrenaline,

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:17.440
 you will experience a stress, speedy adrenaline reaction.

01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:21.160
 People think that's the thyroid action,

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:25.300
 but actually the thyroid has a relaxing function.

01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:27.600
 You have to adapt to it gradually

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:32.600
 by getting your adrenaline under control.

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:38.720
 And having a sugary and salty foods

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.560
 while you're adjusting to your thyroid

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:44.560
 will let you keep the adrenaline under control.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:49.400
 And then when your thyroid function is good,

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.360
 adrenaline is all good.

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.360
 It speeds your thinking

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:59.360
 and does everything helpful for adaptation.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:03.240
 It's just the overproduction of it,

01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:07.720
 usually from hypothyroidism, that becomes a stress problem.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:08.560
 - Very good.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:12.160
 Thomas says mid-40s always had leg cramps

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:13.260
 for many, many years.

01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:16.040
 And he said he would notice that sweet or salty

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.160
 in the evening would exacerbate it.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.820
 And then he figured out that having lots of water

01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:24.280
 before he went to bed would really calm it all down.

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.540
 And he wanted to know what could be going on

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:30.480
 and why do people get cramps mainly at night

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.540
 when they are lying horizontally?

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:39.640
 - The parasympathetic system turns on when you lie down.

01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.480
 - Right.

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.240
 - Your adrenaline goes down.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:47.360
 And that's the sort of thing I was just talking about.

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.920
 Parasympathetic goes up at night.

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.320
 And with age in particular,

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.280
 the parasympathetic starts overpowering

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.360
 the adrenaline system.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.520
 And during the night,

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:05.580
 that causes your blood sugar to go down.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:12.000
 And the falling blood sugar turns on other stress hormones.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.360
 And you go into various,

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:25.200
 asthma can occur primarily at night.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.720
 And even epileptic seizures can be triggered

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.920
 by that parasympathetic dominance

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.780
 lowering your blood sugar.

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:40.240
 - But parasympathetic is better at night.

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:42.720
 It's more to relax in the sleep, right?

01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:47.720
 - Yeah, normally that happens with young people.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:53.240
 But with old age, it exacerbates the problems of aging.

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:02.760
 I think thyroid hormone deficiency

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:07.760
 is part of that age-related sleep problem.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.960
 - Interesting.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:10.880
 Here's an email for you.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.320
 Can pneumonia be treated at home,

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.240
 for example, with food or coffee or niacinamide,

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.800
 red light or watching funny movies?

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.840
 That's funny.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.800
 What do you think about that?

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:26.160
 - Pneumonia, it's usually produced,

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:31.160
 most often produced by inflammatory signals

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:37.020
 that they can come from your intestine or from germs,

01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.820
 but anti-inflammatory things,

01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:46.320
 chicken soup, a source of salt and gelatin, for example,

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:52.680
 orange juice, milk and ice cream,

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:56.260
 all of these can help reduce inflammation.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:02.480
 Aspirin, Losartan, the thing I mentioned

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:07.280
 for angiotensin opposition,

01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:13.840
 that has been used for treating pneumonia,

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:15.800
 among other things.

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.640
 - Interesting.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.640
 Which potato has the most ketones, red, yukon or russet?

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.160
 - The red potatoes are usually higher in water content.

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:35.760
 The russet, I think, has the best nutrition.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.960
 Technically, you could find the nutrients in the yukon,

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.440
 but I think they're the ones

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:47.080
 with the yellow carotene content.

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.080
 They are harder to digest

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.440
 because the carotene interferes

01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:55.680
 with the breakdown of the starch.

01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:57.720
 - Linda wants to know if you can talk

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.320
 about the Scandinavians, how they cook fish in lye,

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.100
 like lute fish, is there health benefits?

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:07.360
 - I don't think there's any.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.640
 I think it was just a preservative thing,

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:14.520
 keeping fish in storage.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.340
 - Amy wants to know, will charcoal help with virus?

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:23.340
 - If you have a bad intestinal situation,

01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:28.980
 charcoal, I think the best approach

01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:31.620
 is to have a daily carrot.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:35.740
 Carrot salad, for example, will clean your intestine

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:38.860
 and remove antithyroid factors.

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:40.460
 - Oh, that's the one where you put,

01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:43.420
 what do you do, Doc, you put a little bit of vinegar

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.020
 and coconut oil in there?

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:45.860
 No carrots?

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.780
 - And salt.

01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:47.700
 - Salt?

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.980
 - Yeah.

01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:51.380
 - Of course, salt, gotta have salt.

01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:55.300
 What does Dr. Peat think about mixing magnesium carbonate

01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:58.500
 with vinegar and calcium gluconate

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:02.700
 to improve the absorption of the calcium and magnesium?

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:09.460
 Mixing magnesium carbonate with vinegar

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.140
 and calcium gluconate.

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:15.340
 - Magnesium carbonate, first of all,

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:20.340
 a lot of people are sensitive to some impurity

01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:24.020
 in most of the products that I've seen.

01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:29.020
 I used to use it regularly as a magnesium supplement,

01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:33.020
 but I've had very bad headaches from it,

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.540
 and lots of people experience that.

01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:39.980
 So you have to be cautious with any of those pure chemicals.

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.620
 Nancy wants to know, is there any way

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:45.340
 to make the valves in my legs work again?

01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:48.940
 I've been diagnosed with venous reflux disease

01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:52.380
 and so fearful of having the procedure done,

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.980
 I'm doing support stockings.

01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.180
 Anything I can do?

01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:59.620
 - The stockings are definitely helpful,

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:04.620
 but the cause of it is usually a hormone imbalance,

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:11.020
 high estrogen in relation to DHEA,

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:14.180
 pregnenolone, progesterone, and testosterone.

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:20.300
 The bad ratio of estrogen weakens the wall of the veins

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:26.300
 and lets them balloon and tend to form clots.

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:30.940
 So checking your hormones,

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:33.660
 making sure that your thyroid is good,

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.780
 that's usually deficient,

01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:40.180
 causing the high estrogen

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:44.420
 to the progesterone and androgen ratio.

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:49.280
 - Couple more here, then we'll let you go to work.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.500
 Okay.

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:55.940
 Does Ray, (laughs)

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:57.660
 boy, you guys are getting clever this morning.

01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:00.620
 Does Ray Peat, this is from Matthias,

01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:02.480
 does Ray Peat believe in God?

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:08.040
 - It depends on how you define it.

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:13.040
 I'm sort of a fan of the process theology.

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:16.880
 If you Google that,

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:21.680
 you can find one of the most famous

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.240
 current process theologists.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.680
 They're basing their thinking on Alfred North Whitehead,

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.800
 who was one of my philosophical influences.

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:38.680
 Whitehead made himself unpopular among philosophers

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:40.340
 by using the word God.

01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:46.200
 But if you read the process theology

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:52.720
 based on Whitehead, you'll get an idea of my approach.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.160
 - Dr. Peat, I love your shows.

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:57.600
 This is from Paula in Scottsdale, Arizona.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:00.440
 My dentist used a cone beam x-ray

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:03.080
 and told me I have a cavitation in my jaw

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.640
 from a tooth that was extracted 40 years ago.

01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.900
 He said about 95% of all extractions

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:09.920
 end up with some cavitations.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.920
 I've never had any pain or tenderness there in my mouth,

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.880
 but he wants to do surgery

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.040
 and scrape and clean out it properly.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.880
 It'd be pretty expensive.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.840
 Expensive, I'm wondering if this is really needed.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.600
 - No, I don't think it is.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:30.600
 If there's no pain, there's almost certainly no infection.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:34.200
 When you pull a tooth,

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.240
 sometimes the bone doesn't fill in the hole.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.800
 No problem there.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.400
 - You don't believe there's a problem there?

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:41.240
 - No.

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.080
 - Okay.

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.640
 Cavitations.

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:50.480
 What is Dr. Peat's opinion on eating organic Adami soy?

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.800
 Is the estrogen too much?

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:56.680
 Or if eaten in moderation, would it be okay, Adami soy?

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:02.960
 - I think it's okay as a condiment in very limited amounts.

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:10.720
 For example, soy sauce, I think it's safe

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.440
 to use occasionally in a small amount.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.400
 But the more, for example, in Hawaii,

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:21.760
 there was a study of people who ate tofu

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:23.140
 and those who didn't,

01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:27.320
 and dementia was higher in the tofu eaters.

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:29.760
 - Dementia was higher in the tofu eaters?

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:30.960
 - Yeah.

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.640
 - What's that about, I wonder?

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.200
 Is it just the estrogen?

01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:35.400
 - Yeah.

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:38.520
 I think a poor diet in general

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:43.520
 because tofu isn't a very complete nutrient.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:47.640
 Another study in China found that milk drinkers

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:51.560
 had much lower incidence of dementia.

01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.720
 High quality protein and anti-inflammatory

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:57.360
 properties of the milk.

01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.200
 - What about tempeh?

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.520
 You get organic tempeh.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.400
 Reasonable food or staple?

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:06.120
 - In moderation, just for a pleasure food,

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.440
 but not a staple.

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:10.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:11.880
 Final one, you'll like this one.

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.360
 After my husband started massaging my lower legs,

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:17.040
 it seems like the healing kicked in overdrive,

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.720
 swelling reduced immediately,

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.240
 and now I've been able to walk carefully again.

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.280
 Is there a correlation?

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:24.360
 - Oh, sure.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.200
 - Of course.

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.400
 Love heals everything, right?

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.560
 Your husband massaged your legs.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.640
 I mean, how could you not feel better, right?

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:32.480
 - Yep.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:33.320
 - Yeah, boy.

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:35.520
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for being here.

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.360
 We had a great time,

01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.520
 and I was really appreciating the virus stuff early on.

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.400
 Let us know if there's anything we can do.

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.280
 If you'd like to visit Dr. Peat's website,

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.480
 it is raypeat.com.

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:47.760
 You can look in our archives.

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.160
 We've had him on the show quite a few times.

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:52.400
 Just put Ray Peat in the search function,

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.440
 top right of One Radio Network,

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:58.360
 and pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.680
 All right, my friend, thank you, sir.

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.880
 You take care of yourself,

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.800
 and we'll talk to you next month, okay?

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:04.920
 - Okay, thank you.

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.760
 - Yes, sir.

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:06.600
 Bye-bye.

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.960
 Dr. Ray Peat, he's a good one, huh?

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.200
 Well, boy, we covered a lot of territory today.

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.560
 Appreciate your ongoing support of what we do here.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:18.980
 Let us know if there's anything that we can do.

01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:23.980
 My email is patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.840
 You can like us on the YouTube thing or Facebook,

01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:29.080
 and it passes on the different,

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:30.800
 even though we're just doing audio right now

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.920
 till we get the video thing all straight,

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.600
 it still passes on these links to other people

01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:36.800
 and helps to spread the word.

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.640
 Also, do the thing on YouTube

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.200
 or subscribe to our UbiTubi channel.

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:43.720
 And once we get the whole video thing straight

01:43:43.720 --> 01:43:45.880
 where the lips are synced up with the sound,

01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:49.540
 we'll go back to putting some guests on cameras

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:50.940
 that wanna be on camera.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:52.780
 Dr. Peat doesn't do the camera thing anyway,

01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:55.060
 so we just have to go with the picture.

01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:58.360
 So that's that.

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.940
 What are we gonna do Wednesday?

01:44:00.940 --> 01:44:06.760
 I've reached out to Dr. Cowan to see if he will do,

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.060
 asked him to do a little show with us,

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:13.060
 a special show on the whole coronavirus 5G thing

01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:17.320
 that we put the video on our front page.

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.820
 So we'll see if that's,

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:24.600
 we'll see if he responds to that.

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:29.600
 We have Richard Olry on Wednesday,

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:33.040
 and we're gonna go over my hair analysis.

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.560
 He's gonna do a whole thing on how the hair analysis works

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.720
 and how you might use that technology to help you.

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.900
 A co-founder of Health Choice, he's a cool guy,

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:51.900
 Mark Blacksell will be here on Wednesday as well.

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:56.820
 So we're out there and we have interview requests

01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:57.940
 out all over the world,

01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:00.020
 and if we get something that pops in

01:45:00.020 --> 01:45:01.500
 and we just do the interview,

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.940
 so just keep in touch with One Radio Network.

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:06.900
 And if you might hear some shows just kinda pop in,

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.860
 looks just like we did the other day with one of 'em.

01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:12.140
 Don't even recall which one.

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:13.980
 Anyway, I love you all very much.

01:45:13.980 --> 01:45:15.900
 Thanks for being here.

01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:18.260
 Appreciate your ongoing support,

01:45:18.260 --> 01:45:21.060
 and we appreciate you very much.

01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:24.420
 And I love you, and I'll see you.

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:25.780
 May the blessings be.
