00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.240
 - Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.960
 Know the source, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.440
 - Well, a very pleasant good morning to you.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.240
 This is Patrick Timpani.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.880
 Welcome to our second show.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.600
 Sorry we couldn't finish up the show

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.000
 with Richard Massey earlier,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.320
 but somebody's internet was not happening

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.920
 and we couldn't even do the audio thing,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.560
 so we had to wrap it up early.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 But Dr. Peat's on the phone here,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.880
 so we should be able to venture through

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 regardless of what happens on the internet.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.040
 And at the very worst, we'll have the recording for you.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 We're kind of doing things differently moving forward.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.800
 We've been censored and deleted from YouTube and from Vimeo

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 and some of the other ones are not working for us yet,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520
 Gap or BitChute, we're trying to figure out.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.160
 And so we're just going to really focus in on the audio shows,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.120
 make sure we have those for you,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.720
 which is all the counts, right?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.640
 You know what I look like

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280
 and you know what Ray P looks like

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.480
 and what does it matter?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.680
 So that's where we're heading

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440
 and we're just going to be able to deliver

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.080
 good high quality shows,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 and at least with the audio.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.680
 And we're playing around with some video ideas

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.240
 to be able to put them up on some places

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.920
 with just a slide, but be that as it may,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.080
 we are focusing on just to make sure

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.240
 we have the highest quality,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.200
 the best people that could ask the best questions

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.840
 so you can learn some things

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.640
 about what's going on in the world

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.600
 from some very interesting people like Ray P,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.120
 who you'll meet here in a minute.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.360
 Dr. Christopher Exley, he is going to be on tomorrow.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.280
 Dr. Exley probably knows more about aluminum

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.660
 than most people in the world, really good guy.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.040
 Richard Lyons-Weiler, who participated

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.640
 in that 13 year study in the Northwest

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.360
 up near Dr. Peat, where they were really looking

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.120
 at the health of unvaccinated

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.440
 and vaccinated children, a great study.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.280
 And Dr. Weiler was on the show talking about it,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.960
 find it in the audio archives a couple of weeks ago.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.560
 And he suggested that mercury was one

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.920
 of the real, real bugaboos in these vaccines.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.320
 I'm sorry, aluminum, aluminum.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.760
 So because of that, we contacted Dr. Exley

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.480
 and he's gonna be on tomorrow.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.720
 Judy Mickiewicz is gonna be here on Wednesday.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.520
 She was involved with Fauci

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.880
 and this whole HIV scam way, way back.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.640
 And she says there was never any HIV virus.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.480
 It was just all a big scam.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.600
 We'll see about that.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.000
 Charlie Sewell is gonna be here

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.360
 and he'll be here also on Wednesday.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.280
 Probably have some time with this alleged inauguration.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.360
 We'll see if that happens as planned.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.320
 And there's some very strange things going on there

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.720
 that you don't even wanna think about

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.800
 or you'll probably learn about.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.120
 We'll see.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.080
 But anyway, Charlie is a great researcher.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.320
 I've known him for probably 20 years.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.320
 And he says there are some real specific, legal,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.880
 powerful things you can do

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.880
 to hold elected officials accountable

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.760
 that are invading your life in one way or another,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.360
 which is very timely these days.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.880
 And you can find out this

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.520
 and you haven't heard this anywhere

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.280
 on the internet anywhere,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.000
 except you'll hear it here on Wednesday.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.880
 On the third Wednesday, Monday of the month, rather,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.640
 Dr. Ray Peat is kind enough to come by.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.480
 He's a good man.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.640
 He's been around a long time,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.520
 a little over 80 revolutions around the sun.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.120
 PhD in biology, University of Oregon.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.400
 He specialized in physiology.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.200
 He taught at the University of Oregon,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.480
 a lot of different places.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.800
 He also conducted,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.400
 he does an anymore nutritional counseling, private.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.920
 He started his work with progesterone

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.400
 and related hormones in '68,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 and papers in physiology, chemistry, and physics, '71 and '72.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.760
 His dissertation, in the dissertation,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.000
 he outlined his ideas regarding progesterone

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.640
 and the hormones closely related to it

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.040
 as protectors of the body's structure and energy

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.720
 against the harmful effects of estrogen,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.880
 radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880
 Pretty cool.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.600
 He has rayPeatsnewsletter.com,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.480
 rayPeatsnewsletter, gmail.com,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.560
 and we'll tell you more about that if you wanna get it.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.280
 And so he's on the phone.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.160
 Dr. Peat, a very pleasant good morning to you, sir.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.640
 - Good morning.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.520
 It's good to hear you're having actually on,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.520
 and that made me suppose that you might find someone

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.320
 to talk about the adjuvant quality of the lipids

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.320
 that they're using in the RNA so-called vaccine.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.080
 - The adjuvant quality of the lipids

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.840
 that they're using in this so-called vaccine?

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.840
 - Yeah, when I Googled the names of those lipids,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.080
 a company came up which sells supposedly

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.040
 those or similar lipids as a vehicle

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.440
 or a carrier medium for introducing drugs,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.880
 but they've been selling them the very same lipids

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.200
 for years as adjuvants.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:06.360
 So it seems to me that Pfizer is using them nominally

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.440
 as a mere carrier for the RNA,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.440
 but conveniently, they're lipids that function as adjuvants,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:27.520
 so they leave out the aluminum,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.580
 which actually we'll explain,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.560
 and put in something which is possibly even worse

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.400
 for creating inflammation in the whole body.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.120
 - Well, so I should ask him about the adjuvants quality,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.000
 or the lipid quality of the adjuvants, is that right?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.080
 That's what I really wanna ask him about

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.360
 to explain what he knows.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.360
 - Well, that would, the best explanation

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.800
 would require a lipid specialist.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.640
 - I see.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.640
 - It's an extremely specialized branch of lipids.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:19.080
 I'm sure there are people who know about it

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.840
 who would be glad to talk,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.840
 but I haven't even looked for those people.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.960
 - Right.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.460
 Have you been able to look at these so-called vaccines

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.920
 for the corona and really determine

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.880
 what could be going on here that is not good?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.200
 I mean, we're hearing reports of people getting sick

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.760
 and dying, and what can you tell us

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.380
 what you've seen with your research?

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:51.800
 - It's an opportunity for Pfizer to lie and deceive.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:08:00.920
 Immediately when the doctor Gregory Michael

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.760
 died of an absence of blood platelets,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:13.640
 after he got sick, the automatic blood analyzer

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.960
 reported zero platelets, and they thought

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.120
 that must be a mistake, so they counted by hand

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.120
 and found one platelet in the batch instead of hundreds.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.480
 And then Pfizer said that there's no reason

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.380
 to believe that there could be a connection

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:44.000
 between failure of platelet production and vaccine,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.200
 but the government has already compensated people

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:57.120
 for other vaccines causing that fatal disease.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.880
 And the substance PEG in other vaccines

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:13.520
 seems to be responsible for creating the immune reaction

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.160
 that kills the platelet system.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.400
 And the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.880
 is the one that has been most incriminating.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.360
 - Really?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.520
 So even those childhood vaccines

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.200
 that they give really generously to young kids,

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.800
 it's doing something negative to their platelets.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.840
 - Yeah, someone familiar with that situation says

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.840
 that between one in 25,000 and one in 40,000

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.640
 people vaccinated develop the platelet deficiency.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.120
 And when you have tens of millions of people vaccinated,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.280
 that starts being a lot of seriously,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.040
 often fatally damaged people.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.400
 - Yeah.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.440
 Dr. Ray Peat is here.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.940
 It is Monday morning, January 18th.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.560
 And if you'd like to ask a question,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.680
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.320
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.960
 We posted a video of Dr. Thomas Cowan, MD,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.840
 on this whole RNA stuff that's going on in these vaccines.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.480
 And I sent it to you,

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.720
 and he also had some things to say about the virus

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.640
 that he's still not a germ theory guy whatsoever.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.400
 I sent that to you,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.280
 and I think a lot of our listeners must have watched it.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.960
 We had it up for about a week.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.840
 Can you talk about what you think is going on with that

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.680
 and value or things that you may agree or disagree

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.040
 with Cowan on his video that he had up?

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.080
 - I basically agree that the terrain

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.080
 is the important thing.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:20.200
 The so-called pathogenic agent

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.200
 has to find a receptive terrain.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.200
 And it happens that about 90% of current population

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:39.040
 doesn't present a terrain for a pathogen like that to grow in.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.760
 But some of the things that affect the terrain

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.120
 are vaccinations.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:53.120
 For example, people who've had an influenza vaccination

00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.480
 are much more likely to, the following year,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.640
 develop a coronavirus condition rather than influenza.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.920
 And the world figures for influenza

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.400
 show a practically complete disappearance

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.640
 of influenza around the world.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.800
 But the best fudged claims for effectiveness

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:36.160
 are around 50% for the influenza vaccine.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.240
 Some of them claim higher,

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.040
 but some people have pointed out

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.040
 that they're changing definitions

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.560
 to get that high result.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.160
 And I think it's about 10 different studies

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.160
 that have shown the year after an influenza vaccination,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:06.640
 the incidence of corona infections

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.800
 and other conditions is much higher.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 So vaccines are one of the things

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.160
 that prepares the terrain for the problems,

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:27.000
 such as pneumonia.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.080
 - So you talk about the terrain

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.760
 and then this corona experience.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.760
 So are you suggesting then that the person's terrain

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:43.040
 determines whether or not they have some kind of symptoms

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.320
 or some kind of illness called corona

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.720
 from a virus that is in fact circulating

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.720
 that can be given to one another, transport?

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.200
 - Well, even that isn't very clear

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.200
 because they haven't done thorough studies of coronaviruses.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.520
 It might be common cold viruses

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.200
 from the people have had repeatedly over the years.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.240
 And like a common cold,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.680
 there have been very few people

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.680
 who caught the apparent coronavirus twice,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.160
 but that's like one in a million.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.160
 It isn't as interactive

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.120
 as the common cold by that appearance.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.280
 - Yeah.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.680
 One of the videos that Dr. Kammen talked about,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.400
 he suggested there'd been time and time again

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.320
 that they've actually tried to,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.640
 to Dr. Peat exchange say snot or saliva

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.720
 of somebody with flu symptoms

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.840
 and putting it into another person.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.000
 And they've never really been able

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.880
 to make it appear in that person.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.720
 - Yeah.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.480
 With influenza,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:16.320
 I think the studies I know of were in animals

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.520
 and in lab cultures.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.080
 So they can clearly demonstrate

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.960
 that it transfers from one animal to another.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.400
 They don't want to give the full influenza

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.920
 to a person,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.000
 but with human cells in culture,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.600
 they can also get infection from the same virus

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:47.600
 that they're transmitting from one animal to another.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.040
 - In culture, and Kammen argues though,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.840
 just because it's in culture in a plate

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.040
 doesn't mean it happens between humans.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.360
 - No, it isn't absolute proof.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.440
 That's very rare anywhere in science.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.200
 - Is there a proof about anything in science

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.280
 that we know for sure?

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:14.200
 - No, the practical aspect

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.120
 is the best we have.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.560
 Not absolute logical truth,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.560
 the way Fauci and almost everyone in government

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.760
 is treating science as an absolute all or none.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:35.400
 They have disproved this and proved that.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.960
 That is all magic

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.960
 or some kind of cult rather than science.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.520
 - You know, we've heard this term, Koch's postulates,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.040
 that you really can't absolutely prove

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.480
 that somebody died from something,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.840
 these Koch's postulates.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.440
 They're similar, aren't they, Dr. Peat,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.280
 to some kind of four or five different

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.520
 really logical things that have to transpire

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.960
 to prove that somebody died from something?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:14.000
 - It's never possible to absolutely prove

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.360
 what someone died from.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.760
 - Really, never?

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.720
 - They might have...

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.680
 When a person is in a weak condition,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.400
 just a slight change of temperature

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.520
 might be enough to be the actual cause of death.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.360
 - Wow.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.360
 - Or you could choose any of the things

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.360
 that contributed to the loss of energy in their system.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.040
 Hypothyroidism has almost always involved

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.520
 weakness of the adrenal system,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.100
 a bias in the pituitary,

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:07.640
 all kinds of nutritional deficiencies or excesses

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.200
 will contribute to the energy weakness

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.880
 and could be focused on as the cause of death.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.960
 So if you look at 1,000 people,

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.640
 you could pick out big groups of people

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:30.640
 dying from a particular nutritional deficiency

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.200
 or hypothyroidism or insufficient adrenal steroids.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:46.160
 The existing low body temperature

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.280
 from multiple failures of metabolism,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.360
 things that can be repaired,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.400
 that simple low body temperature

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.360
 creates inflammatory reactions

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.040
 that look just like the reaction you get

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.040
 from a virus or some bacteria and so on.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.020
 So simply a low body temperature,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.240
 maybe because you didn't eat at the normal time

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.760
 and then a cold wind blew through,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.640
 that will kill lots of people.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.600
 - Isn't that interesting?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.600
 You know, in a way, some of these old period piece movies,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.040
 you know, in the 15th, 16th, 1700s,

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.560
 actually alluded to that a little bit,

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.480
 where somebody could really get sick

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.760
 and possibly even die from getting overchilled

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.800
 and things like that.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.480
 It's almost like they were kind of onto this kind of stuff

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.320
 long ago.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.280
 - Absolutely.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.320
 - That's interesting.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.600
 - And in the 19th century,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:00.400
 inflammation of the bowel was a very common cause of death.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.640
 - And what would be that, just bad food and overeating?

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.900
 - Yeah, bad microbe culture in your intestine.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.320
 - The WHO is out, and on record,

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.840
 I saw the video saying that anybody who was test positive

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.880
 for this COVID and they die,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.680
 then that's put down as a COVID death.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.040
 And all indications are that the PCR test,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.120
 as we've talked about in previous shows,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.000
 is just not accurate, could be way, way off.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.080
 Go ahead.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.080
 - They were not only instructed to list COVID virus

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.120
 as cause of death,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:47.120
 they were paid out of the government compensation fund.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:54.620
 If they diagnosed the infection,

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.960
 they would get, I think it was $14,000 support

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.380
 from the government.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:05.120
 If they had to intubate the person

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.120
 because of slightly low oxygen pressure or saturation,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.320
 they would get $48,000.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.320
 And so hospitals were not only instructed

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.440
 to diagnose cause of death,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:29.480
 they were paid to incline them

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.360
 toward diagnosing the COVID as cause of death.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:40.600
 That whole period, the supposed huge spike

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.600
 of a large, there was a very high proportion

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:53.720
 of the people in hospitals getting intubated and dying,

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.340
 just as was known would happen.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:02.680
 After three or four days of intubation,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.900
 there was very little chance of recovering.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.400
 One doctor very early in the process

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.400
 helped bring intubation to an end for COVID.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.880
 He showed that in the hospital,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:25.880
 he caused to use a very simple nasal cannula

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:32.740
 to provide oxygen when needed.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.740
 There was zero mortality from COVID pneumonia.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.800
 - Really?

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.000
 - In an adjacent high quality hospital

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 that was following the World Health and CDC recommendations

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.780
 had 60% mortality, absolute night and day difference

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.500
 just from using intubation.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.100
 - Now what's the word, the ink?

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:05.060
 - Putting a tube with forced oxygen into their lungs.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.780
 - Down the throat or just directly into the lung?

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.900
 - Yeah, directly into the lung, down the throat.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.300
 And to do that, they have to paralyze their muscles

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.920
 and anesthetize them.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.740
 Two basic, very serious drugs

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.460
 that have to be given constantly

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.740
 to keep them from waking up

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.400
 and trying to reject the tube.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.300
 - So I guess, oh, go ahead, go ahead.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.300
 - One patient who happened to be an addict

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.900
 and wasn't anesthetized because he was so insensitive to it,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.540
 he woke up and pulled the tube out.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:01.540
 He was the only one that survived the process

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.920
 in that hospital.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.080
 His health was worse, but because he pulled his tube out,

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.620
 he was able to survive.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.660
 - Wow, so I guess big picture of Dr. Peat,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.260
 it's almost, see if I'm close on this,

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.660
 when somebody leaves their body, or we call dying,

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.260
 there could be innumerable things contributing

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.900
 to this loss of energy.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.860
 And do you really, it's not like you could ever

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.220
 really pinpoint, say, well, he died of a heart attack

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.900
 or he died of this or that.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.100
 It's almost like the person, it was almost like

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.060
 it was their time to go and their body was failing

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.220
 a little here, a little here, a little here.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.780
 You know what I'm saying?

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.980
 Does that make sense at all to you,

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.060
 or what I'm kind of saying?

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.460
 - Have you heard of the voodoo deaths?

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.940
 - Voodoo deaths?

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.780
 No. - Yeah, a person

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:03.460
 makes the voodoo priest or priestess angry,

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.900
 or they might have been bribed by someone

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:14.860
 to tell them that they have put a spell on them,

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.860
 person in perfect health, and the person will be convinced

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.660
 that they have been affected by the voodoo principle,

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:31.980
 and they'll just wither away and die within a few days.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.500
 - So that's real.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.940
 I mean, when we believe something like that.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:42.300
 - Yeah, and I'm sure something like that goes on

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.300
 as soon as you get a diagnosis of a fatal heart disease

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.580
 or cancer. - Cancer, sure.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.580
 There's no way to really calculate or to analyze

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.580
 and know exactly for each soul of how much

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.780
 their belief of what they think they have is affecting them,

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.060
 and we just wouldn't know.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.460
 That's more of a spiritual thing, right?

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.540
 - Yeah, and lots of people don't know they're sick

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.460
 until they get the diagnosis and then they feel very sick.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.500
 - George, you have cancer.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.940
 Wait a minute, I feel great.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.060
 - Really, that happens very often.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.820
 - Wow, so then there's no way of calculating,

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.020
 Dr. Ray Peat, on this corona experience

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.900
 of how much fear or angst or worry is going on with people

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.660
 who do get a positive test, and we know how accurate that is

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.940
 and what their experience is after that.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:46.100
 - And since they stopped the mandatory

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:51.300
 power respiration, which destroys the lungs

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.180
 after about three or four days,

00:26:54.180 --> 00:27:00.100
 in a healthy person, if there was any reason to do it,

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.420
 animal studies show that, first, oxygen treatment

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.020
 of their lungs destroys the lungs and kills them.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.660
 But as soon as that process was ended

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:26.500
 because of the evidence between hospitals,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:32.580
 using it and avoiding it, as soon as that process ended,

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:37.740
 there is no visible excess mortality.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.340
 I don't know whether last month I mentioned

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:49.420
 Genevieve Briand at Johns Hopkins.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.700
 - Kind of sounds familiar, Genevieve Briand.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.700
 - She did a statistical study and her figures

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:05.540
 based all on the CDC numbers show no excess mortality

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.340
 for the period she analyzed.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.540
 - When they took them off of the ventilator?

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.780
 No excess, yeah.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.280
 - For the whole year, even including the ventilator time,

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.780
 she shows that the very CDC figures show

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:34.140
 no, nothing really happened in the way of a pandemic

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.300
 over the whole population.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.500
 - Oh, comparing it to past years and such.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:48.300
 Comparing it to past death rates and such.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.300
 - Yeah, and her, as soon as someone noticed

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.260
 that a lot of people were reading the article,

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:02.540
 Johns Hopkins canceled their website

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:07.580
 and is still available on other websites

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:12.580
 and there's a good analysis of her article

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.460
 on a statistical site called

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.180
 The Censorship of Genevieve Briand.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.380
 - Wow, and you can Google that?

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:28.540
 - Yeah, I don't have their address, but--

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.980
 - That's okay, The Censorship of Genevieve Briand,

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.740
 and how do you spell Genevieve's last name?

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.300
 - B-R-I-A-N-D-E.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.020
 - Oh, B-R-I-A-N-D, Briand, oh, interesting.

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.460
 - I think there's an E on the end.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.980
 - And she published through Johns Hopkins

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.620
 and they just canceled the whole thing or censored it.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:55.620
 - Yeah, she's a professor there, but in another subject,

00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:00.940
 and so they said it wasn't proper

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.300
 to have an opinion on statistics.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.300
 - I wonder if we could reach her,

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.820
 if she'd be fun to get on, if she could come on,

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.460
 we'd see, I mean, I'll check it out.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.860
 So you think she's still there at Johns Hopkins?

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.660
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:21.980
 She's an economist, very familiar with statistics,

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:30.300
 so I don't think there's any criticism of her method.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.300
 And the people, it's another economics website

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:40.220
 that I think published the article,

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.380
 the censorship of Briand.

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.780
 - We had a fellow on the other day, Ralph Moss,

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.220
 he's written four, five, six books

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.660
 on the politics in Cancer Incorporated,

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.380
 and he used to work for this big hospital

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.620
 in the upper Midwest, oh, the name's escaping me,

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:05.820
 a real, the premier cancer kind of place,

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.820
 it'll come to me, but he came across work

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.180
 with Laetrile many years ago and was virtually

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.860
 his job because he wanted to put that out.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:23.900
 - Yeah, I followed all of that in detail.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:24.740
 - Did you?

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:29.740
 - Yeah, I would listen to the defenses

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:36.660
 of an Indiana University professor, whose name I forget,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:42.860
 and Ernst, Jr., the promoter,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:48.460
 that they switched substances in the middle

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:53.460
 of the controversy of the cancer,

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.900
 I got some of what they said was Laetrile.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:07.540
 So the whole thing was based on the theory

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.980
 of a very specific substance,

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:20.340
 ending, the name of it ends with glucuronide,

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:26.860
 and what they began sending out,

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:32.060
 because it was cheap, was the similar molecule,

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:38.420
 but ending in glucose, and very different systems

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:45.580
 work on the glucose and the glucuronide forms

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.820
 of the molecule, and the glucuronide,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.820
 as theorized by Krebs, Sr., it was tested in Israel

00:32:54.820 --> 00:33:03.060
 by Dr. Rubens, I don't remember his full name,

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:09.380
 and found to be very effective,

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.340
 but when they found that they could get away

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:19.020
 with selling the glucose form, which is very cheap,

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.820
 the glucuronide form is very expensive,

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:28.700
 and so the substance most people were getting

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:34.860
 was not at all Laetrile, it was the glucose form

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:39.020
 of the molecule.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.420
 - Wow, that's fascinating.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:46.380
 - And what was his name, the,

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:51.020
 the researcher you mentioned?

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.780
 - Moss?

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:58.780
 - Moss, yeah, he was observing the actual effects

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:04.740
 of the real stuff, and after that,

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.940
 most of the studies used only the false material,

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:19.100
 including fairly early in 1968,

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.980
 what he sent me from Canada, the producer,

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:31.980
 was the glucose form, not at all what I had intended

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.620
 to use in my experiment, but it came without a label,

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.620
 and it didn't work at all like the actual Laetrile

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:47.260
 should work, and so a person at a college in Oregon

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:57.180
 had it analyzed and found that it was not Laetrile at all,

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:04.300
 it was the glucose form, and so I started putting out

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:09.340
 that information, it didn't have the biological effect

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:16.260
 it should have on my mice, and I couldn't see any reason

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:23.260
 why it would act like Laetrile, because it wasn't,

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.820
 and as that information got around,

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:32.900
 these two people were the main propagandists,

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.180
 and listening to their presentation,

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:41.180
 they carefully evaded the fact that the,

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:46.860
 one that they were selling, poisons the intestine

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:53.500
 incurably before it gets around to having any activity

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:59.180
 against the cancer, so these people were creating

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:05.540
 a tendency for sepsis by poisoning the intestine,

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.700
 and not even having a possible effect

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.380
 on the cancer itself.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.340
 - Oh man, oh, fascinating.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.260
 Dr. Ray Peat is here, stay right there, sir,

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.500
 we're gonna do a break, Patrick Timpone.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.780
 I've just been notified, we're having, for some reason,

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.620
 we have, I don't know what's going on,

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:28.060
 issues with the actual audio stream, believe it or not,

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:33.060
 and I don't know why that is, I don't even know,

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.740
 it's just hard to tell you what's going on,

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.740
 but we're recording it, we have all that,

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.260
 and you're gonna have the whole recording of Dr. Peat

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.780
 I can see if I can do something here in the meantime,

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.860
 but you can click on the video, the front page,

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.580
 and you can hear the audio there, but we're working on it,

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:54.180
 so sorry for the issue.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.420
 Previously with Peter Ragnar, who's a great example

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.300
 of staying young and healthy,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:02.260
 we asked him what kinds of things he takes.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:07.260
 - Personally, for myself, I look at all of the supplements

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:12.900
 that help bolster and harmonize my hormones,

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:18.300
 and this is both for men and for women,

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.100
 and when you go online, there's so much information

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:25.580
 about that out there, I've actually, I heard on

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.660
 one of your advertisements there, Patrick,

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.980
 about the pine pollen.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.980
 I personally take pine pollen, which is,

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.860
 I think it's an amazing product,

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.540
 has an amazing effect upon the body.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.660
 - Peter, it's one of our favorites, too.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.700
 Pine pollen, any of these are Thrival Links,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.620
 you have the Pine Pollen Pure Potency,

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.140
 Pine Pollen Gold, and if you'd like to get it every month,

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.220
 the auto ship is the best price.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.140
 Also, Steven Buehner's book, exclusively on pine pollen,

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.820
 is right there on the site, too, Daniel's site.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.660
 Right here on oneradionetwork.com.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.660
 Dr. Patrick Flanagan has been regarded

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.100
 as one of the most important scientists

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.860
 in the last 50 years.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.700
 We talked to him about sulfur.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.180
 - There's a product called organic sulfur,

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.420
 and organic sulfur was put into trade

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.540
 in 1865 as organic sulfur.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.140
 Some people call it MSM, or methyl sulfonylmethane,

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.740
 but most of the MSM in health food stores

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.780
 have been contaminated with a kind of silica

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:36.340
 that prevents its absorption by the body.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.580
 But anyway, what happens is that if you take

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:44.580
 a tablespoon of MSM of the organic sulfur

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.420
 in hot water in the morning,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.820
 and a tablespoon in the afternoon,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:55.700
 it sulfates 192 different compounds,

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.460
 heavy metals from the periodic table.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.980
 And once it sulfates them,

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.020
 I'm talking about radioactive elements and other things,

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.700
 once it sulfates them,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:12.420
 these sulfates cannot stay in the human body

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.300
 for more than 12 hours.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.220
 - And what Dr. Flanagan just mentioned

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.500
 is one of the key reasons why our sulfur

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.300
 is different from most out there,

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.340
 Amazon, no matter where you go,

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.540
 because it's pure.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:01.140
 and it's coming up there.

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:07.140
 So I'm not sure what's going on for some people.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.420
 Don't know what to, I don't know what to tell you,

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.020
 but we have more than one, so something's going on.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:18.460
 Yeah, well, it's, you know, life on planet Earth.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:20.660
 We're with Dr. Ray Peat, who's,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.340
 we're very proud to have him on,

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:26.580
 on once a month, on the third Monday of the month,

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.940
 that now we're doing it, and a little hour later,

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.660
 about 10.30 central time.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.580
 I'm sorry, 11.30 central time,

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.700
 and so if you have a question for him,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.900
 let me know if,

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:44.980
 if you can hear it okay through the play button.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.380
 I don't know what's going on, but we'll just continue.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:55.500
 Well, Dr. Peat, do you think,

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.460
 before we take some emails, do you,

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.060
 wait a minute, I gotta get my, turn my microphone on.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.700
 Okay, we're back here with you, thanks.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.060
 So Dr. Peat, do you think,

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:12.620
 in general, the thyroid thing

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.620
 that you're such a specialist,

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.900
 it's kind of one of the,

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:19.420
 on the top of the list that folks should really

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.020
 maybe pay attention to when they're not feeling

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.500
 as well as they can, or?

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.500
 - The, one of the important functions of thyroid

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:37.500
 is to lower the body's estrogen absolute content

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:44.340
 and its ratio to the androgens like DHEA and progesterone.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:53.180
 And one of the important ways of getting rid of estrogen

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.260
 is to attach sulfuric acid to it.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:05.260
 And so sulfation is probably the biggest

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:10.200
 single route of disposing of estrogen.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:16.300
 But simply by keeping your body temperature up,

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:21.660
 all of the good effects of thyroid

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.540
 are likely to be activated.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.540
 So even keeping your body warm artificially,

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:35.100
 avoiding chilling from extreme exposure

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.220
 and fatiguing amount of chilling,

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:44.540
 even artificial heating reduces

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.220
 some of the estrogenic effects.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:53.380
 For example, the ears of a rabbit

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.500
 are much cooler than the core body temperature.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.500
 And a researcher, knowing of that,

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.180
 that the ovaries are somehow kept cooler

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:10.600
 than the adrenaline body temperature tissues.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:15.640
 In a very short space,

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.820
 the temperature of the ovary

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.180
 can be a whole degree Celsius lower

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.620
 than the adrenaline tissue.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.620
 No one knows how that cooling, where the heat goes,

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:34.420
 but structural changes of water in the blood

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:39.420
 coming in, for example, are the only mechanism

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.320
 that I know that could account for that cooling.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.980
 But anyway, this researcher,

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:49.620
 aware of the low temperature of the ovaries

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.500
 and the low temperature of rabbit's ears,

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:59.620
 injected some ovarian, small pieces of the ovary tissue

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:06.460
 into the skin of the rabbit's ear.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.220
 And those animals went into constant estrus,

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.020
 a premature aging,

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:19.020
 but with an exaggerated constant level

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.700
 of estrogen production.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:26.900
 So carefully avoiding a low body temperature

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.420
 is extremely important to keep a healthy balance

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.980
 of the hormones.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.740
 - Wow, wow, wow, wow.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.380
 So, bottom line for you,

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:42.620
 the TSH number along with your body temperature,

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.020
 those are two of the things you wanna,

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.620
 our people can really look at and see?

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.900
 - Yeah, some of the beliefs about pH

00:44:53.900 --> 00:45:01.180
 were absolutely reversed when they were able to use MRI

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:07.220
 for measuring intracellular pH.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:12.980
 Cancer, following Varberg's observation

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.700
 that all cancers produce lactic acid.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.700
 People noticed that yes, all tumors

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:30.820
 have a high concentration of lactic acid and low pH.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:37.300
 And so that led to the idea that baking soda, for example,

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:45.260
 raising the pH might help avoid

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.700
 or cure cancer.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:55.780
 But it turns out that the intracellular pH of cancer

00:45:55.780 --> 00:46:00.740
 is always higher.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.860
 And that should have been known way back

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:09.860
 in the 40s or 50s because when a cell forms lactic acid

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:15.940
 from pyruvic acid, it absorbs protein

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:22.220
 and so raises the pH in the cell.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:27.220
 And the removal of lactic acid from the cell

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:32.780
 is exactly a removal of acid from the cell,

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:37.500
 making the cell less acidic, more alkaline.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.500
 And it turns out that when you eat baking soda,

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:50.100
 it does alkalinize your blood,

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.100
 but the brain tissue in particular

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.100
 and muscle and other tissues are acidified

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:05.420
 by taking baking soda because the carbon dioxide

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:11.420
 component of the bicarbonate quickly,

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:16.940
 enzymes convert bicarbonate to carbon dioxide

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:27.100
 in a gaseous form which is soluble in cell material.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:32.180
 So just by solubility, it tends to stay inside the cell,

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.860
 acidifying the cell.

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.060
 And so some of the, if people were just more careful

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:47.100
 about doing their chemistry and observing

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:52.260
 what the enzymes are doing, all along they should have known

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.260
 that cancer was an intracellular alkaline shift.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:03.340
 And the baking soda, although alkaline in itself,

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.340
 turns to carbon dioxide and acidifies the cell.

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.940
 - Very well, well done.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.420
 Ray P., Patrick Timpone.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:19.260
 It seems like the audio file is streaming okay now

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.220
 and I don't know what was going on,

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.100
 but we have the recording,

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.980
 so you're gonna have the whole show with Dr. Peat,

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.020
 so not to worry.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:29.260
 But if you have a question, patrick@oneradionetwork.com,

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.320
 patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.260
 This is from Kelly.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.140
 I'm still a little confused on this whole coronavirus thing.

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.860
 Can Dr. Peat just give us a simple explanation

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:47.100
 of what he thinks is truly going on with this,

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.720
 with the deaths and the testing, in his opinion?

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:57.740
 - What's known is that Fauci himself instructed

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:05.700
 all the testers to use the PCR process

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:13.480
 running the cycle more than 40 times,

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.580
 although it has been known that above 30 to 33 cycles,

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:23.480
 it produces more and more false positives.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.120
 The instruction went out all across the country

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:33.120
 to use a process of testing known to produce

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:40.080
 an extreme excess of false positives.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:46.200
 So right on the surface, anyone should infer

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:52.480
 that they wanted to have as many apparent positive results

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.340
 as they could to justify that there was a pandemic.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:04.840
 And now, if the vaccine comes into

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:10.200
 a fairly widespread use, all they have to do

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:15.200
 is instruct the testers to properly use the test

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:21.200
 with maybe 30 or 32 cycles,

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:27.120
 and they will discover that the virus has disappeared.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.000
 - Yeah, that's well said.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.680
 I think it seems like that's the plan,

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.080
 not to be too much of a tinfoil hat guy, Dr. Peat,

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.860
 but who would know, right?

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.720
 They could just say, "Oh, the vaccine."

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.760
 But then, aren't there people out there right now,

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.880
 even WHO and other people,

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.200
 saying that just because you're vaccinated

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.520
 doesn't mean you can't get this thing or share it?

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.520
 I mean, the whole thing is such a mess.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:51:00.160
 - Yeah, and Pfizer, I think they have something

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.360
 like 40,000 pages of data

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:11.480
 about what their so-called vaccine has done.

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:16.700
 They released 400 pages, and an editor of BMJ,

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.200
 the British medical journal, Peter Doshi,

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:29.760
 I think is his name, he analyzed the data he could find

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.320
 that was released to the public.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:37.760
 And from his calculation,

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.640
 and he's been working on vaccines,

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.900
 particularly for 10 years,

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:48.960
 his analysis showed that from 19 to 29,

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.560
 99% according to Pfizer's data

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:58.180
 were protected by the vaccine.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:04.480
 Not at all the 95% or 69% or whatever they announced

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.200
 publicly, but they don't want to release

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:14.200
 the full set of data because that would spoil

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.240
 the whole plot.

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:21.600
 - The whole thing, wow.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.640
 Are you amazed that whoever they are

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.060
 have been able to pull this thing off

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.760
 at such a grand, global scale?

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.120
 After all your many years looking at the ins and outs

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.400
 of people in science and so-called science,

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.600
 is this surprising to you that they've been able

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.360
 to pull this off like this?

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.480
 - A little bit, but I've been watching

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.360
 the whole education indoctrination process

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.000
 for 50 years and more.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.560
 And they have created a gullible population,

00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:00.920
 maybe at least 80% I would guess,

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:05.360
 of absolutely gullible people when it comes

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.740
 to calling something science.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.680
 Totally fail to teach critical thinking

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:19.160
 which really should begin in grade school

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:24.840
 what it means when someone asserts

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.800
 that something is scientifically shown.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:36.240
 And no one functionally seems to be thinking critically

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:41.720
 about what the government and the mass media are saying.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:45.200
 - A real epidemic, I think, isn't it,

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.800
 from people that are just not thinking critically

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:48.800
 about any of this.

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:53.240
 And you say that's early on in the education

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.480
 is where that starts.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:00.920
 - Yeah, fails to teach critical attitudes

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:08.160
 towards anything called scientific.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.240
 So it's no wonder politicians, I guess,

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.560
 and governors and mayors and whoever,

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.560
 that they just follow along with whatever CDC says.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.800
 - Yeah, they were educated in the same way.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.560
 - In the same way, yeah.

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.080
 - They're absolutely gullible when it comes

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.840
 to Fauci or someone else,

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:35.840
 an unhealthy person in a white coat saying something.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.800
 - And we're seeing a lot of reports now

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.680
 of this new improved strain.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:43.560
 Have you seen this in the UK and other places?

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.640
 A new strain, right?

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.820
 A new one, stronger.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.800
 - Yeah, there's a website.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.800
 I looked at it when they had 3,400 variations

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.040
 on the virus.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:01.040
 Now, here they have about 6,000 variations.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:08.040
 And how are they, even if there were only a few variations,

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:14.080
 how are they gonna test to demonstrate

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.080
 that one is more infectious or more deadly

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.880
 than another one?

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:26.800
 No one is doing any statistical thinking at all

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:31.120
 regarding the claims of new strains.

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:35.000
 - And I guess, Dr. Peat, with the massive control

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.360
 of the media, and almost all of it, right,

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.880
 and all the censorship going on,

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.760
 like, you know, of just people that are questioning,

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.920
 we've been deleted from YouTube and Vimeo and, you know,

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:49.800
 Facebook, they have a pretty good way

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:54.120
 of keeping this information with what they want.

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.120
 - Yeah, just about, oh, 20 years ago,

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:04.840
 they were still subsidizing shipment of books

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:09.480
 and scholarly materials.

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:14.480
 The post office was helping to keep people informed.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:22.080
 And with the internet, it momentarily looked like

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.880
 this might be spreading information more widely,

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:33.960
 but it went along with a plan to shut down the post office,

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:38.520
 take away its funding, make it run in debt,

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.520
 until finally it could be bought by UPS

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.720
 or another private service,

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:53.600
 and shifting everyone's communication to the internet,

00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:00.600
 which was taken over by companies

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:05.160
 that were started with government,

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:08.680
 CIA, Pentagon subsidies,

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:13.680
 and now these corporations are acting as a,

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:18.880
 extensions of the military and CIA,

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.880
 so that when something embarrasses

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.760
 those people and their intentions,

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:30.760
 they disappear from the internet.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.800
 - Yes, I'm sure you've seen what happened with,

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:37.720
 I guess with Amazon Web Services, Apple, and Google,

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.360
 where they just wiped out Parler,

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:42.800
 which was a huge new kind of free platform,

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.400
 just wiped 'em out.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.120
 But we saw a story today where the CEO of Parler

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:49.440
 says they're gonna be back up by the end of January.

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:54.440
 So it's amazing to me that Amazon Web Services

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.200
 have that much power and juice,

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.400
 and that you have to have these kind of servers

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.480
 to do this thing.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:00.720
 Wow, man.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.720
 Well, it's a problem when things get in,

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.760
 just too few hands, I guess.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.840
 Here's an email for you, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.840
 By the way, it seems solid now, all the audio,

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.800
 so you're listening, you wanna have a question here,

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.400
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.820
 Carolyn wants to know,

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:29.280
 if Dr. Ray Peat experiences chemtrails

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.480
 up in the Northwest where he lives,

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.400
 and she does in California,

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.400
 wants to know how we can get rid of these

00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.480
 nanoparticles in our lungs.

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:44.120
 - I've seen very few

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.520
 unusual trails

00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:52.280
 sitting out in the yard.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.200
 - Yeah, we don't see much around here either.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.560
 Hardly ever, never.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:04.440
 - And there's no real cure for the particle exposure.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:11.360
 I did a newsletter on the nanoparticles,

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:16.240
 and they can even be absorbed through the skin,

00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:21.240
 and they're being used in lots of fabric now

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:30.040
 as deodorants to kill microorganisms

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.900
 that produce odors in dirty clothes.

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:40.760
 But the ability to kill bacteria and fungus,

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:47.840
 these same particles can penetrate into the bloodstream

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:51.420
 and begin affecting our immune cells.

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:57.640
 So it's important to be alert

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:02.320
 about the many sources,

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.420
 food additives, for example,

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:10.260
 silica particles are probably one of the most common,

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:18.980
 which can contain the deadly size range of particles.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:26.380
 And you find silica in even probably the majority

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.620
 of health food supplements added as lubricant

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:37.060
 to make the machinery run smoothly.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.360
 And even when it's not on the label.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.580
 - Lots of those are in there, right?

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.580
 - Yeah, there are Teflon particles used

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:49.180
 in a micro or nano form,

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.380
 used as a machine lubricant

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.060
 that doesn't have to be listed on the label

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.460
 even though it gets into the food.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.660
 - Yeah, yeah, they use that silicone dioxide

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:01.020
 to encapsulate a lot of things.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.580
 And folks, that's one of the reasons why our sulfur,

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:06.500
 which doesn't get encapsulated is better than most

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.140
 because this stuff is everywhere

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.980
 and sulfur is really a kind of persnickety

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.220
 and doesn't like it.

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:14.780
 Right, Peat mentioned his newsletter

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.940
 and you can get that by emailing

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:21.780
 raypeats, plural, newsletter@gmail.com.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.660
 Sign up, very affordable.

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.940
 I think it's, Dr. Peat, it's every couple months, right?

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.220
 Six, seven times a year?

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:30.020
 - Six times a year.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.100
 - Six times a year.

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:36.100
 Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.260
 and bone up on this stuff

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.580
 so you can take care of your stuff

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:42.900
 because there's some challenging times around

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.260
 so we're just doing everything we can

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.500
 to thrive during these challenging times

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.020
 and we're gonna do it, we'll be fine.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:52.860
 Stick around, we have a lot of good things

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.540
 to talk about this week.

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.380
 Dr. Axley tomorrow on aluminum.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.700
 Judy Mikovich and the HIV Fauci thing

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:04.700
 and HIV and Dr. Gabriel Cousins will be by on Thursday

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:09.940
 and German New Medicine Lady next week

01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:12.500
 and Dr. Jennifer Daniels next week.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.540
 Thanks for having Dr. Peat on, says Benjamin.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:20.540
 I'd like to ask him to again explain fructose intolerance,

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.540
 often called fructose malabsorption.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.940
 Can it be fixed and if so, how?

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.460
 Thanks for all your great work, Ben.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.980
 He's in Pittsburgh.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.940
 Fructose intolerance.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:37.540
 - It is a new way of defining gas

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:46.700
 and diarrhea and digestion problems

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:51.900
 but it's usually just a bad microbial mix in the intestine.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:57.460
 Most of our fructose except in apples and apple juice

01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:03.180
 which contain a fairly concentrated pure fructose,

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:09.500
 most of our fructose comes in the form of sucrose

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.780
 or ordinary sugar.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:17.780
 And so the way it's defined is that it's a mixture

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:22.820
 in the form of sucrose or ordinary sugar.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:28.220
 And it's very rare to lack the enzymes

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:34.140
 for absorbing those.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:40.300
 They break down and each one can be absorbed

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:45.300
 but if your microbial balance is out of control

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:51.300
 then the bacteria are likely to turn fructose

01:03:51.300 --> 01:04:01.180
 into endotoxin and other bacterial toxins

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:10.220
 and balancing the microbes.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:16.860
 The main thing is to increase the metabolic rate

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.900
 of your intestine so that you can absorb the sugars

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.260
 high up in the intestine.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.660
 - Increase the metabolic rate of your intestines?

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.660
 How do you do that?

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:30.460
 - Keeping your body temperature up.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.100
 - Keeping the body temperature up.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.500
 - And your thyroid.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.780
 - So that's back to the thyroid, right?

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.500
 So if we, just for fun, say if we're keeping

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.340
 our body temperature up by wearing warm clothing

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.340
 and exercising, does the body realize that

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.660
 as the same thing as having a happy thyroid

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.260
 or you can't fake it out like that?

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:58.420
 - The quick acting component of the thyroid

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:04.500
 is suppressed by intense exercise

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:09.740
 because the glucose needed to produce the glucose

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:15.260
 to produce T3 is being consumed by the muscles

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:20.460
 and it should bounce back an hour or two

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:24.900
 after the exercise if your liver has stored enough

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.900
 glycogen made when you have a little excess sugar.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:37.820
 To form glycogen and store it in the liver,

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.540
 that's one of thyroid's basic functions.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:48.060
 Selenium, thyroid, and a source of carbohydrate

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:54.160
 in the diet, you'll quickly replenish the liver

01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:00.140
 of glycogen which you need to maintain

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:06.100
 a high metabolic rate.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:10.220
 And with that high metabolic rate,

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:15.220
 your intestine should have finished its digestion

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:18.140
 fairly high up.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:23.500
 But the lower the general metabolism,

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:30.400
 farther down, undigested food will go.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:37.860
 In a very healthy person, maybe 10% of the population,

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:43.420
 the whole small intestine system is sterile.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:49.980
 In another very sick, 10 or 20%,

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:57.540
 the microbes invade the small intestine

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.300
 in extreme cases, even into the stomach

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.060
 by raising the pH of the stomach.

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.860
 In the absence of thyroid,

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.060
 you can't make enough stomach acid.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.620
 - Wow, so the stomach acid is tied with thyroid too.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:13.540
 Yeah, go ahead.

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:17.980
 So then that's that small intestinal bacterial overgrowth

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.100
 we hear about, SIBO.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.020
 - Yeah, yeah.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:27.140
 And at an extreme, the stomach becomes alkaline

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:31.820
 and bacteria such as H. pylori

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:37.220
 then thrive because they're alkaline loving.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:42.220
 And some people will even develop a brewery

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:48.620
 containing yeast all the way up into their stomach

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.460
 so that if they eat carbohydrate,

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.580
 they'll have alcohol in their breath.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:58.700
 That's all because of a very slow metabolic rate.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:05.700
 So normalizing, optimizing your thyroid

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.700
 is going to give you a sterile stomach and small intestine.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:16.380
 And the bacteria will live almost exclusively in the colon.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.980
 - Which is where we want it, right?

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:19.820
 - Yeah.

01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:20.900
 - Yeah, which is, wow.

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:24.820
 Then connecting the dots between a low thyroid

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.100
 and low stomach acid, I mean, who'd have thunk it, right?

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:29.940
 I mean, you could chase after that for years

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.860
 with giving HCL or other things

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.020
 or even apple cider vinegar.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.260
 And would that just be symptomatic then,

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.900
 even if you have a low thyroid, to keep things going?

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:43.620
 Giving HCL or vinegar or stuff like that?

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:50.660
 - Yeah, they used to sell glass straws

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.260
 with actual hydrochloric acid.

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.100
 - No kidding.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:58.860
 - For such things to sip it without dissolving your teeth.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.580
 But what they sell now is usually butane.

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:04.420
 - Butane, right.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.260
 - Hydrochloric.

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.260
 And the butane itself seriously affects

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:17.020
 your cyanine metabolism, your methyl processes.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:23.540
 And so it can have very unexpected side effects.

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.620
 - You don't want to do that, huh?

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.460
 Take HCL.

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:31.460
 - Too much methyl addition going on.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.060
 - Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.700
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.580
 Does Dr. Peat have any ideas, actually,

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:43.220
 of how I can get rid of sciatica?

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.780
 I've been to the chiropractor

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.940
 and I just haven't been able to make it go away.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.900
 - More than 100 years ago,

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:58.100
 I think approaching 200 years ago,

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:04.820
 a few doctors were curing sciatica almost always

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:12.100
 by using a good laxative, Fibra and Furgis,

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:19.380
 because the colon, when it's very overloaded,

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:24.660
 stuffed, it becomes so heavy,

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:31.020
 especially over the left leg, but it can affect both.

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:37.180
 It becomes so heavy it sits on and pressurizes,

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.860
 damages by too much pressure,

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.820
 the nerve conduction to the leg.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:50.300
 And I've seen people do that.

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:56.300
 Just take a few days of strong laxatives

01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:01.500
 and a good Fibra and the leg pains disappear.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.820
 - That's amazing.

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:05.660
 Good job.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.500
 Stay right there, Doc.

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.860
 We're gonna take a short break here

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.380
 before we wrap it up with you.

01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:12.700
 Dr. Ray Peat, we're live here January 18th.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:16.500
 Dr. Chris Hexley, probably the foremost authority

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.900
 on aluminum tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.640
 Judy Mickovich, Wednesday.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.420
 Dr. Gabriel Cousins on Thursday

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.860
 about some spiritual stuff.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:31.300
 If you'd like to get a very, very nice aloe product

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:36.580
 to help keep things moving,

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.360
 boy, aloe's a very, very good thing

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.540
 to keep the colon clean and that,

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:45.820
 and you can get a fresh, frozen aloe vera product

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:46.740
 on our website.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:48.660
 You'll see it right there on the website.

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.060
 And it comes in frozen and you just thaw it out

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:53.860
 and you pour it in a glass

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:56.380
 and put it back in the freezer

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:58.300
 and then thaw it out some more.

01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.780
 And that's how you do it.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.940
 And it's very, very good.

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:06.460
 There's no preservatives whatsoever.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.640
 It's just been frozen.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.120
 Probably the best way to do it

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.260
 other than have your own plant at home.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:14.180
 And boy, it's very powerful.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.300
 It tastes great.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.980
 And you can just slug it down.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.820
 And I think the minimum of two,

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.900
 and just look on the website for the aloe product there.

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.780
 And I think you'll have a good experience with it.

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.880
 I order them two and three times.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.020
 Not that it matters what I do,

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:31.540
 but I use it a lot.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:36.080
 And it's just so magical for everything in your gut.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.660
 It's 100% pure, fresh, frozen aloe vera gel,

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:43.060
 stocked in aloe one, minimum of two.

01:12:43.060 --> 01:12:46.660
 And it's a wonderful, wonderful product.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.280
 This conversation goes back seven years

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.500
 with Dr. Patrick Flanagan.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.700
 Listen.

01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:55.660
 - And then I discovered that HUNZA water

01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:59.300
 also contained negative ionized hydrogen,

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.580
 which is a source of biological electrons.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.980
 When we're young, we have enzymes in our body

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.620
 called dehydrogenase.

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:10.020
 And the purpose of dehydrogenase

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:15.020
 is to lift off hydrogen ions from the foods we eat.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:19.060
 And their purpose is to create NADH,

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:22.420
 which is a chemical that acts as a shuttle

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:25.060
 in the mitochondria for producing

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:28.980
 all the energy in our body, adenosine triphosphate.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:33.980
 And when people take this, it causes DNA repair.

01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:38.580
 It heals the body from all kinds of oxygen-free radicals.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:43.180
 It also helps the body recover from damage from radiation.

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.580
 - Well, we certainly want some of this stuff, right?

 - Indeed, this is one of the greatest,

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.380
 I mean, I love breathing it.

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:21.140
 I'm working on my screenplay and book downstairs.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.300
 Breathe it a lot at night if I watch a film or read.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:28.220
 And I just keep feeling better and better and better.

01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:30.180
 I do a lot of good things because of advice

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:32.900
 from people like Adam Bergstrom and Dr. Ray Peat

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.140
 and others, but I think it's really key

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:40.060
 in my health, improving with the antioxidant

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.340
 kind of thing.

 Check it out on our website, oneradionetwork.com.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.940
 (upbeat music)

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:49.420
 - From the Hill Country in Texas,

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.820
 this is oneradionetwork.com.

01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:57.060
 - Dr. Ray Peat, his website is rayPeat,

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.500
 isn't it, let me see, what's your website?

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.220
 Oh, I got it right here, I'm sorry.

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:04.020
 RayPeat.com, sometimes I get confused.

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:06.700
 RayPeat.com.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.020
 Here's a good one, Nancy wants to know,

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:14.020
 "Dr. Peat, does sugar always feed cancer?"

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:23.300
 - Not always, but it's a preferred food.

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:29.500
 But the problem is that the body normally

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:35.220
 has trouble producing and delivering enough

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:37.260
 sugar to the tumor.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:43.620
 In one experiment with a tumor isolated to the leg

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:48.860
 where they could control, put a huge amount

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:55.340
 amount of glucose into the artery feeding the tumor,

01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:00.300
 they found that they could create so much

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.620
 lactic acid production by the tumor

01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.180
 that it killed itself.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:10.420
 A very, very high amount of glucose that took,

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.100
 which you couldn't do to the whole body.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:20.820
 And when the tumor experiences hypoglycemia internally,

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:29.100
 which it always does, low oxygen leads to

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:34.380
 the increased need for sugar.

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:37.060
 When the body experiences that,

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:42.060
 once the tumor becomes a self-sustaining,

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:46.380
 self-replicating, noticeable thing,

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:52.540
 that signals the whole body, turns on the adrenal glands

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.580
 and starts converting our tissue proteins

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:03.540
 to glucose or amino acids.

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:08.940
 And at that point, you're losing ground

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:13.940
 because when you can't provide enough glucose

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:20.300
 from either your food or your stored glycogen,

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:25.300
 then the body has to start feeding the tumor amino acids

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:31.260
 and the tumor can live very well,

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:36.260
 perfectly on amino acids and on fat.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:40.460
 When there's not enough glucose,

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:45.460
 the tumor will thrive on pure amino acids and fatty acids.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.940
 And so the worst thing you can do

01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:56.180
 to accelerate death from a tumor

01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:00.580
 is to starve the cancer for glucose.

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.340
 - The worst thing you can do?

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.740
 - Yeah.

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.060
 - Wow.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.480
 So, since hanging around with you a little bit,

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:14.060
 I've not been nearly as uncomfortable

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:15.220
 about having some sugar.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:17.460
 I have some organic beet sugar, Dr. Peat,

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:19.780
 that I use with maybe raw goat's milk

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:20.820
 and I'll heat it up a little bit

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.340
 with the organic sugar even at night.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.980
 And I do fine sleeping.

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:26.700
 I wonder, so I thought about it,

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.260
 I wonder what the difference is when moms say,

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.020
 "Well, if you give kids candy before bed,

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:32.380
 "they'll never sleep,"

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:35.300
 or, "The kids get all wound up on sugar."

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.140
 And why that's not affecting me like that.

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.900
 - No, if they ate enough sugar,

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.780
 they would get wound down.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:48.780
 Sugar is even a mild anesthetic for a baby.

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:53.380
 Getting injections and such,

01:18:53.380 --> 01:19:01.500
 dose of sucrose is demonstrably calming

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.380
 and actually stops the pain

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:09.300
 and it lowers adrenaline.

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.700
 So, it's actually not getting enough sugar

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.020
 that makes kids get hyperactive.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.660
 The immediate effect of the sugar is quieting.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:21.980
 - That's crazy.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:22.820
 That's amazing.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:24.100
 I'm sure the moms are listening now going,

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:27.140
 "Oh, wait a minute, come on, could that be true?"

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:30.700
 - And something similar happens in diabetes.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:37.060
 The definition of diabetes is that you can't use glucose.

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.020
 - Right.

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.780
 - And so the cells are starving for sugar.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:47.540
 And in that state of starvation for sugar,

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:52.540
 they increase the stress hormones, cortisol and others,

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:58.300
 and start turning the body protein into glucose

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:06.460
 or using it as the amino acids

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:10.540
 and start burning fatty acids from storage.

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:16.900
 And that doesn't help the body.

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:21.980
 Provide enough glucose to the cells

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:26.580
 because the cells have been,

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:30.140
 something is blocking their ability to use the glucose.

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:35.140
 So, the traditional death from diabetes

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:40.860
 involved extremely rapid weight loss,

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:42.660
 eating your muscles,

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:47.660
 producing a high sugar content of the urine.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:52.700
 Even if you hadn't had any sugar for weeks,

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:57.820
 you would still be producing sugar in your urine

01:20:57.820 --> 01:21:00.100
 at the expense of body tissue.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:06.540
 And that was why diabetes was always quickly fatal.

01:21:06.540 --> 01:21:08.420
 - Fascinating, wow.

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:13.420
 - And two experimenters tried not depriving

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:17.660
 their patients of sugar.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:22.660
 They called it the sugar disease, the saccharin disease.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:27.660
 And so doctors thought if it's a sugar disease,

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.860
 they should not feed sugar.

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:34.860
 But that inevitably led to death by wasting.

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:39.620
 And two doctors decided what's the point

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:43.820
 of restricting sugar?

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.340
 Why not let them have as much as they crave

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:52.420
 if they're going to die from converting their body to sugar?

01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:57.760
 So they found that they craved about 12 ounces a day.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:02.260
 And when they ate a normal diet

01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:06.660
 and were allowed to have 12 ounces or so

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:11.220
 of purified, ordinary white sugar in addition,

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:14.580
 their patients recovered quickly.

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:15.460
 - Interesting.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.700
 In general, if we're gonna have, say,

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:19.300
 a piece of fish and a vegetable at night,

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:23.700
 is it helpful to also have a little bit of a carb

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.700
 or a little potato or rice or something?

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.780
 - Yeah, before bedtime.

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:33.780
 Hot flashes, people have found that a lot of carbohydrate,

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:40.100
 I think they used cornstarch or rice or something like that,

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:47.100
 they found they could stop night sweats and hot flashes

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:50.780
 just by giving them a very big dose of carbohydrate.

01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.980
 - Carbohydrate.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.780
 Have you ever heard about the idea of the rice diet

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:57.180
 where you just eat white rice, I think,

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.900
 until your illness goes away?

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.220
 Do you think there's anything to that?

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.700
 I mean, that's a whole thing out there.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.900
 - Yeah, I think it's closely related

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:10.820
 to what those two doctors demonstrated,

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:15.820
 that your body can have very high requirements

01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:19.980
 for sugar when it's under stress.

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.140
 - Oh, I see.

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:24.880
 - If you really meet those high needs,

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:30.900
 you can turn off the stress and that ends the disease.

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:35.060
 - Oh, because the person has kind of let go

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.740
 of whatever is kind of stressful

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.940
 and then the disease will kind of work itself out.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:40.780
 - Yeah.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.700
 - Yeah.

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.660
 Dr. Peat, how do we stop the medical police state

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.380
 from taking over the world?

01:23:46.380 --> 01:23:48.980
 Even Lillich gave up in 2002,

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.100
 saying it was not possible anymore.

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.000
 What do you think?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.500
 - What happened?

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.340
 - Stopping the medical police state

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:58.100
 from taking over the world.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:03.260
 - It already has taken control,

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:08.260
 so it's a matter of working our way out of it.

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:14.020
 All kinds of dropout systems would be helpful.

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.980
 - Dr. Peat, what do you suggest for someone on insulin

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:22.980
 because of diagnosed diabetes with ketoacidosis

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.700
 and high 1,5-0 fasting blood glucose,

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.660
 adding carbs makes it higher.

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.140
 Should one continue with insulin

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:34.080
 while following your recommendations?

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:41.940
 - A couple of people have done it half-heartedly.

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:46.180
 No one tried the 12 ounces a day thing

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:53.220
 because of fear of hyperglycemia in itself.

01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:58.940
 And usually you will stop the acidosis and ketosis

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:04.460
 just by letting your blood sugar go higher

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:05.700
 than it's supposed to be.

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.820
 - I see.

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:11.700
 How can you tell if you need ACV,

01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:14.500
 apple cider vinegar, or HCL?

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:21.220
 - Those can help to acidify your stomach,

01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:26.220
 but they are very unlikely to be the whole solution

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.860
 if you don't get your thyroid going.

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:32.060
 - If you don't get Mr. Thyroid happy.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:32.940
 Here's another one for you.

01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:34.540
 This is interesting from Carol.

01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:39.540
 Is iodine deficiency the cause of the thinning of hair shaft?

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.140
 What can I do to thicken it?

01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:45.660
 I'm a girl, vanity-driven, and it drives me to be healthier.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:47.260
 Okay, so she got thinning.

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:49.140
 Is iodine, is that part?

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:53.660
 - In the 1970s in the US,

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:58.020
 there was a study of a large population

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:03.020
 and they found that almost all Americans

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:08.460
 were getting too much iodine from iodized salt

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:15.060
 and the use of iodized salt in preparing foods and so on.

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:21.780
 And that would indicate that an excess of iodine

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:27.300
 nowadays for most people is the problem.

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:28.580
 - An excess, wow.

01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:33.860
 - I've got about 70 some references

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:39.460
 showing on big population studies

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:44.180
 that as little as half a milligram a day

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:49.180
 of added iodine or dietary iodine total

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:57.100
 was enough to cause long-range cumulative

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:01.180
 deterioration of the thyroid gland.

01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:03.340
 - Ooh, but all these people out there

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:08.340
 recommending iodine for hypothyroid people, right?

01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.900
 I mean, there's a lot of that going around.

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.020
 - Wow, yeah.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:17.740
 So if we're using like a Celtic or you know,

01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:20.380
 those sea salt, like Celtic or one of those,

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:23.140
 there's enough iodine in there that's all we need?

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.140
 - Yeah. - Okay.

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:30.780
 - Possibly more than enough.

01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:33.780
 I haven't seen the exact amount,

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:38.780
 but definitely iodized salt because of the other foods

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:45.380
 which now have added iodized salt

01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:50.820
 is in the United States and Europe at least,

01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:53.060
 it's creating an excess.

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:57.300
 There are still places in central China

01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:02.020
 and the Andes that are very deficient in iodine.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.340
 - Interesting.

01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:05.980
 Ruth wants to know, can you please ask Dr. Peat

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:10.860
 what he thinks of strophanthesis,

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.540
 the herb for the heart.

01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:17.540
 Do you know that one, Dr., S-T-R-O-P-H-A-N-T-H-U-S?

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:22.380
 - Say the word strophanthesis?

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:27.380
 - Strophanthesis, S-T-R-O-P-H-A-N-T-H-U-S.

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:35.940
 - I don't know what that--

01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:37.780
 - Yeah, I think it's a Brazilian herb

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.100
 that I think even Dr. Townes,

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.420
 I think he uses it for heart people,

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.620
 but if you're not familiar with it, understandable.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.780
 Dr. Peat, from Antonio,

01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.900
 I started taking Sinoplus three months ago

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:54.540
 when I determined my temperature was always low

01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:56.340
 regardless of what I took.

01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:57.780
 I recently had a lab test

01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:01.820
 and the results of my Free T3 was 4.7.

01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:03.820
 My temperature is still a bit low,

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:08.340
 but I do not feel I have symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:12.620
 Should I be concerned about the high Free T3 score?

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:18.900
 - No, part of the lab norm for T3

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:26.900
 is because of the widespread use of things

01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:33.860
 like pure T4 supplements,

01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:39.780
 Synthroid for example, L-thyroxine,

01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:43.620
 or iodine supplementation.

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:50.660
 I think it's better to look at your TSH.

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:56.580
 It should be well below 1.0.

01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.700
 - Wow, well below that.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:02.380
 So if your TH was one, two, three, or four,

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.540
 would you keep taking something like an H-athroid

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:09.300
 or which has all the T3s and T4s together

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:10.860
 until it gets down there?

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:11.700
 - Yeah.

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:12.860
 - And how long do you have to take it

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:14.820
 before you would recheck?

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:18.660
 - Oh, check your temperature every day.

01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.140
 - Okay, but I mean, as far as the lab,

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.580
 how long would you say,

01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:25.940
 well, I'm on 60 milligrams and maybe I need 120.

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:30.220
 How long would you go before you tested the TSH?

01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:34.060
 - I would rely on symptoms and temperature.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.980
 - Symptoms and temperature, okay.

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:41.780
 - Your heart rate should get up consistently to,

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:47.660
 I would say at least 80 during the daytime

01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:52.060
 and your temperature should be at least 98.6.

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:55.060
 - At least 98.6, right.

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.500
 Do you think that those thermometer things

01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:01.420
 you put on your forehead,

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:02.900
 do you think they're accurate?

01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:07.460
 - I can't see how they could be accurate

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:12.460
 if the air temperature is, say, 40 degrees outside

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:18.260
 or 110 degrees.

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:24.940
 Your skin just can't compensate.

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:27.620
 - Just can't figure it out, huh?

01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:28.660
 Yeah.

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.820
 Well, it's fast and easy,

01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:31.620
 so you just get an old-fashioned,

01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:32.860
 I guess, mercury thermometer.

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.100
 You can still find them

01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:36.260
 and they're the most accurate, I guess.

01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:38.460
 - Yeah, the most accurate,

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:43.460
 but a quick and easy thing is the eardrum thermometer.

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.020
 - Oh, let me see.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:46.260
 I don't know about those.

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:49.180
 So is that something you stick all the way in your ear?

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:54.180
 - No, it's an infrared from the eardrum

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:58.100
 and it has to be aimed just right,

01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:01.500
 so you should take two or three readings at a time.

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:02.780
 - How do you know if it's just right?

01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:05.260
 I mean, when you stick it, it's as dark down there.

01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:10.740
 - Just try aiming it in different directions

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:15.740
 and you'll see a certain feel

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:22.420
 will give you repeated higher temperature.

01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:23.780
 - I'm sorry, I lost you there.

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.700
 A certain--

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.980
 - A certain feeling.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.140
 If it's aimed sideways,

01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:36.140
 it's getting the canal temperature from the skin.

01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:40.340
 - And not the eardrum, right?

01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:44.540
 - But the eardrum is very close to the brain temperature

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:49.540
 and I've noticed that a different kind of mental activity

01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:55.260
 will make either my right ear or the left ear hotter.

01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:56.740
 - That's great.

01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:58.860
 It's always something here.

01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:01.100
 Couple more for you before we let you go.

01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.540
 Dr. Peat, this is from Chris in Canada.

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.540
 What do you think of cooking in pressure cookers

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:09.100
 like meat, for example?

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.300
 - It doesn't generally taste very good.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.780
 - Yeah, it really doesn't, does it?

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:19.140
 - Quick cooking at normal pressure,

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:24.100
 I think is the best for taste and health.

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.060
 - Yeah.

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:26.060
 Here's one for you.

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:29.620
 How can you tell if a underactive thyroid problem

01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:34.500
 is specifically conversion from T4 to T3 within the cell

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:38.220
 versus T4 production or transportation problem?

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.740
 Could this be a minor iodine or selenium deficiency

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:46.740
 easily remedied by adding these in micro amounts?

01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:51.740
 - Yeah, selenium, I think 100 micrograms

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:54.500
 is a safe supplement.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:00.500
 And selenium is essential for the local production

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:01.900
 in the tissue.

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.740
 - Oh.

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:05.180
 - So it's always good to try that.

01:34:05.180 --> 01:34:09.860
 But eating shellfish or seafood, halibut,

01:34:09.860 --> 01:34:13.860
 or cod or sole, for example,

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.900
 will provide enough selenium

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:21.100
 to keep your tissue supply active.

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.140
 - I know you're not a big supplement fan,

01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:26.220
 but so you say that we all could maybe benefit

01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:28.860
 from 100 mg of selenium?

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:30.660
 - Very often, yeah.

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:31.900
 It's a safe amount.

01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:35.020
 - And then you like that Progest-Ease, right?

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:35.940
 That one.

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:38.420
 You think that's valuable, regular?

01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:42.460
 - Yeah, that helps the thyroid in a variety of ways.

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.220
 - Any other things regularly

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.660
 that people should think about?

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:50.900
 - Enough carbohydrate in the diet is essential.

01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:52.180
 - Enough carbohydrates.

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.820
 Well, great, man, we like carbs, right?

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:54.980
 They're fun.

01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.300
 - Yeah, too much.

01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.500
 Berta Barnes himself demonstrated

01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:04.900
 that a high meat protein intake

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:08.220
 powerfully suppressed the thyroid.

01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:16.420
 - Okay, finally, ask about the thyroid antibody test, please.

01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:20.580
 Oh, yeah, what is that about, thyroid antibody tests?

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:26.220
 - The usual misunderstanding is that antibodies

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:33.100
 are just destroying, causing the problem,

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:38.100
 but antibodies are a cleanup process.

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:43.340
 You can see the background in theory by Jamie Cunliffe

01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:48.300
 and Polly Mattsinger.

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:52.580
 They take a different approach to the immune system.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:57.580
 And the real function compatible with their theory,

01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:02.820
 the real function of antibodies

01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:06.380
 is to clean up damaged tissue.

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:12.300
 And for example, iodine intake is one thing

01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:14.420
 that damages the thyroid gland.

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:20.420
 And eventually you'll develop antibodies

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:26.140
 in the process of cleaning up damaged thyroid cells.

01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:31.140
 So you'll show elevation of anti-thyroid antibodies.

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:37.380
 - But so you're saying the conventional wisdom

01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:40.340
 about the thyroid antibody test

01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:42.900
 is the antibodies are supposed to be there

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:45.380
 and they're doing what they need to do.

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:50.380
 - Yeah, and in the case of viral damage, for example,

01:36:50.380 --> 01:37:00.180
 the antibodies are as much cleaning up the damaged tissue

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:06.180
 and in the process, they sort of accidentally

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.940
 destroy the virus that's causing it.

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:16.020
 And their theories, the whole process of immunity

01:37:16.020 --> 01:37:21.900
 is based on a cleanup maintenance system

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:28.660
 in which the so-called pathogen

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:33.700
 get involved and be destroyed.

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:37.500
 - And so that's the argument with Cowan and Kaufman

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.780
 and all these other folks that the viruses,

01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:42.380
 these so-called viruses, so-called,

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.820
 we don't even have to call them now,

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.100
 they're actually there cleaning things up.

01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:52.220
 - Well, it's our maintenance system

01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:58.020
 which cleans up the viruses.

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:01.900
 - Our maintenance system cleans up the virus.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:06.180
 - No matter what has caused the damage,

01:38:07.340 --> 01:38:12.020
 malnutrition or whatever sensitizes the tissue

01:38:12.020 --> 01:38:17.020
 and it starts falling apart, getting inflamed.

01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:23.300
 We produce antibodies actually as a repair process

01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:24.700
 for the damage.

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:25.620
 - Okay.

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:29.700
 - And anything that has caused the damage

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.260
 will get caught up in the process

01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:36.780
 and taken out with the debris.

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:38.180
 - Anything that have caused the damage

01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:41.820
 which could be chemicals or, I don't know,

01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:43.700
 stress or anything, right?

01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.460
 - Yeah, stress, malnutrition.

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.700
 - Malnutrition, well.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.100
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks for being here today.

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:53.500
 It was fun having you, thanks a lot.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.540
 It's always an honor to talk to you

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:59.980
 and well, we'll just see how we move on forward

01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:03.060
 with all this COVID thing and all the political stuff.

01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:05.020
 So you take care of yourself.

01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:08.140
 Again, if you'd like to get Dr. Peat's newsletter,

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:13.140
 it's raypeats, that's plural, newsletter@gmail.com.

01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:17.340
 raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:19.260
 Again, Doc, thank you so much.

01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:20.500
 - Okay, thank you.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.460
 - Bye-bye.

01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:26.460
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:31.700
 Okay, so we're just gonna kind of focus on the audio

01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.080
 but even that we had an issue with this morning

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.900
 which is strange, you know?

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:38.260
 You know, it's kind of a karmic thing

01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:40.740
 because we're just trying to understand

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.980
 the whole video thing and what we can do

01:39:42.980 --> 01:39:45.380
 and if it's gonna be worth it or not.

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:48.060
 I think Sharon and I are leaning more and more

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.060
 towards the idea that the important thing

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:53.860
 is to get the information and the words

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:57.220
 and the right questions for these guests, for you,

01:39:57.220 --> 01:39:58.940
 so you can understand what's going on.

01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.780
 I can do that, I'm pretty good at it.

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:06.600
 And that's more important than the video stuff.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.900
 And so we're just gonna kind of do it this way for a bit.

01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:13.120
 We can put the guest on video.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.840
 I'm just not gonna, you know, get him,

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:19.600
 I don't even know what, if it even makes sense

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.440
 for me anymore to get on video.

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.560
 We don't even know where we can put these things.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.920
 Most places are so dysfunctional now,

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.480
 they're just censoring and so we have our issues there

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:30.720
 and they're just working that out.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.860
 So stay tuned, we're gonna have better and better people

01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:36.580
 all the time right here at One Radio Network.

01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:39.340
 People you're not gonna hear anywhere else,

01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:43.020
 anywhere else, well, maybe, kinda, sorta,

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:45.420
 but good people and being presented

01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:50.420
 with the right questions that you are interested in hearing.

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:51.700
 That's my job.

01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.500
 So I love you all very much, thank you.

01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.700
 You did great today.

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:57.620
 Thanks for going through any kind of weird things

01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:58.900
 we had going on with the audio,

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:03.900
 but the entire Ray Peed and Richard Massey show

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:08.900
 will be on there as an audio podcast real soon,

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:13.140
 sometime in a few hours later on today.

01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:15.140
 So please pass on these links to everyone

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.900
 that you care about and we appreciate

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:21.220
 your ongoing support, very important for us here

01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:22.260
 at One Radio Network.

01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:24.500
 So if you wanna buy some stuff for your health

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:27.380
 and, you know, Sir Thrivill and hydrogen

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:30.820
 and things like that, check it out.

01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.500
 And we think we have some of the best.

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.980
 I just wanna give a little plug here before I go

01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:37.980
 because I just noticed I hadn't talked about it,

01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:41.300
 but this air purifier that I have

01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:46.700
 that called the Air Doctor, this is really cool, folks.

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.460
 I mean, this is one of the best things I've ever,

01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:50.380
 it's just great.

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:54.060
 It's about, let's see, it's a little bit bigger

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:57.700
 than a tower computer, not much bigger, a little taller,

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:01.260
 and it's very slim and sleek and well-built.

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:04.660
 It's super quiet and you put it on automatic

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:08.580
 and it just purifies everything in the house, right?

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:10.660
 It just keeps moving air through there

01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:12.420
 and I don't care what it is.

01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:13.460
 So this is what's cool.

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:16.220
 This thing is about, oh, 25 feet, I think,

01:42:16.220 --> 01:42:18.740
 or maybe 20 feet from my stove.

01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:23.100
 And you can cook something, just pretty much anything,

01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:27.020
 and you'll hear the little fan, since it's on auto,

01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:28.980
 just go up a notch or two

01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.060
 to get rid of whatever's coming out.

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.740
 And especially if you do bacon

01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:34.780
 and you get a little smoky thing going in bacon,

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.540
 man, this thing just kinda turns up

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:39.620
 and it cleans up all the little smoke and all the whatever.

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.700
 I mean, I like bacon smell, it's great.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:43.860
 And then it goes back down.

01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:46.420
 You just leave it on 24/7 on auto.

01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:48.540
 It's very easy to change out the filters

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:49.580
 and it tells you when to do it

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.260
 and you don't have to do it very often.

01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:56.180
 It's one of the coolest and just amazing little thing.

01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:58.220
 It gets rid of toxic ozone,

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:01.020
 volatile organic chemicals, gases.

01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:05.060
 If you get kinda little things from the outside,

01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:10.020
 maybe you're sensitive to pollen or mold or whatever,

01:43:10.020 --> 01:43:11.520
 this is gonna clear things up.

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:14.340
 And there could be things going on in your home

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:17.340
 from outside that you just don't even know about.

01:43:17.340 --> 01:43:19.060
 And this could do the deed.

01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.740
 I think this whole deal I got, I bought a whole bunch.

01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:25.220
 I think I bought a year's worth of a whole box of filters

01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:26.820
 'cause they're cheaper when you buy 'em.

01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:29.460
 I think it was like 450 bucks or something

01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:31.380
 for the whole deal delivered.

01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:33.060
 It's called the Air Doctor.

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:34.140
 I highly recommend it.

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.720
 It's a beautiful little unit.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.460
 Just very pleased to have it around the house.

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:41.860
 I sent one up to Sharon for Christmas and she loves it.

01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:43.820
 She said, "Man, this thing is really cool."

01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:44.720
 Yeah, it's great.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.340
 And if you're really having some health issues,

01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:51.620
 I would put that puppy right in your bedroom.

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.020
 And maybe there is some mold going on.

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:55.340
 Maybe, who knows?

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.980
 I mean, we don't know, you know?

01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.820
 Who knows?

01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:58.640
 So this is cool.

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.920
 It's called the Air Doctor and it's on oneradionetwork.com.

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:06.140
 So if you've been looking or thinking about an air purifier,

01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:06.980
 check it out.

01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:10.580
 I think you'll find this one really, really great.

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:15.160
 And we use all the different things that we promote.

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.980
 So we're not gonna sell you any dumb stuff.

01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:19.300
 Just not gonna do it.

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:20.980
 Very, very particular.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.500
 We know the source.

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:23.980
 All right, kids, I love you all very much.

01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:26.980
 We'll see you tomorrow with Dr. Christopher Exley

01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:28.620
 on aluminum, num, num, num.

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.260
 He's one of the foremost experts.

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:34.100
 Happens at 10 o'clock tomorrow, central time.

01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:36.780
 We're starting at 10 pretty much every morning

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:38.340
 and we'll stream things.

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:41.540
 Judy Mikovitch as well, Dr. Gabriel Cousins,

01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:45.180
 German New Medicine next week with Dr. Jennifer Daniels.

01:44:45.180 --> 01:44:46.380
 A lot of cool people coming up.

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.780
 I have a whole list of people that I wanna get on.

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:51.860
 We'll stay on top of the whole political thing.

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:56.100
 We're gonna stay on top of the whole COVID extravaganza.

01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.500
 You know, who knows, excuse me,

01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:59.700
 who knows what they're gonna do with this thing.

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:05.980
 The last we've heard, President-elect Joe Biden,

01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:07.940
 if he's inaugurated on Wednesday,

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:10.100
 and there are many people saying that he ain't gonna be,

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:11.820
 but that's another story.

01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:14.820
 But if he is, that he's ready to roll out.

01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:20.260
 Green New Deal, but right away,

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:25.700
 a masking, mandate masking for the whole country.

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.580
 And so you just might wanna go to our new website.

01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:32.900
 It's called Just Say No to Joe.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.220
 No, I'm just kidding.

01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.460
 I tried to get that URL, Just Say No to Joe,

01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:38.460
 and they wanted $400 for it.

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.660
 They're thinking ahead.

01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.180
 I thought it'd be fun to have

01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.340
 because I don't care what this guy says.

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.700
 I'm not doing any of it.

01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:46.300
 Except pay my taxes.

01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:47.140
 That's it.

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:49.900
 Otherwise, who cares?

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:54.060
 And then also keep an eye on the whole gold and silver thing

01:45:54.060 --> 01:45:57.060
 because all this money,

01:45:57.060 --> 01:45:59.160
 all this money that they're talking about,

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.900
 1.9 trillion, right, COVID relief bill

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:05.940
 that they're gonna run through

01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:07.380
 because they have the Senate now,

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:10.260
 they're gonna run it through probably the first week.

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:13.380
 1.9 trillion, a very small amount of that

01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.580
 is gonna go to you.

01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:17.340
 They're gonna send you $1,500 to keep you quiet,

01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:19.860
 but I don't know where all the rest of the money's going.

01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:23.580
 You have to read the 5,000-page bill, which nobody does.

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.880
 And all this money comes from

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.260
 the expansion of the money supply.

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.580
 That's the only place it comes from.

01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:32.540
 The government is over $30 trillion in debt.

01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:33.640
 There's no money.

01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.060
 They've got no money.

01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:36.940
 They create treasury bonds.

01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:38.860
 They borrow money from the Fed

01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:41.020
 or somebody else that's silly enough

01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:46.020
 to loan them money at 1% interest for 10 years,

01:46:46.020 --> 01:46:48.660
 which isn't even keeping up from inflation.

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:51.420
 So the likelihood of gold and silver going up

01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.660
 in the next few years,

01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:54.540
 if Mr. Biden is in there in the globalist,

01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:55.380
 well, he won't be there.

01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.460
 It'll be Kamala because Sleepy Joe

01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:00.820
 will probably just go to sleep someday.

01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:03.500
 And Kamala will be Kamala.

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.140
 She'll be running things and God knows,

01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:09.100
 Green New Deal, all this stuff, trillions of dollars.

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:12.340
 So it all comes from the expansion of the money supply.

01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:15.380
 That's where it comes from, where it comes from.

01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:19.140
 And that's got to mean be bullish for gold and silver,

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:23.380
 antiques, old cars, anything that's real,

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:25.600
 some real estate, but you gotta be careful there.

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.200
 But anything that's real with a limited amount of stuff.

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.500
 That should go up in value

01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:35.980
 when you increase the money supply.

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.220
 And they're gonna do it.

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:38.820
 There's no way around it.

01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.220
 There's no option.

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.020
 There's no doubt about it.

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:44.100
 With all this socialist stuff they're gonna do,

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:47.060
 you know they're gonna go to a universal basic income

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.060
 when they can.

01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.380
 They're already raising the,

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:52.520
 they wanna raise the minimum wage thing,

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.180
 which is gonna drive more businesses out of business

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.140
 'cause they can't do it,

01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.860
 which is another one of their goals

01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:03.920
 is to drive more businesses out of business.

01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:07.620
 They're gonna bring in 10 million illegal aliens

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.980
 and make 'em citizens and they'll give them money

01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:12.900
 and they'll vote for them in the next four years from now.

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.060
 These people are out of control.

01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:16.980
 They're socialists, they're communists,

01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:19.780
 they're New World Order people, they're globalists.

01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:22.020
 And this is what we're in store for

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:25.160
 if Sleepy Joe is inaugurated on Wednesday.

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.700
 So we're gonna have to get very creative,

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:30.900
 batten the hatches, full steam ahead,

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.180
 and we'll be here to help keep your eye on the ball

01:48:34.180 --> 01:48:37.980
 so you can navigate and thrive during the coming

01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:43.020
 tumultuous times with looks likes we're gonna get our share.

01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:47.140
 But we'll be fine.

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:48.860
 Thank you for your ongoing support.

01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:51.060
 I love you all very much.

01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:52.220
 See you tomorrow at 10.
