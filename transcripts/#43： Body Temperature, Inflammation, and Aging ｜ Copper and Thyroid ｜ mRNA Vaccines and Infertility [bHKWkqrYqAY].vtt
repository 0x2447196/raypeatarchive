00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures that are defensive.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 and that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 What if free people could live secure in the knowledge

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant US retaliation to deter a Soviet attack,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 I know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished by the British.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Their technologies, the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this year,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Space shuttle is very difficult to do, one would think.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 It seems the sweep of technology has no limits.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 The robot can talk and take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and poured beer all over the counter.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 The robot's designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Thank you guys for joining us. Raymond Peat, Georgi Dinkov.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Ray, how are you? How are things in Eugene, Oregon?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Very good. The usual cold, wet and dark winter.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 And Georgi, how are things in DC?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Dark, but for different reasons.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 It's just the political climate is murkier than it was a week ago.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 We had some snow yesterday, but it's all melted by now. It's just cold and windy, but dry.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 I want to devolve into political things, but first I want to tackle Ray's newsletter.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Ray, maybe giving us an elevator pitch and going through and talking about your newsletter,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 Body Temperature, Inflammation and Aging. I think that would be a great place to start.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Then we could swing into political things. Maybe give us your motivation for writing it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 I've just been watching for many years people, doctors, like a totally psychotic woman.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Her brother said, but isn't it significant that her eardrum temperature is only 96 degrees?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 And the doctor said, oh, but that's normal for these people.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 And about 40 years ago, a woman supposedly with dementia,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 she couldn't find her way home if she was let out of the house by herself.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 She mentioned that her temperature had been as low as 92 degrees.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 And when she took a little progesterone and got her body warm,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 she returned to graduate school and got straight A's for a master's degree.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So just warming up the brain five or six degrees, you can gain about 60 or 70 IQ points.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And when I was working on physiology of hamster aging,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 I noticed that there were some changes that worked under the influence of either temperature or hormones.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And estrogen, which lowers your temperature, happened to cause microtubules to appear.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And progesterone, which actually raised the temperature, had the opposite effect on the microtubules.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And I started thinking about the effect of cold and hot water

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 when the microtubules are sensitive to the structural temperature of the water,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 how much order there is in it. And there are lots of enzymes in our cells

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 that are structurally sensitive to the temperature of the environment, for example,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 to the degree that as the temperature goes down,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 some enzymes are suddenly totally inactivated while others are activated.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And so it isn't just a chemical reaction, but it's a shift in the structure

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 according to the temperature of the water.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And so there's something about mammals and birds that they function very well

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 if they live at or above 37 degrees Celsius, about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Birds very often like a much, much higher temperature.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 But every organism has a specific range where its enzymes work,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 and the transition can be very sudden.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 And there's a system that has just been more recently discovered

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 called the heat shock proteins.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And it happens that estrogen receptors are closely tied into the heat shock proteins.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 And so what these proteins and estrogen are doing is trying to save the terribly stressed organism

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 that doesn't have the heat to keep working.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 It does something to lock the structure up and protect it structurally.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 And you can see that in the appearance and disappearance of microtubules

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 and the activity of various enzymes.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And anyway, that has been in the background of watching people when they take thyroid

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 or need thyroid or warm up their brains by taking progesterone

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 or eating more sugar and protein and so on.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 And so the fact that the national temperature, especially in the last 50 years,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 has dropped about a degree Fahrenheit for men and somewhat less for young women,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 but for postmenopausal women their temperature has fallen about as much as men.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 And so the fact that women, young women, have a higher body temperature than the average man

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 is an indicator of progesterone ruling their physiology enough to keep them working

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 and avoiding some of the aging diseases that men get as long as they steal or are cycling

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 and making progesterone.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 And so in this newsletter I just go through all of the things that have been known

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 relating to inflammation, aging, degeneration, and disease

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 as it relates to failing to keep your temperature up where it should be.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 Silly question, but the microtubules, is that the same thing as the cytoskeleton of the cell?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 It's a big part of it.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 It's the big hollow ones that are involved in cell division

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 and part of the system of movement.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 But there are several types of smaller intermediate and smaller filaments.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Wasn't there a recent study showing that pregnenolone is one of the most effective stabilizers

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 of the structure of the microtubules and cholesterol as well?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Cholesterol, pregnenolone, and progesterone.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And we talked about it a while ago, Ray, the hardening and the suppleness of tissue or a cell

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 and that being a big part about aging and energy.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And unfortunately this was, I think it was an interview that never actually aired.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 But it was really interesting talking about energy having a softening effect

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 and then the deprivation of energy having this hardening effect.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And that's of course associated with fibrosis and calcification, correct?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And cancer.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 There are several articles that are very interesting.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 For example, once you know that a tumor hardens, these people will say that, for example,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 for telling whether breast cancer has spread to the lymph nodes,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 all you have to do is feel for the lymph nodes and see if they're abnormally hardened.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 If they're not hardened, they're not cancerous.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 And you see estrogen as one of the primary hardening aspects of aging and things like that.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 That's driving the hardening.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 - Anything that knocks the energy down.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 - And it's kind of odd, like the carbon dioxide and the generation of heat have totally been sidelined

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 as the effects of proper mitochondrial respiration.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 But people in the health world are so obsessed with mitochondria,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 but those two things are rarely ever talked about.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Is that a little strange?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 - Very strange.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 That's part of what organizes my thinking, looking at the reason and the nature of the myths

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 that people have created to support their way of life and their belief system.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 And mostly the giant corporations that run science and publication.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 The ignoring temperature in my newsletter, I talk about the basis that goes back to the idea

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 that Raymond Pearl, a professor at Johns Hopkins, promoted that if you live fast and warm,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 you'll use up all your heartbeats and burn all your permitted calories and have to die young.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 And so he advocated being very lazy and staying cool to live a long time.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 - Was he just stupid or was he supported by industry?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Like is there a specific outcome for the rate of living theory?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 - He was immersed in the matrix of industry, so that was all part of it.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 But I think he had to be really pretty stupid.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 You put up a picture of a hummingbird right below his picture,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 and you can see the difference in vitality and mentality between the two organisms.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 - His experiment was on seeds or something?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 It sounds, I mean, to me, a layman, it sounds really stupid.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 It just sounds really ridiculous of what his experiment was.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 - Once you get used to it, that's not at all unusual.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 For example, someone was just asking me about the telomere theory of aging

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 and the idea that we have an inborn number of cell divisions,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 which really derives straight from Pearl's idea that we have only so many heartbeats

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 or so many calories that we can produce in a lifespan.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 For Hayflick, it was so many cell divisions that were allotted.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And the first group of his papers that I read was in 1970.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 And I had to show them around to my friends

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 because I couldn't believe that anyone could really say such stupid things.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 And his whole career, if you see it in terms of, for example,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 one paper, he kept one group of cells frozen in liquid nitrogen,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 very cold for a year or two, and another he kept in the lab in the usual dish.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And his conclusion was that being frozen at minus 70 degrees Celsius or whatever it was,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 cells don't age.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 - Well, sure.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 - Your orientation was shaped before this by Albert St. Georgi.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 So you were kind of reading the good stuff,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 and that's why these ideas seem so ridiculous to you when you were confronted with them?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 - Oh, yeah.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 But I had started reading the encyclopedias,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 which even the little Funk and Wagnalls had very good objective articles in it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And then we got the 1950 Britannica, and some of its articles are still the best on the subject available.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 The newer 1960s editions have gone somewhat stupid compared to the classics.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 From 1900 to the 1950s, the Britannica was a great source of orientation in science and culture.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 - Yes, Albert, I'm sorry, Albert St. Georgi was much later.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Was there a counter, was Lamarck like the counter to this kind of rate of living theory,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 or you're talking about the Britannica?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Was there an idea that was suppressed in favor of the rate of living theory?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 - Yeah, it grew most directly out of August Weissman's wear and tear theory.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 The rate of living is just another version of Weissman's wear and tear.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 And the free radicals, Denham-Harman's theory of free radical aging, damage to the mitochondria,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 that's just more wear and tear theory.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 And part of the essence of Weissman's ideology was to destroy Lamarck and actual Darwinism

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 to support the essentially idealistic, anti-evolutionary position of the, what's the first geneticist?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 The monk Mendel, Gregor Mendel.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 His position was simply derived from Catholic doctrine, that nothing essential changes.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Genes are immortal, and so the apparent changes that you see that are mistaken for evolution

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 are just mixing immortal genes.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 For Weissman, the germline is immortal, and the body, the soma, is mortal.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 So Weissman was just rephrasing the Christian doctrine of Mendel.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 And so those were getting built into the authoritarian side of the medical and biological cultures.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Meanwhile, there was the actual science going along at ground level with people like Jacques Loeb

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 and Alexis Carroll, Otto Warburg and St. Georgi and so on.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Okay, so Otto Warburg, they would have been like the pro, they would have been the vitalists

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 or the animists compared to the 1928 Raymond Pearl types.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 I'm trying to say, who were the pro-metabolic people in the '30s?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Well, Warburg, obviously, and Frederick Koch.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Frederick Koch inspired at least St. Georgi, and I don't think Warburg ever said anything about Koch,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 but his ideas were really kind of vitalistic or holistic, because he said the whole organism

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 is the immune system, that the vitality of the whole thing isn't separable.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And that's what the mainline embryologists were seeing, that you can take part of an early embryo

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 and isolate it, and it will produce a whole organism.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 So it's not an assemblage of parts.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 The ovum has an intention, and if you cut the dividing parts of the ovum into several pieces,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 each one can still fulfill its intention of becoming a whole organism.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 And that idea continued into field theories of all sorts in the '20s and '30s,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 and people recognizing Warburg's work, for example, saw that if you look at an area that's developing a cancer,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 you can find at the center a perfect malignant bunch of cells, but surrounding that,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 the next adrening ring of cells will be pre-malignant, very degenerated, but not decisively cancerous,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 and revertible if you change their embryological position or their place in the organism.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 And surrounding that is less and less inflamed cells.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 So in the '30s, there was lots of evidence showing that cancer is a field process

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 under some degree of control of the surrounding organism.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And in psychology, Gestalt psychology was extending that whole thing,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 thinking of the brain as similar to the organism, working in terms of holes,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 not wires and digital computable units, but as holes and images.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 That whole thing, the Second World War distracted from it,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 but there was a very deliberate killing off of it with several, both government and industry,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 trends to sell the idea that we are mechanisms,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 and to totally knock out of science history all of this holistic embryological field understanding of nature and the organism.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Have you had any discussion with people in regards to the telomere theory,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 proponents of the theory, and have you asked their opinion on how is it that if the rate of living is so important,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 if telomere length is so important, how come every attempt to inhibit telomerase seems to lead to cancer?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 There have been at least five or six companies.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 The enzyme telomerase, every time a company tries to come up with a drug to inhibit that enzyme

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 to preserve the length on telomeres, that seems to invariably cause cancer in pretty much every animal model that they've tried.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 I think it's just one of the organizing things that has to be whole to get a whole functioning organism.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 You can produce cancer in about a million different ways. I think that's just one of them.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Right. What I'm trying to get at is that it seems that trying to manipulate the telomere length,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 or at least artificially keep it long, which is kind of like the corollary of that rate of living or the long telomere thing,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 every time they come up with a drug that tries to keep the telomeres artificially long,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 they seem to be endangering some kind of a cancerous process.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Or at least all of the drugs that they've developed so far, that seems to be the end result so far.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 They've been cancerous in the animal models that they've tried.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 I went through the arguments. It's been about 15 or 20 years, I think.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 But at that time, there was accumulating very clear evidence that some very old 90- or 100-year-old individuals had long telomeres,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 and some young people in their 20s and 30s had extremely short, worn-out-looking telomeres.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 I think the correlation of it strictly with aging has been a biased sampling to fit the ideology.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 How do you think Richard Dawkins' ideas of the selfish gene grow out of Weissman's?

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Was he part of that group? I mean, he's not that old, but he seems to be sort of like the protege of Weissman,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 just living in modern times. He seems to be spitting out the same kind of nonsense.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 I think it's some kind of growing-up family personality development that happens.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Do you think maternal stress or having some sort of rough childhood leads people to develop such a twisted view of nature?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 He seems to be coming from a fairly well-off family, or at least a non-poor one.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Oh, yeah. They identify with the interests of the royalty and ruling classes.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 The ideology is classical, ancient doctrine that the divine right of kings is something built into the universe.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 For example, meritocracy derives from the idea of an unchanging, un-evolving social order.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Naturally, you can't have monkeys turning into people.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 If you're going to have divine kings, everything arranged in a heavenly order,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 a great chain of being from angels to kings, all the way down to ordinary people and monkeys near the bottom.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 It's so deeply into our culture. Most professors don't want to acknowledge that that's where our history has come from.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Bertrand Russell seems to have some of those views of doctrines, but I felt like by reading his works that he eventually realized that the ruling class is just trying to enslave everybody.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 And while he still wrote and did work in service of them, I think every once in a while he spoke the truth.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Do you have a similar impression of him?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Oh, absolutely. He was as high in the ruling class as you can be in England without being royal.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 And so he grew up with that perfect, concrete view of logic and mentality.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 He wanted to show that our divine mentality and clear logic is identical with mathematics.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 And then in middle age, he actually started thinking about it and said, well, we really don't know whether Leibniz might have been right,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 that everything is defined partly by where it is and what it's with.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 And if everything is part of one's being is where one is, then everything is constantly changing its essence.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 And so how can you have language and a perfect mathematical language if reality is actually context sensitive?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 If it makes a difference to the Earth, that the moon and the sun and Saturn and Mars are moving around in space,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 could it affect the essence of the Earth that other things are related to it in space and time?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 And Russell just had that simple insight.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 How can you define things in isolation? Where do we have the evidence that there are timeless entities, which atoms are believed to be?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 And at first he was calling the units of his thinking logical atoms.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 But as he thought more about the Leibnizian possibilities of metaphysics and ontology,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 he realized that there is no evidence basis for having these abstract atomic views of logic.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 So simply his ability being very intelligent, he was able to learn and actually think his way out of it.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 It sounds like maybe he was a radical empiricist later in life.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Yeah, pretty much. He didn't talk about it because there was no place to talk effectively.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 I think the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein also had a big impression on him because he was one of his students.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 And Wittgenstein then asked Bertrand Russell to write the foreword to his magnum opus,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, as it was called.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And Bertrand Russell wrote it and Wittgenstein absolutely hated it and said, "You think like a computer.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 This is not what this book is all about." And he had a falling out.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 And I think that's one of the things that Russell was devastated because he thought Wittgenstein was brilliant.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 And if this brilliant mind thinks that I'm dumb as a bag of rocks and I just don't get what logic and philosophy and life are all about,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 that I must change my…

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 He said that that was the event that made him turn to politics and social moral philosophy.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 He realized he wasn't smart enough, but he actually was intelligent enough to change his mind.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 I wanted to ask a question about carbon dioxide and temperature.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 I saw several studies performed in the '70s that were done in the United States,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 and they were giving people either vitamin B1 or acetylzolamide or the two together and also warming people up.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 And they were able to permanently cure severe psychiatric diseases that are nowadays still considered incurable.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 How is it possible that human trials like this could occur in the '70s and this knowledge is out there, widely available,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 and these things cannot seem to be possible to happen now? You just cannot get funding.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 If you try to convince a funding body to give you money for vitamin B1 or acetylzolamide,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 I'm pretty sure they will laugh you out of the room.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 What was different back then? I mean, it was still a fairly authoritarian time, wasn't it?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Yeah, and before that, some psychiatrists put some patients in the house with continuously elevated carbon dioxide,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 and all of their psychopathic conditions improved.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 And what that elevated CO2 does is to increase your metabolic rate and body temperature.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 So there have been lots of workable therapies, but no one sells those things.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 You can't make a trillion dollars selling thiamine or carbon dioxide.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 But they were still done in the '70s, right? And it was fairly large in terms of how many people were involved.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Those things seem to have completely died out and disappeared.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 So is this basically due to the fact that the pharma industry really took full control of academia over the last two, three decades?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Oh, yeah. It's a continuing process. They're trying to finish it off now.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 They're trying to even get the nuisance students and professors out of the universities and turn it over to a few, one or two corporations who will prepare the courses and sell the licenses to the students.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Doesn't this new model also completely, well, not completely, but move us further away from experimentation towards abstract thinking?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 I mean, how would experiments be performed if all the universities are closed?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Well, experiments have mostly been a nuisance to the business of science.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 You know, the journals just won't publish things that are anomalous seeming observations.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 You know the fate of Halton Arp and his pictures of galaxies.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 They wouldn't let him use their telescope anymore because he saw things he shouldn't have.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 I have a few friends that have chemical degrees, graduate degrees in chemistry, and little by little chemistry seems to move entirely towards the so-called in silico modeling.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Basically, they're just using computer models to design new molecules and predict the effects of those molecules in organisms.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 So I'm guessing that has some sort of a validity, but it seems that chemistry is moving towards trying to replace almost entirely the process of experimentation with modeling in a computer.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 Yeah, it will rarely cause embarrassment for anyone.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 The computers aren't going to invent anything shockingly unexpected, but experiments actually are constantly doing that.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Right, just for posterity, can we talk about the living fast, dying when, and the temperature in ROS and aging in general?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 This is something I'll be perusing Twitter and I'll still see people talking about increasing the metabolism increases the reactive oxygen species, and so maybe just unpacking that a little bit.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 The ability to detoxify the free radicals increases when your metabolic rate is higher.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Slowing your metabolic rate, you shift towards the reductive, anti-oxidative state, and you grossly slow down your ability to inactivate the free radicals that are produced.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And then, just a slightly related topic, but calorie, reducing calorie, calorie deficit models, am I saying that right?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 You pointed out in your Gender of Energy book that that could be from a multitude of different things, from PUFA restriction to heavy metal restriction.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 People online commonly talk about longevity and aging like they're the same thing, but they're not really the same, right?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 No, you can avoid the main things that kill old people and you can extend lifespan up to 90 or 100 or so, and that's what the genetic determinists emphasize.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 They say that the process is essentially mechanical and it's all foreordained whether by some Hayflick principle or the necessary accumulation of free radical damage.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 But the experiments that show that the more saturated fat animals live at a higher temperature without damage and live much longer than animals of a similar weight with highly unsaturated membranes.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 So the hotter you are, the more you revise your fats away from unsaturation.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 If you just grow soybeans, for example, in a hot, humid climate or in a northern climate where they usually grow them, they'll have more saturated fats when they grow in the more humid and warm climate.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And if you have a pig in the north eating the usual corn and beans diet, it's going to have very unsaturated fat in the layer under it, close to its skin, because the skin is constantly living at a lower temperature.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 But if you put a sweater on the pig so its skin doesn't get so chilled on the same diet, its subcutaneous fat will be much more saturated.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 So we adjust to keep the hot tissues from getting over-unsaturated and the breakdown largely in the mitochondria of polyunsaturated fats turns down the oxidation energy production

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 and lets only the random kind of oxidative damage occur.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Aren't the polyunsaturated fats, in contrast to the saturated ones, aren't the PUFAs also deactivating the uncoupling enzymes, the ones that raise temperature?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Yeah, in general, the life-extending things do increase the uncoupling activity.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 I've also seen several studies showing that lower temperature increases the activity of the enzyme aromatase. Have you seen anything in regards to that effect?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Yeah, a Russian experimenter noticed that the temperature connection of both testicles and ovaries live considerably cooler than the core temperature of the body.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 And that's surprising in the case of ovaries because they're in the core of the body, but they have some kind of a cooling system that keeps their temperature lower.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 And so he chopped up bits of ovaries and implanted them under the ear skin of rabbits.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Their long ears in a cool climate are several degrees cooler than the rest of the body.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 And he found that they went into constant estrus and they had the ovaries living at that very low temperature.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 So they were overproducing estrogen, basically?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Yeah.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 What do you think is the adaptive function of the chronic inflammation that seems to be happening under constant exposure to low temperature?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Is it like a desperate attempt to raise temperature because the inflammation usually triggers some kind of a fever?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 I don't think I understand why it happens.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 The proper response to injury doesn't involve inflammation, and so I think those are being used in a way that they weren't intended by the organism to be used.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 I think they function in a healthy environment, in a complete well-nourished environment with the right oxygen tension and so on.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 I think they function as regulators and don't really turn on that anti-biological kind of inflammation.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 So if a person's or if an organism's stores of fat were, let's say, 100% saturated, when they're exposed to cold, there wouldn't necessarily be an inflammatory response.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 That fat will flood the bloodstream, but if saturated fats have an uncoupling effect, then basically that would serve the purpose of raising temperature, but in a positive manner,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 versus the PUFAs, when they flood the bloodstream when it's cold due to increased lipolysis, they will simply serve as a precursor to the inflammatory mediator.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 So it will still raise temperature, but in a very pathological and disadaptive way.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 Yeah, I think that's part of why injured fetuses inside the womb don't heal by forming a scar.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 They heal perfectly, just like a fragment of an embryo can complete itself.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 A damaged part of a fetus can regenerate itself without forming a scar.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 I think that's because of the high temperature, steady temperature, and carbon dioxide and glucose meeting the needs, so that those very same peptides and such that cause inflammation in the worst situation are constructive, reparative, rather than causing the damage of inflammation.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 In terms of reactive oxygen species, do they have any positive function?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 I was under the impression that some of them participate in the oxidative destruction of things like serotonin.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 So it's good to have at least some level of those, right?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 Some level of which?

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 Of reactive oxygen species.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Oh, locally produced, yeah. The amino oxidase, I think that's the enzyme in the lungs and a few other places that destroys serotonin.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Right. So, but I guess the medical industry, when they say reactive oxygen species, from what I understand is they tend to accumulate or form when there's actually a blockage of metabolism.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 There was a recent study which showed that administering chemicals that block any of the electron transport chain complexes drastically increased the production of reactive oxygen species.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 So it's low metabolism that causes ROS, not high.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Right. You mentioned Broda Barnes in your newsletter, and I feel like I send people quotes from Hypothyroidism, the unsuspecting illness, like multiple times per day.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 When did you learn about him? And then was that the reason, was he kind of the inspiration for the first time you yourself took thyroid?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 His books came out, I think, early 1970s.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 And I didn't connect him specifically. I had been thinking about it for years, but since I had a much above normal metabolic rate, I had to learn other things before I was willing to experiment with thyroid.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Because I was, for example, on a BMR machine where you breathe oxygen while lying at rest. The machine is set up so that you're supposed to, in the couple of minutes during the test, you're expected to breathe somewhere between a third and two-thirds of the can that contains the oxygen that you're measuring.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 And during the time of the test, before the test was over, I had used up the oxygen.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 So it was looked from the slope of the line like it was about three times the normal rate.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 And I was aware of that for just about nine or ten years before I finally convinced myself to try taking thyroid.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 And when I did, within a few days, my rate of metabolism had come down to approximately normal.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 You've mentioned this a few times. It's always been slightly confusing to me.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 Do you think your high natural, high rate of metabolism was from stress and taking the thyroid lowered it?

00:39:47.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Since then, I've known a few men in their 20s to early 40s with a similar thing. They would weigh maybe 140 pounds and be 5'8" or 10" or so.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 And no matter how much they ate, they couldn't gain any weight.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 And from my own experience, I suggested they try thyroid, and every one of them immediately started building muscle and growing.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 My interpretation was, after I read Jerry Ikawa's book on magnesium, he had some information in it about the mechanism by which the body retains magnesium.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 And it's held inside the cells largely as a complex with ATP. Magnesium ATP is in effect a compound.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 And when you have more ADP, the de-energized form, that associates with calcium.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 And so as your energy level goes down, your cells pick up calcium and lose magnesium.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 And if you lose magnesium, you get cramping and inability to relax fully.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 And so the cell sits there spending energy just making ATP so that it can hang on to magnesium, which tends to get lost.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 And supplementing magnesium to a hypothyroid person will typically relieve their symptoms for a very short time, maybe just a few hours.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 And if you measure it, the amount you put in and the amount that comes out in your urine a few hours later, they've lost all of the magnesium you put in them.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 If you give them quick acting T3 and magnesium and then check their urine at the same time later, they haven't lost their magnesium.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 It's just like a switch letting your cells retain the magnesium.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 Just for my own interest, when you first took thyroid, you said it lowered your basal metabolic rate.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 But did that also accompanied by a resolution of maybe some type of symptoms that you noticed as well or no?

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 Oh, yeah. When I lectured someone, I asked why I wasn't fidgeting the way I always did before.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 And I slept much more easily without being wakened by any little environmental noise.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 I was going into a deeper sleep. So those were very sudden changes that went with the metabolic rate.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 So in terms of the measure of the metabolic rate, that machine measures the metabolic rate, but it doesn't measure your rate of carbon dioxide production.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 So in order to find out if your basal metabolic rate is high and also in a good way, you also have to measure how much carbon dioxide you expire, right?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 That's what matters, the amount of carbon dioxide produced per unit of oxygen consumed.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 It should be very close to the same.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Right. And if somebody has a very high rate of oxygen consumption but low rate of carbon dioxide production, that means they're running on the stress metabolism.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 They're getting ransomed quickly.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 Okay. So that's basically adrenaline and cortisol driving their metabolic rate.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Maybe we could touch on PUFA and hibernation. Ray, are you familiar with Chris Knob? He seems to have read your articles.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 He's talking about cardiolipin and cytochrome C oxidase.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 So I don't know if you've communicated with him at all, but he seems to be saying a lot of the things you've been saying for a very long time.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 What's the last name?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 Knob, K-N-O-B-B-E. He has a video on YouTube called the PUFA Apocalypse, I think.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Nope, I haven't heard of him.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 I think he's familiar with your work.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 But anyways, just the general, you know, your biological view of PUFA and hibernation.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 And you had quoted articles in your newest newsletter, but also the ones that I had read a few of them by Geiser, first name F.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 And again, I'm always astounded when I read these articles and they just perfectly align with what you're talking about.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Yeah, they've known that for a long time, that animals eat unsaturated fats in the fall when the nuts are ready.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 And their bodies become much more polyunsaturated and then they go to sleep or don't really go to sleep.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 They go into a torpor.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 And the typical hibernator who gets very torpid and cold, they usually have to wake up two or three times from the torpor to go to sleep.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 Because they actually need real sleep for brain maintenance and repair.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 And when we go into hibernation, we just get a cold brain and get sick when we go into our pseudo hibernation phase.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Yeah, the deep sleep needs a good warm temperature, right up 98 plus something to sleep into the deep sleep.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 That's all I had about the news.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 Georgie, any other questions before we go into conspiracy stuff?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 I think there were a few studies recently done that show that hibernating animals refuse to eat nuts and the seeds if they're given during the hot months in the spring and the summer.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 So this whole premise that, "Oh, look at all these animals that are thriving on nuts and seeds that are filled with PUFA."

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 No, they actually seem to be eating them at very specific times of year.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 They refuse to eat them when they're actually fully active and running around and mating.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 They only eat them when they're about to go into torpor.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 They're very sensible.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 Okay. I shouldn't even call it conspiracy. It's just the news because it's so in your face with what's going on.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Ray, are you surprised at the lack of coordination between the messaging behind the vaccine?

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 It seems so incoherent that I know people that, again, aren't into these alternative theories or trying to figure out what's going on, that they're confused by what's happening.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Like, you still need to wear a mask if you get a vaccine.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 It doesn't protect you from the virus, they say.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 It doesn't seem like they're coordinated with what they're talking about.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Yeah. This is someone who's assuming that there is something sensible going on.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 Yeah. Yes.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 If you pay close attention to the experts, especially the government-connected experts, I haven't seen anyone who is either both informed and honest.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 A lot of them, I think, are both ignorant and not caring about the honesty of it.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 Did you see the...

00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Everything they talk about, like describing COVID as a new, uniquely bad disease, I've heard probably 15 or 20 people who are supposedly experts say that they named the various features.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 But everything they say is unique about it was an outstanding feature of influenza, and supposedly they're respiratory experts.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 So how can they say that because something has exactly the same side effects that influenza had, that it's some uniquely new and bad condition?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 Everything you look at, they wouldn't be embarrassing themselves if they had the sense.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 Because this is so sloppy, is there any way to entertain the idea that, again, people are seeing people having allergies and all these bad reactions to the vaccine?

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 Do you think it's being rushed so quickly that it's possible that it scares an even larger portion of the people that, even if that did happen, it'd just be a little bump in the road and they're still going to push forward with their agenda no matter what?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 We should hope that it's going to scare a lot of people.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Did you read the Pfizer publication that came out, I think, Monday?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 Maybe.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 New England Journal of Medicine, the chief editor, who is not a virologist, wrote an editorial to go with Pfizer's statement.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 And he not only wrote the editorial saying what a triumph this information is, but he was on the FDA committee that voted for it.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 And his magazine gets huge amounts of advertising from Pfizer.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 So it's all an inside deal.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 And if you go through what Pfizer actually said, they didn't say a peep about the nature of the population and who was excluded from the tests.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 But when two English nurses on the first day developed anaphylaxis, after that happened, someone asked them, ask Pfizer, and they said, well, allergy was one of the groups that was excluded from testing.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 So now they tell us.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 And they also excluded old people, apparently.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 But the first people who are going to get the actual vaccine are said to be the people in long-term care homes, the frail and old,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 exactly the people that vaccines usually don't work very well with, but who might be most susceptible to dying very soon from getting any inflammation that it produces.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 And the editor in chief, Eric Rubin, who said it was a triumph on a radio interview, he said he was glad that his young, healthy patients weren't in line to receive the virus now,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 the vaccine now for a few months, so that they would be able to see what its effects are on frail old people.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 Laughing because it's crazy.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 It's hard to imagine anyone who could say that, but I think you can find it on the Internet.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 The guy who was praising it, saying that better for his healthy people not to risk it.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 Dr. Kelly Moore, associate director of the Immunization Action Coalition, says don't be surprised when older people are dying within a day or two of their vaccination,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 who are residents in long-term care facilities.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 And this Reddit commenter was saying they've been saying for months that if you go outside without a mask, you're the devil, but they're going to be killing people in old folks' homes.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 And that's just part of the vaccination.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 It doesn't make any sense.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 When it came out that they had excluded allergic people from the test for their safety, an official at the FDA said there are 1.6 million allergic people in the United States who might suffer anaphylaxis from a vaccination.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 1.6 million is a lot of people. We can't afford not to vaccinate that large number of people.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 So naturally, they will be required to risk anaphylaxis.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 So, I mean, there was also the issue of like the trial design.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 They use the PCR test to assign, to basically determine that the trial participants have not had COVID in the past.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 But if you look at the PCR test, it has a notoriously high false negative rate, at best 20%, and sometimes as bad as 100%.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 So there is no guarantee that these people that were already in the, you know, that they were admitted to the trial, that they weren't already having like, that they didn't already have the COVID and had antibodies and natural immunity.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 So Pfizer could have easily designed the group, the one that looked better to be the ones that already had it, right?

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 The ones that already have an immunity.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 And also, I think they didn't control for any prior vaccinations.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 And I think you mentioned in several interviews that having the influenza vaccine increased your chance of getting COVID.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 So that wasn't controlled for either.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 So it was a very poorly designed trial to start with.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 So I'm surprised they're able to draw any statistically significant conclusions whatsoever.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 Yeah, I think it was someone at Pfizer that said that, well, the experimental period goes on for two years.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 So we won't know how safe it is for until the end of the two years.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 But they also, I think the actual trial stopped following people up after the second month, right?

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 Or something like that.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 And they declared it safe if nothing happened within the first two months of receiving the last dose.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Yeah, but even ordinary traditional vaccines, supposedly they had to be followed up for up to two years.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 And now with this nucleic acid content of the vaccine, logically you would think maybe they should follow them up for two or three generations.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 Doesn't the emergency use authorization basically say that all the FDA is saying is not that this is safe, not that this is effective,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 but it leaves it as a decision between a doctor and a patient, and FDA saying this basically passes just some very basic criteria of what a drug should be.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 But the ultimate result is not a recommendation.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 It's leaving it to the patient and the doctor to decide.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 But that's not what we're hearing on TV.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Yeah, the insiders somewhat sensibly to each other about actual dangers,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 but the very same person talking on television tells a totally different story.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 So clearly they're crooks and careless about the public health.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 Are there any publications demonstrating incorporation of mRNA material into our DNA after, let's say, injecting it?

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 It doesn't have to be a vaccine, but any sort of trial that injected foreign RNA and found it incorporated into the DNA of the organism?

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 Yeah, for years there's been a lab in Germany, Walter Dorfler,

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 who has been demonstrating the incorporation of foreign DNA just from regular exposures.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 But now we have the intramuscular injection, which is a much easier way to get it in.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 It's expecting the cells to take it up.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 And once it's in the cell, we have the reverse transcriptase enzymes.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 I just saw a recent publication validating the fact that we do have the reverse transcriptase enzymes that can turn viral RNA into DNA,

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 which can then be integrated into our genome.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 I was going to ask you about fertility and syn... how do you say it, George? Syn...

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 Syncytin.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Syncytin.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 But that just reminded me of something you had said previously, that we're being prepared to activate our renin-aldosterone, angiotensin-aldosterone system,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 and that's the opposite of progesterone.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 So just on that fact alone, this would be an anti-fertility vaccine.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 Does that make sense?

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 There's one personality of, I think it's the spike protein and the syncytial protein or enzyme that forms the placenta.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 They're structurally very similar.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 And until that's disposed of, I don't know why anyone shouldn't just stop until they do some actual experiments and see whether it's so or not.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 But yeah, and I don't want you to speculate or anything, but that could be the reason this vaccine, this could be on purpose.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 That's a possibility, right?

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Oh, yeah. When you see the horrible things they do openly and have their face on the camera saying it, then if they can do such horrible things as that,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 then I don't know why you should suppose they wouldn't do the ordinary conspiratorial kind of anti-human activities.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 You said several times that when we're exposed to chronic stress, then all of this retroviral material that's in our genome starts to shed into the bloodstream.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000
 And this seems to be driven by inflammation as well.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 And since this vaccine has this highly pro-inflammatory protein, do you think there's a risk of us causing something similar, sort of like an AIDS-type syndrome appearing?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Yeah, just from dumping lots of new, unfamiliar stuff.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 The more of it that comes out at once, the more confusion it can cause in your metabolism and immune reactions.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 Outside of the COVID-19 vaccine, are there any other mRNA vaccines you're aware of that are in widespread use?

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 That are what?

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 That are in widespread use, aside from this one?

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 No, the only nucleic acid intentionally included was this one.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 But things like the Simian virus 40 tumor producer, they knew it was there when all of the world-famous vaccine people were talking.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 And one of them said, "Oh, well, good. The Russians are using it now. Maybe it'll get rid of some Russians."

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 Wow. So if the SV40 is producing, the vaccines containing SV40 are tumorigenic, why wouldn't this be as well?

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 That other one was fairly quickly tested in animals and shown to be.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 No one is testing this stuff in that way.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 It would take a little bit of honest curiosity before they would bother testing it.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 But there seems to be a similar potential, right?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 So we talked about it last week, but there's an emergency authorization act for first-line workers and things like that, and older people.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 But when do you think the, what did you say, proverbial crap hits the fans, Georgie, last time?

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 That's going to happen in April when they do this mass vaccination campaign.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 It seems, again, so sloppy right now. But when do you think, again, I don't speculate if you don't want to, but what do you think?

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 They'll tighten things up and just normal people will start getting this vaccine.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 What do you think is going to happen then, Ray?

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 I'm hoping that there will be a big reaction against it.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 We were talking yesterday that putting the nurses and doctors in the front line, even ahead of the long-term care patients as expendables,

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 remembering what Eric Schmidt and Klaus Schwab have been predicting, we aren't going to need doctors or teachers anymore.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 So they're good experimental material for a first run of the virus, because we're going to have digital medicine along with digital education.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000
 So it really doesn't matter to them if they lose lots of doctors.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:59.000
 And especially it's going to save money for the insurance companies if they lose about half of the old people in the retirement homes.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 It should really start waves of thinking and reaction and criticism going through the general population.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.000
 Do you think Schmidt and Klaus have an army of doctor robots and teacher robots ready to take over?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
 I mean, Schmidt's attempts to apply AI to the medical field and IBM's most notably failed miserably.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 So their diagnostic AI system, I think it was Watson they called it, right?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 They applied it to medicine. It flopped.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:39.000
 I mean, even the mainstream press was grilled pretty hard and said that AI is nowhere near what we've been told it is.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000
 So I can't even begin to imagine how much more difficult the teaching process would be to emulate in a machine.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000
 So they're saying doctors and teachers are expendable, but do they even have anything right now ready to replace them?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
 Or is this just like projections and conjectures?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
 I think they are hoping to have continuing crisis.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:05.000
 And if there's a die off of doctors and nurses, that's in itself a self-supporting crisis.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:18.000
 You hardly need a pandemic if you have lots of doctors becoming rheumatic, autoimmune diseases, disabled in various ways.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.000
 That becomes another major crisis for them to work on over the next couple of years.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 So if you cause a shortage in these professions, then people will be willing to accept any alternative and Schmidt will conveniently say,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
 "Oh, here is this doctor robot which you can try in the meantime until we replenish the ranks."

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:50.000
 In a crisis, they will approve any kind of remote control surgery machine or remote control computer doctoring machine.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000
 And of course receive full immunity, right? Just as Pfizer did for the vaccine in the UK. Full immunity no matter what happens.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.000
 That's so twisted, especially since these people, most of them will be advocating for their own death.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
 So it's only from the mind of an oligarch, I guess. Yeah, that's insane.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000
 Okay, anything else? I feel like there's a historical episode because this stuff is all happening.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.000
 Ray, can you even think about in your history on this planet of anything as crazy as this happening? Does this top the list?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
 Yeah, I think it does.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 So even World War II and the propaganda associated with it doesn't cut it, doesn't take first place compared to that?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:43.000
 No, the Korean War was really a highlight of how they could be committing genocide, destroying more of a single country than they've ever destroyed before.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:53.000
 Practicing germ biological warfare and using the bomb dropping.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:03.000
 They bombed every city until there was nothing and even Douglas MacArthur vomited when he saw what they had done to the country.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
 Americans at home didn't know anything was going on.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:18.000
 When do you think the powers that be realized that crisis serves them very well and they started actively, purposefully working and probably even setting up teams that come up with future crisis?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
 Was that around the Korean War or the Vietnam War?

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:38.000
 I think they were just going back 10 years. The Rockefeller Foundation had people working on it, but I imagine organized efforts were in the various foundations long before that.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:56.000
 Do you know anything about the Phoenix program in Vietnam? The author Douglas Valentine makes the case that a lot of what happened after 9/11 was directly from what the CIA learned during the Phoenix program of documenting all the people they had killed and tortured and things.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 The Indonesia episode, American social science, people like the Obamas were helping it along doing social research to help to form lists of the million people they needed to exterminate and dump into the rivers.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:42.000
 That sort of thing has been both academic and governmental in a very organized form using anthropologists and sociologists and various kinds of cultural researchers to help to organize assassination campaigns on an industrial scale.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 Most Americans would have never guessed that it was going to be eventually turned on them though like we're experiencing now.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
 Oh no, oh no.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:58.000
 Okay, unless, George, you have other questions. I have like a list of questions I've been wanting to ask you for multiple streams, but George, if you have some, go for it.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
 Are you familiar with the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
 Yeah, yeah.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
 Have you read his Unabomber manifesto or at least the ideas there?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
 I kind of liked it. Nice environmental sentiment.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:27.000
 Right. He seemed to be pretty worried and condemned technocracy, at least from what I understand from it. Do you think he got that sort of ideas while he was tortured at Harvard under the MKUltra experiment or do you think he had more inside knowledge?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
 No, I don't know anything on the inside of that.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 Okay. But it seems that for a person who was, you know, all it took for him to be, I guess, subjected to these psychological torture experiments and he developed a very strong hatred for the technocratic process.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 And that's, you know, he wrote that Unabomber manifesto. And, you know, if you read it, it's basically, it's an indictment of the system that is currently controlling us.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:06.000
 And I'm surprised he hasn't seen more publicity. I remember when I first came to the United States in '97, a few major newspapers published it and he was universally condemned by everybody.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:16.000
 Despite some people trying to say, look, this guy has some good ideas. We're not headed in a good direction. But it was only a few voices in general. It was universally condemned.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 Yeah, it was too bad he had the publicity that he did because anyone looking at the inside of things should come up with conclusions like that, that technology is a dead end as it's going.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:57.000
 Norbert Wiener was warning of that in the early '50s. And so he refused grants related to mass murder. And so he was ridiculed at MIT for not accepting the war culture.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:14.000
 But his human use of human beings was a very interesting book. And he saw it as deep as the divide between digital control and analog control.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:37.000
 You're much less likely to go off into insane futures if you are thinking in terms of analogs and making everything immediately apparent to how you regulate it and what it's going to do, where the whole process becomes invisible when it's digital.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:46.000
 Right. So basically the analog computation is a physical process. It's analogous to the human brain, while digital is arbitrary and it's just somebody's crazy definition.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 Yeah, you can't possibly have any moral judgments in the digital world. And that was Norbert Wiener's whole thing that people might consider acting like human beings.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:16.000
 Do you think there's an optimal level of technological development that helps civilization beyond which it starts to become detrimental? If yes, is there a way to gauge it/measure it? Or does it always change and it needs to be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 Somewhere very close to the middle of the 20th century, we had everything a person could conceivably need and we could have gone on researching and developing things safely from that point.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:47.000
 It was the computer world and the CIA getting together around 1940s and 50s that put it on the death path.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
 So it's not a coincidence that they say the world peaked in the mid-20th century?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:15.000
 Yeah, there was still the field approach to looking at organisms. And Norbert Wiener and a couple of others in the government still, who had the analog view, the real world view of how we should understand things.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
 But they were just deliberately covered up, quieted.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
 Are you guys still there?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:29.000
 Yeah, you there? I was going to ask you, speaking of digital, what is your take on Bitcoin? People ask me that fairly often.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:36.000
 I don't really know what it is. People have often offered to give me some, but I wouldn't know what to do with it.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
 It's what the Federal Reserve will turn our regular money into in the near future.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
 Yeah, I know something bad like that will happen, but I don't care to understand it.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:56.000
 And then we talked about it maybe a little bit last time, but Klaus Schwab saying there's going to be a giant cyber attack and then it will bring down power and internet and things like that.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 That seems like a pretty convenient way to immediately censor everyone.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:11.000
 Like instead of censoring people on Twitter or Facebook individually, if they really need to do something big, that seems like sending everybody back to the Stone Age would really fit the bill.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000
 And obviously I believe Klaus, he apparently knows that there's going to be a big cyber attack coming up.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000
 Yeah, that's pretty much on schedule, I think.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
 But if the power is off, how are they going to brainwash the populace, right? They still need to be able to broadcast their poison.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 Oh yeah, I think they'll just wipe out the things that they don't want and bring it back up purified.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000
 So do you think, George, you and I were talking about this before we went live, but they're rolling out the vaccine stuff now.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:51.000
 And so it would be maybe, I'm not a crazy, insane oligarch, but it would be maybe weird to shut everything down in the middle of that.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
 So maybe that's a year away or two years away or three years away, maybe in the next 10 years or so.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:06.000
 Oh, no. Anytime things need to be shaken up, I think they have a repertoire of tricks they can pull out in an opportune way.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:13.000
 So in terms of money, if all fiat currency, actually fiat or not, if all currency derives its value from the people,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:22.000
 and if the elite is basically waging wars against humanity and trying to kill as many people as they want, basically,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 isn't that undermining their own wealth in a certain way?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 I mean, the wealth starts to become an arbitrary definition, just like a computer program.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
 They get to assign it whatever wealth number they want, but that doesn't mean it's going to have any value, right?

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000
 I mean, China can tomorrow say, "We don't want your US dollars because they have no real value.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000
 You've been telling us they have so much value, but they don't."

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
 It's whatever we decide the US dollar has value, and we don't care about your definition.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
 Doesn't that whole process of waging war against humanity undermine even the interests of the elite in a sense?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 I think they figure that they're going to integrate China, and everyone get them just as thoroughly controlled as the American population.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:21.000
 And the behavior, once it's under control, then they can figure out how to make it do exactly what they want over the long run.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 So in a strange way, China is like an obstacle in their course, and we should be grateful that it's still there?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:36.000
 I think so. It's really probably the main obstacle to everything being finished off in just a matter of months.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:48.000
 China has the vitality of lots and lots of intelligent, well-educated people developing economic power.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:57.000
 So I don't think it's going to be very easy to eliminate them from their program.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000
 Do you think Russia has already been subjugated, or they're still trying to put up a fight?

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:13.000
 As long as Putin is in, I think they have such a literate population that that will give them momentum for a couple generations.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:24.000
 Just people who read, who really think about politics rather than just consuming it.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000
 So you're saying it's not necessarily natural resources, it's how awake or at least how willing to perceive the population of a country.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
 That's really the main obstacle to the empire?

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 I think so. They can end up poisoning masses, but short of that, the consciousness of the population is going to endlessly resourcefulness.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:06.000
 I think we'll keep coming out in places they don't want to. Like Iran is getting out fronted the worst of the sanctions.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:15.000
 So now they're giving the US ultimatums. They have to restore the nuclear agreement within 60 days.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:24.000
 So basically you're saying that there are several countries getting back on their feet and saying, "We're not done yet."

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:40.000
 Once a country gets it into their mind that they want to be outside of the empire, I think it's going to be very hard to keep going ahead with the Great Reset.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
 So the more countries break out of the empire to establish world control.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000
 Several years ago, somebody asked you if you had to leave the United States, what country would you go to?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:00.000
 I think you said something along the lines of the western parts of Latin America are the places where civilization has its best chance to escape or to survive.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
 But you never mentioned countries like Russia or Iran or even other countries.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:12.000
 Is there a reason why you think western parts of Latin America somehow have more chance of preserving freedom and civilization?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 In Russia, it's the weather and the scenery.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
 You don't like them?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
 Yeah, flat land and long winters.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:41.000
 And along the western edge of the country, you have the clean air coming off the Pacific combined with sunny days and high altitude.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
 You have a very ideal region.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
 So the Andes Mountains basically, countries that span the Andes.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000
 Okay, Ray, I'm just going to run through some things.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
 So feel free to talk as long or as little about any of this.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
 Copper is very... people are talking about copper a lot these days.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
 And I know that you've done a lot of work on that subject in your "Gener of Energy" book.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
 You said, "I think chronic loss of copper accounts for the obvious features of aging..."

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
 And I know you've said in your articles, probably on interviews as well, that thyroid was needed to absorb copper.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
 And then apparently, and correct me if I'm wrong, DHEA has a relationship with copper.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
 And obviously thyroid.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
 Is there any way to weave a narrative through any of that?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
 No, not right now anyway.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:42.000
 There's a book by, I think, A.E. Needham, not the famous Joseph Needham, but a very good book on the nature of the materials involved in organisms.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:51.000
 Basically, it's sort of a portrait of all of the biological elements in particular.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 And I think it's good to read a book like that that gives you a personal feeling about copper.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:09.000
 Encyclopedia Britannica, I've noticed that each of several of my volumes spanning about 50 years,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.000
 each one has a very unique, very important article that the other issues don't have.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:29.000
 And if you look at each of the biological substances, sulfur, for example, zinc, each element,

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000
 I think you should try to get a personal feeling about what its properties are and its potentials.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:44.000
 Is there an internal metabolite that copper associates with similar to how magnesium associates with ATP?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
 Nothing occurs to me.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:58.000
 It's in competition with iron and molybdenum and in several ways cooperates closely with zinc.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:08.000
 And it's kind of a polar pair with selenium, a reductant and a powerful oxidant.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000
 So from what I understand, copper is retained in proportion to the protein seruloplasmin.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000
 Are there any things that, do you know of things that increase the production of that protein?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
 Oh, stress and estrogen increase it.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.000
 So you don't want too much of it.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 And any heavy metal in excess will cause you to overproduce metallothionine,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:43.000
 which will fairly indiscriminately deplete your tissues of heavy metals.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:51.000
 So that's one of the things that heavy metal poisoning does is to sort of clean out other heavy metals along with it.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000
 And then last question on this, but is copper absorbed in relation to the activity of cytochrome C oxidase?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
 Therefore, if a person's low thyroid, they're not going to need to retain much copper?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 I think that's true.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:12.000
 The same way thyroid pulls magnesium into cells by creating its mate,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.000
 I think the modifying the cell structure is what pulls and retains copper in.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
 How would one gauge their copper needs?

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000
 Is there any sort of sign/symptom that can be used to ascertain whether somebody needs to eat extra liver

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
 or they have plenty of copper, they don't need to eat liver, etc.?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:38.000
 A good oxidative function and definite evidence that something's going wrong with your copper

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
 is if you're losing pigment in hair or skin or any tissue that should be pigmented.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 Great stuff, and we can put a bow on this, but your copper requirement increases during infection.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
 Do you think that's true, Ray?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
 I think so.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:06.000
 The body wants to get rid of iron or hide it, and iron is like the evil cousin of copper.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
 Copper comes in therapeutically.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
 Thanks for that, Ray. I appreciate it.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
 Moving on, lidocaine.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
 I think you were talking to Emma, and maybe you said...

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
 Ray, I think we've talked about this a while ago, but it was just a conversation on the phone.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
 I think it's interesting that you mentioned it prevents mast cell degranulation.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
 It's nerve-protective, anti-stress, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-arrhythmia,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
 memory-improving, anti-cancer.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 Then you put it in the classification of pregnenolone, aspirin, sugar, DHEA, progesterone, thyroid hormone.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
 Anything that you say is very safe is very interesting to me.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
 Well, one, have any of your thoughts changed about lidocaine?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000
 Maybe, and I'm conscious of time, but maybe an elevator pitch of just what is so useful about lidocaine.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 Oh, it has analgesic effects.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:03.000
 It can be used systemically as anesthetic or analgesic, and it has anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:10.000
 Basically, anything which is anti-inflammatory should be checked out in more detail.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.000
 It turns out that it is safe in those amounts.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:23.000
 You don't want to use the anesthetic high concentration of 2% or something.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
 That will kill everything it touches.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:38.000
 But like a periodic systemic dose of 50 or 100 milligrams is probably therapeutic for cancer and arthritis

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
 and a lot of the degenerative things.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
 And just general anti-aging or anti-stress, you think it's valuable as well?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:55.000
 Oh, it isn't something I would use for those purposes because carbon dioxide has such a perfect spectrum all the way up to analgesia.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
 In Eugene, do you use carbon dioxide, like just writing or anything?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
 Do you use tanks or anything like that?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
 Yeah, I have a tank sitting right beside me.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000
 I've always wanted to ask you that. I don't know why.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
 Georgie, did you have a question?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:16.000
 Speaking of lidocaine, in doctors and dentist offices, if somebody cannot be treated with lidocaine,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
 they use a substitute called eugenol.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
 And it seems to have many of the same effects.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
 Yeah, eugenol is very pleasant smelling and you can make fillings out of it too.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:36.000
 Mix it with zinc oxide and make some non-toxic filling that if it's properly done, it can last for a year or two.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
 Have you seen some of the studies with eugenol?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:45.000
 It's also analgesic, it's got anti-tumor effects, it's anti-estrogenic apparently, things like that.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000
 And it seems to overlap some of its effects with lidocaine.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000
 Yeah, and you get it in clove candy and pumpkin pie and lots of places.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
 It's a familiar chemical to our bodies.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Do you think a similar dosage range, like 50 to 100 milligrams, would be systemically,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
 somebody who wants to take it internally?

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
 It would be safe to experiment with.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
 I don't know what uses it might turn out to have.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
 Can you try it yourself?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:23.000
 Lots of different ways of practicing making fillings out of it and using it for anesthetic and preservative.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:30.000
 You don't want everything to smell like cloves, but it's a good preservative for drying fruit, for example.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.000
 Would it be a good thing to try to at least stop the progression of cavities?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
 It seems to have a powerful antiseptic effect, too.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
 Yeah, that's why I think the filling material is nice.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
 Just three more questions, Ray. Thank you so much. Appreciate your time.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
 Getting rid of citric acid in canned fruits.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
 You know how dire the fruit situation is.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
 If people have access to longans or lychees or whatever,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
 is there a way to mitigate the harm of the citric acid in those canned fruits?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
 I don't think so.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
 Citric acid is made in the citric acid cycle, and so people think of it as harmless,

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
 but everything should be in the right place.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:23.000
 Coming in from outside the cell through the cytoplasm to get to the mitochondrion isn't really a safe thing.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.000
 There are suspicions that it might be carcinogenic to constantly consume a large amount of it.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 So it wouldn't be worth it, the potential risk from citric acid?

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:40.000
 Well, just keeping the intake low, using that fruit only as needed.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
 Good stuff. I'm sure you've probably gone over this question 100,000 times,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
 but what function is starch having in the low thyroid person?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:54.000
 It's very common to hear, "Oh, I can never, ever give up starch. It has such an essential function."

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
 "Quenching my appetite and living without it seems impossible."

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
 I know I used to feel that way, but I don't feel that way anymore.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:08.000
 Is it a possible low thyroid, under-functioning liver, and maybe the use of starch with fat is slowing down the--?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000
 Yeah, just probably as a guilt-free way of eating sugar.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:22.000
 Sugar or starch can make you feel really good because it lowers stress and keeps you going.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
 But you have to not forget to take all your nutrients with it.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:34.000
 But I guess what I'm saying is, for a hypothyroid person, starch would be having some--

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:40.000
 like the gravitating towards starch, might that be alleviated by supplementing thyroid, do you think?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
 Oh, immediately, yeah.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:53.000
 I was a huge candy consumer, and a couple of days after I took thyroid, same with coffee,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
 I didn't have any craving for sugar or starchy foods or even coffee for a spring in the morning.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
 The thyroid regulates your blood sugar,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
 so you're more likely to think of ham and eggs or something rather than potatoes and toast.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000
 And then, last question for me, what are the giant doses of vitamin K doing that the lower doses wouldn't do?

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.000
 I know there was-- I didn't put it in front of me, but there was an article talking about PUFA interfering with vitamin K-dependent processes,

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
 or processes, however you say it.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
 Is that what the giant 40, 50 milligram doses are doing?

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
 Are they opposing the PUFA that's in the tissues, and that's why they're useful?

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:40.000
 I think it's working as an extension of or amplifier of coenzyme Q10.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000
 It associates with that and helps feed energy into the mitochondria.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
 And you've mentioned for, I think, cancer and also hypertension,

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000
 would you assume that larger doses, if a person could afford it because it's such an expensive vitamin,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
 would that just be useful for any degenerative health problem, do you think?

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
 The Russians tested it on both cancer and brain problems,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000
 and in the '50s, I think, published positive articles on it, but there hasn't been much done.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 And I've known people-- the first one was a guy who had pressure of 240 over 70,

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
 a tremendous gap between diastolic and systolic,

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:32.000
 and he took one or two droppers full, probably more than 50 drops per day,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:40.000
 and in just a few days, his pressure was down to 140 over 70 and stayed there now for years.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
 That was my last question. Ray, what are you working on right now?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:52.000
 I just started today thinking that I will pull out some more ideas from the temperature thing.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 The idea of the connection between heat shock proteins, estrogen receptor,

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:06.000
 and the process of disorder and reestablishing order,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000
 and where heat shock and estrogen work in that system.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
 And can you let everybody know how to obtain your newsletter?

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
 Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000
 And then the same thing for your books, which they are now available digitally, correct?

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
 Yeah. Awesome. Georgie, did you have something to say?

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
 I think I just wanted to mention that I think vitamin K,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.000
 other possible effects that may be causing this--

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
 possible mechanism may be causing this perceived benefit is

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
 it tends to be strongly anti-estrogenic in higher doses,

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
 and also I think it--what was it?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
 It's converts--it increases the conversion of cholesterol into all of the downstream steroids.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
 There are several studies showing that very old rats,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
 when you give them the equivalent of about the human dose of about 100 milligrams,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.000
 they immediately get the testosterone of younger rats, the equivalent of 20-year-old rats.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:09.000
 So for an aging male, I think that may also be one of the reasons why they're feeling perked up

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
 and feeling good on vitamin K.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
 And another recent study found that vitamin K is also an inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase type B.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:24.000
 So they compared it to the anti-aging drug Selagiline, I think is the one Ray mentioned a few times.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000
 So that may also be another way that vitamin K is producing these benefits.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
 Very interesting.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
 I was going to let you go, but let me read these donations first.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
 Bob for five pounds, thank you so much, Bob.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
 Marcello for $50, thank you so much, Marcello.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
 Michelle for another $50, thank you so much, Michelle.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
 David for $20.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
 Marlon for $50.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
 Holy smokes, wow, guys.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
 Carlos for $49.99.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
 Wow.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
 And that was it.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
 So I will forward those to Ray.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
 Ray, thank you so much.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
 You know, it's always special having you on the show, especially in these insane, weird times.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
 Georgie, thank you for being with us.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 Any parting words I'm going to ask you anyways, Ray?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
 Nothing.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000
 Okay, thank you again.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
 Georgie, any parting words?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
 As usual, stay sane.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 I appreciate it.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
 Thank you, everybody, for watching the show.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
 We have an amazing audience.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
 Feel very fortunate to be able to do this and bring it all together.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
 And a special thanks to Ray for taking the time to do this.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
 So sincerely appreciate it.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000
 Have a safe weekend, everybody.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
 We'll talk to you guys soon.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000
 Take care.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
 Goodbye.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
 Let me share with you a vision of the future which offers hope.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
 It is that we embark on a program to counter the awesome Soviet missile threat with measures

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
 that are defensive.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
 Let us turn to the very strengths in technology that spawned our great industrial base and

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
 that have given us the quality of life we enjoy today.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000
 What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000
 upon the threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack?

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
 That we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000
 own soil or that of our allies?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 That formidable technical tench won the accomplished by the British.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
 Computer technologies, the high-flying hardware computer company which took a nosedive this

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
 year, may be bought out by the British firm Applied Computer Technologies.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000
 The space shuttle is very difficult to do, one would think.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
 Can a kid or a normal person actually pull this off?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.000
 Well, what I did when I designed this was I understood that problem.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
 It seems the sweep of technology has no limits.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
 In San Francisco this week, the world's first robot bartender was unveiled.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000
 The robot can talk and take spoken orders and can mix 200 different drinks.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
 But on the first test run, the robot knocked a glass off the bar and onto the floor and

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
 poured beer.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
 The designer said there were still some bugs to be worked out.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000
 Siamese nuclear weapons, Soviet system with our own station with our own taking an important

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
 instant U.S. retaliation.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
 N-N-Nuclear war.
