00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.140
 In one of your articles, you talked about how the Appalachian region has the lowest

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.860
 death rate from breast cancer even though the rates of breast cancer are higher than

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.820
 the rest of the country.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:14.200
 And you also mentioned how extremely rural areas and poor areas will probably not notice

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.500
 you know, whenever the collapse of the world economy arrives.

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.480
 So, a question to me is, like, is there any reason why you wouldn't consider going to

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.480
 the Appalachian region?

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.440
 Or you don't think it's high enough altitude, or you think the culture there is not very,

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.200
 I don't know, friendly?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.200
 Just curious.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:47.080
 Yeah, there are pockets of culture that could be acceptable, but other places, the xenophobia

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:58.120
 basically, not just according to skin color, but just having the wrong accent of an outsider

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.120
 can be difficult.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:13.880
 I would choose a completely different country where they're used to tourists and Anglo people

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:20.200
 don't have such xenophobia.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:28.160
 Ron Unz has an article on his website recently about a journalist who went to Welch.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.400
 It's a town in southern West Virginia.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.200
 It's the poorest town in the poorest county in the entire country.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.080
 And he basically chronicled the decline of the area, which used to be booming in the

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:46.160
 50s due to coal, and kind of coincided with the peak of America, from what I'm understanding.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.720
 You said that the 50s was really the time where people had everything they needed and

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.880
 nothing they didn't.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.400
 And just the way he described the area is that because it's so poor, they've really

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.280
 opened up to tourists, and they're really friendly.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.280
 There's basically very little internet and very little cell phone service, and everything

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.400
 is dirt cheap there.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.840
 So I don't know, it sounds very attractive to me.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:17.080
 If I have to make a move from out of DC, that will probably be the first place I would try.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:26.160
 Yeah, I think poverty in terms of the internet culture is a very creative, highly progressive

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.160
 thing.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.640
 Well, it seems like people from Monterrey are very westernized.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.040
 And that's something that...

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.040
 Oh, Monterrey, Mexico?

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.040
 Yeah.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:43.280
 Buildings there, I've seen slogans, "Hitler was right."

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:52.480
 And the cops there are the nastiest I've ever seen in Mexico.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:41:03.720
 It's not just Americanized, but it's the worst industrialization can do to a government.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:05.200
 Good to know.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.120
 One thing I was interested in getting your take on, I'm not sure if we've ever talked

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:13.600
 about it, but the incoherent narratives that conflict, just watching Fauci contradict himself

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.080
 a hundred times.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.680
 And I think a lot of people would tend to say, "Oh, that's because our leaders are so

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.680
 incompetent."

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:26.640
 But what do you think about that being a strategy of terror, of confusion, to make people so

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.360
 confused that it inactivates them because they don't know what to do because nothing

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.360
 makes sense?

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:42.360
 Yeah, I think it's natural for them to just talk through their hat.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:52.160
 And it turns out that that also is producing confusion and working in the direction they

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.800
 want people to go, panic and confusion.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.760
 I have a book, it's by a guy named Kurt Lewin.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.560
 I think it's like 1942 or something.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.360
 And he was some big wig at the Tavistock Institute.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:10.160
 And in his book, he says, "If we just confuse people enough, they won't know what to do."

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:16.880
 And even if you're a renegade, you will be inactive because there'll be no clear path

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.160
 forward of what to do because everything is so...

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.080
 That's basically what they do in the US.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.720
 The people that consider themselves radicals are aligned with Citibank and Wells Fargo

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.200
 with the exact things they believe.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.200
 Yeah.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:43.680
 Four years or 2016 election, I guess it was, I noticed that the Communist Party of the

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:52.560
 US was supporting Hillary Clinton.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:43:02.080
 That's a perfect example of confusing people to be utterly useless.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:07.120
 Or it shows how little commonness there is in the Communist Party of the United States.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:12.240
 Okay, well, we can take the show in really any direction we want.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.200
 Ray, did you want to...

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.360
 You are working on something.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.600
 Did you want to talk about that?

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.760
 Or we could go into questions.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.360
 Really, we have a free for all here.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.920
 Oh, questions are okay.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:33.440
 I'm right in the middle of thinking about what to write about something to do with development

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:43.560
 and immunity and how the whole system has been warped so much that it's almost impossible

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.120
 to talk about how the immune system works.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:55.720
 And so it's a perfect background for people saying ridiculous things about vaccines, for

00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:10.480
 example, because there's no solid ground for making a decisive and final argument about

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.160
 any issue in the immune system.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:23.560
 You have to see the history going back more than 100 years to see why the situation is

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:30.440
 so muddled around the vaccine issue.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.120
 Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Metzinger, did anybody take them seriously?

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:39.840
 Was that more morphostatic view of immunity ever a real contender against the traditional

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.720
 view?

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:53.280
 Jamie Cunliffe and his danger hypothesis, I think he got right to the center of the

00:44:53.280 --> 00:45:01.960
 issue, but he hasn't been keeping up with his studies in the last 15 or 20 years.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:06.880
 He's hardly refined his thinking.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:18.600
 What he did was very good, and the Polly Metzinger ideas have been to some extent adopted by

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:26.000
 the mainstream, but in the process, their meaning has been lost.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:38.680
 The potential of Polly Metzinger's system or perspective was to go the Cunliffe direction.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:51.560
 It has instead gone the clonal selection right down the mainstream, everything staying the

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.560
 same.

00:45:52.560 --> 00:46:00.600
 If I could butcher that point of view, it's that tissue injury comes before any kind of

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.000
 bacteria or fungi or anything like that, right?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.840
 If you're worried about immunity, you should be worrying about limiting tissue injury.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.280
 Yeah.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:22.440
 Our body is concerned with coming into existence and maintaining that existence and improving

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.600
 it if possible.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:37.560
 The Cunliffe idea is that when something goes wrong, whether it's a mechanical, radiation,

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:50.680
 chemical damage, or an organism that somehow created damage in our system, it's the damage

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:54.520
 that our body is concerned with.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:02.560
 In the process of fixing that damage, it takes out the pathogen, whether it's part of an

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:10.200
 organism or a toxin or even radiation damage.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:22.840
 The body takes the measures necessary to maintain its integrity and not really thinking or designed

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:31.240
 for or evolved to attack enemies or other than self.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:40.000
 It's the process of optimizing the self that has a sideline that happens that sometimes

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:50.080
 we develop the antibodies and so on for taking out viruses and bacteria and parasites.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:55.120
 Well, there's some studies showing that depending on the occupation, specific occupations had

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:01.360
 a much higher rate of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, like boxers, since

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:07.360
 they continuously damage their knuckles and various other joints, they're much more likely

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.000
 to develop this autoimmune condition.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.840
 Hasn't this ever attracted attention of the mainstream medicine saying, well, there is

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:18.320
 a connection between chronic tissue injury and autoimmune conditions?

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.320
 Very little.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:31.480
 About 25 or 30 years ago, I saw a single article in which they took a piece of cow cartilage

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:38.520
 and I forget who they injected it into, maybe rabbits.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.800
 And when it was in a fresh condition, it didn't elicit antibodies.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:53.440
 But if they just twisted the cartilage, gave it a little bit of mechanical stress, then

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.680
 it elicited antibodies.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:10.360
 And that was like an image of how easy it is to induce the antibody reactions you see

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.800
 in autoimmune conditions.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:18.120
 Have you seen the recent studies, I know you've said this many times, but recently they confirmed

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:24.160
 that endotoxin is directly responsible for the flares of rheumatoid arthritis?

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:36.760
 Yeah, I've been following that general line that any injuries to the tissue will bring

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:44.640
 up the so-called autoimmune system.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:59.120
 Virus infections in some of the experiments were lethal if the organism wasn't allowed

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:18.120
 to produce antibodies, the virus that would bring up the antibodies would in itself not

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:27.960
 produce the disease, but the antibody itself was there mostly to clear out the damaged

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:33.960
 tissue rather than to attack the virus.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:39.640
 Do you think chronic low-grade endotoxemia, as they call it, can be a factor in many of

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.560
 these autoimmune conditions constantly causing this small level of injury?

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:49.000
 And then eventually, I guess, if the organism is energetically depleted severely, then sort

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.440
 of like a chronic autoimmune condition sets in?

00:50:52.440 --> 00:51:07.960
 Yeah, and things like lupus and the famous named autoimmune diseases including Sjogren's

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:24.720
 syndrome and thyroid and probably MS, in some of these such as lupus, I've seen very clear

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:36.240
 diagnoses of everything confirming that it was the so-called lupus condition causing

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:45.520
 the arthritis and other symptoms, but just by correcting their vitamin D, calcium intake,

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:54.600
 progesterone and thyroid, all of the symptoms disappeared and they gradually started having

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.640
 a regression of the antibodies.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.000
 Right, so you're saying you don't need to go on the carnivore diet if you have an autoimmune

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 disease?

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:18.080
 No, keeping your blood glucose up and your carbon dioxide high from oxidizing glucose,

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:26.040
 I think those are the basic anti-inflammatory things that will correct all of the autoimmune

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040
 diseases.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:32.600
 I was making a joke, but actually, when a person does eat an all-meat diet and they

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:38.680
 do experience like an improvement in their symptoms, it probably would be a reduction

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:40.680
 in endotoxin, right?

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:49.600
 Yeah, so many people are eating indigestible stuff that causes inflammation of their intestine

00:52:49.600 --> 00:53:03.040
 and a meat diet will simply represent the absence of toxic indigestible foods, but that

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:12.560
 gives you very quick relief like a fast, a week of fast has very often completely relieved

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:27.360
 the spondylitis type of arthritis and inflammation, but after you are on that diet for a while,

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:40.120
 the excitatory inflammatory effect of the unbalanced phosphate and iron intake, a very

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:47.800
 unbalanced diet, eventually brings up other problems just as serious.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.760
 One last question about this and then we can move on.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.560
 In the complex biochemical web of all the stress substances, we were talking last time

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:58.920
 about PTH being like all roads lead to parathyroid hormone.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:04.360
 Where would you put endotoxin in that whole mix?

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:12.920
 It's a constant threat everywhere and all the time.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:23.760
 The bad diet choices will make it take over and become dominant, but even with the best

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:32.480
 diet, just something like a physical shock or an emotional shock can reduce the barrier

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:41.800
 function of the intestine enough and slow the digestion so that you absorb more endotoxin.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:49.600
 So it's very controllable, but it's always a present danger.

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:55.800
 I saw some old studies in the 50s and 60s showing that they suggested that the main

00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:03.480
 mechanism of the increased barrier permeability in the gut during stress was estrogen, because

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:11.800
 when they basically gave an estrogen blocker, the effects of stress on the increased endotoxin

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:12.800
 in the blood disappeared.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.480
 Do you share that view?

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:31.160
 Body capillaries are where the intestine barrier is most important, and everywhere in the body,

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:36.080
 estrogen weakens the capillary barrier.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.080
 Amazing stuff.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.080
 Thanks for that.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:43.000
 Or maybe we should do a little advertisement using air quotes here for your newsletter.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.400
 Okay, the newsletter is available by email now, and it's $28 US, which can be paid through

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.840
 PayPal at rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.720
 You can also order all of Ray's books, from PMS to menopause, progesterone and orthomolecular

00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:01.640
 medicine, gender of energy, my favorite, mind and tissue, nutrition for women, and then

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.240
 Progest-E from Keenogen.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:10.740
 So you can email Catherine to purchase progestekeenogen@gmail.com, and each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.440
 of progesterone.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:17.000
 And while we're on the topic of progesterone, I'm going to kick questions off here with

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 Marcelo's question.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.880
 And he says, "Hey Danny, can you ask Ray if he had ever seen or heard of a woman regaining

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:26.720
 her fertility taking high-dose progesterone?

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:31.880
 We're talking to someone who has been infertile for a decade or more."

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:42.160
 When I was teaching nutrition classes, there were several women who said they had been

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.360
 infertile for more than 10 years.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:53.480
 And it was a three-month class, and usually there were two or three people during that

00:56:53.480 --> 00:57:04.120
 class who would suddenly get pregnant, almost all of them just with diet changes.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:11.920
 But it was to increase their progesterone and thyroid and to get their estrogen under

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:12.920
 control.

00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:29.480
 And one woman, a medical doctor, she had diagnosed ovarian failure when she was, I think, about

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:31.760
 35.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:41.480
 And by carefully taking a blood test about every week or two, she imitated the natural

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:50.920
 hormones of the cycle with small amounts generally of both thyroid and progesterone.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.680
 That doesn't take a huge amount when it's at the right time.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:58:03.720
 And I think, I forget her exact age, but she was in her 40s and had been perfectly infertile

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.640
 for over 10 years.

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:14.680
 And had a baby very quickly as soon as she got her blood test showing the hormones in

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.680
 the right range.

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:16.680
 That's amazing.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.680
 Thanks for that.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.680
 Okay, first question.

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:23.920
 "Raise thoughts on the importance of posture and health.

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:28.200
 Does good posture come from good health or vice versa?"

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:38.360
 I think good health makes you feel springy and energetic, so you take on the aspect of

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:42.120
 a springy, energetic person.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:49.880
 If everything hurts and you're tired, naturally everything is going to slump.

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:53.880
 I think a long time ago, you wrote to somebody I knew and you were specifically talking about

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:58.160
 maybe DHEA and testosterone causing a lot of the slumping.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:01.640
 Of course, those are energetic types of therapies.

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:11.120
 Yeah, and the pregnenolone and progesterone work with them.

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:25.480
 The fascia that hold up your skin, even though they're basically fibroblast type cells, in

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:32.840
 the absence of those protective steroids, they go limp.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:41.720
 And given just pregnenolone, for example, but the others all have a similar effect,

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:47.520
 just a dose of pregnenolone will cause the fascia to contract, showing that they have

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:55.600
 the properties of smooth muscle cells besides being the tough connective tissue that holds

00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:01.320
 your whole body organs in place.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:13.320
 For example, if the fascia gets loose, the tendons and capsules around tissues all get

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:22.760
 slack and it can lead to the prolapse of the uterus, for example.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:31.300
 Several months ago, a woman told me that her doctor had planned to do surgery to pin her

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:40.080
 uterus back where it should be, but she was using a mixture of DHEA and progesterone,

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:46.720
 both topically and orally, and her uterus normalized.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.200
 No surgery needed to hold it in place.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:57.840
 That same thing where it happens throughout your body, undoubtedly it's going to affect

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:03.920
 your posture and the feeling of strength in your joints.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920
 Amazing.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.960
 Thanks for that.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.960
 Okay.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.400
 Does Ray think it's possible that apes are actually devolved human beings?

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:20.160
 Yeah, I've joked about that a lot.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:30.400
 If the vegetarians found a very congenial environment where they could eat all the vegetables,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:38.720
 they wanted their intestine would get bigger and bigger and their brain would get a smaller

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.200
 cortex and so on.

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.400
 The parts of this have all been demonstrated.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:54.760
 The more fibrous your diet is, the bigger your colon gets, and you can cause radical

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:05.640
 changes in a growing monkey, for example, just by the amount of fiber in the food.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:15.800
 And a poor diet very powerfully limits the growth of your brain.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:27.400
 I don't know about the distribution of body hair, but the length of the arms and legs

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:31.960
 is also something that's very responsive to gestational conditions.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:36.600
 Georgi, I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but do you want to ask Ray that question you

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:41.880
 talked about last time about the divergence of people that are following the rules versus

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.360
 ... Well, maybe I can just ask him.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.360
 You'd probably do a better job.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.000
 Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 Which one?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.720
 What do you mean, following the rules?

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.720
 Like with the people that don't want ...

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.720
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.840
 Basically, I mean, I thought that evolution can work backwards too.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:04.200
 Basically, if the environment is not energetically conducive to maintaining higher complexity

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.660
 of species, it's not just that apes are devolved humans.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:16.560
 We may devolve into a lower level species.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:22.100
 My question is related to this lady's, is that, well, if the monkeys eat mostly leaves

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:26.860
 and fruit, aren't the leaves very rich in the keto acids?

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.360
 So why would that be a poor diet?

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.400
 I mean, it seems like they can get plenty of protein.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.000
 Because they're full of toxins.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:45.520
 Lately, I've been talking more about the causes of human development with a big brain and

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:53.000
 the areas where the biggest brains of fossils have been found.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:06.580
 I think if you look at the idea of evolving in reverse when you eat too many leaves, instead

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:15.420
 of leaves, if you have a very good climate that produces huge amounts of various fruits,

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:30.580
 the extreme concentration of calories, you can either get the necessary proteins from

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:41.460
 the right selection of fruits, or you could occasionally add eggs and bugs and so on.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:53.300
 But an abundance of fruit would provide the high calorie guarantee that is needed for

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.940
 maintaining the very expensive brain.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:08.580
 The hunting diet, if you eat lots of meat, which some evolutionists have suggested, the

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:18.580
 meat, even though it provides the essential proteins, doesn't necessarily provide the

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:28.820
 very high concentration of glucose and the materials for metabolizing glucose.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.300
 It tends to cause hypoglycemia.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:41.220
 In fact, the more meat you eat, the more insulin you secrete to handle the disposition of the

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.220
 protein.

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:52.100
 And if you aren't taking in carbohydrate, then the meat will give you chronically increased

01:05:52.100 --> 01:06:00.820
 cortisol and a tendency towards hypoglycemia from the maintained high insulin.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:05.540
 You're telling me Klaus Schwab wanting us all to eat bugs?

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:06.540
 He's on the right track?

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.540
 What was that?

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:13.220
 Klaus Schwab from the World Economic Forum.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:19.700
 You know he's all about us eating bugs as soon as possible.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.220
 Oh, yeah.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.260
 There are, I suppose, adequate protein.

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:34.260
 Once I had some very nice things that seemed to be like little fish patties, but after

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:40.100
 I'd eaten them, they turned out to be mosquito larvae.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:45.900
 There's a Mexican restaurant in DC and they serve tacos made from locusts.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:50.140
 Is this like a common thing in Mexico or is this some kind of a monstrosity that they

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.140
 concocted here?

01:06:51.140 --> 01:07:03.420
 I never heard of the locusts, but around the lakes, you've seen the butterfly net fishermen

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.140
 on Lake Patzcuaro probably.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:14.020
 I don't know if they still do it, but they used to have these big nets that they would

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:24.340
 skim the mosquito larvae with so they could collect them in really nutritious quantities.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:29.460
 They had a pleasant, mildly fishy taste.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:34.460
 That has to be just pure punishment, like the bug agenda.

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:41.380
 The oligarchs are just mad and they want to abuse the citizens.

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:44.660
 Everybody eats bugs in Thailand, that's what I remember.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:45.660
 Great stuff.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.660
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:55.180
 What does Dr. Pete think about life after death?

01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:58.260
 I never really think about it.

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:07.260
 I have read lots of discussion and more or less evidence.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:21.100
 A physics professor, one of the most famous physical chemists in the world, I always have

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:29.500
 trouble remembering his last name, but he became notorious at the University of Texas

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:40.820
 or Texas A&M maybe for doing experiments that showed transmutation of heavy metals into

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:43.020
 gold.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:54.700
 After he retired, having experienced the powers that come to bear on anyone who thinks outside

01:08:54.700 --> 01:09:07.660
 of the system, such as believing that transmutation can happen at non-nuclear energy levels, cold

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:18.780
 fusion for example, he wrote about the history of communicating with the dead.

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:29.380
 His book, The New Paradigm, I think it's called, has lots of interesting historical discussions

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:43.100
 of fairly convincing information transfer from post-living people to presently living

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.980
 people.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:46.140
 I wish I had saved it.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.100
 There was actually a great response to this question on the YouTube comments section,

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:57.580
 but they started with St. Georgie's, "The living state is the degree of electronic desaturation,"

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.540
 if that's correct.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:05.940
 And they were saying when you die, you go down to a lower level of energy metabolism

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.340
 and a lower level of consciousness.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:12.020
 Does that sound right to you?

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.740
 I think it's on a completely different level.

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:34.660
 The neutrino sea idea as the ether for interaction of all substance, physical things like gravity

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:49.220
 and electricity, the common medium of neutrino sea actually has pretty good evidence.

01:10:49.220 --> 01:11:05.260
 The neutrino sea can resonate for a very low energy, but of the appropriate frequency,

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:13.020
 very low energy patterns can influence this ether or neutrino sea.

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:23.140
 And I think that's where the telepathic and transgenerational communication, how it's

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:24.140
 working.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:30.300
 So, do you think what we call the soul may be something like a standing wave in the neutrino

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.300
 sea?

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.300
 Yeah, exactly.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.300
 Okay.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:40.620
 I'm very, for a layman, like, so the physical body disappears and we melt into this neutrino

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.740
 sea, something like that?

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:43.740
 Yeah.

01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:52.580
 I'm not sure if it's still on the internet, but there was a very good video doing the

01:11:52.580 --> 01:12:03.620
 physical energy calculations called No More Secrets, a Canadian psychologist who died

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:18.140
 first thing, that just shows the physical energy possibilities for these externalized

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.740
 patterns that people can tune into.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.060
 So do you think that principle of deja vu that people experience, like they have seen

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:34.020
 that before, it's basically resonating with a past, with the brain state of not even their

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:41.220
 own, a basic of a previous life, so to speak, or a person that, I don't know, a very similar

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:47.420
 energetically wise, if we can say that their soul may be still being in the neutrino sea.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:52.100
 So what we experience as ancestral memories could be just resonating with those standing

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.620
 waves that are still there.

01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:05.140
 But the deja vu, where you are experiencing something that you can actually see it coming

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:12.820
 at you, so you know in some sense you've already seen it.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:25.300
 But our ordinary consciousness, we are constantly foreseeing a little bit of the future, and

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:33.340
 we ordinarily only project two or three or maybe four or five seconds into the future.

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:44.220
 But when you're listening to someone sing a tune or make a sentence, you can anticipate

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:55.220
 what's coming, and there's no simple dividing line between what's immediately past and

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.820
 what's immediately to come.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:15.940
 The brain is, in ordinary things like talking and singing, the brain is very oriented towards

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:25.580
 forming an image of what's about to come, and that can vary, just a well-stimulated

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:39.940
 brain can go much farther into hearing what's coming and interpreting what has just passed.

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:46.820
 If you aren't attending to someone in a lecture and suddenly at the end of a sentence

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:58.380
 they say a word that is important to you, you can wake up and replay, get back to the

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:05.020
 beginning of that sentence, even though you weren't consciously recording it.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:11.100
 So you can make your brain back up and deliver something that you missed.

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:17.460
 I was just going to say that the lack of clear dividing line between the immediate past and

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:23.180
 the incoming immediate future, I think that line actually seems to extend way further

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:28.380
 out because there are studies published showing that people that have learned something as

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:32.980
 little kids completely forgot it and they went through some kind of a trauma, usually

01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:37.820
 an electric shock of sorts, suddenly remember everything in vivid detail from things that

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:45.500
 happened decades ago and managed to basically reconstruct through a story that was later

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:51.180
 verified because I guess that event was recorded somewhere, that they basically had an incredibly

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:54.580
 detailed memory that they were able to connect with.

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:59.460
 It was a very distant past, we're talking several decades.

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:10.100
 Yeah, and if you think of the incredible detail in that kind of memory that we're ordinarily

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:23.380
 completely unconscious of, that kind of extreme detail I think can extend into the future

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.540
 even though you're not attending to it.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:36.780
 Sometimes the deja vu experience is when something slips in your brain and you forget to ignore

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:44.860
 enough of what's coming in and suddenly you see what's to come for maybe 10 or 15 seconds

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:45.860
 ahead.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:48.100
 What do you think of synchronicity?

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:52.500
 Do you think it's a sign of us resonating well with the environment?

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:57.660
 It seems to occur when people are in particularly good energetic state and attentive to the

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.660
 environment.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:05.780
 Yeah, there are a couple of very good books on synchronicity.

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:17.860
 One by F. David Peat is a good one, pretty much the history of stories about it.

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:33.140
 But I think that's true that things are, again, the ether or the neutrino sea I think

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:42.340
 is guiding causality enough that sometimes things will choose to happen because you're

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:44.780
 ready to perceive them.

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:45.780
 I see.

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:50.540
 And one last question related to the ancestral memories.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:54.540
 There have been several public cases of people undergoing brain surgery and then when they

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:59.660
 wake up suddenly start speaking fluently a foreign language that they had never heard

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:01.100
 before in their lives.

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:02.380
 What do you think could explain that?

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:08.420
 Would it be a resonance with a dead soul or a previous brain state or what could it be?

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.060
 Because they've never learned that language in their lifetime.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:22.860
 One of the cases I read about many years ago was a woman who had been a cleaning lady in

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:26.340
 some academic organization.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:36.780
 She had spent years scrubbing floors and emptying waste baskets for professors who spoke different

01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:43.460
 languages but just being present.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:51.220
 When she had a brain accident suddenly she could speak the languages that she had been

01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:56.300
 around but not knowingly attending to.

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300
 I see.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:02.700
 So the brain acquired, I mean the brain is capable of resonating with past events though

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.820
 not always on demand.

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.420
 Some kind of a trigger is needed.

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.420
 Yeah.

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:20.340
 Aldous Huxley took up one of the ideas that was introduced I think at the end of the 19th

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:30.620
 century and thought of the cortex of the brain as a filtering device and when something damages

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:40.180
 the cortex enough to get it out of the way the full complexity of reality can break through.

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.700
 I think I'm going to give myself a TBI to speak Spanish better.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:49.020
 Are you familiar, Ray, with the Hinduistic ideas?

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.020
 Probably are.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.020
 Of prana and akasha.

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:57.060
 Akasha I guess being the equivalent of the neutrino sea where every event that ever happened

01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:02.020
 basically is recorded forever and continues to exist as an analogy I guess of a standing

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:09.700
 wave and then depending on the intellectual or consciousness state of the person practicing

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:14.460
 yoga they can tune into that and basically have access to all of the events that have

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:16.460
 already happened.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.460
 Yeah.

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:31.740
 That sort of thing, the new paradigm, has really been developing for thousands of years

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.180
 in pretty much all of the cultures around the world.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:46.420
 There's this idea that under certain circumstances you can tune in and know much more than ordinary

01:20:46.420 --> 01:21:01.180
 knowing could produce like the George Wasson's story of the magic mushroom.

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:07.300
 Eventually it turned out that he was working with the government but he was at the time

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:18.460
 just a hobbyist, a rich person wanting to investigate the magic mushroom culture of

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:22.220
 Mexico.

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:28.940
 One of their experiments was to, because the people talked about the ceremonies as their

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:38.860
 mail service just so he could be there watching their procedures, he asked what was happening

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:51.180
 with his son in New York and the shaman told him that something very serious was going

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:58.420
 on and so when he got back to Mexico City he called his son and found that he had got

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:07.460
 a draft notice that day and was in an emotional state.

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:15.900
 There are lots of stories like that where the mushroom takers can focus in on something

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:21.740
 in very, very remote places.

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:27.260
 So the process of learning, would it be fair to say that it's basically the change of the

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:33.500
 structure or even the frequency of that standing wave in the neutrino sea as we observe and

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.060
 interact with new events?

01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:37.140
 Is that how we learn?

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:40.420
 I think so.

01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:50.740
 Since very, very early, I don't really know when I concretized it, but I began seeing

01:22:50.740 --> 01:23:06.980
 consciousness as something electronic or finer, either the neutrino sea or a sort of coherence

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:12.660
 of electrons, sort of like the conductive electrons in the metal.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:25.820
 I've visualized the process of consciousness in the brain as being this sort of jelly-like

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:36.420
 ethereal material that we push around with our biological activity in the nerves, but

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:45.780
 what's really happening is that we are the resonance process in this conductive electronic

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:52.020
 or sub-electronic substance.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:24:01.620
 And so knowing, if that's what our everyday knowing is doing on its basis, then those

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:11.780
 exceptional experiences of knowing things we shouldn't know would fit in with the idea

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:26.500
 that we have adopted a way of using our cortex to filter out those ultra-fine details of

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.500
 reality.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.220
 Amazing stuff.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.900
 Thanks for that, guys.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.380
 Please ask Dr. Peet about the safety of dental implants.

01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:40.420
 Are there issues in terms of inflammation/autoimmune response or toxicity?

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:43.540
 Thank you.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:53.540
 The stories I've read about the failures have made such an impression on me that all of

01:24:53.540 --> 01:25:02.020
 the successes don't seem very important when you hear about someone's jaw falling off,

01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.380
 basically.

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:13.380
 The bone disappearing, the jaw bone disintegrating to the point that they have to put a metal

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.540
 jaw bone in.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:21.740
 I kind of forget about this, but I got my tooth knocked out a long time ago in 2009.

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:24.340
 I have a plastic retainer.

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:30.660
 What kind of devastating things is that doing to my health, do you think?

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:35.580
 Just a plastic over your tooth, I don't think hurts anything especially.

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:40.220
 It's one that covers, it's like the front left tooth, so it covers all the teeth on

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.220
 the top.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:45.340
 It's kind of ruining a lot of the back teeth because it's constantly there.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:56.940
 Yeah, I don't think it does any deep harm, but the idea of putting a foreign object,

01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:05.460
 the teeth are separated from the bone by very special barriers, but to dig right into the

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:15.940
 bone and put a foreign object inside the bone, that just doesn't make biological sense.

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:25.220
 Sometimes the body can handle it and you won't lose your jaw bone, but when it does, there's

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:29.380
 hardly any repair that's satisfactory.

01:26:29.380 --> 01:26:32.740
 Would you say dentures will be safer?

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:39.660
 They can do the exact same thing without the implantation risks?

01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:44.700
 All kinds of restoration are preferable.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:51.500
 Crowns can often be done on a basically destroyed tooth.

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.700
 Amazing.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.140
 This one's from our friend Dodie.

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:58.300
 She says, "We know the purpose of the vaccine, if that's what you want to call it, but what

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:06.620
 is the purpose of the booster shot for COVID and how does it relate to the variant?"

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:19.100
 The increasing insights into the appearance of the variants, so-called, it increasingly

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:28.100
 looks clear that the variants are nothing but the side effects of the various nucleic

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:33.060
 acid treatments.

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:47.540
 The first reaction of people like Luc Montagnier was that the variants were caused by the immunity

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:57.700
 to the first one, and so the virus would mutate and become maybe more and more infectious,

01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:08.420
 but usually that kind of resistance of the host generally leads to it becoming less deadly

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:11.180
 while being more infectious.

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:19.740
 But as the information has come in, it looks like there might not be any such thing as

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:30.780
 a gamma, delta, whatever variant, but simply that it's a name that's being given to the

01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:37.340
 symptoms produced by the original vaccine.

01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:47.580
 So if that's the case, then the booster shot is, if it's the real vaccine material, it's

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:56.380
 just going to produce more so-called variants, more vaccine symptoms.

01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.380
 Great stuff.

01:28:57.380 --> 01:28:58.380
 Thanks, Dodie.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:28:59.380
 Thanks, Ray.

01:28:59.380 --> 01:29:05.060
 Okay, "Does Ray identify himself as a social anarchist in the sense of excluding rent-seeking,

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:09.940
 forming worker cooperatives, freeing the individual from authority, collectivism, direct democracy,

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:14.260
 mutual aid, etc.?"

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:27.020
 No, I think organization, if it's allowed to develop, the systems have been very quick

01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:36.620
 to kill any incipient organization, but to the extent that they can spontaneously come

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:49.140
 into existence, you'll have consumers, cooperatives, and producers, cooperatives, and the organization

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:59.660
 will be what suits the people on the ground level, but if that's allowed to develop, it

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:11.060
 will develop, and they will find the best way for these ground-level cooperative organizations

01:30:11.060 --> 01:30:16.780
 to cooperate on a larger and larger scale.

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:24.580
 So I think that's a natural course of development.

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:35.780
 If some of these spontaneous cooperative groups could somehow take over the state, then you'd

01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:45.380
 have the problem of maybe the consumers having more control than the producers, but if it

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:52.980
 grows up from the ground up, you're going to have to solve the problems of each level

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:56.660
 of organization as they come about.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:06.500
 So I don't think there's any problem with evolving even a world-level state as long

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:14.300
 as it's based on these spontaneous surface level.

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:19.540
 Is there any truth to, I mean, the way it at least looks to me is that the social structure

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:24.780
 and the political structure are in a sense a metabolite of the health of the people that

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.980
 are building them.

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:31.220
 So if the people are relatively healthy, they can thrive under a variety of systems without

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:37.180
 them being exploitative and degenerating into the worst that a particular system has to

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:38.180
 offer.

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:41.980
 So instead of worrying about a specific political system, wouldn't be the most prudent thing

01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:47.220
 would be to just sort of like optimize or maximize individual health and then see what

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:50.300
 kind of structure emerges from there?

01:31:50.300 --> 01:32:07.740
 Yeah, because different cultures, for example, military oriented cultures, there's evidence

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:18.700
 that they are very tightly connected with child abuse and body mutilation and repression

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:23.220
 of sexuality in children.

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:35.540
 Those things are closely tied with sadistic group policies and sadistic war making, head

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.020
 chopping and so on.

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:46.900
 And you don't want one of those societies to take over a larger government.

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:57.100
 It has to be basically an indulgent social organization that doesn't oppress its own

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:58.100
 children.

01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:04.740
 But in a healthy, in a group of healthy people, that sort of society wouldn't form to start

01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.100
 with.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:11.380
 My concern is that as soon as we say, oh, we should prevent that sort of culture taking

01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:17.580
 over and then establishing itself, then the only way to fight such a vicious thing is

01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:23.020
 through basically other kinds of violence, which ultimately tends to be kind of self-defeating

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:28.140
 because if you continue this conflict long enough, even the good peaceful culture will

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:32.580
 eventually militarize itself through this constant conflict that has been going on.

01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:37.860
 So it seems to me that the only way to ensure a sort of like semi-stable existence of a

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:43.140
 large group of people is make sure that as many of them are as healthy as possible and

01:33:43.140 --> 01:33:48.780
 then natural or natural non-exploitative order should arise.

01:33:48.780 --> 01:34:02.860
 Yeah, the problem is that an urge to conquer tends to lead to conquest and that involves

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:14.300
 such things as being hostile, outline good food, for example.

01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:27.580
 Basically conquest can take the form of establishing a medical system that doesn't allow preventive

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:37.220
 methods, says everything has to be focused on killing the pathogens, cutting out the

01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:49.500
 details and so on, so the society that asserts the importance of being healthy is itself

01:34:49.500 --> 01:35:01.100
 in danger of offending the sadistic cultures and stimulating oppression from them.

01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:05.400
 So I guess there is some truth to the saying that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.460
 even for healthy people.

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:16.940
 I think so until two or three generations you might outgrow the sadistic tendencies

01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:21.140
 that have been inculcated for so long.

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.540
 164 people watching right now.

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:24.540
 Thank you guys so much.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:25.540
 Sincerely appreciate it.

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:26.940
 Give this episode a like.

01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:28.900
 All donations here will be sent to Ray.

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.660
 I don't think I sent you the last donation.

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:32.860
 I've been very busy, but I will send them to you.

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:33.860
 I promise.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:36.540
 Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much for being here.

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:39.620
 Obviously, Ray, thank you so much for doing this so regularly.

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:43.100
 Such a pleasure to have you on.

01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:45.180
 This next question.

01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:55.740
 What does Ray think is the role of estrogenic predominance in sexual orientation and paraphilic

01:35:55.740 --> 01:35:56.900
 disorders?

01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.060
 So sexual fetishes, nymphomania, excessive masturbation, and porn addiction.

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:06.540
 What do you think about that, Ray?

01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:16.500
 One of the problems with high estrogen is that it doesn't allow sexual satisfaction.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:30.940
 It's the prod to seek satisfaction, but it requires a good balance of thyroid and progesterone.

01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:37.060
 And androgens to achieve satisfaction.

01:36:37.060 --> 01:36:46.620
 And so it can lead to such things as nymphomania or insatiability.

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:55.620
 And at the same time, it has this toxic excitatory effect on the brain.

01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:12.780
 So it can contribute to obsessiveness, hyperactivity, poor attention.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:21.740
 Everything you do to increase your biological energy and vitality is tending to keep estrogen

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:22.740
 subdued.

01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:23.740
 Amazing.

01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:26.420
 So a similar track.

01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:33.340
 Is celibacy dangerous in a relationship that will be long term for the foreseeable future?

01:37:33.340 --> 01:37:48.420
 I think it's always a result of an imposition like these sadistic cultures suppress women's

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.020
 sexuality in particular.

01:37:51.020 --> 01:38:05.260
 And they start very early by often mutilations, including circumcising both girls and boys

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:15.020
 to remove the satisfaction of sexual interest.

01:38:15.020 --> 01:38:16.020
 Amazing.

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:20.020
 Thank you for that, Ray.

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:21.900
 OK, last sex question here.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:28.020
 Not to put him in the public ire, but does Ray what does Ray think of homosexuality?

01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:35.940
 But does Ray think homosexuality is optimal, optimal normalcy?

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.580
 If it's optimal or what?

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:43.460
 I don't really know what they meant by that, but I guess your take on homosexuality.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:47.860
 I think the gist of the question is the person thinks that homosexuality is driven by hormonal

01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:52.740
 imbalances and it's not in an optimal, healthy sexual state.

01:38:52.740 --> 01:39:02.660
 Yeah, the evidence from history as well as animal experiments are that you can produce

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:13.500
 it by stress during gestation.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:26.220
 Gestation is abnormal in some way, isn't something that I think law should be involved in regulating

01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.900
 in any way.

01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:38.940
 But I think the evidence is clear that it's a particular product of both prenatal and

01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:40.420
 early life stresses.

01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:45.940
 Have you seen the more recent studies demonstrating that finasteride can pretty reliably induce

01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:47.500
 homosexuality in animals?

01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.260
 No, I haven't seen that.

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:55.900
 Yeah, well, I mean, I guess you can never know if an animal is homosexual or not, but

01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:01.540
 they started displaying the male animals started behaving like females and started quoting

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:06.620
 the other normal males and assumed like a mating position and basically started behaving

01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:08.380
 like females.

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:14.220
 And when they stopped administering the finasteride, basically they became asexual.

01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:17.540
 They stopped behaving like females, but they didn't revert back to behaving like males

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:18.820
 either.

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:24.220
 And only when they were administered very high doses of testosterone did they sort of

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:28.060
 not completely sort of revert back to acting like normal males sexually.

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:32.260
 How long ago was that done?

01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:33.980
 That study is, well, it's not that old.

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:35.940
 I think it was from the late 90s.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:44.500
 Well, to tag along with what you said, if a culture is promoting stress in every way,

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:49.860
 shape or form, and then stress promotes homosexuality, it's not like a moral judgment on a person.

01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:56.020
 They're just expressing what the signals from the environment are telling them to do, right?

01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:57.020
 Yeah.

01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:59.900
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:00.900
 Sincerely appreciate it.

01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:01.900
 Okay, let me.

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:04.140
 Okay, I get this question a lot.

01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:08.780
 So this is why I'm asking, what are Ray's thoughts on Adolf Hitler and his expulsion

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:11.500
 of banking cartels and masons from Nazi Germany?

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:20.500
 And then the other part of this question was a little too hot for YouTube.

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:29.380
 He had many right perceptions, but in a very crooked way.

01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:41.660
 He convinced the voters that Germany had been close to revolution, and the fear was that

01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:49.860
 the voters would gradually support a Bolshevik type of government.

01:41:49.860 --> 01:42:00.380
 And so all of the money and bank powers of Germany and England and the US concentrated

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:08.340
 on supporting him as the barrier against Bolshevism.

01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:22.220
 And he developed a language that would convince the voters who wanted social welfare, guaranteed

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:28.100
 employment, health care and so on, good transportation and so on.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:36.700
 He talked to them and said he would give them socialism, but he told the bankers there would

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:51.980
 be national socialism that wouldn't threaten to benefit anyone outside of German society.

01:42:51.980 --> 01:43:02.140
 And so he had lots of progressive pro-worker things for German citizens, but at the same

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:10.460
 time he was following the instructions of the money system.

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:25.940
 And his anti-Semitism was partly just to convince the working people that he had an awareness

01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:38.700
 of the manipulators of money and the banks, but he really was working with some of the

01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:48.300
 top Zionists, and they wanted pressure on European Jews so that they would move to Israel

01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:49.820
 and set up a new country.

01:43:49.820 --> 01:44:01.380
 So there was collaboration between the Zionists and Hitler for a while, but it finally turned

01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:07.020
 into the murderous anti-Semitism.

01:44:07.020 --> 01:44:19.620
 And the things such as the anti-masonry, that was part of the German culture at the time.

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:31.700
 He used those things to keep his mass support along with giving them cheap little cars and

01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:42.420
 high-speed highways, things that simply made the Germans able to be distracted from what

01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:44.500
 he was doing elsewhere.

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:48.700
 Amazing, thanks for that.

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:53.780
 How might Ray respond to the question of why worker ants are sent out into dangerous conditions

01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:58.440
 while queen ants are protected other than worker ants are not reproductive, cannot pass

01:44:58.440 --> 01:44:59.900
 on genes anymore?

01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.060
 Well queens can, same with bees.

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:10.940
 I wasn't joking when I said ants were observable national socialists.

01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:16.260
 Their organism also strategy is clearly designed around a collective effort to provide for

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:19.140
 reproduction of the tribe's genetic material.

01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:24.180
 They have a rigid deterministic caste system where sterile ants are sterile their whole

01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:32.060
 lives and will readily give up their lives to protect the productive queens.

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:44.660
 But at the same time individual ants can be intelligently altruistic one ant to another.

01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:51.180
 So it's not, I mean, it's a hierarchical structure, but they're also altruistic to each other

01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:56.420
 at the same case when they actually should be competitive if there's truly a national

01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:58.660
 socialistic system, right?

01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:05.620
 Yeah, and there are lots of good people doing good things in the United States, for example,

01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:13.620
 even though the system is definitely not designed to have good people doing good things.

01:46:13.620 --> 01:46:17.260
 Let me ask the question which Danny didn't, but it's right there.

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:20.860
 Somebody asked, is Ray Peat a communist?

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:22.380
 And I know it's a very loaded word.

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:23.620
 I thought you answered it already.

01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:24.620
 That's why I didn't answer it.

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:28.780
 But no, there was another one where he's a social anarchist, but somebody asked directly,

01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:30.460
 is Ray Peat a communist?

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:32.460
 There you go.

01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:36.100
 I'm not sure what the difference is.

01:46:36.100 --> 01:46:48.460
 If you define either of them very thoughtfully, there's not really any difference.

01:46:48.460 --> 01:47:00.980
 You want to get rid of tyranny and you want to have cooperation.

01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:10.300
 The idea of communism essentially goes back to Christianity as the main source of those

01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:13.060
 ideas.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:31.020
 And it has developed a lot of historical confusion around it, but the Christian beliefs are at

01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:35.460
 base, you could say that they're predominantly communistic.

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:41.220
 Didn't William James say that Christ was a communist or something along those lines?

01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:55.540
 A lot of people have, because of his attitude towards money changers, the common person,

01:47:55.540 --> 01:48:05.540
 even the outcasts of the system, he was definitely a bottom-up person.

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:10.900
 You can call that anarchism or communism either way.

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:14.860
 Do you think it's possible to have Christianity without the involvement of the church?

01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:20.220
 And by the church, I specifically mean corrupt structures like the Vatican with their history

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:26.500
 of child abuse and financial machinations and supporting the Nazis and everything else.

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:36.220
 Yeah, I think one of the most interesting books on Christianity was Wilhelm Reich's

01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:48.100
 book The Murder of Christ, and he gets much of his guidance from the New Testament.

01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:49.100
 Amazing.

01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:54.660
 Okay, let me search real fast for – I skipped this question.

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:59.460
 Okay, in regards to an extremely morbidly obese person in their 40s and 50s, what are

01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:04.660
 the first steps they should do to tackle their weight?

01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:08.780
 Should some fasting regimen like Alternative Day or OMAD be feasible in this situation

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:11.160
 simply because of the danger posed by their weight?

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:15.880
 If they're 300 plus pounds and they simply might not live long enough to take the slower

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:20.260
 PUFA-depleting bioenergetic route?

01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:21.700
 And what were the alternatives?

01:49:21.700 --> 01:49:26.300
 Well, they were saying, "Should I fast or should I do one meal a day?"

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:29.900
 Or I guess another possibility would be liposuction.

01:49:29.900 --> 01:49:32.060
 If somebody's extremely obese, what do you think?

01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:34.540
 And they don't have a lot of time, what do you think they should do?

01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:45.420
 All of the alternatives are extremely harmful, and I've wondered whether there might not

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:48.620
 be a type of surgery to remove –

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:49.620
 Hello?

01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:54.220
 Yeah, do we just lose Ray?

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:56.580
 Yeah, we do.

01:49:56.580 --> 01:49:59.300
 Okay, I thought it froze.

01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:02.540
 Okay, let's – oh, Ray, are you there?

01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:03.540
 Yeah.

01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:05.820
 Sorry, you just dropped out for a second.

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:09.780
 I think we can just start that question over if you remember.

01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:10.780
 Okay.

01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:18.620
 The amount of damage is something that can be investigated.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:27.380
 The way liposuction is usually done, just sort of stirring a suction tube around in

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:37.500
 the fat causes lots of nerve damage as well as liberation of free fats into the system.

01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:47.740
 And there might be surgical ways of removing a large mass such as abdominal fat while doing

01:50:47.740 --> 01:50:57.860
 less systemic damage with good local anesthesia, for example.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:06.420
 I think it might be possible to unload 40 or 50 pounds of fat without doing terrible

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.700
 damage.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:20.060
 But a fast, especially if you're fat, that fat is going to travel through your brain

01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:26.700
 and liver and other organs on its way out of the body.

01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:34.780
 And so you're exposing yourself to a great prolonged toxicity.

01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:44.900
 I've seen someone fast steadily for two months to get over extreme obesity.

01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:54.300
 I'm not sure that your lifetime effect on your health is going to be worth it.

01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:56.220
 What about chemical interventions?

01:51:56.220 --> 01:52:03.380
 I mean, there is a tremendous track record of things like dinitrophenol being able to

01:52:03.380 --> 01:52:09.420
 cure effectively even extremely morbidly obese people, of course, under medical observation

01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:12.260
 because it can easily kill you if you overheat.

01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:16.620
 Would something like that be considerable?

01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:19.300
 Overdosing on thyroid does the same thing.

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:30.580
 At the right level, it can increase your safe oxidation of fats while helping to suppress

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:35.260
 the toxic random oxidation.

01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:45.220
 Both DNP and thyroid can, carefully controlled, can reduce the toxicity of getting rid of

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:46.900
 the fat.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:59.700
 But I think a diet high in calcium and vitamin D should be part of the program because they

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:10.660
 will support safe oxidation and provide the nutrients that, for example, a high milk diet

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:18.740
 will keep your metabolic rate higher and suppress the toxic effects.

01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:19.740
 Amazing.

01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:21.900
 Thank you for that.

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:24.700
 About 10, 15 more minutes here and then we'll let you go, Ray.

01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:25.700
 Thank you so much.

01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:26.700
 Thank you, Georgie Dinkov.

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:27.700
 Appreciate it.

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.980
 Okay, let me find this question.

01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:37.540
 Aside from painting, does Mr. Pete recommend any other practice for positive brain effects

01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:41.660
 such as knitting, sculpting, etc.?

01:53:41.660 --> 01:53:54.060
 Whistling, singing, playing a French horn, playing a recorder whistle, playing the cello

01:53:54.060 --> 01:54:04.500
 or violin, all kinds of things that are very structured and stimulating.

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:09.380
 Wouldn't things like gardening and tending to animals also work?

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:11.020
 Oh, yeah.

01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:12.020
 Amazing.

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:17.860
 Okay, James says, as a social animal, humans seem to have a need to belong and experience

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:19.620
 connection with other people.

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:24.580
 How can we meet this need in the current authoritarian anti-life culture and avoid a life of atomized

01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:29.300
 loneliness?

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:39.020
 I don't know, but I keep looking around for what people can do.

01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:49.420
 Just the simplest personal contact, if you can get three or four or more people together

01:54:49.420 --> 01:55:03.300
 with a similar interest, such as little music groups, something that is harmless looking

01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:13.380
 to the society, but getting people together, they're going to talk about their fate under

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:18.020
 the present system.

01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:26.260
 Anything you can think of to put people into personal contact, I think is going to eventually

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:32.380
 lead to political progress and organization.

01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:38.060
 This person says, on the most recent Radio Network interview, Ray talked a little about

01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:39.060
 pheromones.

01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:44.140
 He said a woman's emitted pheromones can change the way she is on birth control and again

01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:45.140
 when she stops.

01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:51.700
 Does Ray know what a woman emits and what she responds to changes in the lead up to

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:57.060
 menopause and can a man's pheromones change as well, making him less attractive to his

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.060
 partner?

01:55:58.060 --> 01:56:00.060
 Sorry, this is a really long one.

01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:04.820
 Can a woman's lack of interest in her long-term partner be due to pheromones?

01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:11.700
 Last thing, can anything be done to restore the pheromones to attractiveness again?

01:56:11.700 --> 01:56:23.340
 Good diet and hormone activity is the best thing to optimize the pheromones, but it's

01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:37.140
 true that both men and women have less of the attractive pheromones and probably gradually

01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:42.580
 some repellent pheromones.

01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:57.300
 I think little kids emit anti-sexual pheromones that I think they induce parental attitudes

01:56:57.300 --> 01:57:08.380
 towards them and then around puberty the chemistry changes towards sexual attraction.

01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:19.060
 To a great extent, I think the same attractants are emitted by both men and women, but with

01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:28.180
 some subtle variations that I don't think anyone has a very clear idea of what a woman's

01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:40.620
 attraction chemistry is, but I'm sure it contains some of the steroids that men emit.

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.980
 Super simple question, but what is a pheromone?

01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:46.340
 It's released by hair follicle?

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:58.180
 It can be any chemical that is volatile enough that you can detect it at some distance from

01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:01.180
 the emitter.

01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:11.380
 Fatty acids of different sorts work for insects and other animals, but the most clearly defined

01:58:11.380 --> 01:58:17.460
 human pheromones are derivatives of androgenic steroids.

01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.460
 Amazing.

01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:23.180
 Let's do one last break here real fast for talking about Progest-E and then I'll ask

01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:24.860
 you one or two more questions.

01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:29.020
 Okay, so Progest-E from Keenogen emailed Catherine to purchase a bottle.

01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:30.380
 She ships very quickly.

01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:33.980
 She packs it in this like mylar or something that protects it during shipping.

01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:36.660
 It's keenogen@gmail.com.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.580
 Each bottle of Progest-E contains 3,400 milligrams.

01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:40.940
 I have a photo here.

01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:45.300
 This is DHEA in this little thing here and then I have a little tiny $15 scale and then

01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:50.660
 I mix it in this glass thing I got from Japan, which I'll never go back to again.

01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:53.260
 A glass of Japan.

01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:56.620
 Japan, unfortunately, because I will never travel again, unfortunately.

01:58:56.620 --> 01:58:59.580
 And then you can, the newsletter is available by email now.

01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:01.500
 It's $28, which can be paid through PayPal.

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:06.100
 And I mean, best deal on the internet for raised by monthly newsletter.

01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.460
 And you can also purchase his books.

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:12.660
 And those are basically collector's items and I'd recommend everybody obtain them.

01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:18.980
 Okay, so again, I think we've talked about this many, many times, but I guess we can't

01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:19.980
 talk about it enough.

01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:26.300
 So this person says, if forced to be inoculated, are there any supplements or diet that will

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:34.860
 counteract the harmful side effects of the mRNA vaccine?

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:44.860
 The first thing is to consider your defenses and resistances, how you can avoid getting

01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:58.660
 it put into and if you can find alternatives such as a certificate of pre-existing immunity

01:59:58.660 --> 02:00:10.140
 or maybe a form of a vaccine that doesn't contain the nucleic acids because the present

02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:18.500
 ignorance, the reason the experiment is being done is because it has never been studied

02:00:18.500 --> 02:00:23.660
 in humans before and so you don't know what the outcome is.

02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:31.900
 And as long as it's experimental, it's on the surface, meaning we don't know what the

02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:35.900
 long-range outcome is going to be.

02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:49.420
 And the animal evidence is that there could be terrible long-range effects such as increased

02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:59.020
 susceptibility to all kinds of infectious diseases or to cancer or to brain degeneration

02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:02.460
 or sterility.

02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:15.220
 So if you allow yourself to be vaccinated, you're taking a big experimental gamble,

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:23.220
 the outcome of which you won't know as long as you're alive.

02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:33.260
 The fact that the so-called variants are tremendously increased in the people who had the vaccine

02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:45.820
 suggests that the disease effects of the virus and vaccine are essentially identical and

02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:57.580
 that is primarily through the toxic effects of the spike protein and that is a fundamental

02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:11.780
 and total promotion of inflammation in every system, hypertension, development of autoimmune

02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:22.180
 diseases, everything you can think of is promoted, which is promoted by angiotensin, is going

02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:28.860
 to be a possible outcome of a vaccine.

02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:41.460
 So the angiotensin receptor blockers and antihistamines and aspirin were known way back 10 or 15 years

02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:49.420
 ago to protect against the toxic effects of the spike protein.

02:02:49.420 --> 02:03:00.860
 The toxicity of that protein has been studied now for a long time and so the Chinese were

02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:08.500
 among the first to realize that angiotensin receptor blockers, antihistamines and aspirin

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:17.700
 simply by being anti-inflammatory were the first things to resort to.

02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:22.660
 So does the mRNA that's in the vaccine, does it use the same mechanism through the ACE2

02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:29.700
 enzyme to get inside of the cell?

02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:38.900
 Once you get the RNA in, it doesn't matter whether it's free RNA that comes into you

02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:48.540
 after being shed by someone who was vaccinated, most likely is either in an exosome form or

02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:58.380
 as free RNA coming out of their breath and skin and saliva and getting into your system.

02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:04.140
 So what I'm getting at is there is no way to prevent the mRNA present in the vaccine

02:04:04.140 --> 02:04:08.280
 from getting inside of the cell, similar to how we can prevent the virus from getting

02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:13.340
 inside of the cell, the wild virus, by giving something like Losartan or anything that blocks

02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:17.820
 that specific entry pathway.

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:19.900
 Nothing I know of.

02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:28.060
 They're using a lipid for getting the RNA quickly into the cells, but other studies

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:31.620
 show that you don't really need the lipid.

02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:41.140
 It will be taken up even in the naked RNA form and that's just a tendency of cells

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:54.060
 is to take up circulating molecules and sometimes they can be either assimilated or destroyed.

02:04:54.060 --> 02:05:02.700
 This particular fat happens to take the highest concentration in the ovaries, but distributes

02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:07.700
 it in every kind of cell in the body.

02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:12.440
 I'm moving house in November and I found a place that I really liked and we were doing

02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:18.800
 all the paperwork and the owner was like, "Can you send me your vaccine papers?"

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:21.480
 And I was like, "Yeah, there's no way that's going to happen."

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:23.360
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, you can't move in there."

02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:25.640
 I was like, "Okay."

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:26.640
 In Mexico?

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:31.440
 A gringo owned the house.

02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.000
 But it's just a sign of the future, I guess, or things that come.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.160
 There's a very interesting, entertaining situation.

02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:43.040
 Okay, Ray, we're going to say something, Ray?

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:44.040
 No.

02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:45.040
 Okay.

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.040
 Ray Peet, thank you so much.

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:47.640
 Stay on the line for just one minute, Ray.

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.080
 Georgi Dinkov, thank you so much.

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.800
 Is there any parting words, Ray?

02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:52.800
 Nope.

02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:54.800
 Georgi Dinkov, any parting words?

02:05:54.800 --> 02:06:01.480
 Well, I guess to me, the Appalachians start looking more and more attractive.

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:06.440
 If it's extremely rural and poor and has no internet and no cell phone service, I think

02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:07.440
 it should be considered.

02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:09.480
 Guys, we have an amazing audience.

02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:10.600
 Cecilia, appreciate it.

02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:12.440
 I get so many positive messages about these shows.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.040
 They're so fun to do.

02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.080
 Took a lot of work.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:17.880
 Thank you so much, Ray, for making these so special whenever you're on.

02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:20.260
 Thank you so much, Georgi, my partner in crime.

02:06:20.260 --> 02:06:22.120
 And thank you for the amazing audience.

02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:25.880
 Give this episode a like, subscribe to the sub stack or follow the show in some way,

02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:26.880
 shape or form.

02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:29.120
 And then also send all those donations to Ray.

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:30.120
 Guys, thank you so much.

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:32.440
 Have an amazing, amazing weekend.

02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.560
 And we'll see you sometime next month.

02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:35.120
 Okay, bye everyone.
