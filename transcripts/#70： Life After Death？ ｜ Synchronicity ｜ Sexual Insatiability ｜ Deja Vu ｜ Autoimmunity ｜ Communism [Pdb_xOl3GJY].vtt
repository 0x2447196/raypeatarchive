00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
 Hey guys, welcome to General Energy Podcast #70. Ray Peat, Georgie Dinkov. Ray, I just

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.580
 interrupted you, but we were talking before about like, what was your take on Australia?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.080
 And I thought you had an interesting take that I really haven't heard before, so I thought

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.480
 everybody would enjoy that.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.040
 For several decades, it has seemed that they've been heavily manipulated by the CIA or whoever

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:38.560
 the world manipulators are. And so I see their extreme reactions as being a test case for

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.840
 how fast they can get away with imposing stuff on different parts of the world. But I think

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.120
 the reaction there is strong enough that maybe they're going to hold back and think of something

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.720
 a little less crude for the US and Europe.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.920
 And then we also talked about, I told you I was a little confused on why the power elites

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.960
 would want to turn the US into a third world country. And we were talking about just the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.400
 possibility that the citizenry of the US are the last remaining threat to the power elite.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.040
 And once they were subdued, they could do all their illicit, weird activities without

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 any interruption.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:28.520
 Yeah. In one of her recent videos, Lee Merritt, an anti-vax physician, she said that in her

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.600
 state the number of people who own guns would be the equivalent of, I forget what it was,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.280
 the fifth largest army in the world.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.560
 Why do you think they don't simply own guns? They also regularly shoot them. So they're

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.960
 there. Well, maybe they're not on par with an active military, but they can put up a

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.520
 probably a pretty decent resistance if things really start getting ugly.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:03.360
 Yeah. Even though the firepower is like a million to one in favor of the Pentagon, the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.840
 actual ground level situation, if you have a thousand people with little guns and a hundred

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.000
 soldiers with bazookas and tanks becomes a better balance.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Do you think the Pentagon has managed to vet its, what you call it, the most loyal soldiers

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.080
 it has to the point where they're completely confident that none of these people will turn

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.520
 on them if they're being ordered to attack their own, like their own families?

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.240
 I think that's the purpose of Biden's talking about dishonorable discharge for people who

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:43.360
 don't get vaccinated. He doesn't want any ambiguous people ambivalent about following

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.000
 orders once he gets the vaccine resistors out, then he's got a nice robot army.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.240
 So we can expect something really bad when all those people are vaccinated, all the soldiers.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.440
 Yeah. If they're really giving them the same vaccine that is causing the CDC's death and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.560
 disability numbers to rise astronomically, then it's going to weaken the army. But I

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.440
 would suppose that they know better than to give the regular vaccines to anyone they want

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.120
 to rely on.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.200
 Did you see that the CDC chief, whatever her name is, she overruled her own advisory committee

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.000
 and basically went against the recommendations. The advisory committee said, no, most people

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.440
 don't need a booster as corrupt as we are. That's too much even for us. And she said,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.120
 nope, I'm going to overrule you. Is that legal under federal law? Does the agency have like

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.480
 supreme power over the agency?

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:52.560
 The agency's concept are internal regulations. I've interacted with some agencies that just

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.880
 really didn't take their own regulations seriously.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.240
 So what I'm hearing is that these advisory committees are largely ceremonial. Basically,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.760
 they're just sitting there making mood decisions, but ultimately it's the agency head.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.840
 Yeah. Just for giving it a little prestige.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.720
 I'm scrolling through looking for an article, but it was talking about during H1N1, the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.800
 government class was issued different vaccines than the population. And so what you're saying

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.520
 is like rooted in the mainstream article that I had come across at some point.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.560
 Several people have been talking about the evidence that several different vaccines or

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.040
 non-vaccines have been issued and the elite get the non-vaccines.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.080
 Just a week after it emerged that German armed forces were getting a different kind of H1N1

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.520
 vaccine to the general population, Der Spiegel magazine reports that the government will

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.840
 also get special treatment.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.560
 What you sent me Dolores Cahill's video, and she was talking about an interesting way of

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.920
 kind of holding people accountable that were forcing vaccines on people. Can you talk a

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.560
 little bit more about that?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.640
 A personal liability lawsuit is one of them. You have injured me and I'll take you to court

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.000
 and get redress. Another one was making them aware of the fact that they're committing

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.720
 a crime. If they do anything to coerce someone in any way, but especially to take an experimental

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.360
 medical treatment, that is worse than simple undefined coercion. But coercion is a felony

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.920
 in some states and a serious misdemeanor in all the rest. Federal law allows up to three

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.960
 years in prison for coercion.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.960
 But these lawsuits, they would only apply to actual to the actual doctors, the private

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.640
 industry, because the government officials have qualified immunity, right? Just like

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.160
 the cops. They cannot be sued for doing bad things to us.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.920
 Yeah, but your employer who is administering the illegal regulation, they would undoubtedly

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.240
 say it was just following the orders. But that has not been working very well.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.280
 So even though OSHA can mandate the employer and say, look, we're going to fine you if

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.560
 you don't vaccinate your employees and the employer does, that the employer is kind of

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.280
 caught between a rock and a hard place because both places can attack, right?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.800
 Yeah. And if the employees make it expensive by suing their employers for damages, if they

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.920
 get fired, then the company has to start thinking which side they'll take.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.680
 Many of the small ones will probably just simply simply fold and close shop, which I'm

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.640
 starting to think that may be that may be one of the desired side effects, even if it's

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.640
 not planned.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.840
 Well, the plan as expressed by Eric Schmidt two years, more than two years ago, it was

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.940
 in line with the Rockefeller Foundation and other long range plans. But the Pentagon Committee

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:08.720
 that Eric Schmidt was the chairman of outlined the need to destroy the existing economy of

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.320
 the United States so that it could be quickly replaced by a digital artificial intelligence

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.720
 economy that was expressed in 2019 before there was a pandemic.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.280
 You can see this basically, we all shop from Amazon, we all get our I.T. from Google and

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.080
 we all get our health care from a single whatever mandatory provider that we don't even get

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.080
 our health care. We we are administered health care against our wishes.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:44.400
 Yeah. And as the small businesses went broke, the Amazon and other giant corporations just

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.120
 about doubled their wealth.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:51.160
 Yeah. The office building that I'm that where my office is basically the company that was

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.280
 renting it out to small companies like me. They went bankrupt and BlackRock, the large

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.440
 the massive financial company, moved in and bought all the real estate in D.C.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.960
 Yeah. Right. Do you have opinions on Vanguard and BlackRock and how they own a lot of the

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.680
 huge major corporations? Like people think there can't be coordination between these

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.280
 huge like so-called private corporations and stuff, but apparently they own like everything.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:19.760
 Yeah. I saw someone analyzing the tentacles of Vanguard. They're everywhere with five

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.160
 or six percent ownership where they can have a strong influence.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.760
 You know who I think did?

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:33.040
 They're just about identical with the World Economic Forum in their policies and reach.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.280
 The guest who owns the private funds behind Vanguard, it's basically a who's who of the

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.240
 new cons, the Bush family, the Rumsfeld family, the Clintons, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:50.280
 Yeah. So no surprises here. I guess how this thing is unfolding. Is there anything you

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.520
 think is incredibly weak or a route to escape? Or do you think it's they're more or less

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.920
 the plan is going according to how they planned it?

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.240
 I think it's going according to the plan.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.200
 You don't see any glitches in their push for the vaccine for everybody and for the lockdowns.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.320
 I mean, I can tell you as liberal and woke as DC is, if another lockdown is attempted

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.480
 here, even the liberals will revolt and probably hang the mayor if she tries something like

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480
 that.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
 It would be good to see.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.720
 Right. I'm saying that even those people who were convinced initially that this is a good

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.520
 thing and they're trying to save the world and everybody should be vaccinated. They've

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.800
 had enough of basically being stuck at home with the screaming children and doing the

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.640
 work of both teachers and doctors and everything and doing their own work. So even the I don't

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.300
 know, the cool cities, I think the population has had enough. So I just don't see another

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.080
 lockdown unless there's a false flag operation with another virus or something militarily

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.080
 happens domestically.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.920
 They keep talking about alternative panic producers like a sudden breakdown of food

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:03.800
 supply or banking crashes, Internet shutdowns and so on. They've been talking about that

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.520
 for so long. I think it means they have something in mind, not necessarily those.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.320
 In one of the in one of your articles, you talked about how the Appalachian region has

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.960
 the lowest death rate from breast cancer, even though the rates of breast cancer are

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.120
 higher than the rest of the country. And you also mentioned how extremely rural areas and

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.600
 poor areas would probably not notice, you know, whenever the collapse of the world economy

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.520
 arrives. So a question to me is like, is there any reason why you wouldn't consider going

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.800
 to the Appalachian region? You don't think it's high enough altitude or you think the

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.920
 culture there is not very, I don't know, friendly? Just curious.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:50.400
 Yeah, there are pockets of culture that could be acceptable, but other places, the xenophobia

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:59.240
 basically not just according to skin color, but just having the wrong accent of an outsider

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:08.360
 can be difficult. I would choose a completely different country where they're used to tourists

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:14.400
 and Anglo people don't have such xenophobia.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.880
 Ron Unz has an article on his website recently about a journalist who went to Welch. It's

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.920
 a town in southern West Virginia. It's the poorest town in the poorest county in the

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.680
 entire country. And he basically chronicled the decline of the area, which used to be

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.760
 booming in the 50s due to coal and kind of coincided with the peak of America, from what

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.820
 I'm understanding. You said that the 50s was really the time where people had everything

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:46.360
 they needed and nothing they didn't. And just the way he described the area is that because

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.480
 it's so poor, they have really opened up to tourists and they're really friendly. And

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.160
 there's basically very little Internet and very little cell phone service and everything

00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.120
 is dirt cheap there. So I don't know, sounds very attractive to me. If I have to make a

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.720
 move from out of D.C., that will probably be the first place I would try.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:11.420
 Yeah, I think poverty in terms of the Internet culture is a very creative, highly progressive

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.420
 thing.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.060
 Well, it seems like people from Monterrey are like very westernized and that's something

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.060
 that...

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.060
 Oh, Monterrey, Mexico?

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:29.380
 Yeah. Buildings there, I've seen slogans, "Hitler was right." The cops there are the nastiest

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:38.300
 I've ever seen in Mexico. It's not just Americanized, but it's the worst industrialization can do

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.500
 to a government.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.380
 Good to know. One thing I was interested in getting your take on, I'm not sure if we've

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:49.380
 ever talked about it, but the incoherent narratives that conflict, like just watching Fauci contradict

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.500
 himself like a hundred times. And I think a lot of people would tend to say, "Oh, that's

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.740
 because our leaders are so incompetent." But what do you think about that being like a

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.500
 strategy of terror, of confusion, like to make people so confused that it inactivates

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.780
 them because they don't know what to do because nothing makes sense?

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:13.500
 Yeah, I think it's natural for them to just talk through their hat. And it turns out that

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:21.740
 that also is producing confusion and working in the direction they want people to go, panic

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.740
 and confusion.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.600
 I have a book, it's by a guy named Kurt Lewin. I think it's like 1942 or something. And he

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.780
 was some big wig at the Tavistock Institute. And in his book, he says, "If we just confuse

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.500
 people enough, they won't know what to do." And even if you're like a renegade, you will

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.660
 be inactive because there'll be no clear path forward of what to do because everything is

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.660
 so...

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.660
 I mean, that's basically what they do in the US. The people that consider themselves radicals

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.540
 are aligned with Citibank and Wells Fargo with the exact things they believe.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:59.800
 Yeah, four years or 2016 election, I guess, I noticed that the Communist Party of the

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:09.440
 US was supporting Hillary Clinton. That's a perfect example of confusing people to be

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.320
 utterly useless.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.480
 Or it shows how little commonness there is in the Communist Party of the United States.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.740
 Okay, well, we can take the show in really any direction we want. Ray, did you want to...

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.820
 you are working on something. Did you want to talk about that? Or we could go into questions.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.500
 Really we have free for all here.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.580
 Questions are okay. I'm right in the middle of thinking about what to write about something

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:44.540
 to do with development and immunity and how the whole system has been warped so much that

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:51.240
 it's almost impossible to talk about how the immune system works. And so it's a perfect

00:14:51.240 --> 00:15:01.040
 background for people saying ridiculous things about vaccines, for example, because there's

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:08.640
 no solid ground for making a decisive and final argument about any issue in the immune

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:17.240
 system. You have to see the history going back more than 100 years to see why the situation

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.880
 is so muddled around the vaccine issue.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:27.200
 Did Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Metzinger, did anybody take them seriously? Was that more

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:33.160
 of a static view of immunity ever a real contender against the traditional view?

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:40.880
 Jamie Cunliffe and his danger hypothesis, I think he got right to the center of the

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:48.640
 issue, but he hasn't been keeping up with his studies in the last 15 or 20 years. He's

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:57.800
 hardly refined his thinking. What he did was very good. And the Polly Metzinger ideas have

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:03.920
 been to some extent adopted by the mainstream, but in the process, their meaning has been

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:13.720
 lost. The potential of Polly Metzinger's system or perspective was to go the Cunliffe

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:24.120
 direction. It has instead gone the whole clonal selection right down the mainstream, everything

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.120
 staying the same.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.080
 And if I could butcher that point of view, it's that tissue injury, it comes before any

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.160
 kind of bacteria or fungi or anything like that. Right. And so if you're worried about

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.880
 immunity, you should be worrying about limiting tissue injury.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:48.880
 Yeah. And our body is concerned with coming into existence and maintaining that existence

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:56.800
 and improving it if possible. And the Cunliffe idea is that when something goes wrong, whether

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:07.360
 it's a mechanical or radiation or chemical damage or an organism that somehow created

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:15.200
 damage in our system, that it's a damage that our body is concerned with. And in the process

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:23.520
 of fixing that damage, it takes out the pathogen, whether it's part of an organism or a toxin

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:32.920
 or even radiation damage, the body takes the measures necessary to maintain its integrity

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:42.960
 and not really thinking or designed for or evolved to attack enemies or other than self.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:50.040
 It's the process of optimizing the self that has a sideline. It happens that sometimes

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:57.640
 we develop the antibodies and so on for taking out viruses and bacteria and parasites.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.880
 Well, there's some studies showing that depending on the occupation, specific occupations had

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.440
 a much higher rate of autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, like boxers, since

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.840
 they continuously damage their knuckles and various other joints, they're much more likely

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.040
 to develop this autoimmune condition. Hasn't this ever attracted attention of the mainstream

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.480
 medicine saying, well, there is a connection between chronic tissue injury and autoimmune

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.480
 conditions?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:28.400
 Very little. Twenty-five or thirty years ago, I saw a single article in which they took

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:37.280
 a piece of cow cartilage and I forget who's injected it into maybe rabbits. And when it

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:44.120
 was in a fresh condition, it didn't elicit antibodies. But if they just twisted the cartilage,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:54.360
 gave it a little bit of mechanical stress, then it elicited antibodies. And that was

00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:02.640
 like an image of how easy it is to induce the antibody reactions you see in autoimmune

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640
 conditions.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.600
 Have you seen the recent studies? I know you've said this many times, but recently they confirmed

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.320
 that endotoxin is directly responsible for the flares of rheumatoid arthritis.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:20.320
 Yeah, I've been following that general line that any injuries to the tissue will bring

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:30.640
 up the so-called autoimmune system. Virus infections in some of the experiments were

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:43.920
 lethal if the organism wasn't allowed to produce antibodies. The virus that would bring up

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:55.280
 the antibodies would in itself not produce the disease, but the antibody itself was there

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.800
 mostly to clear out the damaged tissue rather than to attack the virus.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.000
 Do you think chronic low-grade endotoxemia as they call it can be a factor in many of

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.640
 these autoimmune conditions constantly causing this small level of injury? And then eventually,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.520
 I guess if the organism is energetically depleted severely, then sort of like a chronic autoimmune

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.880
 condition sets in?

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:28.000
 Yeah, and things like lupus and the famous named autoimmune diseases including Sjogren's

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 syndrome and thyroid.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Hashimoto.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Hashimoto, yeah.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:44.400
 And probably MS. In some of these such as lupus, I've seen very clear diagnoses of everything

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:51.360
 confirming that it was the so-called lupus condition causing the arthritis and other

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:59.520
 symptoms. But just by correcting their vitamin D, calcium intake, progesterone and thyroid,

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.800
 all of the symptoms disappeared and they gradually started having a regression of the antibodies.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.480
 Right, so you're saying you don't need to go on the carnivore diet if you have an autoimmune

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.480
 disease?

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:20.920
 No, keeping your blood glucose up and your carbon dioxide high from oxidizing glucose,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:27.400
 I think those are the basic anti-inflammatory things that will correct all of the autoimmune

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400
 diseases.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.880
 I was making a joke, but actually, when a person does eat an all-meat diet and they

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:38.000
 do experience like an improvement in their symptoms, probably would be a reduction in

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 endotoxin, right?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.280
 Yeah. So many people are eating indigestible stuff that causes inflammation of their intestine

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:56.080
 and a meat diet will simply represent the absence of toxic indigestible foods, but that

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:03.720
 gives you very quick relief like a fast. A week of fast has very often completely relieved

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:14.200
 the spondylitis types of arthritis and inflammation. But after you are on that diet for a while,

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:23.760
 the excitatory inflammatory effect of the unbalanced phosphate and iron intake, a very

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.460
 unbalanced diet eventually brings up other problems just as serious.

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.420
 One last question about this and then we can move on. In the complex biochemical web of

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.460
 all the stress substances, we were talking last time about PTH being like all roads lead

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.980
 to parathyroid hormone. Where would you put endotoxin in that whole mix?

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:52.900
 It's a constant threat everywhere and all the time. The bad diet choices will make it

00:22:52.900 --> 00:23:00.980
 take over and become dominant. But even with the best diet, just something like a physical

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:06.940
 shock or an emotional shock can reduce the barrier function of the intestine enough and

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:15.620
 slow the digestion so that you absorb more endotoxin. So it's very controllable, but

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.220
 it's always a present danger.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:22.860
 I saw some old studies in the 50s and 60s showing that the main mechanism, they suggested

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:29.060
 that the main mechanism of the increased barrier permeability in the gut during stress was

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:35.740
 estrogen because when they basically gave an estrogen blocker, the effects of stress

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.780
 on the increased endotoxin in the blood disappeared. Do you share that view?

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:49.820
 Oh yeah, the capillaries are where the intestine barrier is most important. And everywhere

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.900
 in the body, estrogen weakens the capillary barrier.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.300
 Amazing stuff. Thanks for that. Or maybe should we do a little advertisement using air quotes

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:03.860

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:25.500
 Catherine to purchase Progest-E, keenogen@gmail.com. And each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.180
 of progesterone. And while we're on the topic of progesterone, I'm going to kick questions

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:34.500
 off here with Marcelo's question. And he says, "Hey Danny, can you ask Ray if he had ever

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:39.260
 seen or heard of a woman regaining her fertility taking high dose progesterone? We're talking

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.860
 someone who has been infertile for a decade or more."

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:50.620
 When I was teaching nutrition classes, there were several women who said they had been

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:57.780
 infertile for more than 10 years. And it was a three month class. And usually there were

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:04.300
 two or three people during that class who would suddenly get pregnant, just with almost

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:11.940
 all of them, just with diet changes. But it was to increase their progesterone and thyroid

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:23.140
 and to get their estrogen under control. And one woman, a medical doctor, she had diagnosed

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:32.140
 ovarian failure when she was, I think, about 35. And by carefully taking a blood test about

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:39.940
 every week or two, she imitated the natural hormones of the cycle with small amounts,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:45.220
 generally of both thyroid and progesterone. That doesn't take a huge amount when it's

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.100
 at the right time. And I think, I forget her exact age, but she was in her 40s and had

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:58.980
 been perfectly infertile for over 10 years and had a baby very quickly as soon as she

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:01.780
 got her blood test showing the hormones in the right range.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.380
 That's amazing. Thanks for that. Okay. Okay. First question, raise thoughts on the importance

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:10.580
 of posture and health. Does good posture come from good health or vice versa?

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:18.820
 I think good health makes you feel springy and energetic. And so you take on the aspect

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:26.180
 of a springy, energetic person. If everything hurts and you're tired, naturally everything

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.180
 is going to slump.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.900
 I think a long time ago you wrote to somebody I knew and you were specifically talking about

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.580
 maybe DHEA and testosterone causing a lot of the slumping. I mean, of course, those

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.940
 are energetic types of therapies.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:46.340
 Yeah. And the pregnenolone and progesterone work with them. The fascia that hold up your

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:55.860
 skin are, even though they're basically fibroblast type cells, in the absence of those protective

00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:05.020
 steroids, they go limp. And given just pregnenolone, for example, but the others all have a similar

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:11.740
 effect, just a dose of pregnenolone will cause the fascia to contract showing that they have

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:18.580
 the properties of smooth muscle cells besides being the tough connective tissue that holds

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:29.260
 your whole body organs in place. And for example, if the fascia get loose, the tendons and capsules

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:39.340
 around tissues all get slack and it can lead to the prolapse of the uterus, for example.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:47.020
 And several months ago, a woman told me that her doctor had planned to do surgery to pin

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:54.340
 her uterus back where it should be, but she was using a mixture of DHEA and progesterone,

00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:00.900
 both topically and orally, and her uterus normalized. No surgery needed to hold it in

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:08.140
 place. That same thing happens throughout your body. Undoubtedly, it's going to affect

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.780
 your posture and the feeling of strength in your joints.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:18.420
 Amazing. Thanks for that. Okay. Does Ray think it's possible that apes are actually devolved

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.420
 human beings?

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:31.340
 Yeah, I've joked about that a lot. If the vegetarians found a very congenial environment

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:37.180
 where they could eat all the vegetables they wanted, their intestine would get bigger and

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:44.700
 bigger and their brain would get a smaller cortex and so on. The parts of this have all

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:53.660
 been demonstrated. The more fibrous your diet is, the bigger your colon gets and you can

00:28:53.660 --> 00:29:01.580
 cause radical changes in a growing monkey, for example, just by the amount of fiber in

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:13.020
 food. A poor diet very powerfully limits the growth of your brain. I don't know about the

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:21.300
 distribution of body hair, but the length of the arms and legs is also something that's

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.100
 very responsive to gestational conditions.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.180
 Georgie, I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but do you want to ask Ray that question

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.900
 you talked about last time about the divergence of people that are following the rules versus

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.540
 ... Well, maybe I can just ask him. You'd probably do a better job. Do you know what

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:37.540
 I'm talking about?

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.620
 Which one? What do you mean by following the rules?

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.620
 Like with the people that don't want ...

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:46.620
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically, I thought that evolution can work backwards too. Basically,

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:54.180
 if the environment is not energetically conducive to maintaining higher complexity of species,

00:29:54.180 --> 00:30:03.660
 it's not just that apes are devolved humans. We may devolve into a lower level species.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:09.040
 My question is related to this lady's, is that, well, if the monkeys eat mostly leaves

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.780
 and fruit, aren't the leaves very rich in the keto acids? Why would that be a poor diet?

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.360
 I mean, it seems like they can get plenty of protein.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:25.440
 Because they're full of toxins. Lately, I've been talking more about the causes of human

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:32.520
 development with a big brain and the areas where the biggest brains of fossils have been

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:42.080
 found. I think if you look at the idea of evolving in reverse when you eat too many

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:50.720
 leaves, instead of leaves, if you have a very good climate that produces huge amounts of

00:30:50.720 --> 00:31:01.200
 various fruits, the extreme concentration of calories, you can either get the necessary

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:11.280
 proteins from the right selection of fruits, or you could occasionally add eggs and bugs

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:20.200
 and so on. But an abundance of fruit would provide the high calorie guarantee that is

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:27.160
 needed for maintaining the very expensive brain. The hunting diet, if you eat lots of

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:36.360
 meat, which some evolutionists have suggested, the meat, even though it provides the essential

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:45.280
 proteins, doesn't necessarily provide the very high concentration of glucose and the

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:53.080
 materials for metabolizing glucose. It tends to cause hypoglycemia. In fact, the more meat

00:31:53.080 --> 00:32:00.280
 you eat, the more insulin you secrete to handle the disposition of the protein. And if you

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:08.280
 aren't taking in carbohydrate, then the meat will give you chronically increased cortisol

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.080
 and a tendency towards hypoglycemia from the maintained high insulin.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.800
 You're telling me Klaus Schwab wanting us all to eat bugs? He's on the right track?

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.040
 What was that?

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:24.640
 Klaus Schwab from the World Economic Forum. You know he's all about us eating bugs as

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:25.640
 soon as possible.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:33.960
 Oh, yeah. They're, I suppose, adequate protein. Once I had some very nice things that seemed

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:40.600
 to be like little fish patties, but after I'd eaten them, they turned out to be mosquito

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 larvae.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:47.520
 There's a Mexican restaurant in DC and they serve tacos made from locusts. Is this like

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.840
 a common thing in Mexico or is this some kind of a monstrosity that they concocted here?

00:32:51.840 --> 00:33:01.480
 I never heard of the locusts, but around the lakes, you've seen the butterfly net fishermen

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:07.880
 on Lake Patzcuaro probably. I don't know if they still do it, but they used to have these

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:16.160
 big nets that they would skim the mosquito larvae with so they could collect them in

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.240
 really nutritious quantities. And they had a pleasant, mildly fishy taste.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.240
 Oh, wow.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.320
 That has to be just pure punishment, like the bug agenda. The oligarchs are just like

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:34.120
 mad and they want to abuse the citizens. And everybody eats bugs in Thailand. That's what

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.600
 I remember. Okay, great stuff. Thanks for that, Ray. What does Dr. Peete, what Dr. Peete

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.720
 thinks about life after death?

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:49.560
 I never really think about it. I have read lots of discussion and more or less evidence

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:58.400
 of it. A physics professor, one of the most famous physical chemists in the world, I always

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:05.480
 have trouble remembering his last name, but he became notorious at the University of Texas

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:14.320
 or Texas A&M maybe for doing experiments that showed transmutation of heavy metals into

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:23.080
 gold. And after he retired, having experienced the powers that come to bear on anyone who

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:32.240
 thinks outside of the system, such as believing that transmutation can happen at non-nuclear

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:41.760
 energy levels, cold fusion, for example, he wrote about the history of communicating with

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:50.080
 the dead. And his book, The New Paradigm, I think it's called, has lots of interesting

00:34:50.080 --> 00:35:00.400
 historical discussions of fairly convincing information transfer from post-living people

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.360
 to presently living people.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:06.240
 I wish I had saved it. There was actually a great response to this question on the YouTube

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.240
 comments section, but they started with St. Georgie's, "The living state is the degree

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.600
 of electronic desaturation," if that's correct. And they were saying when you die, you go

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:23.400
 down to a lower level of energy metabolism and a lower level of consciousness. Does that

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.400
 sound right to you?

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:35.400
 I think it's on a completely different level. The neutrino sea idea as the ether for interaction

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:46.240
 of all substance, physical things like gravity and electricity, the common medium of neutrino

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:59.320
 sea actually has pretty good evidence. And the neutrino sea can resonate for a very low

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:08.680
 energy of the appropriate frequency, very low energy patterns can influence this ether

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:16.880
 or neutrino sea. And I think that's where the telepathic and transgenerational communication,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.880
 how it's working.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:23.240
 So do you think what we call the soul may be something like a standing wave in the neutrino

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.240
 sea?

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:32.640
 Okay. For a layman, so the physical body disappears and we melt into this neutrino sea, something

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640
 like that?

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:41.000
 Yeah. I'm not sure if it's still on the internet, but there was a very good video doing the

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.560
 physical energy calculations called No More Secrets, a Canadian psychologist who died

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:59.880
 first. That just shows the physical energy possibilities for these externalized patterns

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.800
 that people can tune into.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.000
 So do you think that principle of deja vu that people experience, like they have seen

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.440
 that before, it's basically resonating with a past, with the brain state of not even their

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:17.840
 own, a basic of a previous life, so to speak, or a person that, I don't know, a very similar

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.540
 energetically wise, if we can say that their soul may be still being in the neutrino sea.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.880
 So what we experience as ancestral memories could be just resonating with those standing

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.880
 waves that are still there.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:37.320
 But the deja vu, where you are experiencing something that you can actually see it coming

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:46.160
 at you, so you know, in some sense, you have already seen it. Our ordinary consciousness,

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:53.280
 we are constantly foreseeing a little bit of the future, and we ordinarily only project

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:59.800
 two or three or maybe four or five seconds into the future. But when you're listening

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:10.080
 to someone sing a tune or make a sentence, you can anticipate what's coming, and there's

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:19.520
 no simple dividing line between what's immediately past and what's immediately to come. The brain

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:31.080
 is in ordinary things like talking and singing, the brain is very oriented towards forming

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:39.480
 an image of what's about to come. And that can vary. Just a well-stimulated brain can

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:48.840
 go much farther into hearing what's coming and interpreting what has just passed. If

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:56.120
 you aren't attending to someone in a lecture, and suddenly at the end of a sentence, they

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:04.760
 say a word that is important to you, you can wake up and replay, get back to the beginning

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:11.000
 of that sentence, even though you weren't consciously recording it. So you can make

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.680
 your brain back up and deliver something that you missed.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.680
 - I was just gonna say that the lack of clear dividing line between the immediate past and

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:25.400
 the incoming immediate future, I think that line actually seems to extend way further

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.780
 out, because there are studies published showing that people that have learned something as

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.200
 little kids completely forgot it, and they went through some kind of a trauma, where

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.240
 they basically, usually an electric shock of sorts, suddenly remember everything in

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:44.120
 vivid detail from things that happened decades ago, and managed to basically reconstruct

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.560
 through a story that was later verified, because I guess that event was recorded somewhere,

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.840
 that they basically had an incredibly detailed memory that they were able to connect with.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.000
 It was way, very, very distant past. We're talking several decades.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.800
 - Yeah, and if you think of the incredible detail in that kind of memory that we're ordinarily

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:16.680
 completely unconscious of, that kind of extreme detail, I think can extend into the future,

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:23.780
 even though you're not attending to it. Sometimes the deja vu experience is when something slips

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:31.080
 in your brain, and you forget to ignore enough of what's coming in, and suddenly you see

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.880
 what's to come for maybe 10 or 15 seconds ahead.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:40.080
 - What do you think of synchronicity? Do you think it's a sign of us resonating well with

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.280
 the environment? It seems to occur when people are in particularly good energetic state and

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.280
 attentive to their environments.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:54.740
 - Yeah, there are a couple of very good books on synchronicity. One by F. David Peat is

00:40:54.740 --> 00:41:04.980
 a good one, pretty much the history of stories about it. But I think that's true that things

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:15.380
 are, again, the ether or the neutrino sea, I think, is guiding causality enough that

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:20.580
 sometimes things will choose to happen because you're ready to perceive them.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:26.100
 - I see. And one last question related to the, I guess, ancestral memories. There have

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.500
 been several published cases of people undergoing brain surgery, and then when they wake up,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.820
 suddenly start speaking fluently a foreign language that they had never heard before

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.860
 in their lives. What do you think could explain that? Would it be a resonance with, I guess,

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:44.140
 with a dead soul or a previous brain state? Or what could it be? Because they've never

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.980
 learned that language in their lifetime.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:53.220
 - One of the cases I read about many years ago was a woman who had been a cleaning lady

00:41:53.220 --> 00:42:01.620
 in some academic organization. She had spent years scrubbing floors and emptying waste

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:10.500
 baskets for professors who spoke different languages. But just being present, when she

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:17.900
 had a brain accident, suddenly she could speak the languages that she had been around, but

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.620
 not knowingly attending to.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:25.220
 - I see. So the brain acquired, I mean, the brain is capable of resonating with past events,

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:29.780
 though not always on demand. Something, some kind of a trigger is needed.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:39.260
 - Yeah. Aldous Huxley took up one of the ideas that was introduced, I think, at the end of

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:46.620
 the 19th century and thought of the cortex of the brain as a filtering device. And when

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:53.980
 something damages the cortex enough to get it out of the way, the full complexity of

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.420
 reality can break through.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.940
 - I think I'm going to give myself a TBI to speak Spanish better.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:04.620
 - Are you familiar, Ray, with the Hinduistic ideas? Probably are, of prana and akasha.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:09.420
 Akasha, I guess, being the equivalent of the neutrino sea, where every event that ever

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:14.420
 happened basically is recorded forever and continues to exist as an analogy, I guess,

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:20.500
 of a standing wave. And then depending on the intellectual or consciousness state of

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:25.340
 the person practicing yoga, they can tune into that and basically have access to all

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.140
 of the events that have already happened.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:34.020
 - Yeah, that sort of thing, the new paradigm, has really been developing for thousands of

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:41.700
 years in pretty much all of the cultures around the world. There's this idea that under certain

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:49.500
 circumstances you can tune in and know much more than ordinary knowing could produce.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:58.820
 Like the George Wasson's story of the magic mushroom, eventually it turned out that he

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:07.380
 was working with the government, but he was at the time just a hobbyist, a rich person

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:16.380
 wanting to investigate the magic mushroom culture of Mexico. And one of their experiments

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:22.940
 was to, because the people talked about the ceremonies as their mail service, just so

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:29.340
 he could be there watching their procedures, he asked what was happening with his son in

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:39.180
 New York. And the shaman told him that something very serious was going on. And so when he

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:46.300
 got back to Mexico City, he called his son and found that he had got a draft notice that

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:53.900
 day and was in an emotional state. But there are lots of stories like that where the mushroom

00:44:53.900 --> 00:45:00.500
 takers can focus in on something in very, very remote places.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:05.660
 - So the process of learning, would it be fair to say that it's basically the change

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:09.900
 of the structure of that, or even the frequency of that standing wave in the Neutrino Sea

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:14.140
 as we observe and interact with new events? Is that how we learn?

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:23.020
 - I think so. Since very, very early, I don't really know when I concretized it, but I began

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:34.380
 seeing consciousness as something electronic or finer, either the Neutrino Sea or a sort

00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:42.140
 of coherence of electrons, sort of like the conductive electrons in the metal. I've visualized

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:51.460
 the process of consciousness in the brain as being this sort of a jelly-like ethereal

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:59.380
 material that we push around with our biological activity in the nerves. But what's really

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:08.420
 happening is that we are the resonance process in this conductive electronic or sub-electronic

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:18.700
 substance. And so knowing, if that's what our everyday knowing is doing on its basis,

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:26.340
 then those exceptional experiences of knowing things we shouldn't know would fit in with

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:36.700
 the idea that we have adopted a way of using our cortex to filter out those ultra-fine

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.700
 details of reality.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:44.780
 - Amazing stuff. Thanks for that, guys. Please ask Dr. Peet about the safety of dental implants.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:49.860
 Are there issues in terms of inflammation/autoimmune response or toxicity? Thank you.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:56.900
 - The stories I've read about the failures have made such an impression on me that all

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:03.380
 of the successes don't seem very important when you hear about someone's jaw falling

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:11.740
 off basically, the bone disappearing, the jawbone disintegrating to the point that they

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.380
 have to put a metal jawbone in.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:20.100
 - I kind of forget about this, but I got my tooth knocked out a long time ago in 2009.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:25.660
 I have a plastic retainer. What kind of devastating things is that doing to my health, do you

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.660
 think?

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.860
 - Just a plastic over your tooth, I don't think it hurts anything especially.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:34.900
 - It's one that covers basically, it's like the front left tooth, so it covers all the

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.060
 teeth on the top. It's kind of ruining a lot of the back teeth because it's constantly

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.060
 there.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:47.780
 - Yeah, I don't think it does any deep harm, but the idea of putting a foreign object,

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:54.700
 the teeth are separated from the bone by very special barriers, but to dig right into the

00:47:54.700 --> 00:48:02.060
 bone and put a foreign object inside the bone just doesn't make biological sense. Sometimes

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:08.900
 the body can handle it and you won't lose your jawbone, but when it does, there's hardly

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.940
 any repair that's satisfactory.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.900
 - So would you say dentures will be safer? Basically, they can do the exact same thing

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.820
 without the implantation risks?

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:26.660
 - Yeah, all kinds of restoration are preferable. Crowns can often be done on a basically destroyed

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.660
 tooth.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.820
 - Amazing. This one's from our friend Dodie. She says, "We know the purpose of the vaccine,

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.180
 if that's what you want to call it, but what is the purpose of the booster shot for COVID

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.540
 and how does it relate to the variant?"

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:46.660
 - The increasing insights into the appearance of the variant so-called, it increasingly

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:54.180
 looks clear that the variants are nothing but the side effects of the various nucleic

00:48:54.180 --> 00:49:05.180
 acid treatments. The first reaction of people like Luc Montagnier was that the variants

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:15.540
 were caused by the immunity to the first one and so the virus would mutate and become maybe

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:23.260
 more and more infectious, but usually that kind of resistance of the host generally leads

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:30.060
 to it becoming less deadly while being more infectious. But as the information has come

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:39.260
 in, it looks like there might not be any such thing as a gamma, delta, whatever variant,

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:47.700
 but simply that it's a name that's being given to the symptoms produced by the original vaccine.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:56.740
 And so if that's the case, then the booster shot is, if it's the real vaccine material,

00:49:56.740 --> 00:50:01.980
 it's just going to produce more so-called variants, more vaccine symptoms.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:06.860
 - Great stuff. Thanks, Dodie. Thanks, Ray. Okay. "Does Ray identify himself as a social

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:11.740
 anarchist in the sense of excluding rent-seeking, forming worker cooperatives, freeing the individual

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.820
 from authority, collectivism, direct democracy, mutual aid, et cetera?"

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:24.740
 - No. I think organization, if it's allowed to develop, the systems have been very quick

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:32.820
 to kill any incipient organization, but to the extent that they can spontaneously come

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:42.580
 into existence, you'll have consumers, cooperatives, and producers, cooperatives, and the organization

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:50.740
 will be what suits the people on the ground level. But if that's allowed to develop, it

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:59.820
 will develop, and they will find the best way for these ground-level cooperative organizations

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:09.940
 to cooperate on a larger and larger scale. So I think that's a natural course of development.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:16.940
 If they could, if some of these spontaneous cooperative groups could somehow take over

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:24.420
 the state, then you'd have the problem of maybe the consumers having more control than

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:30.620
 the producers. But if it grows up from the ground up, you're going to have to solve the

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:37.620
 problems of each level of organization as they come about. So I don't think there's

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:45.500
 any problem with evolving even a world-level state as long as it's based on these spontaneous

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:46.500
 surface-level...

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:53.180
 - Is there any truth to, I mean, the way it at least looks to me is that the social structure

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:57.940
 and the political structure are in a sense a metabolite of the health of the people that

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.460
 are building them. So if the people are relatively healthy, they can thrive under a variety of

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:08.580
 systems without them being exploitative and degenerating into the worst that a particular

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.220
 system has to offer. So instead of worrying about a specific political system, wouldn't

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:16.620
 be the most prudent thing would be to just sort of like optimize or maximize individual

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.180
 health and then see what kind of structure emerges from there?

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:31.500
 - Yeah, because different cultures, for example, military-oriented cultures, there's evidence

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:40.180
 that they are very tightly connected with child abuse and body mutilation and repression

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:48.940
 of sexuality in children. Those things are closely tied with sadistic group policies

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:59.380
 and sadistic war-making, head-chopping and so on. And you don't want one of those societies

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:09.100
 to take over a larger government. It has to be basically an indulgent social organization

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.860
 that doesn't oppress its own children.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:17.740
 - But in a group of healthy people, that sort of society wouldn't form to start with. My

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:22.420
 concern is that as soon as we say, "Oh, we should prevent that sort of culture taking

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:28.100
 over and then establishing itself," then the only way to fight such a vicious thing is

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:33.420
 through basically other kinds of violence, which ultimately tends to be kind of self-defeating

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:38.060
 because if you continue this conflict long enough, even the good peaceful culture will

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.820
 eventually militarize itself through this constant conflict that is being going on.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:46.500
 So it seems to me that the only way to ensure a sort of like semi-stable existence of a

00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:51.300
 large group of people is make sure that as many of them are as healthy as possible and

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:55.940
 then natural or non-exploitative order should arise.

00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:06.060
 - Yeah, the problem is that an urge to conquer tends to lead to conquest. And that involves

00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:17.220
 such things as being hostile, outline good food, for example. The conquest can take the

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:27.260
 form of establishing a medical system that doesn't allow preventive methods, says everything

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:35.900
 has to be focused on killing the pathogens, cutting out the defects and so on. So a society

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:45.020
 that asserts the importance of being healthy is itself in danger of offending the sadistic

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:50.180
 cultures and stimulating oppression from them.

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:54.300
 - So I guess there is some truth to the saying that eternal vigilance is the price of freedom

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.780
 even for healthy people?

00:54:55.780 --> 00:55:03.540
 - I think so. Until two or three generations, you might outgrow the sadistic tendencies

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.220
 that have been inculcated for so long.

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.740
 - 164 people watching right now. Thank you guys so much. Sincerely appreciate it. Give

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:14.300
 this episode a like. All donations here will be sent to Ray. I don't think I sent you the

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:18.180
 last donation. I've been very busy, but I will send them to you. I promise. Georgie

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.300
 Dinkov, thank you so much for being here. Obviously, Ray, thank you so much for doing

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:26.700
 this so regularly. Such a pleasure to have you on. Okay, this next question. What does

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:32.420
 Ray think? What does he think is the role of estrogenic predominance in sexual orientation

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:38.260
 and paraphylic disorders? So sexual fetishes, nymphomania, excessive masturbation, and porn

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.180
 addiction. What do you think about that, Ray?

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:48.980
 - One of the problems with high estrogen is that it doesn't allow sexual satisfaction.

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:58.060
 It's the prod to seek satisfaction. It requires a good balance of thyroid and progesterone

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:05.900
 and androgens to achieve satisfaction. And so it can lead to such things as nymphomania

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:16.820
 or insatiability. And at the same time, it has this toxic excitatory effect on the brain.

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:27.340
 So it can contribute to obsessiveness, hyperactivity, poor attention, everything you do to increase

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:33.700
 your biological energy and vitality is tending to keep estrogen subdued.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:38.460
 - Amazing. So a similar track. Is celibacy dangerous in a relationship that will be long

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.220
 term for the foreseeable future?

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:51.260
 - I think it's always a result of an imposition, like these sadistic cultures suppress women's

00:56:51.260 --> 00:57:03.060
 sexuality in particular. And they start very early by often mutilations, including circumcising

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:12.020
 both girls and boys to remove the satisfaction of sexual interest.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:17.900
 - Amazing. Thank you for that, Ray. Okay, last sex question here. Not to put him in

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:26.180
 the public ire, but does Ray think homosexuality is optimal normalcy?

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.260
 - If it's optimal or what?

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.700
 - I don't really know what they meant by that, but I guess your take on homosexuality.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:35.860
 - I think the gist of the question is the person thinks that homosexuality is driven

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:40.740
 by hormonal imbalances and it's not in an optimal healthy sexual state.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:48.980
 - Yeah, the evidence from history as well as animal experiments are that you can produce

00:57:48.980 --> 00:58:00.300
 it by stress during gestation. Everyone is abnormal in some way. It isn't something that

00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:08.580
 I think law should be involved in regulating in any way. But I think the evidence is clear

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:16.260
 that it's a particular product of both prenatal and early life stresses.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:21.100
 - Have you seen the more recent studies demonstrating that finasteride can pretty reliably induce

00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:22.580
 homosexuality in animals?

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.700
 - No, I haven't seen that.

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:28.460
 - Well, I mean, I guess you can never know if an animal is homosexual or not, but they

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:33.420
 started displaying the male animals started behaving like females and started courting

00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:38.460
 the other normal males and assumed like a mating position and basically started behaving

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:44.940
 like females. And when they stopped administering the finasteride, basically they became asexual.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:48.260
 They stopped behaving like females, but they didn't revert back to behaving like males

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:53.660
 either. And only when they were administered very high doses of testosterone did they sort

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:57.540
 of not completely sort of revert back to acting like normal males sexually.

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:00.300
 - How long ago was that done?

00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:03.820
 - That study is, well, it's not that old. I think it was from the late nineties.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:09.580
 - To tag along with what you said, if a culture is promoting stress in every way, shape or

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:14.140
 form and then stress promotes homosexuality, it's not like a moral judgment person. They're

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:18.580
 just expressing what the signals from the environment are telling them to do, right?

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.660
 Thanks for that, Ray. Sincerely appreciate it. Okay. Let me, okay. I get this question

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:26.900
 a lot. So this is why I'm asking. What are Ray's thoughts on Adolf Hitler and his expulsion

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:30.700
 of banking cartels and masons from Nazi Germany? And then the other part of this question was

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.620
 a little too hot for YouTube.

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:40.820
 - He had many right perceptions, but in a very crooked way. He convinced the voters

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:51.260
 that Germany had been close to revolution. And the fear was that the voters would gradually

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:59.380
 support a Bolshevik type of government. And so all of the money and bank powers of Germany

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:10.220
 and England and the US concentrated on supporting him as the barrier against Bolshevism. And

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:19.620
 he developed a language that would convince the voters who wanted social welfare, guaranteed

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:27.100
 employment, healthcare, and so on, good transportation and so on. He talked to them and said he would

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:34.820
 give them socialism, but he told the bankers there would be national socialism that wouldn't

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:47.660
 threaten to benefit anyone outside of German society. And so he had lots of progressive

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:54.940
 pro-worker things for German citizens, but at the same time, he was following the instructions

01:00:54.940 --> 01:01:05.940
 of the money system. And his anti-Semitism was partly just to convince the working people

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:18.260
 that he had an awareness of the manipulators of money and the banks. But he really was

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:26.060
 working with some of the top Zionists, and they wanted pressure on European Jews so that

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:32.580
 they would move to Israel and set up a new country. So there was collaboration between

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:42.620
 the Zionists and Hitler for a while, but it finally turned into the murderous anti-Semitism.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:52.540
 But the things such as the anti-masonry, that was part of the German culture at the time.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:02:02.100
 He used those things to keep his mass support along with giving them cheap little cars and

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:10.540
 high-speed highways, things that simply made the Germans able to be distracted from what

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.940
 he was doing elsewhere.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.460
 Amazing. Thanks for that. Okay. How might Ray respond to the question of why worker

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:21.200
 ants are sent out into dangerous conditions while queen ants are protected other than

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.860
 worker ants are not reproductive, cannot pass on genes anymore? Well, queens can. Same with

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:31.880
 bees. I wasn't joking when I said ants were observable national socialists. Their organism

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:38.540
 also strategy is clearly designed around a collective effort to provide for reproduction

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:42.340
 of the tribe's genetic material. And they have a rigid deterministic caste system where

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:47.020
 sterile ants are sterile their whole lives and will readily give up their lives to protect

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:48.620
 the productive queens.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:57.140
 But at the same time, individual ants can be intelligently altruistic one ant to another.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:04.980
 So it's a hierarchical structure, but they're also altruistic to each other at the same

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.580
 case when they actually should be competitive if there's truly a national socialistic system,

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:10.580
 right?

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.220
 Yeah. And there are lots of good people doing good things in the United States, for example,

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:21.580
 even though the system is definitely not designed to have good people doing good things.

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:26.900
 Let me ask the question, which Danny didn't, but it's right there. Somebody asked, is Ray

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.020
 Pete a communist? And I know it's a very loaded word.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:32.260
 I thought you answered it already. That's why I didn't answer it.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.300
 But no, there was another one where he's a social anarchist, but somebody asked directly,

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.580
 is Ray Pete a communist? There you go.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:47.780
 I'm not sure what the difference is. If you define either of them very thoughtfully, there's

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:57.580
 not really any difference. You want to get rid of tyranny and you want to have cooperation.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:06.860
 And the idea of communism essentially goes back to Christianity as the main source of

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:18.340
 those ideas, and it has developed a lot of historical confusion around it. But the Christian

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:24.620
 beliefs are at base, you could say that they're predominantly communistic.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:28.940
 Didn't William James say that Christ was a communist or something along those lines?

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:39.540
 A lot of people have, because of his attitude towards money changers and the common person,

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:49.340
 even the outcasts of the system, he was definitely a bottom-up person. And you can call that

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.100
 anarchism or communism either way.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:55.100
 Do you think it's possible to have Christianity without the involvement of the church? And

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.700
 by the church, I specifically mean corrupt structures like the Vatican with their history

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:04.940
 of child abuse and financial machinations and supporting the Nazis and everything else.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:12.220
 Yeah, I think one of the most interesting books on Christianity was Wilhelm Reich's

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:19.900
 book, The Murder of Christ. And he gets much of his guidance from the New Testament.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:24.780
 Amazing. Okay, let me search real fast for... I skipped this question. Okay. In regards

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.700
 to an extremely morbidly obese person in their 40s and 50s, what are the first steps they

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:34.940
 should do to tackle their weight? Would some fasting regimen like Alternative Day or OMAD

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.580
 be feasible in this situation simply because of the danger posed by their weight? If they're

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:43.300
 300 plus pounds and they simply might not live long enough to take the slower PUFA depleting

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.540
 bioenergetic route?

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.140
 And what were the alternatives?

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:51.780
 Well, they were saying, should I fast or should I do one meal a day? Or I guess another possibility

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.580
 with liposuction, like if somebody is extremely obese, what do you think? And they don't have

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.460
 a lot of time. What do you think they should do?

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:04.420
 All of the alternatives are extremely harmful. And I've wondered whether there might not

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.100
 be a type of surgery to remove...

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.100
 Glow?

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.940
 Oh yeah, do we just lose Ray? Yeah, we do. Okay, I thought it froze. Okay, let's... Oh,

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:12.940
 Ray, are you there?

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:13.940
 Yeah.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.180
 I think we just... You just dropped out for a second. I think we can just start that question

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.740
 over if you remember.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:28.260
 Okay. The amount of damage is something that can be investigated. The way liposuction is

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:35.460
 usually done, just sort of stirring a suction tube around in the fat causes lots of nerve

01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:42.220
 damage as well as liberation of free fats into the system. And there might be surgical

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:52.900
 ways of removing a large mass such as abdominal fat while doing less systemic damage. With

01:06:52.900 --> 01:07:01.540
 good local anesthesia, for example, I think it might be possible to unload 40 or 50 pounds

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:10.540
 of fat without doing terrible damage. But a fast, especially if you're fat, that fat

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:18.220
 is going to travel through your brain and liver and other organs on its way out of the

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:27.460
 body. And so you're exposing yourself to a great prolonged toxicity. Even though I've

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:35.140
 seen someone fast steadily for two months to get over extreme obesity, I'm not sure

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:39.660
 your lifetime effect on your health is going to be worth it.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:44.980
 What about chemical interventions? I mean, there is a tremendous track record of things

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:52.060
 like dinitrophenol being able to cure effectively even extremely morbidly obese people, of course,

01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:56.700
 under medical observation because it can easily kill you if you overheat. Wouldn't something

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.500
 like that be considerable?

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:04.340
 Overdosing on thyroid does the same thing. At the right level, it can increase your safe

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:14.300
 oxidation of fats while helping to suppress the toxic or random oxidation. Both DNP and

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:21.940
 thyroid can carefully controlled can reduce the toxicity of getting rid of the fat. But

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:30.480
 I think diet high in calcium and vitamin D should be part of the program because they

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:39.140
 will support safe oxidation and provide the nutrients that, for example, a high milk diet

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:45.300
 will keep your metabolic rate higher and suppress the toxic effects.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:49.300
 Amazing. Thank you for that. Okay, about 10, 15 more minutes here and then we'll let you

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:53.660
 go. Ray, thank you so much. Thank you, Georgie Dinkov. Appreciate it. Okay, let me find this

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:59.900
 question. Aside from painting, does Mr. Peet recommend any other practice for positive

01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:03.260
 brain effects such as knitting, sculpting, etc.?

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:12.260
 Whistling, singing, playing a French horn, playing a recorder whistle, playing the cello

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:19.580
 or violin, all kinds of things that are very structured and stimulating.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:23.340
 Wouldn't things like gardening and tending to animals also work?

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.340
 Oh, yeah.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:29.660
 Amazing. Okay, James says, as a social animal, humans seem to have a need to belong and experience

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.980
 connection with other people. How can we meet this need in the current authoritarian anti-life

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.580
 culture and avoid a life of atomized loneliness?

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:46.860
 I don't know, but I keep looking around for what people can do. Just the simplest personal

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:53.980
 contact if you can get three or four or more people together with a similar interest, such

01:09:53.980 --> 01:10:04.060
 as little music groups, something that is harmless looking to the society, but getting

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:13.460
 people together, they're going to talk about their fate under the present system. So anything

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:20.300
 you can think of to put people into personal contact, I think is going to eventually lead

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.860
 to political progress and organization.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:29.460
 This person says, on the most recent Radio Network interview, Ray talked a little about

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.700
 pheromones. He said a woman's emitted pheromones can change the way she is on birth control

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:41.100
 and again when she stops. Does Ray know what a woman emits and what she responds to changes

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:45.820
 in the lead up to menopause? And can a man's pheromones change as well, making him less

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:47.020
 attractive to his partner?

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.220
 Sorry, this is a really long one.

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:54.540
 Can a woman's lack of interest in her long-term partner be due to pheromones? And last thing,

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:58.740
 can anything be done to restore the pheromones to attractiveness again?

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:07.060
 Good diet and hormone activity is the best thing to optimize the pheromones, but it's

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:16.500
 true that both men and women have less of the attractive pheromones and probably gradually

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:29.300
 increase some repellent pheromones. I think little kids emit anti-sexual pheromones that

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:37.220
 I think they induce parental attitudes towards them. And then around puberty, the chemistry

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:45.900
 changes towards sexual attraction. And to a great extent, I think the same attractants

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:53.500
 are emitted by both men and women, but with some subtle variations that I don't think

01:11:53.500 --> 01:12:02.740
 anyone has a very clear idea of what a woman's attraction chemistry is. But I'm sure it can

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.500
 contain some of the steroids that men emit.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.500
 Super simple question, but what is a pheromone? Like what, it's released by hair follicle?

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:20.140
 It can be any chemical that is volatile enough that you can detect it at some distance from

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:29.060
 the emitter. Fatty acids of different sorts work for insects and other animals, but the

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:35.740
 most clearly defined human pheromones are derivatives of androgenic steroids.

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.580
 Amazing. Let's do one last break here real fast for talk about Progest-E and then I'll

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:44.380
 ask you one or two more questions. Let you go, Ray. Okay. So Progest-E from Keenogen

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:48.780
 emailed Catherine to purchase a bottle. She ships very quickly. She packs it in this like

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:53.720
 Mylar or something that protects it during shipping. It's keenogen@gmail.com. Each bottle

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:59.420
 Progest-E contains 3,400 milligrams. I have a photo here. This is DHEA in this little

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:03.240
 thing here. And then I have a little tiny $15 scale and then I mix it in this glass thing

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:06.220
 I got from Japan, which I'll never go back to again.

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:10.100
 A glass of Japan. Japan, unfortunately, because I will never

01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:13.660
 travel again, unfortunately. And then you can, the newsletter is available by email

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:18.180
 now is $28, which can be paid through PayPal. And I mean, best deal on the internet for

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:23.420
 Ray's bi-monthly newsletter. And you can also purchase his books. And those are basically

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:27.660
 collector's items and I'd recommend everybody obtain them. Okay. So, so again, I think we've

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:32.260
 talked about this many, many times, but I, I guess we can't talk about it enough. So

01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:36.500
 this person says, if forced to be inoculated, are there any supplements or diet that will

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.360
 counteract the harmful side effects of the mRNA vaccine?

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:47.580
 The first thing is to consider your defenses and resistances, how you can avoid getting

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:57.100
 it put into you. And if you can find alternatives, such as a certificate of pre-existing immunity

01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:06.020
 or maybe a form of a vaccine that doesn't contain the nucleic acids, because the present

01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:13.460
 ignorance, the reason the experiment is being done is because it has never been studied

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:19.580
 in humans before. And so you don't know what the outcome is. And as long as it's experimental

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:28.180
 on its surface, meaning we don't know what the long range outcome is going to be. And

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:37.220
 the animal evidence is that there could be terrible long range effects such as increased

01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:44.500
 susceptibility to all kinds of infectious diseases or to cancer or to brain degeneration

01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:55.020
 or sterility. So if you allow yourself to be vaccinated, you're taking a big experimental

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:59.500
 gamble that the outcome of which you won't know as long as you're alive.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.500
 Are you disturbed?

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:09.980
 The fact that the so-called variants are tremendously increased in the people who had the vaccine

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:19.460
 suggests that the disease effects of the virus and vaccine are essentially identical and

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:28.820
 that is primarily through the toxic effects of the spike protein. And that is a fundamental

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:38.980
 and total promotion of inflammation in every system, hypertension, development of autoimmune

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:46.820
 diseases. Everything you can think of is promoted, which is promoted by angiotensin

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:57.980
 is going to be a possible outcome of a vaccine. So the angiotensin receptor blockers and antihistamines

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:05.740
 and aspirin were known way back 10 or 15 years ago to protect against the toxic effects of

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:15.140
 the spike protein. The toxicity of that protein has been studied now for a long time. And

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:22.780
 so the Chinese were among the first to realize that angiotensin receptor blockers, antihistamines

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:29.340
 and aspirin simply by being anti-inflammatory were the first things to resort to.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:33.420
 So does the mRNA that's in the vaccine, does it use the same mechanism through the

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:36.500
 ACE2 enzyme to get inside of the cell?

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:44.820
 Well, once you get the RNA in, it doesn't matter whether it's free RNA that comes into

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:52.580
 you after being shed by someone who is vaccinated, it most likely is either in an exosome form

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:59.540
 or as free RNA coming out of their breath and skin and saliva and getting into your

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.540
 system.

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:05.540
 So what I'm getting at is there is no way to prevent the mRNA present in the vaccine

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:09.460
 from getting inside of the cell, similar to how we can prevent the virus from getting

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:14.060
 inside of the cell, the wild virus, by giving something like Losartan or anything that blocks

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:17.100
 that specific entry pathway.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:23.900
 Nothing I know of. They're using a lipid for getting the RNA quickly into the cells,

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:30.740
 but other studies show that you don't really need the lipid. It will be taken up even in

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:38.620
 the naked RNA form and that's just a tendency of cells is to take up circulating molecules

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:47.460
 and sometimes they can be either assimilated or destroyed, but this particular fat happens

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:54.580
 to take the highest concentration in the ovaries that distributes it in every kind of cell

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.580
 in the body.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.080
 I'm moving a house in November and I found a place that I really liked and we were doing

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:05.820
 all the paperwork and the owner was like, "Can you send me your vaccine papers?" And

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:09.140
 I was like, "Yeah, there's no way that's going to happen." And they're like, "Oh yeah, you

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.940
 can't move in there." I was like, "Oh, great."

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:12.940
 In Mexico?

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:20.700
 Yeah, a gringo owned the house. But it's just a sign of the future, I guess, or things

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:23.660
 that come. There's a very interesting, entertaining situation.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.060
 Okay, Ray, were you going to say something, Ray?

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:27.060
 No.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.260
 Okay. Ray Peete, thank you so much. Stay on the line for just one minute, Ray. Georgie

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:33.500
 Dinkov, thank you so much. Is there any parting words, Ray? And Georgie Dinkov, any parting

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.500
 words?

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.980
 Well, I guess to me, the Appalachians start looking more and more attractive. If it's

01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:44.740
 extremely rural and poor and has no internet and no cell phone service, I think it should

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:45.740
 be considered.

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:49.220
 Guys, we have an amazing audience. Cecilia, appreciate it. I get so many positive messages

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.020
