WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
 Okay, General Energy, number 85, and we have Ray Peat and Georgi Dinkov on the line.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.840
 Ray, how are you?

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.840
 Very good.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.880
 Thank you so much for doing this.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.160
 Really appreciate it, even with the time mishap, but thank you so much for bearing with us,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.720
 and I hope you had time to drink your coffee.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.720
 And yeah, thank you so much.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.720
 Appreciate it.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.880
 Anyways, okay, so I've listened to the bits about protein that you've been talking about,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.920
 and I thought maybe anchoring the show in that would be kind of the most interesting

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.920
 thing.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.320
 I'm not necessarily looking for you to tell everybody how much protein to eat per se,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.160
 but more like, I mean, as long as I've been following your work, you've been talking,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.440
 maybe referencing that 1999 military study, 80 to 100 grams of protein per person, and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.240
 then occasionally if somebody would ask you, you'd say, "Maybe even more would be better."

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.440
 And so I'm more interested in how you shifted your thinking on this, and so maybe laying

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.400
 that out for us would be interesting, and then I have more questions about it.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.520
 Yeah, it really started in the 1970s.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:15.440
 I was volunteering for a free clinic in Eugene, and at that time they were burning grass fields,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:26.560
 producers of grass seeds for lawns, and everyone had respiratory disease because of the summer

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 constant smoke.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:43.600
 And I had found that stopping certain supplements had greatly reduced my allergies, and so I

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:52.080
 just suggested that since everyone was taking every conceivable supplement with no benefit

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:01.800
 at all, I mentioned that to these allergy people at the clinic, and all of them got

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.240
 over their symptoms despite the field burning continuing.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:18.080
 And then they said, "If that silly idea worked, what other ideas do you have?"

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:36.240
 I said, "Well, stop eating toxic junk like tofu and bean salad with lettuce and cucumbers

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:49.800
 and various seeds and indigestible material, all the stylish, hippie stuff.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:02.000
 Stop eating that and just try milk and cheese and eggs and meat and a more digestible diet."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.400
 And so everyone did, and they said, "Oh, the wonders of a high-protein diet."

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400
 It wasn't high-protein.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:21.840
 It was just low junk food basically, uncooked, indigestible materials.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:45.680
 So it wasn't intended as a specially high or low-protein diet, but for years, people

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.960
 ate a healthy diet and it was considered high-protein.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:04:01.680
 But if you're an active person in your 20s, you're very likely to be burning 4,000 or

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.520
 5,000 calories per day of whatever nutrients.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:21.520
 And so 100 grams of protein in a 5,000-calorie diet with lots of carbohydrates isn't a bad

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.960
 ratio at all.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.320
 So to you, maybe there hasn't really been a change or a shift, and maybe that's like

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.280
 a perception of people that are listening.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.400
 Because you don't have to broadcast every single thing that you do every day, so maybe

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.280
 this isn't really new to you.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:53.600
 When you, for many years now, have been talking about amino, restriction of essential amino

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:04.400
 acids, a sign in restriction in animals increased their lifespan by 40%, and you've got an additional

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:13.840
 percent for restricting cysteine and tryptophan and other essential amino acids.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:25.840
 So it's extremely life-extending to limit certain essential amino acids.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:34.800
 And when you look at something that Broda Barnes noticed about 50 years ago, I guess,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:43.520
 he tried a high-protein diet, and for years he had been taking two grains of armor thyroid

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.120
 every day.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.880
 And on increasing the meat in his diet, he had to take four grains of armor every day

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.040
 to maintain his functions.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:12.400
 And so those two things have been out there as items of interest, the messianic restriction

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:26.160
 and longevity and the anti-thyroid effect of generally higher protein, and the life-extending

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:44.000
 benefits of the immunosuppressive target of rapamycin inhibitors, the rapamycin type of

00:06:44.000 --> 00:07:00.800
 antibiotic suppresses our growth called mammalian rapamycin, and so that explains a big part

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:16.160
 of the mechanism behind messianine restriction, longevity, and protein inhibition of energy

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.600
 production in a safe way.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.880
 So you're saying blocking the mTOR pathway is life-extending?

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880
 Which pathway?

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.080
 Well, the abbreviation that they typically use in studies is mTOR, mammalian target of

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080
 -- yeah.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.000
 Yeah, inhibiting that is good.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.800
 Well, you know, some of the main arguments of the caloric restriction crowd is that that's

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.320
 precisely why they advocate people eating less, up to like 40 to 50 percent less of

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:54.760
 the calories, because that's what basically blocks the mTOR pathway and activates the

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.400
 PGC-1-alpha, I guess, is the opposite one?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:06.000
 Well, it isn't actually calories, it's the anti-metabolic effect of those specific amino

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 acids.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.480
 I see.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.600
 So maybe five or so years ago you had written to somebody saying you didn't really feel

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.400
 right with that like 120 grams of protein.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.440
 So was that something personal that you had experienced, maybe experimenting with a lower

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.200
 amount, given the situation you find yourself in, and said to yourself that the methionine

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:32.440
 was maybe more thyroid suppressive than you had originally thought?

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:44.360
 Around the age of 30, everyone's mitochondria are being suppressed, so your metabolism is

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:55.680
 much slower after middle age, and that means that it's much more susceptible to being suppressed

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.760
 by those unnecessary amino acids.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:09.160
 So but you're saying if you're young you could need normal 100 grams of protein or so, but

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.680
 in later age you don't need as much, you maybe need 50 or somewhere around there, is that

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.680
 right?

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.680
 Right, right.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:31.520
 And the carbohydrates go up as you, the ability to metabolize carbohydrates go up as you reduce

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:37.800
 your protein suppression, suppression of metabolism.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:43.720
 And then what about sick people or just generally people that don't feel well, should they reduce

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.800
 their protein intake or be conscious of it?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:59.920
 Well for example having fruit juice when you're sick, a very high carbohydrate diet is very

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.920
 protective.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:10.160
 A lot of that is because the proteins, even though they're anti-inflammatory for your

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:22.840
 digestive system, if they're beyond that very low level, whatever, 50 grams a day maybe,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.040
 they're going to slow your metabolism.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.660
 Let me rephrase this, would this be a useful tool in the toolbox for a person to regain

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.760
 their health back is to try different amounts of protein including the lower amounts?

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.740
 Oh yeah, but especially different amounts of carbohydrate and different types.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.720
 And you just reminded me to talk about the grape juice because I think that's really

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720
 valuable.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.960
 This just reminds me of the experiment the Russians did showing that you can survive

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.240
 and in fact thrive on a diet of nothing but potatoes and butter.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.680
 Considering that potatoes have all these keto acids and basically the rest of it is carbs,

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.760
 would you say that would be a decent kind of diet for an older person or a hyper-metabolic

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.760
 person?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:23.480
 Oh yeah, everyone since Adele Davis maybe before have commented on how well so many

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:31.040
 old people do living on tea and toast for example or jello and toast.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.880
 That's the real repeat diet.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.840
 So what can one do to limit the dangers of starch even in well-cooked potatoes because

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.440
 we don't want that starch, right?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:50.560
 Just for energy if it's well-cooked or with butter to prevent preservation.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.800
 So the butter is the main, like other saturated fats are basically the main protective factor

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.920
 when eating starch?

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:10.360
 Yeah, combined thorough cooking with a little butter to assure its breakdown.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.480
 Ray for yourself, how did you arrive at the 50 grams?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.200
 Like what was that calculation?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.040
 How did that happen?

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:30.000
 Oh, just that it's hard to eat less.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.240
 Even with the juices, as you reach a gallon of orange juice, your protein is going up

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.360
 considerably.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.400
 And that's fairly difficult to do.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:51.880
 You probably have to modulate your milk intake and meat and things like that.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:13:03.840
 Even though calcium in milk helps to keep your thyroid function going, you have to at

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:19.480
 first somewhat limit your milk and cheese and egg intake and even well-cooked vegetables.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:28.200
 You can choose some that have a little over-messianic content.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.800
 And then was the grape juice useful for this new experiment?

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.760
 I don't know how new it is, but the things you're doing now, because to maybe offset

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.520
 with the huge amount of carbohydrate you would need to increase it?

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.240
 Yeah, it does have a huge amount of carbohydrate.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:54.800
 You have to be careful because it can osmotically upset your digestion.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800
 The grape juice?

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:03.680
 Yeah, I can only tolerate two or three ounces at a time.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.040
 And so I guess, how many carbohydrates are you eating?

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.920
 I'm not saying this so everybody should do it, I'm just curious of what you're doing.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.000
 Maybe you're eating well over 500 grams or so?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.400
 Just about in that range, 500 or 600 I think.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.640
 Mainly from orange juice?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:37.120
 Oh no, a lot of very well-cooked vegetables, just for taste variety.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:44.680
 I just can't gag down that much grape juice and orange juice.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.560
 And then I promise we'll move on, but how has this changed your liver consumption and

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560
 your egg consumption?

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.400
 Like, do you eat less liver each week?

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.280
 I'm very, very much less.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.400
 Like one or two ounces?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:11.760
 Currently it's hard to get good organic liver such as chicken liver, and so whenever that's

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:22.560
 available we'll have some chicken livers with bacon, but that might be only once in two

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.560
 months.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560
 Oh well.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:30.840
 But maybe if the butcher in Oregon had liver, would your preference be to, or be ruminant

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.520
 liver, would your preference be for that?

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:39.960
 It's just not available given all the crazy things that are happening?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.800
 No, chicken livers with bacon are very unpleasant.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.800
 Fair enough.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.800
 That's a good answer.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.640
 I think that settles it.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.800
 But why would the change in dietary, in the macro ratios change the intake of liver for

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.520
 you as well?

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.000
 You feel like you need less?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.840
 You don't feel like I need less.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.640
 But liver is a huge source of methionine, right?

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.240
 Yeah.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.680
 And really early on, probably ten years ago, I think I ate eight ounces of liver and I

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.700
 felt real cold afterwards, and then the next day felt especially hypothyroid.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.680
 So it might be just good for posterity.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:29.800
 The methionine, what is the specific mechanism that it's suppressing the thyroid function?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.440
 Or is it doing lots of different things?

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.200
 Lots of things.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:41.600
 I don't know what the most important mechanism is.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.600
 Fair enough.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.800
 And we can move on and Georgie, interrupt me at any time here.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.400
 Something I've noticed, you had mentioned it a long time ago, that people with a physically

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.520
 larger brain might notice symptoms really quickly.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.640
 They have really high energy requirements, and if those requirements weren't met, they

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.360
 would notice it and kind of nuance symptoms about their health.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.800
 You know, that idea, I keep thinking about it because the people I talk to are all really

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800
 interesting.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.040
 They're all interesting people with interesting ideas, with different backgrounds, and I would

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.600
 bet that they're very, I mean, I know they're intelligent.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.960
 And so, but some of the smartest people will notice the tiniest little defects in their

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.960
 body.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:28.160
 And so I was wondering if you could just speak about brain metabolism and then noticing symptoms.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:46.400
 Yeah, the brain requires, in an absolute sense, a steady supply of glycogen and glucose.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:59.520
 So just excited thinking can consume really large amounts of sugar.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:07.840
 And checking your blood pressure, it's called the pulse pressure or the difference between

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:15.920
 systolic and diastolic pressures.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:28.160
 If everything is running smoothly with enough blood sugar, you'll have a systolic that's

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:40.080
 at least 50 points, about 50 points higher than the diastolic, very often lower.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:49.480
 But if you're having a problem with your glucose, you're going to have increased difference

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:58.760
 with maybe 75 points higher systolic than diastolic.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:12.880
 And if you get in that condition from excitation or whatever cause, anything that depletes

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:24.560
 your systemic glycogen, then by checking your pulse pressure frequently and increasing your

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:36.840
 glucose and starch intake considerably, every few hours checking it and having more glucose,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:44.960
 you can tell when you have replenished the glycogen source because suddenly your difference

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:52.560
 between systolic and diastolic will come down to 40 or 45 points difference.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.640
 Wow, that's useful to know.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.640
 And then in the same kind of line of questioning, would you expect somebody that had a real

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.920
 low rate of metabolism and maybe had, I mean, we all have imperfect development, but somebody

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.040
 with like a physically smaller brain or something that had three vaccines and just taking finasteride

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.240
 and stuff and says they don't notice the difference, but like maybe somebody that's running at

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.480
 a really low level would not notice these like toxic insults that are happening every

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.040
 moment of the day to them.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.920
 Could that equally be true?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.920
 I think it is.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.160
 People that take SRI drugs are basically very prone to not only self-harm, but also like

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.000
 getting wounds that they sometimes they sit there and fester because they ignored them,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.840
 they never felt the pain and they couldn't disinfect them.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.240
 So people with high serotonin, I think they tend to experience higher emotional pain,

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.000
 but they're numbed at the extremities.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.760
 And I've noticed several people around me that are taking these drugs.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.400
 They often have these wounds and scrapes on them that look pretty ghastly and they only

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.960
 notice them when I point them out.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.760
 They claim they didn't hurt when they actually happened.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:18.560
 Yeah, that sort of thing eventually is corrected by keeping your thyroid chronically a lot

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.120
 higher.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.560
 And then keeping in line with the things I'm learning from the people I talk to, I'm probably

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.320
 talking to like four people right now that can take 200 milligrams of Progest-E and it

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:37.640
 has no effect whatsoever, but they all seem to uniformly benefit from antibiotics, like

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.160
 specifically the tetracyclines or the macrolides.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.160
 But they don't necessarily have digestive problems per se.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:50.200
 And so clearly they're, or maybe they're benefiting from the antibiotics anti-inflammatory effect.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.600
 And then again, I know this is kind of redundant because you've talked about this a lot, but

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:00.960
 what do you think is a good approach or strategies for somebody that might have a nitric oxide

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.360
 problem if that's what's going on and their liver is not maybe responding to the huge

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.140
 amount of progesterone?

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:13.560
 Would a small amount of T3 be useful, like one or two micrograms per hour?

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.840
 I think so.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:21.280
 And it all works.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:32.600
 Everything that you have to regulate with, nervous system, hormones, digestive enzyme

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:43.520
 balance and so on, all of those are involved so that your cholinergic nervous system activity

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:51.520
 and your adrenergic system are activated in different ways.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:23:11.320
 The helplessness cholinergic reflexes interfere with everything good so that you make more

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:19.240
 nitric oxide for example and slow things down and cause inflammatory damage.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.120
 Is there something I'm not thinking of that would be useful for that situation?

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.280
 Like oh, I have an experience with this person writing me that they overcame that situation

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.040
 with XYZ or is it like a...

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.880
 Go ahead.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:41.840
 Looking at the whole picture and seeing which you're in most desperate need of.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.520
 What about the tool in the toolbox of reducing protein?

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.920
 Would that be especially useful for somebody maybe with like a...

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.440
 Do you think what I'm describing is liver disease?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.800
 Like a person not responding to the progesterone?

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:06.360
 Yeah, and that can be a quickly repaired thing by getting the glycogen up.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:14.520
 The liver turns off just like the brain if it hasn't stored enough glycogen and that

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:19.200
 is a matter of two or three days often.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:25.000
 So for liver disease, glycogen should be the top priority and glycogenesis can't happen

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 without T3 and progesterone and enough carbohydrate?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Yeah.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Since you mentioned the cholinergic system, do you think that's the main risk of people

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.560
 using nicotine besides its many beneficial effects?

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.720
 The problem is that it is the direct activator of the acetylcholine receptors.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.480
 The problem with using which?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:58.800
 Well, several people have asked you about using nicotine from tobacco as a chewing gum

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.280
 or actually as a tincture or just as an isolated substance and you've said several times that

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.280
 it may be beneficial.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.320
 It's got a number of beneficial effects but you're wary of it and you don't recommend

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.440
 long-term use and do you think that the fact that nicotine is actually a direct ligand

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.640
 for that system, an activator of the cholinergic system, do you think that's the main risk

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.640
 associated with it?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.720
 I think that's likely.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:37.680
 It's part of your cholinergic system and you can't be sure how the nicotine is going to

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:43.240
 fit into the anti-inflammatory system.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:51.920
 It has that potential but it can do the opposite too and turn on cancer metabolism.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.680
 Why do you think that tobacco consumption is so widespread among indigenous cultures,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:09.720
 especially the ones that are in the Americas?

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:21.440
 Because it's stimulating value, psychologically it can tone things up and make you function.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.400
 So it's mostly as a stimulant, as a widely available stimulant?

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.880
 Yeah, I think so.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.600
 Just going back to the glycogen for a second, two things I know you've mentioned that can

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.520
 deplete the liver of its glycogen, the estrogen and maybe the serotonin and maybe they're

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.800
 working on the same mechanism.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.080
 Does the methionine, how does that relate to the estrogen and the serotonin, does that

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.680
 tend to increase them?

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.000
 Yeah.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:07.680
 It has a demobilizing function and the methyl groups are in a constant battle.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:16.360
 There's been too much emphasis on people who don't have enough methyl groups and not enough

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:23.480
 on the danger of an excess methyl pressure.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:30.440
 So in addition to the methionine and the insulinogenic effects of the protein, that could be a slippery

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.960
 slope for a person with an under-functioning liver.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.960
 Mm-hmm.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.960
 Okay, just a few more and then we can talk about cultural things.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.520
 And Ray, I'm not going to keep you too long.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.360
 And so the other thing that's completely unrelated.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.880
 But Ray, lidocaine as a topical for hair loss, what do you think about that?

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:59.960
 It's generally self-protective and I don't know anyone who has tried it, but since it

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:18.760
 works for all kinds of very serious conditions, even helping with cancer and brain injury,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.960
 it's almost always a good thing to try.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.240
 There is a -- oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:40.040
 It prevents energy waste and so working at the simple level of available energy, it makes

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.360
 everything better.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:49.120
 And then I have at least one paper in regards to so-called pattern baldness.

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:54.760
 They say investigation should be done on mast cell inhibitors for pattern baldness.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.920
 And so obviously, the lidocaine would help with that, right?

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.480
 And the whole world wants me to ask you about the massage thing.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.560
 And so everybody is asking, what is he specifically talking about?

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.560
 What type of massage?

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.560
 So in my point of view, the massage ideas that were going around were like, don't stop

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:20.920
 until your head is inflamed and red and has obvious inflammation in it.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.040
 So what type of massage were you thinking about that you thought could increase hair

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.040
 growth?

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:42.360
 Oh, just a very gentle massage such as gently rubbing oil into it.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:47.000
 You don't want to cause inflammation.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.360
 And the mechanism there might be -- obviously, it feels good, but maybe increasing the blood

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.840
 flow to the area that is a problem with the hair loss?

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:04.560
 Yeah, feeling good is a good way to increase blood flow.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:15.500
 If you increase blood flow by irritation, that's because you're doing damage that causes

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:24.120
 lactic acid production and blocking good energy production.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:39.800
 So a very soft, stimulating, pleasure-giving massage is the opposite of a rough, irritating

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.800
 massage.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.800
 Thanks for that.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.020
 And last question from me, and then we can move on.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:51.200
 The most -- maybe you can concur, but the most common thing with thyroid dosing with

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.500
 Sinoplus and Sinomel is overdosing.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.920
 Maybe once a week, somebody tells me I started with a tablet of Sinoplus and a tablet of

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.160
 Sinomel just as a starting dose.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.240
 And so I have a few questions for you about this.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.400
 So one, we've talked many, many times about maybe 10 micrograms of T3 being kind of a

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:18.840
 limit for dosing thyroid, or maybe even an arbitrary limit, and using that with a meal.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:24.480
 When you take 15 or 20, what -- maybe you had said previously that the liver creates

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.040
 enzymes to destroy it really quickly.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.440
 Maybe you can just expand on that a bit.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:40.880
 Yeah, so after a couple of weeks of doing that, you are -- after maybe 10 or 12 hours

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:48.920
 after that overdose, you have plunged to a hypothyroid state.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:56.480
 And if you're dosing it only once or twice a day, those ups and downs become really extreme

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:03.960
 and can do things like stopping your heart rate when your thyroid dips sharply.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.080
 And then just because we've been talking about it so much, for a person with liver disease,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.720
 in your experience and from what you've read, do they tend to do better on smaller doses

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.280
 of T3 or bigger doses?

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280
 Like what --

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.840
 Oh, smaller.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:28.120
 I think no one should supplement thyroid until they've read at least one of Broderbarn's

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.080
 books.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.520
 Maybe the "It's Not Your Mind, It's Your Liver," the "Hope for Hypoglycemia?"

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520
 Yeah.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.000
 I think they just started reprinting that as a side note.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.240
 And shoot, I had another question about the T3.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:47.240
 Oh, do you think it's a good idea to -- like I've seen the overdosing stuff so often that

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:51.540
 I started recommending people buy $20 milligram scales.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.720
 And as annoying as that is, I'm just worried about people taking too much.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.360
 And so if they measure a tablet of Sinomel, which is usually about 100 milligrams, and

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.240
 then they do that cross-reference math, and then they find the microgram dosage, do you

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.800
 think that's a good way to do it?

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:18.400
 Or is that too -- is that crazy?

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:27.480
 I'm not sure whether they're actually going to be getting the right amount of T3.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:43.440
 If it's well distributed in the tablet, I think powdering a Sinomel tablet and figuring

00:33:43.440 --> 00:34:03.120
 that you're taking two or three micrograms at a time, you're in least danger of having

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120
 a suppression.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120
 So that's good to know.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.120
 So I did not know that.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.120
 So you think there could be a huge amount of T3 on one side of the pill and not enough

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.120
 on the other side?

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.120
 It's just conceivable.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.120
 Very interesting.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.400
 I appreciate you pointing that out.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.800
 And then once it's powdered, if a person wants to go for accuracy, they could measure it?

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:29.160
 Yeah, but I would tend to go by the label.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:41.120
 If it's Sinomel or Sinomel, I think you can count on the amount per tablet being accurate.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:54.880
 But none of the generics that I've tried has been reliably to the potency that they claim.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:01.880
 But once you powder a Sinomel tablet, if somebody was in a precarious situation and they're

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.760
 like, "Okay, I'm going to try two micrograms," how do you even go about doing that?

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.520
 You'd have to have a scale, right?

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:20.640
 Just by visual judgment, you powder a 25-microgram tablet and divide it into 10 apparently equal

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.640
 pieces.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.640
 Okay, fair enough.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:29.960
 I know you're maybe resistant to recommending a super complex type of thing, but if a person

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:37.080
 wanted to go for very accurate doses, do you think that's a bad idea to do the scale?

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.600
 Would that not be as accurate as the person thinks it is?

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:50.120
 It's misleading because your body isn't that accurate.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:58.160
 The body responds very differently every time.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:05.000
 There's no scale equivalent in the body.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.880
 It's always a new experience for the body.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.760
 But what you're saying is it's basically impossible to get an accurate dose of thyroid and you

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.000
 just have to go off feeling, which I can accept.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.160
 By the feeling, right?

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.560
 Your pulse rate and feeling.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.240
 Okay, fair enough.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:28.320
 Okay, I guess we'll let you go really soon here, Ray, but I just wanted to catch up on

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320
 the cultural stuff.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.760
 So maybe, I don't know, three, four months ago, we asked you, "Are things still going

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.760
 to plan?"

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.480
 And I just wanted to get your update about that.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.600
 Do you still think things are going to plan?

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.000
 Not our plan, the oligarchs' insane psycho plan.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.960
 Which things?

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:54.080
 Like the things you're seeing right now with the war and the rallying about monkeypox and

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.540
 everything that's happening and then the Fed starting to talk about the digital dollar

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.200
 and servers being online in February 2023.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.680
 I guess sometimes a person will say, "Hey, I think their plan is failing."

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.700
 So do you think that?

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:11.240
 Is that your orientation, that things are not going well for them?

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:25.200
 Oh, yeah, everything they're doing is becoming stupid and obvious, but they have rigged it

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:35.240
 so that stupid and obvious aren't impediments to going ahead.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:48.560
 The banks say that there's simply no alternative to digital money and they're just going ahead

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.760
 with it according to plan.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:38:07.040
 It takes time to write all of the programs to manage all of the money in the world in

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:26.600
 a stereotyped manner so that no one has actual money but everyone is on a retainer of a certain

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.120
 loud amount of money.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:36.400
 As soon as they can write the programs to administer that, they're intending it to come

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:44.640
 out in something like two or three years just to get the bank machinery set up to do it.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:39:01.320
 Even though everyone who thinks about it realizes it's absolutely evil, deadly, going to ruin

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:18.760
 the whole ecosphere, they have created essentially a mass dementia, an epidemic of dementia in

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:34.440
 which people can't even begin to think about how to get out of that deadly fate.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.840
 So a more direct question, as you now see, I mean I'm sure you've seen, Russia and China

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.280
 are basically, have solidified their union.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.120
 Russia has said, "We're done with the West.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.500
 It's over."

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.520
 They're about to start their own currency.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:53.040
 The BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India and China, the organization, and now they've added more

00:39:53.040 --> 00:40:00.320
 to that organization, is also about to launch its own currency backed by commodities.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.960
 What do you think is going to happen over the next six to 12 months in the West without

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:09.360
 food and potentially without raw materials for energy in Europe and maybe even in the

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.360
 United States?

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:18.480
 Are we looking at a mass famine event here in the States in the next six to 12 months?

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:35.480
 The production of grain by Ukraine and Russia is still there so that the worst of starvation

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:45.760
 in the southern world can be alleviated, but everything is going to be under maximum tension

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:59.880
 and the only thing that is keeping away a sort of terminal starvation condition is the

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:09.800
 success of the Russian-Chinese third world axis.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:21.400
 They are on the threshold of a successful world economy and the main danger of that

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:33.480
 is that the West can't see any non-demanded solutions, so they're increasingly likely

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.640
 to resort to nuclear weapons.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.880
 We're basically looking at World War III because the West is now out of options.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.240
 I just don't see what the West has remaining.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.280
 Obviously, they're going to try to go full fascism first just to keep the population

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.920
 under control, but still that doesn't resolve the immediate situation, which is the economy

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.160
 of the West is done.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.680
 There's literally almost no productive activity left here.

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:07.560
 Do you think that now with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and the economy formally,

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:12.600
 not that there was much of it remaining before, but even now the fake money is going to disappear

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:18.460
 or at least significantly be curtailed because of the higher interest rate, do you foresee

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.760
 things getting rougher over the next six to 12 months or do you think there's some kind

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.560
 of an opportunity for improvement?

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:39.240
 No, I think the West is just committed to everything getting worse.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.360
 Ray, you echoed, I'm kicking myself because I can't remember this reporter's name, but

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.160
 he's in the Ukraine and he basically said that the Ukraine is getting slaughtered by

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:53.920
 Russia right now, then he thought the US would then send in troops, they would also get slaughtered,

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.160
 and then the only thing the US could do is, because they never apparently said they would

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.440
 not do a first strike, that they would use nuclear weapons.

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.040
 Do you think that is a plausible scenario?

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:18.280
 Yes, the state of dementia that they have created for themselves leads almost inexorably

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.280
 to that.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.280
 Was that Goncalo Lieber?

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.280
 Yes.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280
 He's really funny.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:23.280
 Yeah, I mean he's compelling.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:32.360
 Does your animal instinct, the first signal system, does it tell you right now that the

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.360
 West is done?

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:44.760
 Yeah, I never hear Lieber say anything wrong.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:52.160
 He is extremely compelling and him being close to the action is also pretty useful.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.820
 He had another one saying that, we've talked about this on a podcast before, but the Americans

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.280
 have such a strong normalcy bias that they can't see what's coming right around the corner.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.560
 I feel like I experience that every day.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:11.860
 I feel like this is wartime, but I'm not saying people should have my crazy attitude or whatever,

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:18.320
 but people seem like they're kind of complacent or think because we're in a reprieve from

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.680
 this crazy, like masks are disappearing and stuff, that things are going to get better.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:29.960
 But I mean, if he's right, things are just going to get significantly worse fast, like

00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:33.920
 really quickly within the next six months or so.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:34.920
 Yeah.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:43.880
 I think it's approximately the schedule that I think is inevitable.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:50.600
 Have you bought any canned food that can last you a few months?

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:56.960
 No, the cans are a nuisance.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:07.840
 I always have a barrel of coconut oil and some powdered milk and a lot of grains.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.440
 And sugar, right?

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:16.080
 George said and sugar, right?

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.080
 And what?

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.520
 Sugar, and bald or sugar, basically, white sugar.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:25.040
 The low protein stuff is actually pretty useful entering into a dystopian future.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.800
 Exactly, right?

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.360
 So less eggs and, oh, we didn't really talk about that, but what, has your egg consumption

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.360
 also decreased?

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:50.600
 Yeah, the good thing about the carbohydrates is that they're cheap, will continue to be

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:57.320
 quickly produced and are easy to preserve.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:03.640
 So if you just avoided the methionine, the PUFA, the iron, all the food additives, even

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.000
 walking into a dystopian future, you could probably feel relatively okay.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Possibly.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Yeah.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Okay.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:18.380
 I've talked to, I mean, because I always try to see the arguments of the other side.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:23.400
 So over the years, ever since this whole thing, the craziness with the pandemic started, I

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.840
 tried to talk to some moderates and some people really at the other extreme.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.720
 And over the last two years, everybody that was moderate, that was willing to consider

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:36.280
 that maybe there was some nefariousness, but they're trying to kind of like buy their time

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.760
 and see how things go.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:42.480
 Every single one of these people has been so-called red-pilled, have moved towards the

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.160
 side that says, "Wow, things are really bad."

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.580
 And then the people who used to be simply optimistic now have become extreme to the

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.780
 point that they don't even want to be bothered.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.540
 And whenever you bring stuff up about like potential world war or anything like that,

00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:01.060
 they just refuse to listen, which to me is saying that we are living in very extreme

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.920
 times.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.360
 One last thing about the nuclear war.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.940
 There's nothing to do about that.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:11.540
 Like if they, I mean, if they use nukes, like there's no amount of, I mean, have you made

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.700
 any preparations whatsoever if that happens?

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:21.040
 Just to drive south as quickly as possible.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.840
 Or towards the middle of the country where they probably wouldn't waste the nuke on?

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:32.160
 Yeah, but the clouds will concentrate over the northern hemisphere.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:41.120
 So the farther south you go, the quicker, the less likely you are to be quickly killed.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:45.920
 Would you have to go, the closer to the equator, the better?

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:47.200
 Yeah.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.600
 In Mexico, would you have to go to like Chiapas or would Michoacan be the best place to be

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.600
 for that?

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.000
 Yeah, I think for the present, Michoacan is good.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.320
 High altitude, moderate rainfall.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.720
 What will be some remedies, potential for low level radiation exposure?

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.640
 Especially if it doesn't kill immediately or cause cancer over the next year, what could

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:19.680
 be some things that could decrease the long term damage?

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:37.280
 Using fossil, if you have a greenhouse, heating it with fossil fuels so that you avoid such

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:46.240
 things as strontium fallout and get stable calcium.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:49:04.520
 Avoid the frequent things that are very quick to absorb radiation.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:12.240
 Avoid vegetables that are growing right after the fallout.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.840
 But that would include also animal food, right?

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:19.080
 Because the radiation will concentrate in their bones and brain and the fat tissue?

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.560
 Yeah.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:33.680
 And so old food, if you find old stores of dehydrated or canned foods, they're the first

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.040
 thing to use.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:41.880
 Last thing for me, one of the common retorts, if I'm talking about Mexico with somebody,

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.440
 is that they don't want to go because of the cartels here.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:50.680
 You know what, in a dystopian future with a nuclear radiation sea, what do you see the

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.800
 cartels function as when things get really bad?

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.880
 You think they would take over Mexico and it would be really bad or would you prefer

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.840
 that over some kind of digitized prison in the US?

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:07.960
 You have to pick your poison or what do you think about that?

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:15.640
 The cartels are just effectively capital.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:22.720
 So there's not going to be anything particularly bad about what they do.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.440
 I think they only exist because there's a huge market up north, right?

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.640
 And they're controlled by the CIA.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:31.080
 If these things disappear, the cartels will have to find another job, which probably involves

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.560
 working the land and doing something productive.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:42.160
 Yeah, they've turned to things like avocados instead of drugs.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:46.040
 You don't think it would turn into kind of organized mafia type of thing, just like crime?

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.760
 I mean, that will probably just happen everywhere if things get really bad.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760
 Yeah.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:56.200
 Okay, let's do the advertisement real fast.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.440
 The newsletter is available by email now.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:04.480
 It's $36 for 12 issues, which can be paid through rayPeats@gmail.com.

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:08.840
 You can also order Ray's books, "From PMS to Menopause," "Progesterone in Orthomolecular

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.840
 Medicine," "Gender of Energy," "Mind and Tissue," and "Nutrition for Women" by emailing that

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.920
 same address.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.280
 And then also Progest-E from Keenogen.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.880
 You can email Catherine to purchasekeenogen@gmail.com.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:25.560
 Each bottle of Progest-E is 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:30.320
 And Ray, do you have any recent progesterone stories from people saying that it did this

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.320
 or that?

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.320
 No, nothing special I've heard.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.720
 I usually have one in the can, but I can't think of anything.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:40.720
 Georgi, do you have one?

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.720
 Yes, I do.

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:49.680
 I have a person who lives in Europe who's been emailing me and basically they got diagnosed

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:54.920
 with what the doctors thought were benign tumors in the liver.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.600
 And then they did a biopsy and turned out one of the nodules was actually malignant.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:01.680
 And then this person really freaked out.

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.360
 I think he bought Ray's Progest-E or had it from before and basically took the equivalent

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.120
 of about a teaspoon daily, I think for two weeks.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:17.720
 And then they went back and then basically the malignant nodule had completely disappeared.

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:24.160
 And then of the four remaining nodules that were basically proven benign, three had also

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.360
 disappeared and the last one had shrunk to the size of a pinhead.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.480
 And after another two weeks, that one was gone as well.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:33.480
 Amazing.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.720
 Hey Georgi, Ray, thank you so much for doing this.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.040
 Ray, stay on the line and we'll close the show.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.040
 We have an amazing listenership.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.080
 Thank you guys so much.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.480
 We only had Ray for an hour today, so we're not going to exceed that.

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.160
 Thank you guys so much for bearing with us and have a great weekend.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.160
 We'll talk to you guys soon.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.160
 Okay, bye everyone.
