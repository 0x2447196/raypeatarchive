 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 For those of you who perhaps never listen to our shows,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 they run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Now we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 and recommend herbal supplements and dietary advice.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 This month we want to reassess the role of sugar in the diet

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 and why good sugars are essential for good health.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 It seems that many things we are told are bad for us are actually the good guys,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 and we need to see the facts and research that's out there.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 First, it was saturated animal fats, and we were told they were hardening our arteries

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 and leading us into an early grave.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Well, not true.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 The polyunsaturated alternatives are actually damaging us and are the cause of many disorders.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Then salt, which we were told was increasing our blood pressure again.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 Not true.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 Salt's essential and regulates many processes

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 without which we suffer from increased adrenaline and stress hormones.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Now sugar, it's a bad guy.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Well, not true.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 So once again, we're excited to have Dr. Ray Peat with us this month,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 and we'll be hearing from him on research-based facts behind the statement that sugar's good for you.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 So Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us again.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Would you first give the listeners who perhaps have just tuned in

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 and maybe never listened to the show or never heard you on our shows before

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 a little bit about your background?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Okay.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 In the '50s and '60s, I was studying and teaching in the humanities,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 but I spent a lot of time reading at the science library of the University of Oregon.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And so I eventually decided to get a Ph.D. in biology, physiology,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 so I could use their laboratory equipment as well as their library.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 But I never really considered myself part of the academic scientific community.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 I just got what I could from their culture and have tried to see things that are useful

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 rather than just abstract.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 And that has meant that I concentrate on small molecules rather than genes

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 and the big fancy molecules.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 So water, carbon dioxide, salt, calcium, sugar, and fats have been the things that I study most.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Okay.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 Well, perhaps, Dr. Peat, would you first qualify the term "good sugar" for our listeners,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and then we'll get into the facts and figures, as it were, surrounding sugar

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 and why they're so important for us?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Well, sugar is really the ideal energy exchange substance.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 It's useful for all organisms, practically.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 And it's something that we can store and turn it into -- use it for building all of the big molecules.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 And when it's metabolized, it releases carbon dioxide,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 and carbon dioxide is really a more universal substance than oxygen for the support of life.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 Mike, you had told us in one of our previous shows that there are organisms who can live without oxygen,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 known as anaerobic organisms, but there are no organisms that can live without carbon dioxide.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Right.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 And it turns out that it isn't just mosquitoes and fleas and bed bugs that are attracted to carbon dioxide,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 but the flatworms and nematodes and such that they're studying as simple models of metabolism and aging,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 they seek out a fairly high concentration of carbon dioxide as more favorable for their living conditions.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 So as our cells use sugar more effectively, then are we producing a larger amount of carbon dioxide?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Yeah.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 And when we produce more carbon dioxide, that means we inhibit the production of lactic acid,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 which is not only a wasteful way to use sugar, but lactic acid has a signal function that turns on a whole range of inflammatory processes.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 And they have talked for decades about tumors producing lactic acid,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 and lactic acid also promotes tumors and all of the inflammatory processes.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 So you want your sugar to metabolize into carbon dioxide,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 which will then prevent the dangerous overproduction of lactic acid.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 And can somebody overdose themselves on lactic acid from eating fermented cultured products?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Yeah, I got interested in that a long time ago when I found a nice kefir product that tasted good,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 and I would drink a pint of it for lunch.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 And I came down with a migraine every time I did that,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 and that caused me to read more about the metabolism of lactic acid.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 It is normally produced by stress.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 When you use your muscles faster than your lungs can keep the oxygen supply adequate,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 the lactic acid is circulated into your bloodstream, reaches the liver,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 and your liver has to spend extra energy to turn the lactic acid back into glucose,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 which it then sends back to the muscles.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 But meanwhile, it is depleting your liver of any stored glycogen it had just to get rid of the lactic acid and turn it back into glucose.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 So it is wasting the sugar that your liver has stored as glycogen.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 Yeah, and I happened, because I probably was hypothyroid,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 I happened to be so sensitive that I got a migraine just from drinking a package of the kefir.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Because the lactic acid was actually lowering your blood sugar then.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Yeah, and since then I have run into quite a few people who were having various symptoms

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 every time they ate a fermented product with lactic acid in it.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 The vinegar type fermentation is slightly toxic,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 but it doesn't participate in that blood sugar disturbing effect that lactic acid does.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Right, so it's all the probiotic.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Well, yeah, some of the probiotic bacteria that make lactic acid in themselves,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 they can produce other substances that are protective,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 but you don't want them producing lactic acid from the sugar you eat.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 The sugar you eat should be absorbed up in the first part of your intestine where there are no bacteria to speak of.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 Or there shouldn't be, right?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 Yeah, and for various reasons, sometimes the bacteria will migrate up there from a sluggish bowel and so on.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Or if you eat poorly digested materials like too many starches or fibrous mixtures of starch and carbohydrates,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 these things will not be absorbed and so they'll go down and feed the bacteria.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 And then the bacteria can make lactic acid and other worse toxins from them.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Okay, I think it's important that a few moments ago you mentioned the fact that glycogen

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 that's normally stored in the liver as a storage form of sugar

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 is used to convert lactic acid when it's been produced in the absence of sufficient oxygen from muscular activity

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 to create the conversion of lactic acid back into glucose.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And what I wanted to just bring out is that for most people that are listening, perhaps you may not understand it,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 but that the liver is a good storage organ for glycogen as a form of sugar to be used in times when it's needed.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 But would you expand on that in terms of how much glycogen is the liver able to store?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 How long do people have?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 How long can people go with just eating proteins or not eating before their liver goes,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 "Okay, I don't have enough," and then they start eating themselves?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 This brings out why sugar is good, and we can keep delving into the details.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 If your thyroid and other hormones are in the right concentration,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 your liver should be able to store at least eight hours of glycogen

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 so that everyone should be able to get through the night on the amount of glycogen in their liver

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 without resorting to other sources of energy.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 But when your thyroid is a little low or, for example, if your estrogen is too high

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 or other things are interfering, then your liver sometimes can hardly store any glycogen.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Typically, when your glycogen runs out, you send out a surge of adrenaline,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 which will squeeze the last little bit of glucose out of your liver.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It activates the dissolution of glycogen, turning it into glucose.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 When your liver can't respond to the adrenaline anymore, the first sign of depleted glucose is

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 you might feel shaky and cold from the high adrenaline.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Then you resort to increased cortisol, which begins breaking down your tissues,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 turning protein into fat and carbohydrate for energy.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Under that extreme condition, when you've been out of glycogen long enough to run on cortisol for about a day,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 the thymus will be dissolved just in a few hours of the intense exposure to cortisol.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 When the quickly dissolved tissues, such as the thymus, are gone over the next week or whatever it is,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 not replenishing your sugar, your muscles will atrophy.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 People who fast for a week or two will usually lose more muscle weight than they lose fat

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 because of the very rapid conversion of protein into fuel.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 Under the influence of the cortisol?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Yes.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Whenever you eat a big dose of protein without sugar to back it up,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 you're going to stimulate the secretion of first insulin to dispose of the digested amino acids from the protein.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 The insulin, which properly disposes of the amino acids, is going to lower any circulating glucose and tend to turn it into fat.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 As the glucose goes down, that will drive up your cortisol.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 Typically, a big protein meal will cause a huge surge of cortisol.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Some people become supposedly diabetic or very hyperglycemic because they eat too much meat unaccompanied by sugar or some carbohydrate.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 That's just because the protein is stimulating the cortisol and the cortisol is metabolizing it?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Yes, it's doing its job of turning protein into sugar and fat.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 So it's important to keep a balance between proteins and sugars.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 You should always eat sugars with protein.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Right. Just for our listeners to clarify, sugars, carbohydrates, we're using the term synonymously.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Sugars and carbohydrates are basically the same thing.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 There are different types of sugars or different types of carbohydrates, starchy carbohydrates versus non-starchy carbohydrates.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 I think we're going to get into that a little bit later.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Galbraithville 91.1 FM.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 From 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of sugar and the benefits of sugar.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 If you live in the area, it's 923 3911. If you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 We are excited and very pleased to have with us on the show today Dr. Ray Peat,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 endocrinologist and research scientist who is going to unravel some of the myths and some of the truths about why sugar is good for you.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Dr. Peat, perhaps we should break into the good sugars versus the bad sugars because obviously,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 most people have heard in one form or another that sugar is bad for you.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 So let's clarify the bad sugars versus the good sugars and what they are and what food sources they are in.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 One of the things that started me thinking about whether a person should follow the government's advice to eat a lot of starch.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Complex, otherwise known as complex carbohydrates.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Yeah, the government and the American Dietetics Association, I think it's been almost 50 years,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 have been promoting that idea that complex carbohydrates have some advantage over sugars.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 And I started reading about that in the 70s and ran across Gerhard Polkheimer's research in which he had first fed different mixtures of starch and water,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 corn starch, potato starch and several other kinds of starch, which occur in grains that are roughly the size of a cell,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 anywhere from five microns in diameter up to 100 microns.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And he would feed these to his experimental mice and then sampled their body fluids.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 And he found that a chronic diet was of frequent feedings of the starch solution.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 He could demonstrate the particles of starch in their bloodstream just minutes after they ate it and then in all of their body fluids about an hour later.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 And so he fed that sort of program to his mice for several months and found that they were prematurely aged.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And when he sliced them up, he found in all of their organs little nests of dead cells where one of these fairly large grains of starch,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 roughly the size of a red blood cell, was stuck in an arteriole, killing all of the cells downstream from that plugged up point.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 So the starch granules were blocking the arteries and starving the cells or the arterioles and starving the cells of the nutrition from the blood.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 And so he tested it on his medical students and would draw blood and sampled their urine and found that about 30 minutes after you drink some of it,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 you can find starch grains in your veins.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 Forty-five minutes to an hour later, you find it in the urine and in the bile and even in the cerebrospinal fluid about an hour and a half later.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 And they're not supposed to cross the blood-brain barrier, are they?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Well, they aren't supposed to cross the intestine barrier.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Because they're so small?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Is this because people's intestines are completely out of balance or is it just the nature of the size of the starch granule?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 He assumed and proposed that they're being forced between cells,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 but people have such a mechanical conception of how the wall of the intestine and the arteries and veins and capillaries,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 and how they're constructed that it just seems mechanically impossible.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 But it's actually more like a viscous fluid and things can really sort of migrate through things as if there was no absolute barrier.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 So it's like a mesh?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Yeah. Many years ago, someone made a movie of white blood cells

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 and showed them what looked like freely swimming in and out of cells,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 swimming into a cell and looking around behind the nucleus and poking around and then leaving the cell.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 The guards of the blood?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Yeah. And people don't draw conclusions from that.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 There aren't cell walls that have to be broken.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 It's more like a sort of viscous fluid.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Through which all these communications occur?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Yeah.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Okay. So let's list the good sugars and then the bad sugars just to keep that in context.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Well, so Dr. Beat's already mentioned the starches as being the bad guys because they're blocking arteries,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 but there's other things that starches do that aren't so great for your...

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Yeah. The typical starch, when it's cooked and digested,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 if it isn't digested, then it goes down and feeds the bacteria and that's a really bad effect.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 They've seen with these so-called prebiotic or probiotic semi-digestible starches that are being promoted.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 They have found that the poorly digested starches cause behavioral changes in their animals,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 makes them anxious and aggressive to have stuff fermenting in their intestine.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 And some of the products of bacterial action on these undigested materials can tremendously increase endotoxins

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 and cause inflammation of the intestine, liver, and eventually all of the body.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 But the typical well-cooked starch, when it is digested, releases pure glucose.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 And in my first physiology lab, a professor had us feed, I think it was a 10-gram dose of corn starch to the lab rats.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And she said, "Wait 10 minutes and then operate on the rat and see how far this huge glob of starch paste had migrated."

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And it turned out that there was no trace of any starch paste left in the rat after 10 minutes.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Wow. It was all picked up.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 It had just instantly been turned into glucose and absorbed.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 And we aren't quite as fast as rats, but when you look at the so-called glycemic index of foods,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 starch tends to be near the top, very similar to pure glucose.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 And that means that you get a quick, powerful stimulation of insulin when you eat starch or plain glucose,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 and that the insulin does its work quickly of disposing of the glucose by turning it into fat when you absorb more than you need.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 But then your liver is -- if it's turned into fat, then it didn't really store very much in your liver, right?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Yeah, it does that too. But when you have this very intense dose, some of it goes into the liver,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 but if it can't all momentarily be disposed of in the liver, then some of it turns into fat.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 So even though you aren't eating too many calories, if you eat it in the form of very quickly digested starch or pure glucose,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 you'll get these bursts of fat synthesis and tend to get fatter and fatter.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 And because the same thing that happens with a quickly assimilated glucose or starch,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 the same thing happens as when you eat a pure protein meal.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 The sudden falling of the blood sugar causes a surge of cortisol production,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 and then that changes your metabolism, makes you waste protein.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Even if you didn't eat any, you'll then disturb some of your tissue, your thymus and muscles especially.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 And so the cortisol helps to direct the fat deposition to your waste area and back and face as in Cushing's Syndrome or the so-called metabolic syndrome.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 So whether you eat a meal that has pure protein or whether you eat a meal with protein and starch, the end game is going to be the same.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 It's going to drive up insulin, it's going to drive increased fat production,

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 and it's not going to be storing sugar in your liver as effectively as it could be if you were eating a different type of sugar.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 So what types of sugars are slow release and are stored in your liver as glycogen so that your body can have an instant supply of sugar?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Sucrose, glucose, fructose and lactose are very good, well metabolized sugars.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 And do those sugars feed bacteria in the lower?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Well, they're so quickly absorbed that usually they will be absorbed partly in your stomach and partly in the first foot or so of intestine.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And the presence of fructose partly blocks the release of insulin and partly changes the effect of insulin so that it helps to direct some of the glucose into the liver while blocking its storage as fat.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 And so you get a lower secretion of insulin, a lower stress effect and a better glycogen storage effect from either sucrose or the mixture of glucose and fructose.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Or in the case of milk and milk sugar, the presence of the proteins and fat in the milk add to the slowing of the sugar effect.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 I wonder how many grams of sugar would you say would be a good healthy amount? Because I know definitely with things like calories, they're pretty well understated by government standards as are several other levels of certain nutrients, etc.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 But what would you say as an intake of sugar would be a good healthy intake?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 Well, it depends on your total caloric requirement. And some, especially hypothyroid women, can maintain their body weight on 700 or 800 calories a day.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 And textbooks used to say that you had to lose weight if you ate less than 1600 calories a day. But now many people, especially women, can get fat on 1500 calories because of things interfering with their metabolism and thyroid function.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 But if you have a healthy metabolism and can burn between 2000 and 3500 calories a day, then your carbohydrate requirement is going to be somewhere in the range of 180 grams to 350 grams.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 And just to give people an idea of how many grams of sugar are in different foods, one teaspoon of sugar contains four grams of sugar.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 So it's actually not very much. You might think one teaspoon of sugar has a lot. And if you need 180 minimum per day to keep your liver happy, in comparison, one cup of brown rice contains 41 grams of sugar.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 But the glycemic index of the rice is going to be a lot higher than it is of the sugar. And so you'll store the sugars from the rice a lot more as fat than you would if you were eating the same amount of grams of sugar in actual white sugar.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 And when you get your sugars in the form of more natural foods rather than refined white sucrose, for example, if you eat orange juice and milk,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 the orange juice is extremely rich in minerals compared to rice or any of the popular pasta, bread and so on.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Those are very poor in the minerals that orange juice and other fruits provide richly. And potassium, which is very abundant in all fruits, acts like insulin.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 So you don't have to secrete very much insulin for the same disposition of glucose. And the orange juice also has some other helpful chemicals like naringin and naringin that help to prevent inflammation and increase the good disposition of the carbohydrate.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And in milk, besides the protein and fat, slowing the absorption of the lactose, the calcium besides the potassium and other minerals,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 the calcium powerfully stimulates the energy metabolism, causing you to use your sugar more quickly, preventing it from being stored as fat.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 So the milk drinkers in general tend to be much slimmer than non-milk drinkers, largely because of this effect of calcium.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 So there's more than just insulin to the way you store sugar, but potassium and calcium have an effect on your use and storage of sugar as well.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And from right now until the end of the show, at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated to this month's topic of sugar and the benefits of sugar.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 The number if you live in the area, 923 3911, or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 Okay, so to continue with the good benefits of sugar and why it's so maligned.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Well, so Dr. Pete, can you explain to us, like, so you've mentioned milk and orange juices being good sources of some natural sugars.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 What about honey and lots of other fruits?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Honey is generally better than white sugar because it has some minerals, but not as much as in the fruit.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 And it's probably the best refined, the bees refined it rather than a factory.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 But honey has been used as a food by all of the high civilizations.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 I think there's good reason to think that sugar goes with high cultural development.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 The Egyptians and Chinese and all of the old, well-developed cultures knew about honey and most of them also refined sugar.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 The Arabs were the pioneers, the Egyptians were actually refining sugar from sugar cane probably a couple thousand years ago.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 Okay, sorry. Do we have a caller?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 No, I was just wondering if you guys were hearing me on that call or not.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Okay, well, we hear you now, Marian. Thank you.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 Okay, so going on to previous cultural experience with sugar, the Egyptians and other civilizations have certainly benefited from sugar

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 and held it in high regard like they did salt as a form of currency for trading with neighboring civilizations.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 So the current dogma of sugar being the bad guy and being responsible for cavities and increasing diabetes and obesity,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 can this pretty much be explained from the processed refined sugar that we're looking at talking about tonight with things like pastas and white bread

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 and those other sources of instant release high glycemic index sugars versus...

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 And low mineral sugars.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 And low mineral sugars, yeah, versus sugars that come with a complement of other minerals and other chemicals, things like honey and then the fruits.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 Are there any other sources that people should be aware of that are certainly going to encourage people to use

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 rather than tell them they shouldn't be using sugar?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 I think you've about covered it all, Andrew.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Do you have any more sugars to add to the list, Dr. Peate, that you'd say are the good guys?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 No, nothing occurs to me.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Okay. So how about the... For people that are listening now, what's the deal with diabetes and sugar and that link

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 and how that link is not necessarily true?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 The principle in physiology that I think really explains it was proposed a few decades ago.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 It's called the Randall effect or the Randall cycle, although there's no cycle involved.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 That refers to the fact that free fatty acids block the use of glucose by cells.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 And that was demonstrated frequently in hospitals when they were giving nutrition support to people who couldn't eat

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 or cancer patients who were losing weight very fast in the form of a soy oil emulsion.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 They saw that about 15 minutes after injecting this nutritional dose of emulsified soy oil intravenously

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 that people would get hyperglycemic.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 And the Randall effect is sort of an instantaneous thing.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 But when the fatty acids that are involved in blocking the use of sugar, when those are polyunsaturated,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 they produce long range damage that keeps the Randall effect going, keeps blocking the use of sugar.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 A group, I think it was in South Carolina, the lead author of one of the papers was M.X. Fu,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 who showed that the glycated proteins that are seen in diabetic people, glycated hemoglobin, for example,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 and they blamed that on glucose or fructose fragments sticking to hemoglobin and other proteins.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 But Fu and his group demonstrated that polyunsaturated fatty acids are much more powerful glycators,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 sticking fragments, three carbon, five carbon and longer fragments from the spontaneously oxidized polyunsaturated fats

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 stick to the proteins. And so the free fatty acids not only block the sugar use instantaneously,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 but they produce these advanced glycation end products, AGEs, that are associated with diabetes and aging.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 So the chronic effect of a high fat diet, if the fat diet is predominantly unsaturated,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 produces not only diabetes, but all of the things that result from glycated proteins.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 So in diabetes, people are poisoning their pancreas with these polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 blocking the pancreatic beta cells from producing insulin.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 But then they're also, they have these high levels of free fatty acids that are blocking the sugar getting into the cell.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 And then doesn't that feed back to the system to tell the body, raise the blood sugar higher, we're not getting enough.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 It's a self-stimulating system. So when you block the cells from using glucose, they call for more glucose.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And the liver obliges by making extra glucose when it can, mobilizing it.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 And going back to the starches, starches, you've already described, more strongly stimulate insulin than the simple sugars do

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 that come from fruits and honey. So wouldn't that be more contributory to the theory of wearing out the pancreas?

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Yeah. And the diabetics, supposedly the sugar just isn't getting into their cells.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 But what's happening, you can see in the fact that diabetics often have very high lactic acid concentrations,

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 showing that the glucose is getting into the cell, but it just can't be used oxidatively because of the fatty acids blocking the respiratory system.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 So then lactic acid goes to the liver, which turns it into more glucose.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 I wanted to ask you in a little while, because we have a call on the line about your opinion of high fructose corn syrup.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Let's take this caller first. You on the air? Hello? Hello. You on the air?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 Hi. I'm wondering, because some of the stuff I understand, some of the stuff I don't understand.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 OK, so if I eat a big bowl of cereal with a lot of sugar and two hours later I get sleepy, what does that mean?

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Usually it's the same effect that a person who has been hypothyroid experiences when they correct their thyroid.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 When your adrenaline is high, you're being stimulated.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 You're very alert and aware and on edge. Your body's under the stress hormone adrenaline.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 It's ready to go and you feel wide awake.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 And when you either correct your thyroid function or whatever other glandular processes is causing you to have high adrenaline,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 or if you eat a lot of sugar, sugar and salt will both help to lower adrenaline.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 And so they can both make you sleepy while they're present and circulating.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 So people who have insomnia can take care of the problem temporarily by just taking some sugary food and salty food at bedtime.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 OK, let me ask you a question. If a person is diabetic or prediabetic,

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 is there a simple way to express what the good sugars and bad sugars are?

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 And I'll take my answer off the phone. Thank you very much.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Did you hear that question, Dr. Peat?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 Yeah. It's basically the whole thing we're talking about.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 The definition of diabetes and prediabetes are they've been created to first to sell insulin and then to sell the non-insulin sugar regulating drugs and so on.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 They keep multiplying the definitions of how many types of diabetes there are.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 There's type one and type two and syndrome X and gestational diabetes.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 We'll probably have half a dozen types of diabetes if the government and the medical business get their way.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 OK, but basically the good types of sugars that are going to be more slow release are the fruit sugars and the honey.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 And if you're eating in combination with fat and a protein, then they're going to be even more slowly released and they won't require the pancreas to pump out a ton load of insulin.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Yeah, fruits and cheese are very safe things for diabetics.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 And they'll notice, like we've seen with our diabetic clients, that their sugar numbers don't go up with fruits and cheese and milk and honey.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 Yeah, I wrote a newsletter about a couple of friends and an English doctor 140 or 150 years ago who noticed exactly that same thing, but it didn't catch on with the medical business.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 I know diabetics are told they need to eat complex carbohydrates, but when you actually look at the glycemic index of complex carbohydrates,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 they're much higher than what's in fruit and honey and white sugar, believe it or not.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 And since the government has been making these recommendations and people have been eating more of the starches and polyunsaturated fats,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 the incidence of so-called diabetes has increased tremendously.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 So for that diabetic caller or if you're calling about someone else, fruits, honey, dairy products, and avoiding starchy carbohydrates,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 which I should qualify for our listeners are things like bread, pasta, cereals, grains, rice, all those are termed starchy carbohydrates.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 They not only have a high glycemic index, which means they shoot your sugar level up quickly,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 but they also have the potential to feed bacteria in your lower intestine, which causes all sorts of other problems,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 as maybe Dr. Pete will have time to explain, but I think we have another caller.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 In the long range, it's very important to avoid the polyunsaturated fats for avoiding diabetes.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 Oh, right, yes, and sorry, I forgot to mention that for that other caller, avoiding the vegetable oils, soy, canola, corn, safflower, sunflower, hemp seed, fish,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 all those polyunsaturated omega-3 and 6 especially.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 Okay, so there's another caller. Are you on the air?

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Yes, hello.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 Hi, so I was wondering what about beans and whole grains, like whole grains, brown rice, that kind of thing, because you mentioned rice,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 but were you specifically talking about white rice or with the whole grains?

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Well, the...

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 Quinoa, things like that, and beans.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 What about, and also, a lot of different nutritional people claim that there's a problem when you combine, like, fruits with proteins,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 and they want you to separate them by a couple of hours, things like that, but what you're saying seems to contradict that theory,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 and so I was wondering, yeah.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 I think it's good to precede a big protein meal by maybe 15 or 20 minutes with fruit so that you get your liver stocked with some glycogen

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 so that you don't respond so violently when you eat a pure protein,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 and the whole grains and legumes are, they have more nutrients, but only a small amount of the minerals compared to the fruits,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 and the germs do contain some valuable nutrients, but they also contain enough of the polyunsaturated fats in the germs that that was why the refining was invented by the Chinese several thousand years ago,

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 because they found that the rancidity of the whole grains damaged the nutritional value.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 Well, that's it.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 So it sounds to me like you're saying that a good diet would be mostly fruit, and then protein, and then maybe some of the other stuff,

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 but stay away from the polyunsaturated oils, and even the omega-3 oils that they keep telling you to concentrate on.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 Yeah, their virtue is that they're a little less toxic in the sense of causing cancer than the omega-6,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 but they tend to break down faster even than the omega-6, and their main virtue therapeutically is as an anti-inflammatory agent.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 That's why they're becoming popular for arthritis and--

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 Psoriasis.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 The way they're anti-inflammatory is that their breakdown products interfere with the immune system and stop the inflammation in the short run,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 but in the long run they're suppressing your immune system.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 Is that like cortisone or something?

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 Yeah, very similar.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 So then if you wanted to have--you should stick with things like fish oil and stuff rather than that.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Well, the fish oil breaks down very easily, too, so in the long range it has its serious problems, too.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 A better solution would be to find out what's causing the inflammation in the first place.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 Is it a thyroid deficiency or another hormonal imbalance that's causing your inflammation rather than taking fish oils to just block it?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 Because even radiation--they used to do radiation treatments to help people with rheumatoid arthritis because it was anti-inflammatory.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 Wow.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 Well, do you and--I guess that's your husband that practiced together?

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 Yeah, my husband is Andrew and I'm Sarah.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 Yeah. Do you guys do--can someone come to you and get an evaluation of their system so that you know where your deficiencies are?

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 Yes, we do offer consultations, nutritional and herbal consultations, and we will be giving our number out at the end of the show.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 Okay. Well, thank you very much.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 Okay, I understand there's probably four or more callers on the line.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Well, we've lost a couple. They've dropped in and out, but we do have another caller on the line.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 Because it is 7.53, so there's another caller. So you're on the air?

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 Hello, me?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 Ah, very good. Hi, Andrew and Sarah. This is Kevin.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 Hey, Kevin.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Hello.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 Hi. So I have a question regarding the role of sugar in yeast infections and systemic fungal infections.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 And if a person has a systemic fungal infection, whether they should be avoiding all kinds of sugar?

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 In general, things like the yeast that cause both internal and external infections love sugar,

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 but usually about once or twice a year someone turns up who has a very intense infestation with yeast, even in their stomach.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 And when they eat sugar, they can actually get drunk from the fermentation, turning the sugar into alcohol.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 But that getting drunk on sugar is about the worst effect of the sugar metabolism by the yeast.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 And when you starve yeast, if you have it living in your intestine and they're attracted to estrogen,

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 estradiol is a reproductive hormone for yeast as it is for humans, if your estrogen is high,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 they tend to congregate in any place that is rich in estrogen.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 If you starve those for sugar, they tend to become invasive and they put out filaments,

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 not like the mushroom type fungus, but a filament long enough to penetrate through cells,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 like fingers reaching through your intestine walls looking for sugar.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 And that starvation condition is what can make them invade your tissues rather than just living free in your intestine.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 And it's only when they invade your tissues that they can become deadly.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 And on your skin, low thyroid people often have high estrogen and that favors genital yeast infections.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 And correcting the thyroid and hormones is the basic thing, eating a diet that helps to regulate your hormones.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 And topically, just dusting with sulfur powder, flowers of sulfur or precipitated sulfur is a safe way to kill them on the surface.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 And it even works taking a pinch of it orally will suppress the fungal growth inside the intestine.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 Great, okay.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 So are you saying, Dr. Peat, that if someone does have an overgrowth of fungus in their intestines,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 that actually eating more sugar would feed the yeast and make them happier so they're less invasive and less deadly?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 Yeah, actually.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 And what would you suggest be a treatment, a good treatment for that?

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 Well, the carrot salad, the carrot is indigestible.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 And you know how a stale carrot takes weeks and weeks before it molds or never rots, really.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 That's true.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 That's because it has antifungal, antibacterial chemicals in it because it lives in the ground.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 Okay.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 So if you grate a carrot and then put some oil, olive oil or coconut oil, and vinegar, vinegar is a bacterial chemical.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 The acetic acid is the bacteria's way of killing fungus.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 And it's a short, saturated fatty acid, and so the longer fatty acids of coconut oil and olive oil are bound to this indigestible fiber of the carrot

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 and slowly released all the way down your intestine.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 And they have a very profound, safe disinfecting action on your intestine that will take care of not only the fungus,

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 but a lot of bad other types of organisms.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 Okay, good.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 I think we'll have to call it a night there, so make sure that people get your contact information, Dr. Pete.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 Thank you so much for all the callers who have phoned in this week.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 And thank you so much for listening to the show.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 And for those who would like to find out more about Dr. Ray Pete, his website is www.rayPeat.org.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 No, .com.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 Sorry, .com now. It's .com. I beg your pardon.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 Gosh, I get that wrong so often. It's .com.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
 Okay, so rayPeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
 I was just going to spell it out, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:26.000
 Okay, he's got a very informative website with a lot of scholarly research articles that are all fully referenced from those topics that he first introduced himself for.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 Things like salt, the polyunsaturated issues, hormone-related issues.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 He has some articles there on cancers and their genesis.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 And yeah, it's a very good site, well worth looking out and finding more from.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:55.000
 Okay, so we can be reached toll-free, 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or further information Monday through Friday.

00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 And thank you so much to all of you who listen regularly and those who tuned in this evening.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
