00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell podcast.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.760
 I am as usual Jodell and I am so thrilled once again to have with me Dr. Pete and he's

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.320
 my forever go-to source for all things health and nutrition related.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.360
 Dr. Pete has a PhD in biology and he has taught at numerous schools and universities all things

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.480
 nutrition and women's health specifically and you can learn more about him by visiting

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.820
 RayPete.com that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T dot com and you'll be amazed at his science-based articles

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.400
 and newsletters, all of which we'll talk about later.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.160
 He was completely in on the thyroid today.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 I'm really excited about talking about the thyroid because I have had thyroid issues

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.160
 resulting from a toxic mold exposure that I've since gotten better from but I always

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.760
 love talking about the thyroid for that reason.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.840
 I wanted to let the listeners know to stay tuned because at the end, Dr. Pete, I really

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.720
 want to touch on the foods for the thyroid.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.000
 I want to touch on is exercise a do or a don't and lifestyle habits that will amp up the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 thyroid.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.280
 Also, we actually have two viewer or listener questions related to the thyroid so I hope

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.380
 to get to those as well.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.640
 Thank you once again for joining me.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.760
 Let's get started.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.200
 Many people speculate, Dr. Pete, that the reasons we have such a thyroid problem now

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.360
 more than ever is you hear things like because of the chemicals in the food systems or they

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 say our poor water supply or the fluoride in the water or EMF radiation, all these different

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.580
 speculations on why we have such a low thyroid problem now but I want your professional opinion.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.480
 Why are thyroid problems such a problem these days?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:53.720
 All of those things contribute to the problem but I think the basic most common problem

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:05.520
 is the increase of polyunsaturated fats in the diet of vegetable oils, liquid kind basically.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.760
 They inhibit the polyunsaturated fatty acids, inhibit the secretion of the hormones from

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:25.960
 the gland and it's transported in the blood and it's used in the cell in various ways.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:35.400
 In the 1930s and early 40s, people were estimating that around 40% of the population suffered

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:47.560
 from some degree of hypothyroidism as defined by symptoms since the late 19th century symptoms

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.440
 of hypothyroidism were being described in the medical literature and the low body temperature

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:09.640
 tendency to have poor liver function, depression or excitatory brain symptoms, insomnia, high

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 blood pressure, abnormally low blood pressure, many things, dozens of symptoms were well

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:33.000
 identified as mainly caused by hypothyroidism and in the mid-1940s, a drug company synthesized

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.400
 what they called d-thyroid hormone.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:45.760
 It was a component found in the secretions of the thyroid gland and it's called thyroxine

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 and it was made synthetically in the 1940s and came on the market as a treatment for

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:06.600
 hypothyroidism but along with that marketing of a single chemical came a whole ideology

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:15.680
 since this new chemical didn't cure most of the symptoms that were known to identify

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 hypothyroidism.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:26.720
 Those were decided in the literature, the advertising program of the company selling

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.640
 the synthetic thyroid, they were written out of the definition of hypothyroidism gradually

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:45.520
 over the next 50 years, the only defining characteristic of hypothyroidism came to be

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.520
 an elevation of the pituitary hormone thyroid stimulating hormone which rises when your

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.360
 thyroid is low almost always.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:08.480
 And that couldn't be measured in the 1930s and so people went entirely by the symptoms

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:19.400
 but with the marketing of thyroxine as the thyroid hormone, they looked over a period

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:33.000
 of decades looked for a way to define chemically exactly what the features of hypothyroidism

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.680
 were so that they could have an exact basis for prescribing the synthetic hormone and

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:50.120
 the first test was a blood test for protein bound iodine and that became the prescribing

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:58.760
 basis for more than 15 years that people were tested for protein bound iodine in the blood

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:09.160
 and if this was low then they could be prescribed the synthetic but in the 1960s it was shown

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.800
 that this protein bound iodine had absolutely nothing to do with your thyroid function.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:26.440
 It's a very sort of a more or less random event that can go with either high or low thyroid

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:36.440
 function and eventually a sensitive test for the pituitary hormone was developed and progressively

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:45.840
 other indicators were thrown away and doctors were told to rely only on measurement of TSH

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:57.400
 and if it was above 10 of the standard units that was said to be hypothyroidism, if it

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:09.000
 was below at first they were saying poor I think it was of the units, that would be hypothyroidism

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.720
 and in the last two or three years guidelines have been published in major medical journals

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:27.320
 advising doctors almost threateningly telling them not to pay any attention to the physiological

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:38.120
 signs that traditionally identified hypothyroidism go only by the measurement of TSH and return

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:50.400
 to a standard range usually from between 3 and 5 I think is the most common definition

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.200
 of normal for TSH.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:58.400
 It's so interesting that you mention that because it seems like there are quite a few

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.680
 people that go to the doctor with classic symptoms of low thyroid function and then

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.920
 are yet diagnosed as no your thyroid is just fine you're in range so can you talk about

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.520
 why subclinical hypothyroidism is so prevalent like why aren't they quick to look at the

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:23.720
 signs and symptoms and only look at the TSH.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.400
 When the company first marketed this synthetic thyroid they said they had tested it on I

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:35.880
 think it was two dozen young male medical students for some reason I guess there weren't

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:44.440
 many female medical students at the time but the funny thing about thyroid is hypothyroidism

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:53.240
 is several times more frequent in women because estrogen messes with the function of all the

00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:03.960
 functions of the thyroid and so they threw out most of the hypothyroid women from treatment

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:13.520
 in the first years and I had obese friends in high school who had been previously diagnosed

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:21.400
 as needing a thyroid supplement but they were told by the doctors I heard it from all of

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:28.680
 my fat friends that they had discovered that they were not it was not a glandular problem

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:36.360
 they had they were just gluttonous people accepted that it was all that they ate too

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:44.560
 much not that their glands were being poisoned by something else in the environment.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.280
 That's why you hear a doctor saying now eat less move more that's their prescription now

00:09:49.280 --> 00:10:02.600
 when we see these people with thyroid issues and the women who could stay obese despite

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:10.160
 saying that they ate almost nothing doctors doctors were taught that women were basically

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:19.200
 lying about how much they ate but someone did the study had women in a locked hospital ward

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.880
 where there's no possibility of getting extra food and it was found that these women who

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.560
 said they ate almost nothing but gained weight they were found to be able to maintain their

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:42.200
 weight on the diet of 700 calories a day the only way to do that is to be very hypothyroid

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:53.560
 but it's still very common for extremely hypothyroid women in particular to be diagnosed as gluttonous

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.840
 rather than hypothyroid.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.600
 Well let's talk about some of the major symptoms that someone would see if they suspect they

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.160
 might have low thyroid like what are some of the major signs they would notice and see

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.400
 clearly like with their own body?

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:21.680
 When I was 9 or 10 years old I started noticing symptoms in myself that I saw that more girls

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:32.040
 had similar symptoms. I didn't see any other boys with migraine headaches and nearsightedness

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:41.120
 but these often begin in puberty as a result of low thyroid and I've known girls in their

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:52.120
 teens who had just suddenly become nearsighted and when a doctor gave them thyroid in a timely

00:11:52.120 --> 00:12:02.400
 manner their vision was corrected to normal. So chronic myopia is one of the very frequent

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:13.000
 signs of hypothyroidism. Weight loss, inability to gain weight was known more than 100 years

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:25.540
 ago 1890 the first publication relating the wasting disease they called it cactexia strumie

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:35.000
 prevent caused by loss of the thyroid function. So overweight or underweight both can be caused

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.680
 by low thyroid. The thyroid hormone is an anabolic hormone that builds protein and tissues and

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:56.760
 bones but doctors by getting most things upside down doctors warn that excess thyroid will

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:07.280
 cause osteoporosis but animal experiments way back in the 1940s for example on rabbits

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:17.240
 they fed them 1% of their food by weight was thyroid plant a gigantic diet equivalent to

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:29.580
 oh like 20 grains probably thyroid hormone for a person and they their metabolism went

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:36.560
 up so much that they were starved to death no matter how much they ate and so they became

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:47.160
 very thin but their bones became abnormally strong and dense showing that the anabolic

00:13:47.160 --> 00:14:00.920
 effect on the bones it has to take precedence over even a starvation diet and lacking this

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:10.960
 anabolic tissue restoring effective thyroid when when your actual metabolism is slowing

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:19.600
 down in the thyroid deficiency the emergency stress hormones starting with adrenaline and

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:30.640
 including cortisol rise to maintain function but at the expense of your muscles and bones

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:43.680
 and so your even if you are eating a good diet these stress hormones can damage your

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:51.400
 tissues make your muscles and bones atrophy leading to osteoporosis and connective tissue

00:14:51.400 --> 00:15:01.600
 diseases in which your muscles and skin and tendons ligaments all deteriorate that makes

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.200
 me think about like cellulite so would low thyroid you mentioned the tissue would be

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.320
 not building up the way it should so which makes me think that the tissue would then

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.560
 be thinner like kind of crepey skin to where cellulite might become more prevalent would

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:26.440
 that be the case with low thyroid the skin becomes under the high cortisol which breaks

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:34.560
 down proteins and they aren't replaced when your thyroid is low protein synthesis is pretty

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:46.240
 much turned off and while the skin gets thinner in the low thyroid condition estrogen is left

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:55.040
 in an exaggeratedly active form and you retain the water but you don't retain salt in proportion

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:04.600
 so you become waterlogged actually hypotonic relative to the normal concentration of salt

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:14.400
 and the salt when it's retained normally under the influence of thyroid hormone the salt

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:22.720
 associates with albumin in the blood and pulls water from the tissues into the blood stream

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:31.480
 and delivers it to the kidneys to be excreted in low thyroid you lose the sodium in the

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:43.100
 urine and so the albumin instead of forming a sort of a cloud in the bloodstream of ionized

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:52.080
 sodium atoms along with the ionized albumin the albumin no longer has this osmotic ability

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:59.240
 to retain water in the bloodstream keeping up the blood volume and keeping it out of

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:09.080
 the tissues so the water is allowed to fall out of the blood vessels cause tissue to swell

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:18.160
 and the albumin in the absence of sodium goes along to some extent with the water and that

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:31.500
 becomes a viscous extra-pascular solution protein and any sodium that might be there

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:43.080
 will form a kind of chelic like mass around cells they instead of ordinary edema in this

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:56.520
 condition when albumin has leaked out of the blood vessels it becomes a mucous like edema

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:05.360
 and that used to be the most common defining feature of hypothyroidism was mixed edema

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:20.160
 or mucous like edema and this water retention in healthy relatively healthy women there's

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:28.200
 a tendency of the estrogen at the time of ovulation to suppress thyroid function a little

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:35.440
 bit and cause a little bit of sodium loss and a little bit of leakage of water into the

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:44.360
 tissues but if it only goes on for a few days it doesn't become mixed edema like it's just

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:51.440
 a passing monthly edema or swelling I think this is so important for so many people to

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.240
 hear this because I don't think people think of water retention as a as a symptom of low

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.580
 thyroid and so many people have that too I know you had mentioned cortisol as well as

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:09.320
 kind of a culprit behind the issue with the water retention too and so talk to me about

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.680
 how like high cortisol is that the precursor to low thyroid or does high cortisol result

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:25.040
 from the thyroid dropping down low thyroid keeps your energy running efficiently so that

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:35.300
 glucose is turned into carbon dioxide and you get many times more molecules of ATP to

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:42.120
 do your work than you would if you didn't have the thyroid thyroid deficiency is like

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:50.320
 an oxygen deficiency and you burn your sugar waste fully producing lactic acid instead

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:57.580
 of carbon dioxide and don't produce the ATP needed to do all of the cellular work like

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:07.560
 making protein and that means that your blood sugar becomes unstable and tends to drop sharply

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:16.240
 with exertion as the lactic acid rises the blood sugar drops and both of those the falling

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:25.200
 blood sugar and the rising lactic acid trigger adrenaline and cortisol and the cortisol breaks

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.920
 down your protein in your tissues including muscles and connective tissues and your immune

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:41.200
 system to produce sugar so the cortisol and the adrenaline will rise as your thyroid falls

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:48.560
 and they will keep function going but at the expense of good structural maintenance processes

00:20:48.560 --> 00:21:00.320
 so you get a parent normal blood sugar in the normal range but at the expense of breaking

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:07.760
 down your muscles and skin too fast makes complete sense so that that's actually the

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:13.160
 low thyroid that actually leads to the issues with adrenaline and cortisol and so with regard

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:19.680
 to stress what are some of the biggest stressors in our lives that might be the initial cause

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:35.480
 of low thyroid? In the healthy person you can do an intense exercise session you can run

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:43.480
 maybe half a block and have no production of lactic acid at all but there's a threshold

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:53.320
 the more you use your oxygen increase your energy production rate you will find a level

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:59.720
 at which you have used your oxygen too fast and you start producing lactic acid and the

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:09.160
 lactic acid causes these tissue damaging cortisol increasing effects so the lactate threshold

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:20.440
 in the good athlete is very high they can run a long distance or perform many weight

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:30.760
 lifts before increasing the lactic acid production so that's a very safe kind of exercise activity

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:41.640
 where you don't reach the lactate threshold but a hypothyroid person the worse your thyroid

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:53.520
 status is the worse your oxygen metabolism is and the closer you are to the lactate threshold

00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:06.800
 until just sitting still a hypothyroid person will have increased lactic acid so when you

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.400
 hyperventilate if you're a normal person sit still and breathe as fast as they can for

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:21.800
 a minute they're going to blow out so much carbon dioxide by that over breathing but

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:29.480
 the lack of carbon dioxide creates a hypothyroid imitating condition in which you produce lactic

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:42.280
 acid but a person on the borderline of hypothyroidism is at rest is in effect hyperventilating they're

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:51.240
 at their lactate threshold and then any further activity is going to just increase the lactic

00:23:51.240 --> 00:24:02.080
 acid and further increase the cortisol and destructive processes and fairly recently

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:14.680
 people have realized that serotonin increases with a stressful exercise and it's the signal

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:21.600
 directly that activates the pituitary gland turning on the adrenals to produce cortisol

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:36.680
 and so the serotonin is now recognized as a signal of fatigue and also something associated

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:46.840
 with hypothyroidism the excess pain signaling and fatigue signaling a function of serotonin

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.760
 goes with hypothyroidism.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:56.160
 Wow so the low energy that a lot of people feel on hypothyroid if they are high low thyroid

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.560
 could actually be high serotonin right?

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.560
 Yeah.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.280
 That's so interesting see no one talks about serotonin being a negative you know you always

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:10.000
 hear it being a positive and so it's neat to hear a doctor actually saying you know we

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.240
 need to really be careful with how much we're elevating our serotonin.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:25.440
 It increases the corticotropin release hormone which then turns on ACTH which then turns

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:35.680
 on the adrenal stress hormones and serotonin is right at the heart of our stress system.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.320
 And so with so many people running on adrenaline and high stress and they already might be

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.280
 low thyroid and having this high serotonin what happens when they're running on adrenaline

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.120
 you know they're not sleeping and even from my understanding low thyroid causes sleeping

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.240
 issues too so when you're not sleeping what's this vicious circle here that we're talking

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.240
 about?

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:05.520
 Some of the people early sleep studies where they monitored brainwaves and could define

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:14.320
 the different levels of sleep found that hypothyroid people never got below the second level of

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:25.640
 sleep never reached deep recurting sleep and so hypothyroidism very often involves difficulty

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:33.960
 getting to sleep but almost by definition it involves inadequate quality of sleep waking

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:46.560
 up feeling unrested often with pain that are worse in the morning before any activity than

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.560
 there were bedtime.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.800
 So which is hard to sleep a lot of people sleep with their cell phones right by their

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.760
 head or they get up in the night if they can't sleep let's say they are low thyroid and they

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.120
 flick their phone on to play games or whatever to go on Facebook or whatever and so the blue

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.360
 light is blasting in their face are they doing themselves any favors as far as their thyroid

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.960
 when they are exposed to EMF radiation and blue light constantly?

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:21.680
 I think almost any stimulus but especially a random cell activating thing like a cell

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:31.040
 phone for a few days I would get insomnia hard to go to sleep and I found that taking

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:38.920
 a very small amount of T3 would put me right to sleep five or ten minutes after taking

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:49.280
 10 micrograms and on one of my trips I was going to speak at a conference sponsored by

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:56.880
 a doctor and the day before I got there I saw him and he said he hadn't slept for three

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:03.520
 or four nights and was just in a desperate condition and I told him my experience and

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:12.800
 gave him some 10 microgram acetamol tablets and the next day as I went to the conference

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:21.220
 before he let me talk he pulled me aside and said that stuff is better than morphine.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:28.720
 And so how does that relate to the as far as like the EMF are we depleting ourselves

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.720
 with constant radiation and blue light is that what we are missing out on is that conversion

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.240
 to T3 is that where it's coming from?

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:48.280
 Yeah if you keep in mind that the thyroid lets you get into the deepest layer of sleep

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:56.520
 the muscle physiology is very analogous to the brain physiology and an old way of diagnosing

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:04.480
 hypothyroidism was to have a person kneel on a chair so their toes hung down freely and

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:11.400
 then something on the achilles tendon triggers a reflex of the muscle in the calf and it

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:21.920
 makes the toes jerk out and then fall back the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is when the

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:29.360
 relaxation phase where the toes fall back into the relaxed position is retarded so it

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:37.800
 looks like there is a pneumatic door closure on a healthy reflex the toe jumps out and

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:44.920
 bounces back just like a loose piece of pork chop hanging there it bounces and sways but

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:55.720
 a hypothyroidism a person relaxes very slowly so that it comes back in little notchy movements

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:02.400
 exactly to where it stopped and might take half a second of this slow relaxation the

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:11.080
 brain is the same way it's very slow to relax in hypothyroidism it takes energy to relax

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:19.480
 the muscle ATP has to be regenerated same in the brain it takes regeneration of ATP

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:27.960
 to relax the brain and in the absence of thyroid the brain simply can't get up enough energy

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:36.200
 to relax and go to sleep and I would say the radiation from the devices and the electromagnetic

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:43.560
 radiation is probably blocking that as well the brain the cells are staying in a semi

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:52.680
 excited state so they are more sensitive to any kind of stimulation and the people who

00:30:52.680 --> 00:31:00.540
 are extremely sensitive to stimulation such as a cell phone are the ones who are hypothyroid

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:07.920
 their cells are already half stimulated they can't reach a deeply relaxed condition it

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.440
 makes sense because if your body is on high alert because there is a stressor because

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.720
 it's not functioning optimally because you're not functioning in an area that should be

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.060
 so critical to health which is your thyroid then it's almost like the body is resistant

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:29.680
 against shutting down or repairing or getting rid of anything it needs to get rid of in

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.440
 the night toxins and repairing tissues and things like that it's just not going to do

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:45.240
 that it's almost like it's just in survival mode is that right?

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:51.480
 The deep sleep restores and renews everything and the cortisol increase towards dawn is

00:31:51.480 --> 00:32:03.040
 greater when your energy production from thyroid activity is impaired and so your stress starts

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:14.440
 out at a higher level in the morning and the hypothyroid people often feel best at sunset

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:24.400
 because the light has helped restore steroid production to some extent and lower the cortisol

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.400
 so that kind of makes sense that there's so many studies on red light because red light

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.320
 closely matches the light of the sunset that there are so many studies saying that red

00:32:33.320 --> 00:33:03.240
 light is actually beneficial to the thyroid.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:15.000
 Because the oxygen isn't withdrawing electrons the cell stays in a reductive condition too

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:28.080
 many electrons not enough oxygen and that is coincident with the excitability for example

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:43.760
 to glutathione in a well oxidized cell should form the disulfide bonds associating proteins

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:52.160
 with glutathione and glutathione to some extent with itself and binding proteins into a stable

00:33:52.160 --> 00:34:03.880
 condition and when your thyroid can't withdraw the electrons completely your cell has a highly

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:16.800
 reduced state with too much pre-reduced glutathione and if that becomes chronic this state of

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:26.880
 chronic excitation leads to all of the degenerative diseases ultimately cancer which is an ultimate

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:37.560
 failure of the cells to relax and reach the reparative high energy state oxidation fails

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:46.080
 chronically in cancer cells and all of the other degenerative conditions involve some

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:54.960
 degree of the same over reduced under oxidized energy failure process all of which would

00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:01.120
 be preventable by keeping your thyroid function proper.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.960
 You reminded me of the fact that the liver is actually really important when it comes

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.840
 to the thyroid and hormone conversion and so when you said glutathione it reminded me

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:17.160
 like we probably need to let listeners know like how important the liver is to the thyroid

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:23.280
 can you talk about that?

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:32.320
 In the 1940s when soldiers were coming back after being in prison camps and on a starvation

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:42.220
 diet for a year or two many of them when they started eating enough many of them developed

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:51.560
 breasts and this led doctors to investigate why these formerly starved soldiers suddenly

00:35:51.560 --> 00:36:00.320
 started growing breasts when they ate a good diet and they found that starvation stops

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:08.940
 the liver from excreting estrogen same thing can happen in various liver diseases but

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:21.040
 starvation is the basic thing that prevents the liver from detoxifying things and estrogen

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:27.440
 is active in such extremely small amounts that it's the first thing you usually see

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:37.280
 when the liver function slows down and when the liver is not able to attach either glucuronic

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:44.520
 acid or sulfuric acid to the estrogen molecule letting it become water soluble and leave

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:53.200
 the body either in the bile or urine it quickly accumulates to an excess and at the same time

00:36:53.200 --> 00:37:03.960
 the liver has started letting estrogen stay in the body the low energy is also decreasing

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:12.200
 the ability to metabolize cholesterol and you can't make progesterone and DHEA and the

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:25.600
 protective steroids which counteract estrogen testosterone and DHEA fall as the estrogen

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:36.440
 increases when something has damaged its liver any kind of injury sickness or traumatic injury

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:44.640
 that sends a man to a hospital when they give a blood test they will often find his estrogen

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:50.640
 level is two or three times or more higher than normal even higher than the woman's normal

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:58.740
 estrogen level just because stress of any kind is likely to stop that liver function

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:08.340
 from getting rid of estrogen and as estrogen accumulates it blocks all of the thyroid functions

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:17.280
 and since the thyroid is necessary to activate the liver to excrete estrogen then trauma

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:26.200
 can set up a chronic hypothyroid state and glandular failure organ failure and so on.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.600
 This is so good and what I learned from you is that the thyroid and the liver work in

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.320
 tandem together as far as the T4 to T3 conversion has to happen with the liver and only if you

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.400
 have enough glycogen or you're getting enough glucose and that would stand to reason like

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:48.160
 when you said the starvation diet is similar to what people are doing today this intermittent

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.880
 fasting or days and days of fasting and they think they're doing their body a service but

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.480
 really they're slowing down their thyroid or they're at least harming their conversion.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.320
 Can you talk about that?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:12.640
 Yeah many diet studies have found that you oxidize fat at a high rate the first in some

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:18.840
 people the first 12 hours and some people the first 24 hours you keep oxidizing fat

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:26.840
 when you go on a starvation diet and lose fat for maybe your first day but at some point

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:34.780
 you have depleted your stored glycogen and that blocks the formation of the active T3

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:45.080
 thyroid hormone and from that point on you're relying for energy to an increase extent on

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:53.720
 the breakdown of tissue protein turning it into fat and so a more or less starvation

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:04.000
 diet that goes on for a week or two will I think it's about 80% of your weight loss is

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.080
 in the form of muscle loss and very little maybe 20% in the form of fat loss but if you

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:20.720
 eat enough sugar and have the minerals such as in fruit and keep a slight protein intake

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:30.400
 the small amount of sugar will prevent the breakdown of protein issues and a 10 to 14

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:39.920
 day diet in this case will cause you to lose maybe 80% fat and only 20% muscle.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:47.440
 So a starvation diet after the first 12 to 24 hours is turning off your thyroid, turning

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.800
 on the destructive tissue breakdown.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:41:00.120
 In one experiment people were put on a treadmill and the killed of the treadmill was adjusted

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:10.200
 so that they kept a steady heart rate of no faster than 120 beats per minute just like

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:19.680
 you were walking down the street and they had blood tests at intervals and almost everyone

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:30.920
 stopped producing T3 in the first hour of that mild exercise so when your T3 is turned

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:41.200
 off whether it's by starvation or by excess activity that's the point of which you start

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.760
 breaking down protein issues.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.480
 Okay, so you heard it here folks we don't want to go without some sugar so you actually

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.920
 can have sugar and actually have a really well functioning thyroid and I want to talk

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:58.840
 about the fact that when you had mentioned that you had supplemented with T3 so obviously

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:04.320
 and I've heard you say many times that you really feel like natural thyroid medication

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.080
 would benefit most people and so I wanted you to touch on just exactly like how would

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.640
 you go about telling someone to begin supplementing if they think they have low thyroid but their

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.680
 doctor's not really doing anything about it.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:26.520
 I think everyone who thinks about that as a possibility should read Bruno Barnes' book

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:37.040
 Hypothyroidism the Unsuspected Illness or his other book on preventing heart attacks.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:44.480
 In this whole career he didn't have any patient style of heart attacks or he should have had

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:52.720
 I think he said more than a thousand from the number of patients that he had he basically

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:58.600
 prevented all of the heart attacks in his patients by giving them an appropriate amount

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:05.680
 of thyroid and most of his people in the long run were getting two grains of armored thyroid

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:14.580
 he would start them on usually half a grain 30 milligrams and watch their temperature

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:21.520
 over the first several weeks and if their temperature didn't rise to normal it would

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:28.640
 then add another half grain and it took him typically several months to find exactly the

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:36.100
 right dose for each patient but most of them would need around two grains.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.240
 I'm glad you mentioned temperature that's something really easy that a lot of people

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.920
 listening could do is if they suspect they might have low thyroid they could take their

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.880
 temperature right and that will tell them if their body is running a little cooler than

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.920
 it should be that means that thyroid is not functioning right?

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:59.480
 Yeah and Broda Barnes worked in Colorado Springs Colorado where you seldom have hot and humid

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:10.320
 weather and one hot and humid summer in Ukraine I noticed obviously hypothyroid people coming

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:22.000
 in with a normal temperature and I realized that a dead person in Florida can maintain

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:33.560
 a normal temperature if the environment is at 98 degrees and humid then a potato will

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.520
 maintain adequate body temperature so you have to look at other signs if the weather

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:46.000
 is humid or if they sleep with an electric blanket or anything artificial.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:55.760
 So the pulse rate is another thing that helps to interpret when you're very hypothyroid

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:02.320
 the adrenaline is the first thing to rise during the night when you use up your glycogen

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:11.200
 and then the cortisol increases and most people have their highest cortisol at dawn because

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:23.120
 the glycogen has been used up but if your temperature is below normal when you wake

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:33.160
 up everyone has a lower metabolic rate during the night so it's normal to be as much as

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:38.080
 eight tenths of a degree below normal when you wake up but it should rise right after

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:50.520
 breakfast and stay up around 98.6 until around sunset but I saw that besides the low temperature

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:58.680
 some people would have a very fast pulse when they first woke up because their adrenaline

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:09.640
 was high but the cortisol hadn't risen enough to slow down the adrenaline effect and a very

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:16.840
 fast pulse along with low temperature at waking is very common in hypothyroid people and the

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:25.000
 pulse should slow down to normal after breakfast but where the normal thing is for the metabolic

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.600
 rate to come back to normal when you eat breakfast and that brings up the pulse rate and the

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:38.560
 temperature in healthy people but the high adrenaline can cause an artificially rapid

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.880
 pulse in a hypothyroid person.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:47.520
 I felt that when I went through my hypothyroid spell like I remember hearing my heart beat

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.680
 very fast on my pillow so if people are feeling that in the night when they're laying down

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.160
 that's not normal also like cold hands and feet is not normal being cold all the time

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.400
 and having to carry a sweater everywhere that's not normal so those are some things people

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:17.520
 should watch out for yes.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.360
 So I want to touch on now the food aspect because I know at the very beginning you talked

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:27.200
 about how PUFA polyunsaturated fats are probably the biggest culprit when it comes to why we

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:32.200
 see so many thyroid problems but can you tell us what other than like crowding out the PUFA

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.640
 is what does a healthy diet for the thyroid look like and how often should one eat you

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:42.560
 know can you talk about the dangers of those PUFA's even in small amounts and things like

00:47:42.560 --> 00:48:00.680
 that and I've mentioned that one of the effects of high estrogen low thyroid is the loss of

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:02.040
 sodium and when you lose sodium you increase L-basterone and L-basterone is closely connected

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:09.560
 to parathyroid hormone which is the regulator of calcium and so if you don't eat enough

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:15.040
 calcium you'll have high parathyroid hormone if you don't eat enough salt or can't retain

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:26.200
 it you will have high L-basterone and stress causes you to lose both sodium and calcium

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:36.440
 and it happens that L-basterone and parathyroid hormone both suppress mitochondrial oxidation

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:46.360
 the same effect as not enough thyroid hormone and so the low thyroid is failing to activate

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:57.480
 the mitochondria and its effects are increasing these two other hormones L-basterone and parathyroid

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:10.760
 hormone which activate which block the mitochondrial respiratory enzymes turn off energy production

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:18.360
 so that's three ways from this interaction that you're knocking out your productive use

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:29.440
 of oxygen and glucose so getting off calcium and sodium in your diet and the only way to

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:36.520
 tell the amount of sodium practically is whether you crave it women premenstrually very often

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:46.600
 have intense salt cravings and I've known many who avoided salt because of medical recommendations

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:54.440
 that eating salt raises blood pressure and so on but they would avoid salt and if anything

00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:02.600
 their water retention got worse that's because it's when you avoid salt you increase parathyroid

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:10.400
 hormone L-basterone and parathyroid hormone and those both work with hypothyroidism to

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:18.760
 turn off energy production so calcium is very important in a thyroid very pro-thyroid adding

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.720
 salt and sea salt probably is best with all the mineral content to your diet would be

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:29.360
 good and then crowding out the PUFA anything else like I know you're a big fan of saturated

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:41.280
 fats too saturated fats are they avoid many of the effects inflammatory effects of the

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:52.600
 polyunsaturated fats linoleic acid directly leads to forming arachidonic acid which its

00:50:52.600 --> 00:51:02.120
 mere presence leads to the formation of prostaglandins which have many pro-inflammatory effects including

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:11.640
 loss of bone calcium and so the rising adrenaline when your thyroid is low rising adrenaline

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:21.880
 liberates arachidonic acid which turns to prostaglandin which breaks down bone and makes

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:28.440
 you lose bone tissue and turns on the parathyroid hormone.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:35.640
 In our schooling we were told that linoleic acid and things like arachidonic acid and

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:40.040
 things like that that there's good prostaglandins there's bad you know there's two essential

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:44.640
 fats that you should really have and I'm hearing you say this and it's like counterintuitive

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.640
 to everything that I was told but yet yours makes so much logic sense when you when you

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:54.360
 break it down like that it makes so much sense why we wouldn't want to have those things.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:04.640
 Yeah just recently people are starting to look at the consequences of having the arachidonic

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:17.000
 acid prostaglandin rise as you accumulate fat with aging the brain gets more and more polyunsaturated

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:25.520
 fats and they're starting to look at the role of prostaglandin in Alzheimer's disease among

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:37.840
 other things the Alzheimer's brain has lots of spontaneous oxidation of fats into substances

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:47.600
 called isoprostanes and neuroprostanes which are spontaneous equivalents of the enzyme

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:56.320
 produced prostaglandins but they are made from both n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in the stressed

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:06.840
 brain and go with our increase in Alzheimer's disease and following the idea of essential

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:16.040
 fatty acids in the 60s people were told to eat more linoleic acid because it's an essential

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:23.360
 fatty acid when it was found that that was increasing both cancer and heart disease as

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:31.800
 the marketers turned to a fish oil type of n-3 but still those are accumulating in the

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:40.960
 tissues in the blood vessels leading to plaque formation in the brain leading to various

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.880
 kinds of under functioning of the brain tissue.

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.520
 So you've heard it here folks you don't need to take a fish oil pill you can eat sugar

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.640
 and you want to make sure that you get rid of the ones they are calling the essential

00:53:54.640 --> 00:54:01.040
 fatty acids like linoleic acid instead you can eat a really awesome pro-thyroid diet

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:09.680
 of things like cheese and milk and good seafood and you know well cooked vegetables occasionally

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.920
 and getting some good starches from your fruits yes Dr. Pete?

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:25.040
 Yes, keeping the ratio of calcium to phosphate high enough is an important part of keeping

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:32.360
 things in balance some Americans have five six or seven times as much phosphate in their

00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:41.600
 diet as calcium or you should have approximately equal amounts or maybe twice as much is safe

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:54.460
 but the high phosphate turns on pro-thyroid hormone and leads to the degenerative ultimately

00:54:54.460 --> 00:55:04.440
 cancer forming processes of turning off oxidative energy and compensating with lactic acid formation.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:10.120
 So avoiding too much like red meat would be it would help that balance like not eating

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.080
 just so much red meat and stuff like that.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:20.800
 Yeah, meat and beans are both very bad proteins because of their high phosphate.

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.840
 Moving on to lifestyle though what are some lifestyle changes we can make in order to

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:30.040
 improve the thyroid naturally like you mentioned the sunset you know being at the in that sunset

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:35.920
 light is red light something that would be beneficial for us to use daily or what other

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:42.560
 lifestyle things could we do as far as like habits we could adopt?

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:50.760
 Being outside as much as possible it is very important but the people who work outside

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:59.960
 ten hours a day cowboys and such have terrible skin on their face if they don't use a good

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:09.560
 hat the sunburn does age your skin but these people have a very low incidence of internal

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:18.200
 cancers, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bowel cancer and so on because the red light inactivates

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:29.560
 the free radicals or active electrons reduces inflammation while maintaining good circulation.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:34.760
 Yeah, I have to jump in here real quick because my husband works in the outside more than

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:41.200
 ten hours a day he owns his own lawn business and he will be glad to know that he is avoiding

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:46.760
 cancer by doing so and he has just to give a little plug to you he follows kind of your

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:53.400
 principles of eating and has lost 25 pounds since doing so so he enjoys his milk and orange

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.160
 juice in the morning.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:06.760
 One of the studies in the 1960 that the oil industry doesn't like to talk about they shave

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:13.400
 rabbits so that the sunlight hit their skin directly and they fed one the essential fatty

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:19.160
 acids the other they gave I forget whether it was butter or coconut oil but a high saturated

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:27.920
 fat diet and the ones on the so-called essential fatty acids the PUFA they got very wrinkly

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:35.080
 sun damaged skin the ones on the saturated fat had good skin despite the constant sunlight

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.080
 exposure.

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:41.800
 Wow, that's fantastic for people that want to know some natural skin care they could

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.400
 do they could just change the oils that they're eating from PUFA to saturated fat so that's

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:47.400
 good to know.

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:53.280
 As far as exercise I know you had mentioned that even that small bout of walking on a

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:57.800
 bit of an incline actually lowered thyroid so in your opinion what would you tell someone

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.560
 who is experiencing low thyroid and trying to correct it what would be the best form

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.920
 of exercise to help their thyroid and what would they want to avoid?

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:16.560
 Well having adequate carbohydrate when you set out and then again as soon as you finish

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:25.760
 like some fruit juice and milk before and after contains maybe some salty like athletes

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:33.600
 who take a spoonful of baking soda before exercise it's both the carbon dioxide released

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:42.040
 from it and the sodium both of them have an anti-stress, anti-lactate effect that make

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:47.120
 you return to normal more quickly.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.760
 That's a really good tip so even like kind of old school mentality I've heard it said

00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:57.080
 back when I was doing a lot of bodybuilding early on in 2000 it's like we always ate carbs

00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:01.320
 right before we worked out we always ate carbs right after so that kind of principle still

00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:06.500
 stands so this kind of brings me to as long as you still have a few more minutes Dr. Pete

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:10.760
 I have two listener questions that I wanted to go to because they were kind of really

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.160
 great questions.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:16.320
 The first one is and I guess I should ask you are you okay on time right now?

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.720
 Can we keep going?

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.720
 Okay great.

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:24.240
 He says can Dr. Pete explain the connection between thyroid and the autonomic nervous

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240
 system?

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:35.480
 You know the adrenaline connection is an important part of it.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:47.360
 The adrenaline compensates keeping your functions going despite being low thyroid and if you

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:57.200
 supplement with thyroid after having been hypothyroid for a while and having very high adrenaline

00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:04.560
 your first reaction to the supplement is to have an excessively high heart rate because

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:12.400
 the thyroid makes you sensitive to the adrenaline which is there so you experience the excess

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.080
 adrenaline and it takes a while to convince your autonomic nervous system to quiet down

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.640
 and let thyroid take care of it.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:31.680
 That usually takes a week or so to slowly increase the thyroid and reduce the excess adrenaline

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:39.600
 but the adrenaline itself has many protective functions if you don't have tissues loaded

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:46.160
 with polyunsaturated fats because a surge of adrenaline releases fatty acids and if

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:55.400
 they're unsaturated they start forming these spontaneous equivalents of prostaglandins

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.680
 as well as real prostaglandins and causing inflammation and degeneration.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:06.000
 If you release saturated fats they can't form those prodegenerative molecules.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.840
 I'm so glad you said that about the jitteriness or somebody who experiences that high adrenaline

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.800
 rush after taking a natural thyroid supplement because that happened to me and I've heard

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.720
 it happen to several other people and I kind of felt the same way like without knowing

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.880
 I kind of felt exactly what you were saying is well I have to kind of teach my body to

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.400
 get rid of this excess adrenaline and that's kind of what I portrayed to my clients is

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.360
 like keep taking it your body is going to get used to the actual feeling of having an

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.560
 adequate thyroid function.

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:51.720
 Yeah that's very common and because so many doctors think of thyroid as a speed equivalent

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:59.080
 people very often will stop using thyroid they become afraid of this overstimulated

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:05.120
 states or they should reach the point of relaxation.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.200
 Okay so that's great to know about the autonomic nervous system so that's a great question.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:15.560
 The next question, the final question was can you talk about carotenemia or keratinemia

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.520
 and how to resolve it when you're trying to recover the thyroid.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.600
 So I would assume this individual is talking about having kind of that yellowish skin or

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.360
 having too high of carotene.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:41.720
 Around 1940 people who were doing surgery sometimes saw that a woman's ovaries in hypothyroidism,

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:51.520
 the corpus luteum is named the yellow body because it normally has a yellow color.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:03:00.600
 They found that in hypothyroid women sometimes the corpus luteum was red rather than yellow

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:09.840
 because of the beta carotene which is red having reached such a high level in hypothyroidism

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:19.560
 and when it reaches such high levels it blocks progesterone production but leaves the accumulation

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.880
 of estrogen.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:35.080
 So you can't produce progesterone and progesterone is needed to produce DHEA and other steroids.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:43.440
 The whole cholesterol conversion process goes bad when you're poisoned with keratin and

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:51.720
 vitamin B12 is needed to break the keratin molecule into two vitamin A molecules.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:57.840
 So you have to make sure your vitamin B12 is adequate.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:07.560
 I saw one man who had a toxic level of keratin in his body and no detectable vitamin A in

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:16.960
 his blood when he took vitamin B12, I think it was just a week and he had a reversed blood

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:28.240
 test, high normal vitamin A and very low keratin as best as that because vitamin B12 deficiency

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:40.440
 necessarily blocks the formation of real vitamin A and the thyroid makes you need vitamin A

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:48.000
 because it's involved in the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone DHEA all of the

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:58.120
 steroids and as your metabolism rises you're using your cholesterol faster to make progesterone

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:09.660
 and that means that your cholesterol will be used, you'll cure your hypercholesterolemia

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:19.400
 at the same time you're curing your keratinemia if your thyroid is at a proper level and you're

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.200
 eating such that you have adequate vitamin B12.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:29.640
 That's so cool how the thyroid, you're healing the thyroid and you're healing so many other

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:35.040
 things at the same time so I think that brings us to a good stopping point Dr. Pete and this

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:37.520
 has been such a valuable podcast.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.480
 I think anyone and everyone will benefit from something in this podcast so you guys make

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:45.980
 sure and share it with anybody you know that's having some thyroid issues or you know someone

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.360
 that's dealing with low thyroid or hypothyroidism.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.160
 Dr. Pete, your newsletter is something all my listeners would also benefit from and the

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.600
 information you keep providing and it is worth the small cost of the newsletter so I really

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:03.120
 encourage my listeners to give back to Dr. Pete for his time and wealth of information

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:09.320
 and purchase his newsletter so Dr. Pete can you tell them how they can do that and how

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:32.400
 affordable it actually is?

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.760
 And it is worth every penny.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.360
 I have so enjoyed them and I think all of my listeners will too and it's just a great

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.360
 way to give back to you.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:44.580
 We so appreciate your time and your wealth of information so with that I will let you

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.620
 go today and I hope you will join me again for another podcast because I have so much

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:51.640
 more I want to ask you so thank you so much Dr. Pete.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640
 Okay, very good.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.640
 Thank you.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:07:08.680
 Alright, thanks you guys and we'll say bye for now.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.920
 Hey out there, I'm about to drop one more bit of knowledge about why you should drop

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920
 an app off.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.800
 So I have ripped open a packet of coconut oil here but I'm not going to eat it.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:22.960
 I am going to use it as a little natural moisturizer so you know how when you travel you don't

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.760
 want to take a whole lot especially nowadays they only let you take a carry on and if you're

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.440
 just going away for the weekend and you need some moisturizer and some sunscreen to take

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:35.080
 with you well guess what coconut oil is kind of nature's sunscreen.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.520
 So you pack one of these little bad boys with you and not only can you eat it but you can

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:44.840
 put it on your skin and it's nature's best sunscreen because it's a natural way to protect

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.600
 from the sun in a low-grade way so you can stay out all day get a little color and not

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.600
 get burnt.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.440
 Also, maybe after the gym you want to moisturize and then head to work you can use this.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:59.840
 Maybe you need to get a little dryness out of your hair this is a wonderful way to saturate

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.040
 the hair and really soothe the hair.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.320
 Pour it all over your head let it sit with a shower cap for a couple hours and then rinse

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.200
 it out and wash it and you're going to have really soft silky hair and your scalp will

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.200
 be soothed too.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.080
 If you have kind of itchy scalp coconut oil it's great for that.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.400
 There are so many great reasons to have a packet of coconut oil with you not just for

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.500
 eating but also for body and skincare purposes.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:24.440
 It works great as a base oil and a body oil.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.300
 So check out dropnfbomb.com and get some of these handy dandy little packets to keep with

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:32.900
 you even if you're not into eating it you're going to find it really beneficial to just

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.240
