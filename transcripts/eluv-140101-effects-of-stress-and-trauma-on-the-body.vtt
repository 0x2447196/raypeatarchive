WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 And you're listening to WMNF 88.5

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.560
 On your dial WMNF Tampa and this is the ultrasound show on every Thursday night

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.640
 From 11 to 1. My name is Elove and tonight we have special guests

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.080
 We're going to be speaking with Dr. Ray Peat who has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.960
 specialization physiology. He's taught at several universities including the Uni of Oregon and

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.860
 Montana State University and also the National College of Naturopathic Medicine and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.640
 Black College. He also conducts private nutritional counseling and today

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.200
 We're speaking with him about the effects of stress and trauma on the body

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.400
 Greetings and welcome to the ultrasound show

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.480
 Okay, so let's dive in

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.240
 Tonight's theme is really about how the body reacts to stress and trauma

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.360
 So let's first talk about day to day stress and what happens to the body and the brain

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.200
 physiologically

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320
 The first thing is that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.680
 If you're really healthy, you can meet challenges without

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.360
 experiencing

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.240
 Something that on cell you would have called stress

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.600
 For example

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 if you

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.640
 Are not very healthy

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 Just skipping a meal can put you in really serious stress, but a healthy person

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.280
 stores something like seven or eight ounces of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.720
 glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.640
 muscles and brain and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760
 since

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.640
 At rest muscles can burn

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.520
 primarily fatty acids

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.280
 Your brain is the main thing that consumes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.800
 Glucose so if you're

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.520
 More or less

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:17.880
 Inactive and relaxed you can easily go 12 to 15 hours without eating and without having any stress at all

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.560
 but if you're not able to store that much glycogen and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.160
 For example low thyroid people or people with a history of severe stress

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.720
 Aren't able to store very much glycogen and so

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.200
 When you run out of sugar whether it's from going

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.120
 All day without eating or because your liver isn't very efficient

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.440
 then if your body tries to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.440
 Increase the available

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.960
 glucose

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.560
 normally just

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.560
 Being awake makes enough

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.080
 Adrenaline to mobilize as much of the glucose from your stores as you need

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.880
 But when you run out of that stored sugar

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.080
 Your brain still requires

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.960
 sugar to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 function properly and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.480
 so

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.000
 Instead of just increasing the adrenaline more and more when the adrenaline

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.200
 Reaches a certain level and can't get the blood sugar up out of your storage

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.640
 Then you turn on the cortisol and that's the classic

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.600
 Stress that can be harmful because it the cortisol

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.400
 dissolves our first tissues like the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.160
 assignments which are very fragile

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600
 That starts turning to sugar

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.480
 just

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.520
 immediately when you run out of stored glycogen and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.760
 When the thymus is gone in just two or three hours of intense stress

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.960
 That happens to be one of the reasons they think adults

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.640
 don't have thymus glands because by the time they're dead and

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.640
 Are analyzed the thymus has been eaten up by stress

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.760
 So they might have had a perfectly normal thymus until they were sick and dead

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.160
 But after the thymus is consumed and turned to sugar then

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.680
 the cortisol starts breaking down your muscles and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.960
 then the skin and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.640
 the brain lungs and heart are spared from stress partly because they are

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.080
 very

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.320
 saturated

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.400
 in a healthy person with

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.120
 androgens testosterone and DHEA especially which block the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.120
 breakdown function of cortisol and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.680
 If your brain lungs and heart are short of those

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.760
 Protective steroids, then that's where the stress really starts

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.640
 causing

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.640
 severe deadly damage and

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.040
 The

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.040
 Post-traumatic stress disorder

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.320
 Is produced when someone has had such terrible stress such as being tortured or?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.920
 or being in

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.160
 terrific

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.760
 catastrophes

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.920
 They not only deplete their

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.960
 stored

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.480
 glycogen and break down the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.320
 expendable tissues like thymus and liver but

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.920
 Then the cortisol starts damaging the brain and heart and so on so they get

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.800
 very severe

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.880
 chronic symptoms and

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.040
 Once the stress is completely resolved then the brain can massively regenerate itself

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.880
 for example, they've seen MRIs of

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.760
 girls who had simply been

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.520
 in the anorexia for months their brain shrinks from the

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.400
 Living on the cortisol breaking down their tissues

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.400
 But once they start eating then the brain can rebuild itself in just a few weeks

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.560
 Now how often does one?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:31.400
 have to eat or is it required or recommended for one to eat in order to

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.040
 not have this

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.040
 stress reaction happen

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.520
 the

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.520
 famous Argentine

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:46.240
 biologist Bernardo who sighed in the 1940s I think he was the first one to show that

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.280
 If he fed his animals only once a day

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.240
 They not only tended to get fat on the same amount of calories, but they

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:02.440
 Had a high incidence of diabetes, but if he fed them at least three times a day or more

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:11.240
 Then they were very resistant to diabetes and were less fattened on a given number of calories

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.360
 so

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.840
 More or less nibbling all the time is the safest thing. But if you have a really good diet and

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.960
 aren't under emotional

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.160
 pressure

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.160
 Then the person can

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.360
 Get along on

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.520
 one or two meals a day

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.120
 Now let's talk about a really good diet

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:43.440
 What is a really good diet for the optimal health of the body the brain the heart all of the organs?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.720
 there's a lot of

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.800
 disputes and conversations about optimal diets

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.440
 Does it differ with different people or is there an overall?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.960
 Optimal and then there's little bits and pieces that different people with different blood types can do

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:07.320
 The blood type has almost no effect because you can see in a even very different

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.200
 species of

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.080
 animal

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.280
 That have very different ways of living you can see the same processes

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:23.480
 So there's a universal animal

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.440
 diet that is

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.560
 optimal but the proportions vary with the type of activity and your body size and

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.560
 Metabolic rate

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:45.440
 And personal history your previous stresses will affect what you need

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:53.640
 So let's talk about someone who perhaps is not that healthy and that does have stress which is quite common

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.280
 What would be the recommended?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.360
 Diet for them. What's some of the things that they can eat?

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:06.240
 One of the reasons that the single meal eaters tend to get fat and diabetic

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:14.160
 Is that it triggers a great surge of insulin and the insulin then triggers?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:20.960
 Cortisol and so if you can eat foods that don't trigger insulin

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.960
 that's the ideal thing and

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.680
 fruit happens to be the

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.680
 best single type of food

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.120
 for not triggering the stress reaction because

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:41.040
 It combines very small amounts of protein with large amounts of sugar and the minerals

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.840
 Potassium happens to

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.080
 handle the sugar in place of insulin and

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.720
 the fructose

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.200
 component of

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.040
 fruit sugar

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.040
 Doesn't require insulin

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.120
 so

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.600
 Eating a lot of fruit even in one meal a day

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:09.720
 produces a much smaller amount of insulin obesity and cortisol

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.520
 than eating for example

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.160
 just one big meal of

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.000
 meat and potatoes for example

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.920
 meat powerfully stimulates insulin and cortisol and

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.200
 starches are more

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.720
 stimulating to insulin than sugars

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.040
 So it's almost counterintuitive when you're talking about

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:41.160
 Taking in fructose in the form of fruit with people that are insulin sensitive

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.240
 Well for about a hundred years

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.960
 fructose has been

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.160
 recognized as the ideal sugar for diabetics because they can metabolize it

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.960
 without needing

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.760
 insulin

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.960
 It used to be sold in

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:07.240
 Health food stores all across the country and you can still find it in in most health food stores for diabetics

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.400
 now let's

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.240
 talk about high fructose corn syrup and the difference between

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.840
 fructose from fruit

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.080
 The funny thing about that is that if you look at the

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.720
 fructose and glucose

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.640
 content it

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.000
 Seems to be not very different from any old sugar maybe

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.800
 45 55 percent

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.200
 Rather than a exact 50/50 balance for toast and glucose

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.920
 but people

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.960
 actually thought to

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.200
 Analyze what is in the stuff other than?

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.440
 fructose and glucose

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.400
 It turns out that the reason people get fat on

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:58.760
 Soft drinks that contain it is that it contains a huge amount of calories

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.480
 That are neither

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.160
 glucose nor fructose

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.400
 It's the syrupy component basically a type of corn starch or corn syrup

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.960
 which

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.400
 They don't count it because it isn't fructose or glucose, but it's there as calories

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:23.160
 Now they're using this in so many different things from salad dressings to soft drinks

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:28.920
 Yeah, it was a trick because of the

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.560
 boycott of Cuban sugar starting in the

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.240
 60s

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.160
 The price of sugar went up because they wouldn't buy it from where it was cheap

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:47.600
 so the corn starch producers have learned how to

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.040
 produce something resembling sugar and

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.680
 It's really like the old kerosene syrup, which was

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:03.440
 Not a very appetizing way to sweeten things, but during the Second World War

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.400
 The I think the Germans pioneered it but in the United States

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.680
 Sugar was scarce and the corn syrup

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.600
 started being used in

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.600
 canned things and even

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.880
 in homes as a substitute for sugar

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.680
 but the

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.560
 Sweeter

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:37.560
 form more palatable form that they call high fructose corn syrup was developed in the 60s in response to the

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.480
 increased price of sugar

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.680
 It's amazing. They've done similar things with oils too

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:50.320
 in using oils that are quite toxic in our foods

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.720
 Yeah

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.800
 cottonseed industry

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.120
 was a major

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.760
 power behind that way back in the end of the

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.440
 1800s

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.440
 the

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:11.560
 Gin of to make cotton textiles

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:18.160
 More more economical they had machines to get the seeds out of the cotton and

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:27.400
 In proportion to the production of cotton they were accumulating seeds that were too toxic to feed to animals and

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.840
 They found that they could squeeze oil out of the cottonseed and

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:40.640
 By chemically hardening it they could sell it as artificial butter and

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:46.000
 The butter industry finally

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.560
 They were

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.520
 for I guess about 20 years required to

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.360
 sell it in a

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.320
 Colorless state and the person had to add color so that it wouldn't ruin the the butter industry, but

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.680
 the seed

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.320
 industry seed oil industry gradually got powerful enough that they could

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:13.520
 Convince people that's better than butter

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:21.880
 But in fact it has many toxic effects that butter doesn't have is this the same as rapeseed oil?

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.560
 The first rapeseed oil

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.800
 happened to cause

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.120
 severe heart disease and

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.600
 the industry wanted to sell it for margarine and cooking oil and so on and

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:45.560
 There was a particular oil in that plant that they decided to blame

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.400
 the heart

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.840
 injury on

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.840
 but Han Selly

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.240
 Did experiments

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.880
 studying the the type of lesion in the heart produced by

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:05.880
 Rapeseed oil and he found that it was the linoleic acid in it

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.400
 Which is still in it they took out the?

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.120
 peculiar

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.840
 unusual fatty acid but

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.960
 the

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.280
 essential fatty acid linoleic acid is it's heart toxic and

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.480
 Han Selly showed that if you added cocoa butter

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.080
 Highly saturated stearic acid

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:36.680
 To the rapeseed oil it no longer caused death of the heart cells

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.640
 So it's just the excess of polyunsaturated

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.080
 fat that made the

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:50.600
 Rapeseed oil or canola or cottonseed oil all of those

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.720
 are

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.360
 Actually toxic if you eat very much of it. What about soybean oil because they're all GMO now

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.760
 Yeah

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.760
 It's still the polyunsaturated

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.640
 component which is and it turns into

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:17.640
 Prostaglandins which promote all kinds of inflammation and degenerative diseases as early as

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.040
 1964 I

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.440
 Think he was a Dutch researcher named Betcher

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.280
 Sliced opened the

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.960
 lesions in

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.960
 atherosclerotic arteries

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.240
 at all different stages of development and

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.160
 analyzed the fats in them and he saw that

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.120
 He called it a

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.280
 primitive idea that cholesterol

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.560
 got

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:57.360
 Diffused out of the blood into the artery and damaged it. He said that the situation is very different from that and

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.440
 many fats

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:08.400
 change at the beginning before the change happens in the cholesterol and in the most advanced

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.000
 lesions the farthest advanced

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.840
 Atherosclerosis he found that the

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720
 content of linoleic acid

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.560
 was highest the worst the lesion and

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.280
 after that many other people demonstrated that the

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:34.160
 Oxidation products of these unstable highly unsaturated fats

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.360
 are found increasingly in the

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.040
 atherosclerosis

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.080
 It's very interesting to me that

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.120
 things like

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:49.600
 These different seed oils canola oil soybean oil high fructose corn syrup

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.520
 butter substitutes all of these things are being advertised as better for your health and

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.400
 It's really about the consumers

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.240
 Self-educating themselves and looking beyond the advertising

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.520
 Yeah, it's um they have to think of some

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.000
 excuse for

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.880
 Claiming that people should buy them because they don't taste good

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.520
 and so the idea that

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.480
 if they are essential

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.680
 in some sense

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.080
 Then the more you eat the better they are but in fact

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:34.520
 It's very questionable whether they're essential as a nutrient at all

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.280
 animals can live

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:44.240
 More or less indefinitely you can grow cells forever in the dish without any of those

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.040
 which I

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.520
 Think that alone proves that they're not essential nutrients and the more

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.320
 You increase in the diet

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.040
 There's a direct

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:06.280
 relationship with the incidence of spontaneous cancer in proportion to the essential fatty acids so called and

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:14.480
 That was first demonstrated in 1927 and over and over but the industry

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.360
 keeps

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.080
 Publicizing them as a health food

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.080
 Well that's

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.840
 That's the way it's been for many many years and it'll probably continue

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:36.120
 Although I think people are becoming more aware and being more conscious and really trying to seek out

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.440
 different dietary options and

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.760
 Going back to the roots has been a big surgence of

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.320
 Grass-fed beef for example

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.040
 Yeah

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.480
 beyond fruits in the ideal diet

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.360
 the

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.360
 ruminants are

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.320
 able to

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.680
 detoxify the polyunsaturated fats in grains or grasses and

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.320
 It happens to be vitamin E in the grass

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.160
 which

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.920
 enables them to

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.880
 convert

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:19.600
 polyunsaturated linoleic acid into the trans fatty acids and the

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.680
 there's one of the

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:28.160
 Components of butter or beef fat that is being sold as a drug or a health food

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:36.000
 Because it counteracts the toxic effects of the polyunsaturated fats. That's called the conjugated

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.320
 linoleic acid

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:43.760
 and you get some of that in beef butter cheese and milk and

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.680
 The

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.400
 High

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.360
 Ratio of calcium to phosphate in butter and cheese

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.840
 comes from the fact that

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.760
 green leaves if the cows are allowed to

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.480
 Eat at least some

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.920
 hay and and grass

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.080
 the

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.920
 Leaves

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.920
 contain a

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.720
 low amount of phosphate and a high amount of magnesium calcium and other

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.520
 safe minerals

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.520
 too much phosphate which

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.480
 You would get on a grain based and meat based diet mostly

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.320
 the phosphate becomes toxic when it isn't balanced by at least as much calcium and

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.520
 other minerals including magnesium and

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.480
 So milk and fruit and cheese give you the

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.800
 main

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.640
 nutrients and

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.560
 Then there are just the the regionally

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.480
 deficient

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.480
 things such as iodine and selenium

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.240
 That if you eat some kind of seafood

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.920
 Then you're getting the the basic things for

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.000
 anti-stress foods

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.600
 So for vegetarians, would you say that it's a little more difficult

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.120
 Because they're not eating these products

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.240
 Yeah, but the if you

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.880
 concentrate on well-cooked greens

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:32.080
 The protein and mineral balance in cooked green leafy vegetables

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.840
 those are

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.840
 Essentially the same as in milk

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.040
 It's just less concentrated because of the high cellulose

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.960
 diluting it but

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.560
 if you can

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.800
 Cook away or wash away or skim away

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.880
 the

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:59.480
 Antinutrients for example too much spinach contains oxalic acid that

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.880
 tends to take the calcium out of your teeth and

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.680
 Some leafy vegetables

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.840
 Have

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.720
 Chemicals that block your

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.800
 Stomach digestive enzymes, but a

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.040
 variety of cooked greens will provide

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:27.600
 the same type of protein that milk provides as well as the

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.440
 very favorable balance of

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:36.080
 magnesium potassium and calcium in relation to phosphate

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:43.240
 So aside from the spinach what other vegetables would be better off cooked as opposed to raw and do you?

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:50.400
 Advocate any raw foods or raw salads in the mix on the very juicy

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:57.880
 Fruits are best raw, but if they're starchy like bananas or plantains

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.480
 They should be cooked by preference

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.560
 because the

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.400
 the starches

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:11.640
 Can enter the bloodstream and trigger allergic reactions and too much

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.280
 undercooked starch

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.680
 It's called persarpen the particles enter the bloodstream and

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.760
 can block

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.920
 capillaries and arterioles

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.080
 causing cells to die until

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.520
 the

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:34.080
 The particle can be broken down, but it can stay in place long enough to kill

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.040
 cells in the heart and brain and lungs

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.520
 Feeding mice on a very high

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.640
 raw starch diet

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.080
 Biologists in in Germany found that

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.360
 they were very prematurely aged because of the

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:59.240
 Death of cells in all of their organs that were blocked by starch grains

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:07.560
 So on starch like potatoes are almost a perfect food if they're very well cooked

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.680
 because you want to break down the starch and

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.520
 the

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.320
 Non starch ingredients of a potato

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.080
 Have almost a perfect balance of nutrients

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.760
 B vitamins

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.960
 The essential amino acids

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.400
 Carbohydrate in the right proportion and

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.400
 The only things lacking in a pure potato diet would be vitamin A and

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.760
 vitamin B12

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:51.560
 Otherwise, they're a very balanced food. Are you speaking about sweet potatoes or white potatoes?

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.440
 The

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.760
 Some white potatoes so called contain

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.560
 enough carotene that

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.600
 that could provide

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.360
 the requirement of vitamin A but

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:12.560
 sweet potatoes often contain so much carotene that it interferes with digestion and

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:21.320
 Too much carotene has anti hormonal effects that can slow down your production of thyroid hormones

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.040
 Progesterone

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.040
 Adrenal hormones and so on

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.560
 If it accumulates to the point that it's making your

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.280
 palms turn orange

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.960
 Which it does with some people who are juicing carrots a lot

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.560
 Yeah, I

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:47.840
 Constantly warn people about that. There are good chemicals in the juice good nutrition, but unless your thyroid is

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.960
 pretty active it's going to accumulate the carotene because

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.680
 you

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.800
 convert carotene to vitamin A if you have vitamin B12 in

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.920
 proportion to how active your thyroid hormone is and

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.040
 if for some reason

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:16.160
 You're getting more carotene than your vitamin B12 and thyroid can handle

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.000
 Then it turns off the thyroid function. I

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.360
 Experienced that myself

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.520
 about 40 years ago

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.960
 Eating

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.960
 so many carrots that I

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.440
 Suppressed my thyroid

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:39.200
 But if your thyroid is good, then having a whole carrot every day has some very

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.000
 important anti stress

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.720
 functions

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:49.000
 yesterday I heard from a woman who said that she had started a daily carrot salad and

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.720
 Had almost immediate relief from all of her

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.000
 premenstrual and digestive problems

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.560
 And we've measured the

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:08.680
 blood hormones in a few people after they started a daily whole carrot and

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:18.560
 It's the stimulating effect on the intestine the fiber in the carrot isn't digestible and so the

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.400
 excretion of the bile into the liver

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.440
 carries all kinds of detoxified

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.080
 chemicals and hormones

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.120
 that if you have a

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.360
 fiber in your intestine

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:41.000
 These toxins that the liver has got rid of will be carried out bound to the carrot fiber

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 but without enough fiber they can be reabsorbed and recycled and so your

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 estrogen tends to go up as the fiber in your diet goes down and

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.720
 That in turn turns off your your thyroid and progesterone

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.360
 so it can cause

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.360
 all the symptoms of

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.720
 estrogen and cortisol excess and

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.840
 In just three or four days we've seen the

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.840
 cortisol and estrogen level in the blood

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:22.440
 Drop as the progesterone comes up just from eating a daily carrot

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:29.040
 It's so interesting how the food that we eat influences everything about our body

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.160
 Yeah

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.340
 Lots of people partly because of a bad

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:44.600
 Industrialized diet I think lots of Americans are now going around in a chronically stressed

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.040
 Condition it's sort of like learned

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.920
 helplessness or post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.840
 that the diet

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.920
 keeps people in a high cortisol high estrogen state and

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:09.320
 That's something that if you're going to have any stress you should

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.760
 Well before you have to do any important work

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.240
 you should

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.240
 Make sure that your diet isn't

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.920
 creating the stress day by day and

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.080
 for example

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.860
 checking your thyroid function just by

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.440
 measuring your temperature and pulse rate when you wake up and

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.280
 Then in the middle of the day your they should rise

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.440
 so that your pulse is maybe 80 per minute at rest and your

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.960
 Temperature should be around ninety eight point six at rest

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.000
 Yeah in the morning. It's okay for them to be

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.520
 about ten percent

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.520
 lower pulse rate and

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.160
 maybe

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.160
 97.8 degrees or so

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.280
 Now

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:11.480
 This can also be influencing the fact that men are having hormonal issues as well, correct

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.280
 Who having

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:22.920
 In in other words the food that that both men and women are eating men are also having hormonal issues

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.680
 It's not only women

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.760
 Yeah

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.240
 When a man is on a very bad diet or is under stress or has an accident the

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.200
 estrogen level rises

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.720
 sharply

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.720
 and in the old age

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.400
 with any of the degenerative diseases

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.840
 men tend to

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.840
 have a sharp increase in

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.320
 Estrogen

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.400
 So they can avoid this or monitor this by their diet

00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:00.680
 Yeah, and your temperature is is the quickest way because

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:06.200
 Estrogen lowers your temperature thyroid and progesterone and DHEA

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.880
 help to maintain a

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.760
 good steady

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.280
 high metabolic rate even at rest

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.600
 So when people get cold when they're sitting there in front of their desk or or at home

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:26.580
 Then that may indicate that the hormones have changed and the thyroid is dropping

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.720
 Yeah, and one of the tricks of the body

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.200
 through

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.080
 increasing the

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.760
 adrenaline can compensate for hypothyroidism and

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.240
 so some people are are

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.760
 hyper alert and anxious

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:51.200
 and have a high heart rate even though their thyroid is is really low and

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.720
 Their temperature can be

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.080
 held up and look normal

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:03.480
 Except that it's likely to be higher when you first wake up in the morning and then decrease

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.760
 When you eat something so it switches

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:14.680
 Yeah, because the nighttime is when you aren't eating and your adrenaline and cortisol rise

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.760
 Those can tear down your tissues

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:23.680
 At such a rate that they keep your temperature up then when you eat something and lower the stress

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.080
 you see that your

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.040
 metabolism is really not so high and

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.920
 When the adrenaline is very high

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.480
 Even though your oral temperature might seem normal your hands and feet will be cold

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.520
 And maybe the tip of your nose even

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.360
 because the body is

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:52.560
 Directing the energy so that your brain lungs and heart aren't deprived or chilled

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.360
 but

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.360
 your body cannot

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:01.480
 Consider your hands and feet somewhat expendable and let them get very cold

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:09.440
 so if we up the stress levels, and we've been speaking mostly about general stress and

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.240
 someone does have a

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.400
 particular experience or if they have a surgery

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:24.560
 Then there's additional chemical changes, or there's more severe chemical changes some of the symptoms in post-surgery

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.000
 can include

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.360
 low energy or weight gain or hormonal changes or even depression and sleep disorders and

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.960
 even dementia

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.200
 Lately they've been measuring mental function

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.320
 after major surgery and

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.600
 for months even years after major surgery

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.280
 people's mental function is

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.320
 often

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.840
 slowed down

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.120
 That's because of the chronic effect of cortisol

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.040
 which

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.880
 slows nerve conduction it protects

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.600
 your some of your tissues from inflammation

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.480
 but it

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.640
 progressively

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.200
 damages your immune system and your

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.080
 nervous system

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.560
 So what would be the best way for recovery?

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.920
 And what are some of the things that people can do for recovery?

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.440
 Specifically no in terms of

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.920
 general diet specific things or

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.560
 your advice in general

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.800
 the

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:44.440
 thing about surgery as opposed to a car accident or or being tortured or something

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.960
 is that

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.960
 you can prepare for it and

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:54.440
 Even the standard medical sources are now

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.120
 saying that you should check

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:02.560
 thyroid function before you schedule someone for surgery because a

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.240
 hypothyroid person

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.560
 Doesn't do well in surgery because their cortisol is already high

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:15.760
 The before Hans Zellye made stress famous

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.440
 an American

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.560
 surgeon

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.680
 George Kryol in Cleveland

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.200
 hundred over a hundred years ago was studying a

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.760
 shock from surgery and

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.560
 What you had to do to minimize?

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.320
 the shock and

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.840
 Shock as he understood it

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.600
 came to be part of

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.840
 shock and stress as Hans Zellye

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.840
 interpreted it and

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.680
 for Zellye

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.680
 an excess of

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.040
 Estrogen was enough to create the whole shock syndrome and

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.120
 George Kryol

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.520
 In in the hospital in Cleveland that he worked at in

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.800
 1908 the

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.400
 mortality rate from all their surgeries was

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.400
 4.4 percent

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.680
 and

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.080
 After he devised a way to reduce stress

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.320
 in five years of

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:25.800
 application it had cut the mortality to 1.8 percent and

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.960
 His basic procedure was to

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:39.640
 Convince the brain that nothing had happened. He called it an "annosy association"

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.040
 meaning

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.720
 getting the

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.720
 brain to

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.480
 Not notice the the noxious

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.920
 events and

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.960
 he

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.400
 found that histamine was

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.280
 released by morphine

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:04.080
 When it was used to control pain that histamine brought on

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.280
 all of these other stress hormone changes

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.280
 So he added an anti histamine an herbal

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.880
 drug called scopolamine

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.280
 Basically an anti histamine anti stress

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.800
 preparation to go with the anesthesia and

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.480
 Then he used a local anesthetic

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:31.800
 To stop

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.120
 First he would anesthetize the skin then

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.960
 As the skin was cut each layer would get a local anesthetic

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.320
 So that he was not letting the brain

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.440
 receive any of those harmful signals but

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.560
 careless quick

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:57.040
 Surgery nowadays often is very rough and the patient wakes up with

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:04.920
 Changes in the brain from that powerful noxious stimulation of the surgery and

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.440
 So if you can get the doctor to

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.200
 Reduce the trauma of the surgery

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.000
 that's a very important part of recovering and

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.080
 Like the hypothyroid person

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.160
 doesn't

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:29.240
 recover very well because their metabolic rate is slow their temperature is also very low and

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.240
 since the surgery

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.640
 Turning on the the stress hormones turns off the thyroid function

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.480
 temperature tends to drop

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.680
 drastically during and following surgery and

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.160
 in proportion to how the temperature falls the

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.080
 person's recovery is

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.440
 impaired

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:58.400
 So everything that will keep your your temperature up during and after surgery

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.320
 preparing with

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.720
 At least two weeks of

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.320
 Adjusting thyroid so that you're not hypothyroid

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.080
 That makes the recovery a lot faster

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.080
 The

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.760
 Study in Mississippi, I think it was

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.600
 Found that if the

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:31.160
 Emergency intensive care people would check the patient's vitamin D levels

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:34.040
 as they came in

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.160
 they found that out of

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.240
 178 cases only three people had normal vitamin D

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.120
 Partly that means that

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.720
 deficient people get sick more often or that sickness lowers your vitamin D, but

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.840
 some of them had as low as eight or ten

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.280
 nano

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.780
 Nanograms per milliliter where it should be 50 or 55

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.840
 that's the normal range and

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.920
 the

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.080
 when he got the dietician to

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:17.080
 check their vitamin D levels and supplement vitamin D the

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.600
 length of stay in intensive care was cut in half

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.880
 survival increased and

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.920
 the expenses

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.720
 that saved the hospital more than half of the

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.760
 Expenses just by that one vitamin. It's amazing

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.400
 You mentioned a vitamin. It's amazing

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.840
 You mentioned a herbal antihistamine earlier. What was that again?

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:48.480
 That was scopolamine and that is sometimes available

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.560
 If a person is nauseated after surgery

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.320
 That's a very safe

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.680
 anti-nausea drug which

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:03.960
 Does several things that helps to hold up the body temperature besides stopping the nausea?

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.080
 And can it be used with anesthetics?

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.680
 Yeah, it was part of the

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.320
 anesthesia that was pioneered by

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.720
 George Creil and it's still occasionally in use but since it's a

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.880
 generic herbal

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.320
 chemical

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:30.280
 The drug companies aren't very keen on having it promoted

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:36.360
 But it is available both as part of the anesthetic and part of the recovery program

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:43.640
 And what can people do as far as specific diet for post-surgery recovery to?

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:50.560
 Help their brain and their body recover. Um the same foods that are generally good but

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.840
 emphasizing

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.440
 The things that are lost specifically by high stress

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.560
 Which are protein, zinc

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:05.600
 Some of the B vitamins are turned over very fast in stress so

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.160
 foods like

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:14.760
 liver and oysters and eggs which are rich in the trace minerals and protein are

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.600
 As long as you're getting

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.200
 adequate

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.200
 carbohydrate and

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.200
 calcium these happen to be high phosphate foods along with the protein, but

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.840
 they have the

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.360
 highest concentration of the healing

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.440
 minerals and vitamins

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:42.720
 You're listening to WMNF Tampa 88.5 on your dial and we're speaking with dr. Ray Pete and

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:48.000
 We spoke a little bit earlier about cheeses, and I wanted to ask you a question

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.320
 Relating to

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:57.640
 Pasteurization you mentioned that there's beneficial nutrients does this get discounted once the

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.440
 milks or cheeses are pasteurized

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.840
 No, it's such a tiny amount of a pasteurized it now in

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.200
 I think it's something like three seconds

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.560
 High temperature and then it drops immediately

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.940
 So there's very little oxidative damage done now by pasteurizing

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.580
 So it's a quick flash

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:24.820
 Pasteurization yeah

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:27.500
 beautiful

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:34.740
 It might lower the vitamin A content three or four percent something like that but

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:41.180
 Since it's such a good rich source of all these nutrients

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:48.180
 No one is going to suffer deficiency if they're eating pasteurized milk and cheese

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:56.380
 And what's your feeling about exercise during that recovery time for people that have gone through surgery?

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:59.540
 um - I think

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.260
 better just to

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.780
 regain

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.700
 Flexibility and

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:12.260
 mobility in a gentle way not to worry about muscle building exercise

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:17.180
 The time to think about that is before surgery because

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.620
 in one study of old people

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:28.980
 They found that the fatter they were the better their long-range survival was in the six months

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:31.540
 following a surgery

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.780
 The death rate was much higher in the lean

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.540
 low-body mass people and

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.540
 That survival went up directly in proportion to the body mass and

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.820
 The

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.420
 In aging or stress

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.260
 the

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.260
 muscles are

00:46:54.260 --> 00:47:00.740
 Shrunken and it isn't just the fat that is a buffer against stress

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:04.660
 but it's mainly the mass of the muscles and

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:10.420
 Exercises such as deep knee bends

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.420
 Mild weight lifting with dumbbells

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.180
 Just a few minutes a day of

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.260
 mild

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:23.820
 resistance exercise of that sort can keep your muscles

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.740
 sound and

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.740
 relatively massive and

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.020
 muscles are

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.660
 Themselves a hormone source they can produce

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.340
 Testosterone

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:40.340
 instead of cortisol

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:43.540
 When you're doing these resistant exercises

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.940
 so they are

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:53.380
 The muscle building is protecting your heart and brain as well as building up the reserves of tissue

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:57.140
 That are part of your resistance against stress

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:04.260
 You mentioned that the cortisol damages the brain once the trauma has happened

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.580
 Is that reversible over time if someone is

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.220
 Following a protocol that would support their greater health

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:18.980
 Yeah, it's probably just the same as the following anorexia

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.100
 That they've seen that young women

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.220
 Can have a great and quick

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.660
 regrowth of the mass of the brain substance

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.740
 just by

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:37.980
 stopping the stress and starting to eat well, and I think that would happen with old people who are

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.580
 partially demanded by

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:43.020
 stress of

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.260
 very serious surgery

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:48.300
 and

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.460
 Lastly I wanted to chat a little bit about adrenals as

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:59.420
 Many many people these days seem to be suffering from low adrenals or adrenal fatigue

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.420
 I

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:09.300
 Mentioned that the muscles are an important source of steroid synthesis our biggest

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.380
 endocrine gland is our brain

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.780
 and

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.780
 the brain

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:23.620
 Stabilizes all of the organs and if if your brain is experiencing stress

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.380
 that

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:28.020
 shifts the

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:30.020
 the adrenal function to

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.220
 Cortisol rather than

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.700
 DHEA and progesterone and the androgens

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.900
 and

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.900
 The adrenals

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.660
 Shouldn't

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:50.940
 Produce simply the stress promoting hormones. They should be putting out some of the defensive

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:55.620
 Protective progesterone DHEA and pregnenolone as well

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.220
 But when your brain gives them

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:03.180
 these super stress signals then and

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.100
 they will

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.140
 over over

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.500
 act and

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.060
 the

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.260
 Hansel you

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.740
 Defined the adrenal failure as when

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:26.900
 The adrenal gland begins bleeding and the cells die that make steroids

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.900
 but the adrenal cortex is

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:36.980
 extremely able to regenerate as fast as the thymus and

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:45.620
 Thyroid gland the cortex of the adrenal if you're well fed and if you stop the stress signals

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.900
 It can regenerate

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.140
 So what Hansel you was was talking about was

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:59.380
 an acute stress causes immediate bleeding of your stomach and intestines and

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:06.460
 That's because of the high cortisol production among other stress hormones and

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:12.940
 If you continue that too long without feeding some of the

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:17.020
 Curative

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.300
 nutrients

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.020
 sugars zinc

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.340
 magnesium calcium and so on vitamin D

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:28.180
 then the adrenal glands can't keep up the intense work and

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.860
 they start bleeding and

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.220
 tissue dies

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:37.860
 Too much estrogen is one of the things that can contribute to

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:44.300
 Overacting of the adrenal cortex in animal experience

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.620
 experiments we saw that just injecting a big dose of

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.700
 estrogen would cause adrenal

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:59.140
 Enlargement in a moderate case or bleeding and death in an extreme dose of estrogen

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:03.420
 Absolutely amazing

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.100
 How everything is so connected and

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:15.500
 Reactive of what we're doing both with our diet and our exercise and our lifestyle choices

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.380
 I should mention that cholesterol and

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:21.860
 thyroid and vitamin A are the

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:29.580
 important things for keeping the adrenal cortex from getting stressed to death because

00:52:29.580 --> 00:52:33.720
 the cortisol of the cholesterol is the

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.820
 raw material for making cortisol and the other stress

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.860
 adaptive hormones and without enough

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:46.020
 cholesterol and

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.020
 thyroid and vitamin A

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:54.900
 These cells are simulated but can't can't work and so they they just give up and atrophy

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:58.540
 What sources of cholesterol would you recommend?

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.060
 I'm a good diet

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.820
 Plenty of fruit and milk in the diet will allow your

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.980
 tissues

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.980
 especially the liver and brain

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:15.100
 to make as much cortisol as much cholesterol as they need and

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:19.180
 Speaking of liver

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:26.180
 Would you recommend for people to eat liver if they do eat meat to eat liver or heart or kidneys?

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.380
 from grass-fed

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.940
 Beef for example, is that a helpful thing to?

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:35.060
 Yeah

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.780
 the liver

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.660
 except for the ratio of calcium to phosphate

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:46.100
 The liver has the highest concentration of the anti-stress

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.180
 nutrients and

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:53.820
 So at least twice a month there should be a good meal of liver for stress resistance

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.060
 Maybe once a week

00:53:56.060 --> 00:54:00.100
 for four ounces a week is a safe and

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:04.900
 Effective amount good old liver and onions a

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:14.620

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.180
 I don't know

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:49.780
 You are up on YouTube and people can listen to some of your interviews and

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.860
 I have on my website

 Radiantsoul.com one of our past interviews where we spoke about

00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:03.900
 Good fats and coconut oil and that was very informative and we had many many people

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:09.420
 Commenting and writing back about that. So thank you so so much. Okay. Thank you

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:13.260
 Many many blessings much love sweetheart. Thank you
