 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.680
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.760
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows which run every third Friday

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.600
 of the month from 7 to 8 p.m., we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.720
 England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.000
 We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.080
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts which are either grown on

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 our CCUF certified herb farm or which are sourced from other USA certified organic supplies.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.700
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garberville 91.1 FM.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.200
 And from 7.15 today until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.920
 any questions either related or unrelated to this month's last minute topic as it were

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.520
 of the unfolding facts in Japan.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.320
 I think first and foremost we want to extend our heartfelt sincere wishes for the people

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.160
 of Japan that their country could recover and the people there can find relief from

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.400
 a lack of food and shelter and protection and help from all the sources possible to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.280
 help them cope with this disaster.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.920
 So last Friday there was a 8.9 or 9.0 earthquake which resulted in a tsunami and the tsunami

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.560
 had the unfortunate effect of causing a fairly catastrophic breakdown in the cooling system

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.440
 of Fukushima nuclear power plant.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.120
 We're going to be joined in a moment here by Dr. Raymond Peat who's an expert physiologist,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.320
 chemist, research scientist and we're going to be hearing from Dr. Raymond Peat about

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.160
 some helpful things to do to counter any potential radioactive spread to this country.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.920
 It was probably earlier in the week that I first started finding some internet-based

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.040
 evidence to show that the spread of radiation from the steam leaked from the plant subsequent

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.920
 to the explosions, the hydrogen explosions on the actual buildings, not the containment

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.000
 vessel for the reactor but the buildings that house all of the reactor and all the machinery,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.920
 that that steam was laden with things like iodine 131 and cesium isotopes and that these

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200
 had been released in the steam cloud as the engineers desperately tried to lower the pressure

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.480
 by allowing the steam from the reactor to leave so it didn't cause any further breakdown

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.720
 of the containment vessel which would certainly result in fairly widespread and very damaging

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.320
 radioactive release.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.240
 And one of the reactors, number three, the mixed oxide fuel reactor that contained the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.800
 plutonium, 6% plutonium and 94% uranium, that would lead to a much more serious environmental

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.280
 damage if that was released.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.080
 OK, so we started coming out on Wednesday, I think it was, I first started seeing some

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 spreading clouds, as it were, in colour showing a potential spread to the East Coast and then

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.120
 the CTBTO from Vienna released information and it became widespread public knowledge.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.960
 It was no longer something that was on the fringes but fairly widespread public knowledge

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.240
 and today, that was on Thursday, and today on Friday quite a few government agencies

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.760
 are also admitting this.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.480
 So on Wednesday or Tuesday of last week they started saying that the radioactive components

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.560
 would be in the upper atmosphere, spread by the jet stream, moving east and due to hit

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.600
 the Aleutian Islands on Thursday and then be on the West Coast of America with a spread

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.220
 potentially from Oregon down to California.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.980
 So yesterday I read the CTBTO report online and indeed this cloud was coming fairly close

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.880
 and was expected to make landfall by Friday.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.760
 So funnily enough today in Sacramento, now the CTBTO is the centre of the, basically

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.160
 the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation that was set up to monitor the atmosphere for radioactive

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.920
 particles, isotopes, emissions from nuclear testing.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.640
 There's a comprehensive test ban on nuclear explosions and these sites, there are 60 of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.680
 them around the world, and these sites actually measure radiation released from nuclear explosions.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.120
 So the ones in the Pacific were starting to detect this and actually in Vienna they released

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.120
 the information.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.200
 I think it was, I don't know if it was a mole or an insider who just wanted to make sure

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.680
 that it got out because as well as radioactive data, the CTBTO collects geophysical information,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.840
 so it's seismic activity, tsunami activity, and on top of that the third thing they do

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.080
 is maintain and monitor any radioactive release as a telltale signature from nuclear explosions.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.920
 Okay so they started picking this up and then on Thursday it was released from Vienna and

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.400
 they said on Friday it would be making landfall in California and actually today one of the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.120
 CTBTO stations based in Sacramento actually recorded a very small, so although they're

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.560
 very small, they're present particles of iodine, I-131, and so it's fairly real that what we

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.720
 have in the upper air jet stream and/or coming down in the rain is potentially going to land

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.800
 here and that's something we should just be aware of.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.640
 At this point in time it's still, I would safely say, still fairly small but it's certainly

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.320
 coming this way all the time now.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.240
 It's made its first landfall from when it first started and the fires broke out on Saturday

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.080
 or Sunday of last week and so for the last five days the cloud trail's been coming east.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080
 So I want to...

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.760
 We're joined by Dr. Ray Peat today and I want to introduce Dr. Peat and then also ask him

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.280
 from his sources if he believes it true that the radioactive iodine has reached our land

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280
 yet.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:29.760
 It's probably present in detectable amounts but probably not yet biologically significant

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.120
 but it could quickly become concentrated enough to affect pregnant women because the fetus

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.540
 concentrates elements from the environment at least 100 times faster than other tissues

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.160
 and so during the first two or three months after an accident like that there will be

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:55.040
 a radioactive iodine which would be concentrating in the embryo and fetus.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.240
 Other isotopes such as cesium and strontium would continue to be dangerous if they got

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.500
 into the food supply but the radioactive iodine is one that's most crucial for developing

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.500
 babies.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.000
 So Dr. Peat, we wanted to go over and discuss what different foods and nutrients could help

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 protect us from increasing levels if it does increase or more dangerous levels of radioactive

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.760
 iodine that may be present and/or cesium and/or strontium from this cloud that is coming over

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.120
 from Japan and we wanted to go through the list of different things that specifically

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.680
 can block those radioactive particles as well as in general what nutrients are protective.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:44.800
 The first principle is to dilute the radioactive isotopes with good stable or relatively stable

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.920
 isotopes and so old food is best.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.760
 The iodine radioactive isotope is practically all gone after three months after the production

00:06:53.760 --> 00:07:00.160
 of it and the others will eventually tend to wash down into the ground and so the plants

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.280
 that grow in the first few months after an accident will contain those isotopes.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:13.040
 So if you have canned food, dried milk or aged cheese, these are very safe and will

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.640
 continue to be safe for months because they were produced before the accident.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:26.680
 The other principle besides diluting the isotopes is to increase your resistance to stress and

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:34.200
 radiation and it happened that my very first newsletter 30 years ago was on radiation resistance

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.640
 and what to do in case of a nuclear accident and at that time I reviewed a couple thousand

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.360
 research articles both from the old AEC, Atomic Energy Commission research and a lot of it

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.400
 from the Soviet research and the main conclusions that I found were that increasing the metabolic

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.120
 rate which causes cells to retain magnesium.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.720
 Magnesium is very important in repairing cell damage and the faster the metabolic rate is

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:13.240
 generally the more damage can be repaired before it becomes established as a stress

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.360
 factor in the organism.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:23.440
 The high metabolic rate produces carbon dioxide which has an antioxidant, anti-stress effect

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.960
 all through the organism so if you keep your metabolic rate up and eat a balanced diet,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.760
 your tissues are going to retain magnesium it needs out of the food and produce the carbon

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.080
 dioxide it needs assuming that you're getting adequate protein, sugar, fat, vitamins and

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080
 balance of minerals.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.880
 So you mentioned to me earlier that there are ways and foods that we can eat to keep

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:52.080
 our metabolic rate high as along with taking thyroid so can you expand on what types of

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.520
 sugars and fats and proteins we should be ingesting?

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:04.400
 The ideal fat is coconut oil because the short chain saturated fatty acids compete with the

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.800
 other fats that normally are slowing metabolism and oxidative metabolism and so for a couple

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.720
 hours after you eat more or less a tablespoon of coconut oil per meal, for a couple hours

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.320
 your metabolic rate is increased producing more carbon dioxide and accelerating cell

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.920
 repair processes.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.520
 The fruits that come from the tropics, the farther south the fruit is grown, the longer

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.560
 it will be free of this high latitude Japanese radiation.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.120
 So oranges grown in Mexico, Brazil and Florida are still going to be pretty pure in terms

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.440
 of radiation for a very long time and the sugar and the minerals in oranges are very

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.160
 close to what we need.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:54.320
 So coconut oil, orange juice and milk is a good source of calcium.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:01.160
 During the atmospheric bomb test in the 50s and 60s, I got interested in the study the

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.320
 government was doing or they were doing it secretly before it became public for a long

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:12.120
 time that they were collecting baby teeth from around the world to measure the fallout

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.840
 effect and the government began recommending that people not drink milk because milk was

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.840
 contaminated with the strontium which was taken up along with the calcium.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:30.000
 I looked at the actual analysis of the food value as well as the isotope content of vegetables

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.520
 and found that a person getting their nutrition from vegetables was going to have about five

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.440
 times higher exposure to strontium-90 than people who got their nutrition primarily from

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.120
 milk and cheese because the cows were able to concentrate the calcium and filter out

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.600
 a little more of the strontium than the vegetables were doing.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.160
 You mentioned to me that in order to get enough calcium to protect against your body's own

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:03.560
 bone destruction that you would have to drink one to two quarts and eat some cheese daily

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.800
 and that same amount of calcium from green leafy vegetables would be about three pounds

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.800
 of spinach per day.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.800
 Something like that, yeah.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.960
 And then the fact that you're eating so much spinach that could have been contaminated

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:18.160
 with strontium, you'd actually be exposing yourself to much higher levels of strontium.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.320
 Yeah.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.880
 Can you talk to us about what you'd recommend for elimination methods like if we are breathing

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:31.320
 in or ingesting radioactive particles, what's the best elimination method you find to take?

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.040
 Because I know there's a lot of stuff on the internet about all these different things

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.960
 you can take that will help bind the radioactive particles, but what do you recommend, Dr.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960
 Peat?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.320
 Well, if it gets into your digestive system, if it's coming in incorporated in the food,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.400
 there's really no way to sort it out.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.560
 But if it's in the water, for example, if you can just keep a lot of fiber flowing through

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.400
 your system, eating fruit that you know isn't contaminated, carrots, for example, if you

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:06.120
 know that they're safely grown uncontaminated, will the material through your intestine preventing

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:13.040
 the absorption of some nutrients at the same time that if you're exposed to a very concentrated

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.920
 dose from rain or something, it's better to go hungry for a little while while sweeping

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.920
 out your intestine.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.200
 So would you consider, just to kind of go back a little bit here, but would you consider

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:31.520
 the radiation that we might have been exposed to thus far dangerous enough to avoid drinking

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.000
 any milk and eating any vegetables from California and Oregon?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Oh, no, not yet.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Not yet.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.720
 If it becomes, if the reactors start burning fuel rods, someone is likely to leak the information

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.040
 in time that people can take precautions.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.640
 But if it reached the proportions of Chernobyl, then it would take extreme measures for a

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.880
 very long time using only stored antique food.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.720
 The older food would become more valuable.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:03.680
 So it sounds like we need to start stocking up on sugar and dried milk powder.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680
 Yeah.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680
 Okay.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.680
 And other things that can help move things along in the intestine are all the various

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.760
 liver herbs and cascara bark powder at all speeds intestinal transit time.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.400
 But I did want to ask you, Dr. Peat, there's a lot of hype around people using potassium

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.680
 iodide already and it's selling out of the stores and people using kelp.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.240
 And can you please explain to our listeners how taking kelp or the potassium iodide supplement

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.640
 would help protect them against the high amount of radioactive iodine in our environment?

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.640
 Well, simply dilute the radioactive isotope.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.400
 When you're taking in a lot of old stable iodine, it saturates your thyroid.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.920
 Your thyroid shuts down and stops taking up anymore.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:52.960
 And so you can add radioactive iodine to a saturated person and it just gradually washes

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.440
 out without concentrating at a very high level in the thyroid.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.600
 But if a person is deficient in iodine, almost all of it will, once it gets into the bloodstream,

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.000
 it'll stick in the thyroid gland and give an extremely high dose to the gland and even

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.160
 more so to a developing embryo's thyroid gland.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:17.960
 The fetus will concentrate even more than the mother's thyroid.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:24.280
 The potassium iodide is very good protection only from the damage to the thyroid gland.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:30.040
 It doesn't do anything at all to protect against the other isotopes or the other tissues of

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.640
 the body, as some people are saying on the internet.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.280
 In fact, probably if you took it more than enough to saturate your tissues, the Center

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:44.640
 for Disease Control advocates 160 milligrams one dose.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:51.160
 If you took that much every day for a long time, your thyroid gland would shut down,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:57.360
 your metabolism would slow down, and all of your defensive reactions would slow down.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.680
 So you'd become more susceptible to injury throughout the rest of your body.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.080
 So you're not recommending that people take any kelp powder or potassium iodide at this

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.080
 current level?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.080
 No.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.040
 Just the minimum requirement is only 150 or 200 micrograms.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:20.360
 And even one milligram per day continued for a very long time increases the risk of damage

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.360
 to the thyroid gland.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:27.160
 Thyroiditis appears increasingly when people just a milligram of iodine or more.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.680
 And do you know the measurements on how much is in kelp powder?

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.320
 How many milligrams is in a teaspoon of kelp or a half teaspoon of kelp?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.800
 No, but probably a half teaspoon.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.800
 I think people have calculated that it would take an ounce to be equal to the Center for

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.800
 Disease Control amount, but probably a half teaspoon is adequate to saturate most people.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.800
 But only once we have more information saying there is actually elevated levels of radioactive

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.200
 iodine in our environment?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200
 Yeah.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.640
 So a half teaspoon dose isn't going to hurt anyone, but you don't want to do that every

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.640
 day for a long time.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.640
 Andrew, did you have a question?

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:09.040
 No, I think what was, like you were saying, the rush on buying potassium iodide was pretty

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040
 apparent.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.360
 I know I saw plenty of information regarding that.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:18.240
 And the thing with iodine, if I'm right in saying this, Dr. Peat, is that the radioactive

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:24.200
 iodine that was present in Chernobyl was also responsible for the big increase in thyroid

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200
 cancers.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.320
 And now you're saying that pregnant women are actually more susceptible even than young

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.320
 children.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.640
 Yeah, Ernest Sternglass, who got interested in the issue when they were doing atmospheric

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.280
 bomb tests.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:42.200
 The government timed their bomb tests in Nevada so that the wind wasn't blowing towards the

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.720
 big California cities.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:49.640
 They wanted all of the fallout to go into Utah, and the population of Utah suffered

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.160
 the most from autoimmune diseases and cancer and other diseases.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:00.400
 But occasionally the rainfall would be so light that no fallout would come down until

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.920
 it got to the East Coast.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.160
 And one of these times, Ernest Sternglass had his students studying how to use their

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.760
 Geiger counters, and they found that there was a terrific amount of radiation at the

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.400
 university, which the government hadn't mentioned to anyone.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.000
 And that got him studying it and paying attention to how dishonest the U.S. Public Health Service

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.720
 and Atomic Energy Commission and state public health officials were.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:33.120
 But he showed that probably there were tens of thousands of miscarriages, and the babies

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.360
 that survived a very high percentage were hypothyroid.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.480
 Even there was an epidemic of babies born without their thyroid glands.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:48.040
 And as long as they were being breastfed, the mother's thyroid was entering the milk

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.840
 at a high enough level to cover up the symptoms.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.280
 So as soon as they were weaned, they were discovered not to have thyroid glands.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.400
 Going back to cover-ups or suppression of information, I found it quite interesting

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:05.040
 from the moment the tsunami happened and the evolving situation of Fukushima was passing

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.680
 day by day with ever increasing explosions, etc.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.720
 I found the most information, funnily enough, coming from Russia Today.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.000
 That news agency there, I think, probably not suppressed so much by the West as the

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 BBC even.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.380
 I found the BBC's coverage was pretty good, but I found Russia Today, their coverage was

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.600
 pretty excellent.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.120
 And they had the most up-to-date information, I presume because the time zone there was

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.800
 much more on a par with Japan.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.600
 So in the waking hours, they were picking up the information as soon as it was being

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.140
 released from sources in Japan.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.960
 But I wonder what would be the best, I guess to keep monitoring Russia Today, but the best

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:49.120
 source for people in America to be able to find out more about local results with real

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.160
 time and real figures to show what actually is in the environment.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.280
 I wonder what would be the best way to go about doing that.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:03.160
 I don't remember the web address, but there is a good nuclear site, basically an anti-nuclear

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.440
 power site that is getting up-to-date information.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:12.440
 The other thing was I was looking on eBay Geiger counters of all things just to see.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.920
 They're out there, there's hundreds of them on eBay, and they're not expensive.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.520
 And I think a lot of them are post-Cold War, post-Three Mile Island.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:25.720
 So getting hold of a Geiger counter to actually do some physical measurements yourself.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:33.760
 For a while, the internet stores were selling old Soviet Geiger counters for about $15.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:40.320
 And someone just told me that she and her neighbor had bought two for $35.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.520
 And as soon as the radiation scare hit, the price went up to $75.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.520
 Oh my gosh.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.160
 Okay, because I saw them on eBay and they were going for about $150 to $200.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.840
 And these were, I can get hold of the information pretty quick, but they were all fairly similar.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.880
 They're kind of bright yellow and maybe about the size of an egg carton.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.880
 So I'm actually holding mine right here, which I got on the internet.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.240
 I could have paid anywhere.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.240
 I got the cheapest basically, which cost me about $250.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.600
 I did see even cheaper ones other places, but the really good expensive ones cost $10,000

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.600
 to $20,000.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.360
 And the little booklet I got with this, I can tell some kinds of radiation from other

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360
 kinds.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.880
 But I basically have it beeping and I got it to check out both industrial metals and

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.880
 phosphate fertilizers.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.080
 And I did find some things which are definitely hot by mine.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.360
 It's not beeping much more than normal right now.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.320
 All right, let's get back to some of those things that people can do.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.880
 We do have a caller on the line, but I did want to at least go through a few more of

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.480
 the anti-radiation nutrients.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:43.520
 Dr. Peate, caffeine, there's lots of information out there about tea and coffee.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.880
 And can you describe to us briefly what the nutrients are in the tea and the coffee and

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.800
 how caffeine helps protect against radiation?

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:57.760
 Coffee is a good source of magnesium and of some B vitamins, niacin especially, and the

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.080
 caffeine anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.520
 So if you happen to have some mobile isotopes that are still in your bloodstream and going

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.520
 through your kidneys, caffeine helps to flush them out faster and safely.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.000
 It has a slight chelating effect as well as anti-inflammatory.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.160
 And, sorry, carry on.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:24.880
 The things that have an anti-estrogen effect as well as anti-inflammatory, the radiation

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.560
 effect itself imitates estrogen in the body.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.080
 Everything that estrogen does can be imitated by radiation, including making a rat go into

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.160
 estrus, for example.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.440
 And if you're in a high estrogen state, then you're more susceptible to radiation injury.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:48.480
 And that's why progesterone and thyroid and caffeine, by helping to lower estrogen and

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.840
 inflammation are protective against radiation too.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.560
 So just to recap those, you said caffeine, coffee, because it contains the magnesium

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.920
 and B vitamins, progesterone to block the estrogenic effects of radiation, other antioxidants

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:07.400
 like vitamin E also blocks the effects of estrogen and helps with radiation, and vitamin

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.880
 C and orange juice and tropical fruits, vitamin A found in eggs and liver helps in the repair

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880
 processes.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:19.000
 I wanted to briefly ask you about the glutathione, that that's been touted to help with radiation

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 damages.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.120
 There's a lot of confusion around glutathione because anything that harms your cells turns

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.080
 on a defensive reaction and increases the glutathione.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.400
 And so a lot of things that have exactly the wrong effect are being suggested on the basis

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.680
 of increasing glutathione.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.840
 Many harmful things by stimulating that defense reaction will increase glutathione.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.920
 And taking a large dose of glutathione in itself, animal studies showed that it could

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.000
 be carcinogenic to the liver just by starting free radical reactions rather than stopping

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 them.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.400
 Other anti-inflammatories that can help protect against radiation, aspirin, of course, which

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.480
 comes from white willow bark, well not anymore, but originated from white willow bark.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.480
 Also ginkgo, turmeric, those are other herbal anti-inflammatories.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.600
 Various adaptogenic adrenal herbs, aluthrowroot, American and Korean ginseng have been shown

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.920
 to help with radiation sickness.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.840
 And we mentioned the B vitamins already.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:22.240
 I wanted you, Dr. Friedt, to talk to us about animal liver, which contains a lot of B vitamins

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.120
 and the fat-soluble A, D, E, and K vitamins and why, contrary to popular opinion, it's

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.480
 actually less toxic than the other parts of the animal.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.920
 Yeah, the liver is the main detoxifying organ.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.920
 Kidneys and brain have some of the same detoxifying enzymes, but the liver is where a great bulk

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.080
 of detoxification happens.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.360
 And there have been studies in which beef were going into the slaughterhouse, their

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.920
 urine, blood, and tissues were measured.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:58.520
 And the large proportion of the animals, more than a third, showed chemical contamination

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.080
 in the blood and urine.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:06.280
 And practically all of them had the same chemicals in their fat and muscle tissues, the meats

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.840
 that are most popular.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.720
 Only a very tiny proportion still had any of the toxic chemicals left in their liver.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.080
 For the first 24 hours after you're exposed to an insecticide, for example, it will collect

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.960
 in the liver and be bound to a certain kind of protein.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.080
 During this first day in which it's collecting at a high concentration in the liver, the

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.960
 liver begins destroying it.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:38.120
 And after just about 24 hours, the liver has cleaned itself and then begins a slow process

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:44.040
 of cleaning the blood as it draws toxins out of the muscles and fat tissues.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.440
 The fats are relatively inert, and so the highest toxins accumulate there over the years.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:56.040
 And so the fatty meats are most risky as far as the chemical poisoning.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.840
 So the liver is the cleanest.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840
 Okay, good.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.200
 There's a caller on the line, so let's start taking the callers, because there may well

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.200
 be.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:08.880
 Hi, hello fellow downwinders of the vast nuclear corporate industrial empire.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:15.160
 I've been watching the news, and I thought maybe it was the website that Dr. Peate mentioned,

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.120
 an anti-nuclear information site.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:24.680
 It was on the news, a couple of programs had the boom coming from Japan, and it indicated

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:30.160
 that the very first place where it was hitting the West Coast was actually Cape Mendocino

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.320
 from about Eureka to Fort Bragg.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.920
 That was like at 11 o'clock last night they were showing that map.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.680
 So we're the initial fallout point of that particular boom.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.160
 And I have a couple of questions concerning, the first one before I forget, the first colon

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.120
 cleanser that you mentioned, I didn't quite catch the name of that.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.120
 What was it again?

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.120
 Grated carrots.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.120
 Raw carrot.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.120
 Once again.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120
 Raw carrot salad, like raw carrots.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120
 Oh, raw carrots.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120
 Okay.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.920
 I had a little static on the line, on the radio when you mentioned that.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.280
 And I understand also garlic is supposed to bring iodine into the system.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.080
 Is that something that you're aware of?

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080
 What was that?

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080
 Garlic.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:13.080
 Garlic, oh, it has some antioxidant effect, but I don't think it has a big effect on iodine.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.320
 Okay, and then this weekend we're trying to safeguard ourselves with our potassium iodine

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.440
 salad, which is bananas and seaweed.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.720
 Is there, I mean, if we don't really go out and eat a whole lot of, I don't know what

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.840
 the flavor is, but it's got to be better than the tasteless plutonium and uranium that's

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.280
 literally raining down on us.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:37.640
 Is there a cautionary amount that you would eat of some kind of a fruit/sea salad like

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.040
 that, that would be reasonable to start maybe implementing some protection?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.200
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that question?

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.200
 The last part of it I didn't hear.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:51.040
 Okay, well, basically he's suggesting eating a banana and seaweed salad.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.240
 So to provide potassium and...

00:26:53.240 --> 00:27:00.600
 Well, the seaweed, kelp and dulse, for example, or sea organisms like greenfin, oysters and

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.720
 clams, those are good sources of iodine.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.480
 But the banana issue brings up an important aspect of radiation, which is bananas are

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:14.640
 probably one of the richest food sources in serotonin.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:22.760
 And some biologists, Carmel Mothersill and Colin Seymour, for example, have been studying

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:28.200
 the effects of low-level radiation on cell physiology and communication.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:35.160
 And they find that at a very low level, ionizing radiation causes cells to produce serotonin,

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:41.360
 among other agents, that even if you take the injured cells out of the organism or the

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:47.160
 culture dish, the water that they were in when they were injured becomes equivalent

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.760
 to the radiation for other cells.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:56.200
 The same kind of genetic damage caused directly by the radiation can be caused by the chemicals

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.400
 put into the environment by those injured cells.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:06.880
 And serotonin at a level above 20 nanograms per milliliter is one of those communicators

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.800
 of radiation damage.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.240
 They in one of their books have a study by some of the biologists who worked with the

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:20.440
 Chernobyl victims, both the children who have been living in the region and the people who

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.920
 survived working at the accident.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:29.000
 And they find that the serum taken from these exposed people 20 years after the accident,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.600
 their serum separated from their blood components, added to another person's cell, caused radiation

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.000
 damage equivalent in those cells.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.120
 And since they identified a very small amount of serotonin as one of the factors spreading

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:51.440
 this inflammation, genetic destabilizing material, I think it's good to avoid as many sources

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.040
 of serotonin as possible, especially bananas.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.040
 Good.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.000
 Well, so when it's said that somebody is going bananas, there's actually a pharmaceutical

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.480
 psychological aspect to that, it sounds like.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.480
 Well, I guess I'll be adding raw carrots to our salad and reducing the amount of bananas.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:14.280
 Is there any benefit to eating dried bananas to fresh bananas, considering the psychopharmaceutical

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.960
 aspects of the serotonin in there?

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:23.840
 I think drifting towards gelatinous meats away from muscle meat would help to reduce

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.520
 the tendency of the tissues when inflamed to produce serotonin.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:35.920
 A good balance of vitamins and minerals to avoid excess serotonin production during inflammation.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:42.360
 But all of those anti-inflammatory things that have been mentioned are basically anti-serotonin.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:48.480
 Okay, and my final question on estrogenics concerning ingestion by men.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:54.760
 I don't know if palmetto is one of those, but is there anything that maybe should be

00:29:54.760 --> 00:30:01.440
 taken to preempt the estrogenic effect of radionuclides as far as the difference between

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.080
 men ingesting them and women ingesting them, or is it at a point where maybe drinking water

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.160
 out of a plastic bottle with a bisphenol A is better than dealing with the radionuclides

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.960
 that that might preempt at least over the next couple of weeks?

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.120
 And thank you very much for the program.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.120
 I'm going to release the line.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.120
 Thank you for your call.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.120
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that gentleman's last?

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.120
 Almost, none of it.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.400
 Okay, yeah, we have a little bit of feedback here.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:30.080
 So he was asking about the anti-estrogenic, what else could men take that's anti-estrogen

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:36.280
 and help protect against the radionuclides, and also whether you would recommend people

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:41.280
 drink bottled water versus water from bringing their well in the next several months?

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.960
 Given that the bottled water is a potential source of estrogenic substance.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.920
 I think a good filter for well water is adequate.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.120
 And progesterone is very anti-estrogenic.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.040
 And for men, keeping the thyroid function high is the main thing.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.240
 Progesterone and thyroid are able to inhibit the estrogen that's produced as a result of

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240
 stress.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.640
 I've actually just thought of something.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:11.640
 In the water filter, is the, because we have water filters that we run our water through,

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:16.360
 and I know that the core of the filter is a carbon, a pleated carbon core.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360
 Is that carbon there?

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.280
 Is that able to sequester things like iodine if it was in the water?

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:26.800
 Yeah, I think carbon catches almost any solid will absorb to an activated percolate.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.800
 Okay, good.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.480
 All right, there's two more callers on the line, so let's take the next one.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480
 You're on the air?

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.480
 Hello?

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:39.280
 Well, the brown seaweeds like wakame and kombu, especially kombu, are high in sodium alginate,

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.240
 and they're supposed to take all heavy metals and radioactivity out of your body, just not

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.240
 the iodine.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.160
 So don't you think they would be good?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160
 Did you hear that, Dr. Peate?

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.040
 Yeah, if they pass through your intestine.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.080
 Well, yes, eating them.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:57.640
 Yeah, they aren't going to be any more effective than good cellulose.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.480
 Anything indigestible that stimulates your intestine will sweep out.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.040
 Even with the sodium alginate?

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:09.160
 Well, the trouble is that alginate is very dangerously allergenic for many people, so

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:14.280
 I wouldn't recommend it unless you are sure that you're not sensitive to it because...

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.480
 I don't know one person that eats kombu that's ever had allergies to it.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:25.560
 Yeah, dental patients have died, and dental students, a very high proportion of dental

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.800
 students working with alginate to make molds are surprisingly healthy young dental students.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.520
 Well, that's a concentrate that they made, not a whole food product.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:41.120
 Well, carrageenan is somewhat worse, but the alginate itself has potential to be dangerously

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120
 allergenic.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120
 Okay.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.880
 I think in light of raw carrots being so absorptive in the intestinal tract and non-digestible,

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.600
 meaning that if they were contaminated themselves, when you eat them, you're not going to be

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.920
 absorbing heavy metals, and when they wash through your intestinal tract, they're going

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.720
 to be absorbing potential heavy metals and radioactive particles.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:06.280
 Oh, well, I think carrots are a good idea, but so is seaweed, I think.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:11.400
 Well, see, taking too much seaweed will actually lower your metabolic rate and make you...

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400
 Well, too much, yeah.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.320
 Well, even eating it daily is enough.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.520
 It doesn't take that much in order to start suppressing the thyroid.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520
 Okay, thank you.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520
 Okay, you're welcome.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.520
 There's another caller on the line.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.520
 You're on the air.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.520
 Oh, hello.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.520
 Yes, what I recommend using is mushroom.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:31.200
 There's this mushroom right around here called the turkey tail, the Medes Versi color, and

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.520
 this one is actually, in Asia, is used as an anti-cancer drug because it has a high

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:42.840
 quality protein-bound polysaccharide, which is discovered very effective in cancer and

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:48.840
 also in treating cancer patients that have chemotherapy in their survival rate.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:54.840
 It also has other qualities, free radical oxidizing compounds and all kinds of things

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840
 like that.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.440
 And other mushrooms are the same quality, which are called polyporor mushrooms, which

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.120
 is the richez one, and these big, thick planks that grow like wood-like looking mushrooms.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:11.480
 And these mushrooms have been studied in Japan and have been proven to reduce the T cell

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.160
 production and what is that, interleukin production?

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.640
 I was wondering if you know anything about that.

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.800
 Dr. Peat, how much do you know about those particular fungi?

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.400
 Oh, what was the name of those?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.120
 Well, he mentioned things like the polyphores, the...

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.240
 The turkey tail is the one that grows around here.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.240
 Yeah.

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.240
 It's the most common, and I make a tea from it just by drying it in dust and powder.

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.680
 Okay, do you know that fungi?

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.680
 It's like the most...

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.680
 It actually is the most studied fungi in the world as far as medicinal.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680
 Okay.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680
 Are you speaking about reishi?

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:41.680
 No, he's talking about turkey.

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.680
 No, it's related to reishi.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680
 It's also a polyphore mushroom.

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.680
 It's a thick mushroom.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.440
 Around here, if you look on these trees, there's these just layers of these mushrooms.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.120
 They're like fry-colored mushrooms.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.240
 They're called turkey tails.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.720
 They go like green and brown and with a white edge.

00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.920
 And they grow on all like the oak trees, the maple, all basically hardwood trees.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.280
 And they're the most common mushroom probably in the world.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.800
 They grow in the most sombrero, boreal forest, tropical forest, and in every state in the

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.640
 union except for I think Nevada.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.440
 I think a lot of the...

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.240
 And they've been studied all over the world.

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.040
 They actually make this commercial thing called Preston, as she calls it, the anti-cancer drug

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040
 in Asia.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.280
 Okay, I'm not a huge fan of it.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.480
 I think a lot of the mushrooms have polysaccharides that are active at absorbing a lot of things

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.280
 from the gastrointestinal tract.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.960
 Right, and that's what I was saying.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.400
 They use them in chemotherapy and stuff like that.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.840
 I'm just saying that...

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:39.560
 Well, they also have for other types of things besides the antioxidizing compounds.

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.680
 But I always take mushrooms anyway.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.160
 I'm a big fan of them.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.760
 I would recommend that people use this mushroom.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.920
 It's growing right on...

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.680
 You look under your oak tree, your apple tree, your bay tree over here on the ground and

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.920
 you look at the dead branches and you see it's covered with these mushrooms.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.920
 They're very dry.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920
 They're dry mushrooms.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920
 All right.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.720
 And that is called the turkey tail.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:05.640
 Okay, well people can check that out on the internet and find out some more about it.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.200
 I'm not too familiar with it.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.600
 It is like it's been used with Reche.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.800
 Okay, I'm familiar with Reche.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.200
 And that's another one of the...

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:19.440
 And the other one around here, you ever see those mushrooms that look like a piece of

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.680
 wood, real heavy, thick things growing off of a tree?

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.680
 Yeah, I've seen those.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.680
 They're called ponks.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.680
 Yeah.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.680
 Right?

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.680
 Yeah.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:28.680
 And that one too has the same quality.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680
 Many of the same quality.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680
 Okay, well thank you for your call.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.960
 I know there's a couple of other people probably want to get a question in.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.640
 So let's take the next caller.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640
 Hello?

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640
 Hi, you on the air?

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.640
 All right.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.640
 So I have a great website.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:45.600
 The EPA has revamped for the general public so we can easily access the graphical representation

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.520
 of the raw data of the monitoring sites along the West Coast.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.520
 Okay, and that is?

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.080
 So you can see the actual gamma and beta radiation levels.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.080
 What's the name of the site?

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.080
 Hourly?

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080
 What's the website?

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080
 Okay, here it comes.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080
 You guys ready?

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080
 Yeah.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080
 Okay.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.080
 So it's www.epa.gov/japan2011/rert/radnet-data.atml.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.080
 Okay, good.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080
 Maybe we'll get a check.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.080
 You get all that?

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080
 I wrote it all down.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.080
 Okay, great.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.080
 Okay, let's try it.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.080
 It's really handy.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.080
 I already looked at it.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.080
 We haven't seen anything unusual anywhere yet.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.080
 Okay.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080
 Okay, it was just the one thing.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.080
 So we'll get you in that department.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080
 After 2011/rert, you said?

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.080
 Yeah, it was 2011/rert.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.080

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:43.080
 And going back to potassium, I know that Carla was asking about bananas, but orange juice

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:49.080
 is very rich in potassium, and potassium will also help your body pick up less cesium like

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.080
 the kelp will help your -- the iodine in the kelp will help your body pick up less radioactive

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.080
 iodine.

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.080
 Yeah.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:02.080
 Fifty years ago, I proposed that the safe thing would be to have industrial-sized greenhouses

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:09.080
 which, if they were going to keep doing the atmospheric bomb test, I suggested that all

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:16.080
 vegetables should be grown in either petroleum or coal-fired greenhouses, providing fossil

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:23.080
 carbon dioxide to avoid the radioactive carbon isotope from the fallout, and using limestone

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:32.080
 as the safe source of calcium for fertilizer and other fossil minerals to give the complete

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.080
 non-radioactive food source for the plants and animals that were being used for food.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:45.080
 But by 1963, the government had agreed to stop testing in the atmosphere.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:52.080
 One of the reasons that I did my newsletter in 1981 on radiation protection was that beginning

00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:00.080
 with that huge burst of atmospheric fallout from the bomb test in 1963, the GORES, all

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:08.080
 kinds of indicators of intelligence, babies born in nine months after 1963's burst of

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:17.080
 atmospheric tests, their SAT scores were showing up in 1981 as the lowest of history, and it

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.080
 turned out people were arguing that it was because more poor students were taking the

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:28.080
 test, but actually it was the high-scoring people who were eliminated from the SAT scores.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.080
 The high scores decreased progressively in proportion to the amount of fallout being

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.080
 produced by the bombs.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.080
 OK, we're going to have to call it a night, Dr. Peat, I'm afraid.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:43.080
 I'd love to hear more, and I know a lot of other people would, but it's one minute to

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.080
 eight o'clock now, so we've got to stop it at eight.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.080
