 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 from 7 to 8 p.m., we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts, which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic supplies.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 And from 7.15 today until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's last-minute topic, as it were,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 of the unfolding facts in Japan.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 I think first and foremost, we want to extend our heartfelt, sincere wishes for the people of Japan,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 that their country could recover and the people there can find relief from a lack of food and shelter

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 and protection and help from all the sources possible to help them cope with this disaster.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So last Friday, there was a 8.9 or 9.0 earthquake which resulted in a tsunami.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 And the tsunami had the unfortunate effect of causing a fairly catastrophic breakdown in the cooling system of Fukushima nuclear power plant.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 We're going to be joined in a moment here by Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 who's an expert physiologist, chemist, research scientist.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And we're going to be hearing from Dr. Raymond Peat about some helpful things to do

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 to counter any potential radioactive spread to this country.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It was probably earlier in the week that I first started finding some Internet-based evidence

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 to show that the spread of radiation from the steam leaked from the plant,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 subsequent to the explosions, the hydrogen explosions on the actual buildings,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 not the containment vessel for the reactor, but the buildings that housed all of the reactor and all the machinery,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 that that steam was laden with things like iodine-131 and cesium isotopes,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 and that these had been released in the steam cloud as the engineers desperately tried to lower the pressure

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 by allowing the steam from the reactor to leave, so it didn't cause any further breakdown of the containment vessel,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 which would certainly result in fairly widespread and very damaging radioactive release.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And one of the reactors, number three, the mixed oxide fuel reactor that contained the plutonium,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 6% plutonium and 94% uranium, that would lead to a much more serious environmental damage if that was released.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 OK, so we started coming out on Wednesday, I think it was, I first started seeing some spreading clouds, as it were,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 in colour, showing a potential spread to the East Coast.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 And then the CTBTO from Vienna released information and it became widespread public knowledge.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 It was no longer something that was on the fringes, but fairly widespread public knowledge.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 And today, that was on Thursday, and today on Friday, quite a few government agencies are also admitting this.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So on Wednesday or Tuesday of last week, they started saying that the radioactive components would be in the upper atmosphere,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 spread by the jet stream, moving east and due to hit the Aleutian Islands on Thursday,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 and then be on the West Coast of America with a spread potentially from Oregon down to California.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 So yesterday I read the CTBTO report online, and indeed this cloud was coming fairly close and was expected to make landfall by Friday.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 So, funnily enough, today in Sacramento, now the CTBTO is the centre of the, basically the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organisation

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 that was set up to monitor the atmosphere for radioactive particles, isotopes, emissions from nuclear testing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 There's a comprehensive test ban on nuclear explosions, and these sites, there are 60 of them around the world,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 and these sites actually measure radiation released from nuclear explosions.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 So the ones in the Pacific were starting to detect this, and actually in Vienna, they released the information.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 I think it was, I don't know if it was a mole or an insider who just wanted to make sure that it got out,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 because as well as radioactive data, the CTBTO collects geophysical information, so it's seismic activity, tsunami activity,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 and then on top of that, the third thing they do is maintain and monitor any radioactive release as a telltale signature from nuclear explosions.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Okay, so they started picking this up, and then on Thursday it was released from Vienna,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 and they said on Friday it would be making landfall in California, and actually today,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 one of the CTBTO stations based in Sacramento actually recorded a very small,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 although they're very small, they're present particles of iodine, I-131,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 and so, you know, it's fairly real that what we have in the upper air jet stream and/or coming down in the rain

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 is potentially going to land here, and that's something we should just be aware of.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 At this point in time, it's still, I would safely say, still fairly small, but it's certainly coming this way all the time now.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 It's made its first landfall from when it first started, and the fires broke out on Saturday or Sunday of last week,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 and so for the last five days, the cloud trail has been coming east.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 So I want to--

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 We're joined by Dr. Ray Peat today, and I want to introduce Dr. Peat and then also ask him from his sources

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 if he believes it true that the radioactive iodine has reached our land yet.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 It's probably present in detectable amounts, but probably not yet biologically significant,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 but it could quickly become concentrated enough to affect pregnant women because the fetus concentrates elements from the environment

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 at least 100 times faster than other tissues, and so during the first two or three months after an accident like that,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 there will be radioactive iodine, which would be concentrating in the embryo and fetus.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Other isotopes such as cesium and strontium would continue to be dangerous if they got into the food supply,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 but the radioactive iodine is one that's most crucial for developing babies.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 So, Dr. Peat, we wanted to go over and discuss what different foods and nutrients could help protect us from increasing levels,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 if it does increase, or more dangerous levels of radioactive iodine that may be present,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 and/or cesium and/or strontium from this cloud that is coming over from Japan,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 and we wanted to go through the list of different things that specifically can block those radioactive particles

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 as well as, in general, what nutrients are protective.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 The first principle is to dilute the radioactive isotopes with good, stable, or relatively stable isotopes,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 and so old food is best.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 The iodine radioactive isotope is practically all gone after three months after the production of it,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 and the others will eventually tend to wash down into the ground,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 and so the plants that grow in the first few months after an accident will contain those isotopes.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 If you have canned food, dried milk, or aged cheese, these are very safe and will continue to be safe for months

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 because they were produced before the accident.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 The other principle besides diluting the isotopes is to increase your resistance to stress and radiation,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 and it happened that my very first newsletter 30 years ago was on radiation resistance

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 and what to do in case of a nuclear accident,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 and at that time I reviewed a couple thousand research articles,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 both from the old AEC, Atomic Energy Commission research, and a lot of it from the Soviet research,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 and the main conclusions that I found were that increasing the metabolic rate,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 which causes cells to retain magnesium,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 magnesium is very important in repairing cell damage,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 and the faster the metabolic rate is, generally the more damage can be repaired

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 before it becomes established as a stress factor in the organism.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 The high metabolic rate produces carbon dioxide,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 which has an antioxidant, anti-stress effect all through the organism,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 and if you keep your metabolic rate up and eat a balanced diet,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 your tissue is going to retain the magnesium it needs out of the food

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 and produce the carbon dioxide it needs,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 assuming that you're getting adequate protein, sugar, fat, vitamins, and a balance of minerals.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 So you mentioned to me earlier that there are ways and foods that we can eat to keep our metabolic rate high,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 as along with taking thyroid.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 So can you expand on what types of sugars and fats and proteins we should be ingesting?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 The ideal fat is coconut oil because the short chain saturated fatty acids compete with the other fats

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 that normally are slowing metabolism and oxidative metabolism,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 and so for a couple hours after you eat more or less a tablespoon of coconut oil per meal,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 for a couple hours your metabolic rate is increased,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 producing more carbon dioxide and accelerating cell repair processes.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And the fruits that come from the tropics, the farther south the fruit is grown,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 the longer it will be free of this high latitude Japanese radiation.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 So oranges grown in Mexico, Brazil, and Florida are still going to be pretty pure in terms of radiation

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 for a very long time.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 And the sugar and the minerals in oranges are very close to what we need.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 So coconut oil, orange juice, and milk is a good source of calcium.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 During the atmospheric bomb tests in the 50s and 60s,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 I got interested in the study the government was doing,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 or they were doing it secretly before it became public for a long time,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 but they were collecting baby teeth from around the world to measure the fallout effects.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And the government began recommending that people not drink milk

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 because milk was contaminated with the strontium,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 which was taken up along with the calcium.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 But I looked at the actual analysis of the food value as well as the isotope content of vegetables

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 and found that a person getting their nutrition from vegetables

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 was going to have about five times higher exposure to strontium-90

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 than people who got their nutrition primarily from milk and cheese

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 because the cows were able to concentrate the calcium

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 and filter out a little more of the strontium than the vegetables were doing.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Yeah, you mentioned to me that in order to get enough calcium

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 to protect against your body's own bone destruction,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 that you would have to drink one to two quarts and eat some cheese daily,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 and that same amount of calcium from green leafy vegetables

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 would be about three pounds of spinach per day.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 Something like that, yeah.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 And then the fact that you're eating so much spinach

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 that could have been contaminated with strontium,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 you'd actually be exposing yourself to much higher levels of strontium.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Yeah.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And can you talk to us about what you'd recommend for elimination methods?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Like if we are breathing in or ingesting radioactive particles,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 what's the best elimination method you find to take?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Because I know there's a lot of stuff on the Internet about all these different things you can take

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 that will help bind the radioactive particles, but what do you recommend, Dr. Peet?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Well, once it gets into your digestive system,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 if it's coming in incorporated in the food, there's really no way to sort it out.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 But if it's in the water, for example,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 if you can just keep a lot of fiber flowing through your system,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 like eating fruit that you know isn't contaminated,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 carrots, for example, if you know that they're safely grown uncontaminated,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 will sweep the material through your intestine,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 preventing the absorption of some nutrients at the same time

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 and if you're exposed to a very concentrated dose from rain or something,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 it's better to go hungry for a little while while sweeping out your intestine.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 So would you consider, just to kind of go back a little bit here,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 but would you consider the radiation that we might have been exposed to thus far

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 dangerous enough to avoid drinking any milk and eating any vegetables from California and Oregon?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Oh, no, not yet.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 If the reactors start burning fuel rods,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 someone is likely to leak the information in time that people can take precautions.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 If it reached the proportions of Chernobyl,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 then it would take extreme measures for a very long time.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Using only stored antique food,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 the older food would become more valuable.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 So it sounds like we need to start stocking up on sugar and dried milk powder.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 Okay, and other things that can help move things along in the intestine

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 are all the various liver herbs and cascara bark powder at all speeds intestinal transit time.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 But I did want to ask you, Dr. Pete, there's a lot of hype around people using potassium iodide already

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 and it's selling out of the stores and people using kelp.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And can you please explain to our listeners how taking kelp or the potassium iodide supplement

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 would help protect them against a high amount of radioactive iodine in our environment?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 It simply dilutes the radioactive isotope when you're taking in a lot of old stable iodine.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 It saturates your thyroid and your thyroid shuts down and stops taking up anymore.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And so you can add radioactive iodine to a saturated person

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 and it just gradually washes out without concentrating at a very high level in the thyroid.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 But if a person is deficient in iodine, almost all of it will, once it gets into the bloodstream,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 it'll stick in the thyroid gland and give an extremely high dose to the gland

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 and even more so to a developing embryo's thyroid gland.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 The fetus will concentrate even more than the mother's thyroid.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 The potassium iodide is very good protection,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 but only from the damage to the thyroid gland.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 It doesn't do anything at all to protect against the other isotopes or the other tissues of the body,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 as some people are saying on the Internet.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 In fact, probably if you took it more than enough to saturate your tissues,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 the Center for Disease Control advocates 160 milligrams one dose.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 If you took that much every day for a long time, your thyroid gland would shut down,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 your metabolism would slow down, and all of your defensive reactions would slow down,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 so you would become more susceptible to injury throughout the rest of your body.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 So you're not recommending that people take any kelp powder or potassium iodide at this current level?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 No.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 The minimum requirement is only 150 or 200 micrograms,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 and even one milligram per day continued for a very long time increases the risk of damage to the thyroid gland.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Thyroiditis appears increasingly when people eat just a milligram of iodine or more.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 And do you know the measurements on how much is in kelp powder,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 how many milligrams is in a teaspoon of kelp or a half teaspoon of kelp?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 No, but probably a half teaspoon.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 I think people have calculated that it would take an ounce to be equal to the Center for Disease Control amount,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 but probably a half teaspoon is adequate to saturate most people.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 But only once we have more information saying there is actually elevated levels of radioactive iodine in our environment?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Yeah, one half teaspoon dose isn't going to hurt anyone, but you don't want to do that every day for a long time.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Andrew, did you have a question?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 No, I think what was, like you were saying, Sarah, the rush on buying potassium iodide was pretty apparent.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 I know I saw plenty of information regarding that.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 And the thing with iodine, if I'm right in saying this, Dr. Peet,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 is that the radioactive iodine that was present in Chernobyl was also responsible for the big increase in thyroid cancers.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 And now you're saying that pregnant women are actually more susceptible even than young children.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 Yeah, Ernest Sternglass, who got interested in the issue when they were doing atmospheric bomb tests.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 The government timed their bomb tests in Nevada so that the wind wasn't blowing towards the big California cities.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 They wanted all of the fallout to go into Utah, and the population of Utah suffered the most from autoimmune diseases and cancer and other diseases.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 But occasionally the rainfall would be so light that no fallout would come down until it got to the East Coast.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 And one of these times, Ernest Sternglass had his students studying how to use their Geiger counters,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 and they found that there was a terrific amount of radiation at the university, which the government hadn't mentioned to anyone.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 And that got him studying it and paying attention to how dishonest the U.S. Public Health Service

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 and Atomic Energy Commission and state public health officials were.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 But he showed that probably there were tens of thousands of miscarriages,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 and the babies that survived a very high percentage were hypothyroid.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Even there was an epidemic of babies born without their thyroid glands.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 As long as they were being breastfed, the mother's thyroid was entering the milk at a high enough level to cover up the symptoms.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 So as soon as they were weaned, they were discovered not to have thyroid glands.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Going back to cover-ups or suppression of information, I found it quite interesting from the moment the tsunami happened

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 and the evolving situation of Fukushima was passing day by day with ever increasing explosions, etc.,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 I found the most information, funnily enough, coming from Russia Today, that news agency there, I think,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 probably not suppressed so much by the West as the BBC even.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 I found the BBC's coverage was pretty good, but I found Russia Today, their coverage was pretty excellent,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 and they had the most up-to-date information, I presume, because the time zone there was much more on a par with Japan.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 So in the waking hours, they were picking up the information as soon as it was being released from sources in Japan.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 But I wonder what would be the best, I guess to keep monitoring Russia Today,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 but the best source for people in America to be able to find out more about local results with real time

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 and real figures to show what actually is in the environment.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 I wonder what would be the best way to go about doing that.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 I don't remember the web address, but there is a good nuclear site, basically an anti-nuclear power site,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 that is getting up-to-date information.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 The other thing was I was looking on eBay, Geiger counters of all things, just to see.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 You know, they're out there, there's hundreds of them on eBay, and they're not expensive,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 and I think a lot of them are kind of post-Cold War, post-Three Mile Island.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 So getting hold of a Geiger counter to actually do some physical measurements yourself.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 For a while, the Internet stores were selling old Soviet Geiger counters for about $15.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 Someone just told me that she and her neighbor had bought two at $35,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 and as soon as the radiation scare hit, the price went up to $75.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Oh my gosh.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Okay, because I saw them on eBay, and they were going for about $150 to $200.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And these were, I forget the, I can get hold of the information pretty quick, but they were all fairly similar.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 They were kind of bright yellow, and maybe about the size of an egg carton.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 So I'm actually holding mine right here, which I got on the Internet.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 I could have paid anywhere.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 I got the cheapest, basically, which cost me about $250.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 I did see even cheaper ones other places, but the really good expensive ones cost $10,000 to $20,000.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 And the little booklet I got with this, I can tell some kinds of radiation from other kinds.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 But I basically have it beeping, and I got it to check out both industrial metals and phosphate fertilizers,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 and I did find some things which are definitely hot by mine.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 It's not beeping much more than normal right now, though.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 Good.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 All right, let's get back to some of those things that people can do.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Yeah, we do have a color on the line, but I did want to at least go through a few more of the anti-radiation nutrients.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 Dr. Peete, caffeine, there's lots of information out there about tea and coffee.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Can you describe to us briefly what the nutrients are in the tea and the coffee

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 and how caffeine helps to protect against radiation?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Coffee is a good source of magnesium and of some B vitamins, niacin especially.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 The caffeine is anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 And so if you happen to have some mobile isotopes that are still in your bloodstream and going through your kidneys,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 caffeine helps to flush them out faster and safely.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 It has a slight chelating effect as well as anti-inflammatory.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 And -- sorry, carry on.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 The things that have an anti-estrogen effect as well as anti-inflammatory,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 the radiation effect itself imitates estrogen in the body.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Everything that estrogen does can be imitated by radiation, including making a rat go into estrus, for example.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 And if you're in a high estrogen state, then you're more susceptible to radiation injury.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And that's why progesterone and thyroid and caffeine,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 by helping to lower estrogen and inflammation, are protective against radiation too.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 So just to recap those, you said caffeine, coffee, because it contains the magnesium and B vitamins,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 progesterone to block the estrogenic effects of radiation, other antioxidants like vitamin E,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 also blocks the effects of estrogen and helps with radiation, and vitamin C and orange juice and tropical fruits.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Vitamin A found in eggs and liver helps in the repair processes.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 I wanted to briefly ask you about the glutathione, that that's been touted to help with radiation damages.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 There's a lot of confusion around glutathione,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 because anything that harms your cells turns on a defensive reaction and increases the glutathione.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 And so a lot of things that have exactly the wrong effect are being suggested

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 on the basis of increasing glutathione.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 But many harmful things by stimulating that defense reaction will increase glutathione.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 And taking a large dose of glutathione in itself,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 animal studies showed that it could be carcinogenic to the liver just by starting free radical reactions rather than stopping them.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Other anti-inflammatories that can help protect against radiation, aspirin,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 of course, which comes from white willow bark, well, not anymore, but originated from white willow bark.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Also, ginkgo, turmeric, those are other herbal anti-inflammatories.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Various adaptogenic adrenal herbs, the lutherow root, American and Korean ginseng,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 have been shown to help with radiation sickness.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 And we mentioned the B vitamins already.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 I wanted you, Dr. Fried, to talk to us about animal liver, which contains a lot of B vitamins

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 and the fat-soluble A, D, E, and K vitamins, and why it's contrary to popular opinion,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 it's actually less toxic than the other parts of the animal.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Yeah, the liver is the main detoxifying organ.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 The kidneys and brain have some of the same detoxifying enzymes,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 but the liver is where a great bulk of detoxification happens.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And there have been studies in which beef were going into the slaughterhouse,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 their urine, blood, and tissues were measured,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 and a large proportion of the animals, more than a third,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 showed chemical contamination in the blood and urine.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 And practically all of them had the same chemicals in their fat and muscle tissues,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 the meats that are most popular,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 but only a very tiny proportion still had any of the toxic chemicals left in their liver.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 For the first 24 hours after you're exposed to an insecticide, for example,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 it will collect in the liver and be bound to a certain kind of protein.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 But during this first day in which it's collecting at a high concentration in the liver,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 the liver begins destroying it.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 And after just about 24 hours, the liver has cleaned itself

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 and then begins the slow process of cleaning the blood

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 as it draws toxins out of the muscles and fat tissues.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 The fats are relatively inert,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 and so the highest toxins accumulate there over the years.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And so the fatty meats are the most risky

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 as far as the chemical poisonings go.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 The liver is the cleanest.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Okay, good.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 There's a caller on the line, so let's start taking the callers

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 because there may well be one behind the other.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Hi. Hello, fellow downwinders of the vast nuclear corporate industrial empire.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 I've been watching the news, and I thought maybe it was the website

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 that Dr. Peete mentioned, a nuclear information site.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 It was on the news.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 A couple of programs had the plume coming from Japan,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 and it indicated that the very first place where it was hitting the West Coast

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 was actually Cape Mendocino from about Eureka to Fort Bragg.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 That was like at 11 o'clock last night they were showing that map.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 That was the initial fallout point of that particular plume.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 And I have a couple of questions concerning it.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 The first one before I forget, the first colon cleanser that you mentioned,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 I didn't quite catch the name of that.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 What was it again?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Grated carrots.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 Raw carrots.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Once again.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Raw carrot salad, like raw carrots.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 Oh, raw carrots.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Okay.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 I had a little static on the line on the radio when you had mentioned that.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 And I understand also garlic is supposed to help bring iodine into the system.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Is that something that you're aware of?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Dr. Peete?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 What was that?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Garlic.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Garlic.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Oh, it has some antioxidant effect, but I don't think it has a big effect on iodine.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Okay.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 And then this weekend we're trying to safeguard ourselves with our potassium iodine salad,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 which is bananas and seaweed.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Is there -- I mean, if we don't really, you know, go out and eat a whole lot of -- I don't know what the flavor is,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 but it's got to be better than the taste with plutonium and uranium that's literally raining down on us.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 Is there a cautionary amount that you would eat of some kind of fruit/sea salad like that that would be reasonable

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 to start maybe implementing some protection?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Dr. Peete, did you hear that question?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 The last part of it I couldn't hear.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Okay.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Well, basically he's suggesting eating a banana and seaweed salad, so to provide potassium.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 Well, the seaweed kelp and dulse, for example, or sea organisms like shrimp and oysters and clams,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 those are good sources of iodine.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 But the banana issue brings up an important aspect of radiation,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 which is bananas are probably one of the richest food sources in serotonin.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 And some biologists, Carmel Mothersill and Colin Seymour, for example,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 have been studying the effects of low-level radiation on cell physiology and communication.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 And they find that at a very low level, ionizing radiation causes cells to produce serotonin,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 among other agents, that even if you take the injured cells out of the organism

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 or the culture dish, the water that they were in when they were injured

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 becomes equivalent to the radiation for other cells.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 The same kind of genetic damage caused directly by the radiation

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 can be caused by the chemicals put into the environment by those injured cells.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 And serotonin at a level above 20 nanograms per milliliter

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 is one of those communicators of radiation damage.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 They, in one of their books, have a study by some of the biologists

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 who worked with the Chernobyl victims,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 both the children who have been living in the region

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 and the people who survived working at the accident.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 And they find that the serum taken from these exposed people 20 years after the accident,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 their serum separated from their blood components,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 added to another person's cells, caused radiation damage equivalent in those cells.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 And since they identified a very small amount of serotonin as one of the factors

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 spreading this inflammation genetic destabilizing material,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 I think it's good to avoid as many sources of serotonin as possible, especially bananas.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 Good.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 Well, so when it's said that somebody is going bananas,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 there's actually a pharmaceutical psychological aspect to that, it sounds like.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Well, I guess I'll be adding raw carrots to our salad and reducing the amount of bananas.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Is there any benefit to eating dried bananas to fresh bananas

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 considering the psychopharmaceutical aspects of the serotonin in there?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 I think shifting towards gelatinous meats away from muscle meats

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 would help to reduce the tendency of the tissues when inflamed to produce serotonin.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 A good balance of vitamins and minerals helps to avoid excess serotonin production during inflammation.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 But all of those anti-inflammatory things that have been mentioned are basically anti-serotonin.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Okay, and my final question on estrogenics concerning ingestion by men.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 I know palmetto is one of those, but is there anything that maybe should be taken

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 to preempt the estrogenic effect of the radionuclides as far as the difference

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 between men ingesting them and women ingesting them?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Or is it at a point where maybe drinking water out of a plastic bottle with a bisphenol A

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 is better than dealing with the radionuclides that that might preempt

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 at least over the next couple of weeks?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 Thank you very much for the program. I'm going to release the line.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Thank you for your call. Dr. Pate, did you hear that gentleman's last--

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Almost, none of it.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 Okay, yeah, we have a little bit of feedback here.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 So he was asking about the anti-estrogenic--

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 what else could men take that's anti-estrogen to help protect against the radionuclides?

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 And also whether you would recommend people drink bottled water

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 versus water from spring or well in the next several months?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Given that the bottled water is a potential source of estrogenic substances.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 I think a good filter for well water is adequate.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 And progesterone is very anti-estrogenic.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 For men, keeping the thyroid function high is the main thing.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Aspirin and thyroid are able to inhibit the estrogen that's produced as a result of stress.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 I've actually just thought of something.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 In the water filter, is the-- because we have water filters that we run our water through,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 the core of the filter is a carbon, a pleated carbon core.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 Is that carbon there?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 Is that able to sequester things like iodine if it was in the water?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Yeah, I think carbon captures almost any solid will absorb to an activated charcoal.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 Okay, good.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 All right, there's two more callers on the line, so let's take the next one.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 You're on the air?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 Hello?

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 Well, the brown seaweeds like wakame and kombu, especially kombu are high in sodium alginate,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 and they're supposed to take all heavy metals and radioactivity out of your body, just not the iodine.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 So don't you think they would be good?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Did you hear that, Dr. Peete?

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Yeah, if they pass through your intestine--

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 Well, yes, eating them.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Yeah, they aren't going to be any more effective than good cellulose.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Anything indigestible that stimulates your intestine will sweep out.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Even with the sodium alginate?

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Well, the trouble is that alginate is very dangerously allergenic for many people,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 so I wouldn't recommend it unless you are sure that you're not sensitive to it.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 I don't know one person that eats the kombu that's ever had allergies to it.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Yeah, dental patients have died, and dental students,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 a very high proportion of the dental students working with alginate to make molds.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Surprisingly healthy young dental students are--

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 Well, that's a concentrate that they made, not a whole food product.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Well, carrageenan is somewhat worse,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 but the alginate itself has the potential to be dangerously allergenic.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 I think in light of raw carrots being so absorptive in the intestinal tract and non-digestible,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 meaning that if they were contaminated themselves,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 when you eat them, you're not going to be absorbing heavy metals,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 and when they wash through your intestinal tract,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 they're going to be absorbing potential heavy metals and radioactive particles.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 Oh, well, I think carrots are a good idea, but so is seaweed, I think.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Well, see, taking too much seaweed will actually lower your metabolic rate and make you--

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Well, too much, yes.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 Well, even eating it daily is enough.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 It doesn't take that much in order to start suppressing the thyroid.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 Okay, you're welcome.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 There's another caller on the line.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 You're on the air.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Oh, hello.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 Yes, what I recommend using is mushrooms.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 There's this mushroom right around here called the turkey tail,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 and it's a nice earthy color, and this one is actually, in Asia,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 is used as an anti-cancer drug because it has a high-quality protein-bound polysaccharide,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 which is discovered very effective in cancer

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 and also in treating cancer patients that have chemotherapy in their survival rates and stuff.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 It also has other qualities, free radical oxidizing compounds and all kinds of things like that.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 And other mushrooms are the same quality, which are called polyporor mushrooms,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 which is the richest one, and these big, thick conks that grow like wood-like looking mushrooms.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 And these mushrooms have been studied in Japan

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 and have been proven to produce the T-cell production and what is that, interleukin production?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 And I was wondering if you know anything about that.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Dr. P, how much do you know about those particular fungi?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 Oh, what was the name of those?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 Well, he mentioned things like the polyphores, the--

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 The turkey tail is the one that grows around here, is the most common,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 and I make a tea from it just by drying it in dust and powder.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 Okay. Do you know that fungi?

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 It's like the most--it actually is the most studied fungi in the world as far as medicinal.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Okay.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Are you speaking about reishi?

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 No, he's talking about--

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 Related to reishi is also polyporor mushroom.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 It's a thick mushroom that--

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Around here, if you look on these trees, there's these--just layers of these mushrooms.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 They're like tricolored mushrooms.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 They're called turkey tails.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 They go like green and brown and with a white edge.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 And they grow on all like the oak trees, maple, all basically hardwood trees.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 And they're the most common mushroom probably in the world.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 They grow in the most--from boreal forest to tropical forest,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 and in every state in the Union except for, I think, Nevada or something.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 I think a lot of the--

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 And they've been studied all over the world.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 And they actually make this commercial thing called crestin, it's actually called.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 It's an anti-cancer drug in Asia.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 Okay. I'm not aware of it, but--

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 I think a lot of the mushrooms have the polysaccharides that are active at absorbing a lot of things from the gastrointestinal tract.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 Right, and that's why I was saying they use them in chemotherapy and stuff like that.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 But I'm just saying that--well, they also have--you know, for other types of things besides antioxidizing compounds.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 But--so I always take mushrooms anyway.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 I'm a big fan of them.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 And I would recommend that people use this mushroom.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 It's growing right on--you look under your oak tree, your apple tree, your big tree over here on the ground,

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 and you look at the dead branches, and you see it's covered with these mushrooms.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 They're very dry.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 They're not--they're dry mushrooms.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 And that is called the turkey tail.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Okay, well, people can check that out on the internet and find out some more about it.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 Yes, it is.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 I'm not too familiar with it.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 It is like--it has been used with Reche.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Okay, I'm familiar with Reche.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 Yeah, and that's another one of the--and the other one around here is--are those--you ever see those mushrooms?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 They're like--they look like a piece of wood, real heavy, thick things growing off of a tree.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Yeah, I've seen those.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 They're called conks, right?

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 Yeah.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Yeah, and that one too has been--has the same quality, many of the same qualities.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 Okay, all right.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 Okay, well, thank you for your call.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 All right.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 I know there's a couple of other people who probably want to get a question in.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
 So let's take the next caller.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Hello?

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 Hi, you on the air?

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 All right, so I have a great website.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 EPA has revamped for the general public so we can easily access the graphical representation of the raw data of the monitoring sites along the West Coast.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 Okay, and that is?

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 So you can see the actual gamma and beta radiation levels--

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 What's the name of the site?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 Hourly.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 What's the website?

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 Okay, here it comes.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 You guys ready?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 I know people are waiting.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 Yep.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 World Wide Web, EPA.gov/Japan2011/rert/radnet-data.html.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 Okay, good.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 Well, maybe we'll get--

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 Did you get all that?

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 I wrote it all down.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 Okay, great.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 Okay, let's try it.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 It's really handy.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 I already looked at it.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 We haven't seen anything unusual anywhere yet.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 Okay.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 Okay, it was just the one thing--

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 So we'll be using that department.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 After 2011/rert, you said?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 Japan2011/rert/radnet-data.html.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 Check.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 Okay, good.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 You can go check that website out and then see how that compares to the CTBTO information,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 especially the one that was published from Vienna on Thursday.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 Yeah, thank you.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 Okay, thank you for having the discussion.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 Good night.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 Okay, bye.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 Any more?

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 I think there's--

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 Oh, yeah, no, we have a full board all the time and Dr. Pete's taking up one line, so

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 people are probably getting lots of busy.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 I have one announcement.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 Someone is teaching a Kunlun Meigong class.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 I'm not sure exactly what that is.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 And it's a strengthening the immune system yoga of some sort, and it's Saturday, 3 to

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 6 p.m. at Stretchy Pants Yoga.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 Call 223-2902 for an immune strengthening class.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Okay, thank you for that.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 Are there any more callers online?

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 Yes, there is.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Okay, good.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Okay.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 Go ahead, you're on the air.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 Yes, I was wondering about using D-ribose to raise the metabolic rate.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 I'm not sure if that's a good idea.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 I mean, I think it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 I mean, I think it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 I mean, I think it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:52:07.640
 I mean, I think it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:27.880
 Okay, there we go.

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.880
 Was that the only question?

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:29.880
 Okay.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.880
 All right, I think they've dropped off anyway.

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.880
 Are there any more callers online?

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.880
 Okay, so let's go back to the useful things that we've learned.

 So, the kelp will help your body pick up less radioactive iodine.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:30.880
 Yeah.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:40.880
 50 years ago, I proposed that the safe thing would be to have industrial-sized greenhouses,

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:50.880
 which, if they were going to keep doing the atmospheric bomb tests, I suggested that all

00:56:50.880 --> 00:57:00.880
 vegetables should be grown in either petroleum or coal-fired greenhouses, providing fossil

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:11.880
 carbon dioxide to avoid the radioactive carbon isotope from the fallout, and using limestone

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:25.880
 as the safe source of calcium for fertilizer and other fossil minerals to give the complete

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:36.880
 non-radioactive food source for the plants and animals that were being used for food.

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:46.880
 But, by 1963, the government had agreed to stop testing in the atmosphere.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:56.880
 One of the reasons that I did my newsletter in 1981 on radiation protection was that,

00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:09.880
 beginning with that huge burst of atmospheric fallout from the bomb tests in 1963, the scores

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:19.880
 of all kinds of indicators of intelligence, the babies born nine months after 1963's burst

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:33.880
 of atmospheric tests, their SAT scores were showing up in 1981 as the lowest of history.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:40.880
 It turned out that people were arguing that it was because more poor students were taking

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:50.880
 the test, but actually it was the high-scoring people who were eliminated from the SAT scores.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:59:00.880
 The high scores decreased progressively in proportion to the amount of fallout being

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.880
 produced by the bombs.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:06.880
 OK, we're going to have to call it a night, Dr. Peat, I'm afraid.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.880
 I'd love to hear more, and I know a lot of other people would, but it's one minute to

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.880
 eight o'clock now, so we've got to stop it at eight.

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.880
