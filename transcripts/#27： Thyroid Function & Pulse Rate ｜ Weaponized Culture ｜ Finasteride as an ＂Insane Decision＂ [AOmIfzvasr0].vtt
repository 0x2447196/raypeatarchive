 And we're going to be talking about the different types of hormones that are involved in the

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:29.000
 process of pregnancy.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:57.640
 So, let's get started.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:20.480
 So, we were just chatting about, you were talking about global warming or so-called

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.800
 climate change and things.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.960
 That might be kind of an interesting place to start in talking about, I don't know, the

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:36.400
 intersection between coronavirus, the elite, global climate, and like the quotes of like

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:44.320
 the Club of Rome talking about how we needed to find a common enemy to unite humanity and

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.800
 that the real enemy was man itself.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:08:08.040
 Yeah, China is just a convenient propaganda object to justify, for example, they say they'll

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:16.240
 be testing new atomic bombs, more usable atomic bombs within a few months.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:28.760
 But that's been the very long-term plan of the Pentagon justifying the invention of planetary

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.080
 warming through carbon dioxide.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:40.400
 Have to change the economy away from carbon energy to nuclear energy so they can have

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:51.720
 a constant supply of nuclear fuel to make bombs as simply a way to focus the attention

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:58.760
 of the world as long as they have nuclear bombs that are more and more usable.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:09.320
 They experience the sense of power that's recognized by everyone.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:15.120
 China is just the momentary focus of why they need the bombs.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:30.400
 But after China is no longer a threat or rules the world, they'll still have to hang on to

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:38.240
 their nuclear bombs just for their police power, even if it's only within this continent.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.520
 They'll still have their nuclear deterrent.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:48.840
 Do you see this ending in a real terrible way, like a war between the US and China or

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.840
 something like that?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:58.880
 No, Russia and China are now getting close militarily as well as economically.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.560
 So basically the US is lost on that basis.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.000
 They wouldn't have a chance in a nuclear war.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.560
 Putin told them that Russia won't allow another war to be fought on their territory.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:25.960
 They've had three great wars that ruined the country each time.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.640
 He said it won't happen again.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:41.440
 So they have demonstrated their weapons that can, at any invasion, they can eliminate the

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:49.840
 source of the invasion, either topically or systemically.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:58.400
 So some people in the conspiracy sector think there's uniformity among these big empires,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.600
 but how much are they trying to do the same thing?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.400
 But you're saying they're radically opposed to each other.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.600
 But for example, the things that China has done are really similar to what the US is

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.800
 doing right now in terms of controlling the citizenry.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.600
 But you're saying, are they just in a race to how fast they can get more control over

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.100
 the population?

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:31.280
 The US isn't very sympathetic with their concept.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:43.840
 China is very focused on public health and education, and the US is always behind on

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.760
 public consciousness and education supported by good health.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:59.800
 They're doing things that have massively ruined the public's health, which drags down the

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:07.200
 way they're performing intellectually and productively.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:15.000
 They see that China, continuing as things are with a more or less even playing field,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.200
 China is obviously imminently winning the game.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:29.720
 So they're trying to change the rules fast enough that they can get ahead.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:37.160
 According to Eric Schmidt's description of the situation, a very detailed discussion

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:52.800
 of how artificial intelligence is to be used to preempt China's digitalization of the economy

00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:00.440
 of the world.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.800
 So why would the United States be stupidly destroying its own population, considering

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.560
 that they need that population to be as productive and as healthy as possible, even though it

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.400
 may be done without good intentions, just to make sure the slaves are healthy, so to

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400
 speak.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.360
 But it seems like that's not being done.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.360
 It's like it's the opposite.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.920
 The population is being absolutely decimated educationally and nutritionally and health-wise.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.360
 How does that help the empire?

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.560
 Or is the empire basically saying, "Oh, we don't care about the population.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.760
 Our approach is we're just going to neutralize any competitive threat that comes through"?

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:44.960
 Yeah, that thing of automation and artificial intelligence has been such a deep part of

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:56.040
 them since the 1930s, that since then, they have considered public education as a drag

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040
 on the system.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.400
 It's just a waste of resources.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.560
 Yeah.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.880
 People were talking about it all through the '40s.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:18.760
 It was just a little over 50 years ago that it became a very open public policy that they

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:30.760
 were set on peonizing the whole United States, taking policy choices that would reduce income

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:37.200
 growth for nearly everyone in the country while concentrating it.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:49.160
 Reaganism was simply one stage of this process in peonization.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160
 So here's another question.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.640
 I mean, with all this military power, all these nuclear weapons, all this technology,

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:02.040
 if the empire really wanted to out-compete everybody else, why can't they just colonize

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.640
 the moon or Mars?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.360
 There's this endless, infinite universe out there, and all these resources and energy

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.760
 and equipment could have gone towards making the empire a galactic force or at least a

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.360
 solar system force.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.680
 Instead, the efforts are focused here on attacking other people who are raising their head.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:37.320
 Yeah, the thought of having a world of peons is such an emotional part of it.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:47.880
 The ruling class hates the idea of competition from ordinary people.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:16:01.280
 So choices way back were meant to degrade as many people as possible by lowering the

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:12.720
 quality of schooling at all levels and nutrition, having diets scaled economically.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:23.640
 I started that in the '30s, and in Los Angeles, I saw doctors are trained to do that.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:37.160
 Grains, pasta, and beans as the economy diet, and then seafood and fruit and dairy foods

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.560
 for the privileged diet.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.320
 So would it be fair to say that a psychopath is always seeking out conflict with other

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:53.040
 people even though that psychopath has the opportunity to colonize the solar system?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.840
 They're saying, "Nope, there's no people there.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.680
 There's nobody to enslave.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.200
 So we're going to focus our efforts here on Earth because there's other people we can

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.080
 torment and peonize."

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.760
 We're choosing that way because there's nothing out in the solar system.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:19.320
 Nelson Rockefeller and Franklin Roosevelt had agreed, the two party leaders, on the

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.360
 post-war world.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:33.000
 They were to develop first Latin America as part of our economic system, build them up

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 as a consumer economy, and then Africa and Asia would come at later stages.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.880
 But a Marshall Plan for the world was the idea to get the whole world up to speed so

00:17:51.880 --> 00:18:01.480
 that capitalism could continue as a growing, productive system.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:13.440
 But the faction that took over with Truman, the Dulles faction, they were the elite haters

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:20.880
 of the public, and South Americans were less than the public.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.160
 Have you heard the rumor that FDR was murdered?

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.240
 I think actually you mentioned this once in your interviews, right?

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.120
 Oh yeah.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.160
 The Roosevelt family was convinced of it, Stalin was convinced of it, and anyone who

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:48.920
 knew what the Dulles, Alan Dulles, what he had been doing during the war was treason.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:58.440
 It came out that Stalin's spies told Roosevelt what Dulles had been doing, working for the

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:06.680
 Nazi army, and Roosevelt said, "Oh, that isn't possible, that would be treason."

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:14.520
 And it took a couple of weeks for the facts to come through his system, because it was

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.400
 held up by the German Dulles intelligence apparatus.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:28.720
 It took a long time to ever reach anywhere in the United States, but meanwhile Roosevelt

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720
 had died.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.640
 Ray, do you think the different power elite factions, do you think they're on the same

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:45.000
 page about installing killer austerity in every way imaginable?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.880
 For example, Webster Tarpley in his book, The Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, says

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.760
 Soros is also associated with a series of projects designed to assault traditional moral

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.320
 values such as championing of legalized narcotics to be made freely available, inevitably to

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.560
 young people as well.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.800
 And you mentioned the food system and just the culture in general.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.720
 Do you think they're all generally on the same page about that?

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:22.480
 Yeah, the CIA financing itself by selling drugs in the big cities in the US, that has

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:28.160
 been documented over and over.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:38.600
 They were profiting in two ways, by destroying poor people in the US and financing their

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.720
 illegal operations with drug money.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:47.480
 What was the name of the journalist that wrote about the crack epidemic being started by

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.840
 the CIA and he was found with two bullet holes in his head and three independent inquiries

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.840
 ruled that it was suicide?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.840
 Web something?

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:04.480
 Yeah, sort of hard to shoot yourself twice in the head.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.080
 Did you hear about the death of China's ambassador to Israel?

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.080
 No.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.400
 Oh no, when did that happen?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.040
 A couple of weeks ago.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:28.560
 China has been making big deals in technology with Israel and Pompeo visited Netanyahu trying

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:38.600
 to get him to stop the deals with China, but then suddenly China's ambassador, who had

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:49.400
 been the agent for building infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, he

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:57.200
 died in his sleep at the age of 57, just about a month after taking the office.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:03.200
 It reminds me of the Iranian nuclear scientists who basically started mysteriously dying all

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.040
 over the world while giving talks.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:12.200
 It happened maybe close to 10 years ago and then they found out it was Mossad agents using

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.680
 fake British passports that were present at the same conferences.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:28.240
 This assassination really implies that the US is inside the Mossad because it was absolutely

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.120
 against Israel's interests.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.360
 That's actually a pretty interesting point.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360
 So it's okay.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.800
 Okay, so I've heard the opposite, that Mossad has infiltrated the CIA, but you're saying

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.400
 it's the other way around?

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.760
 Probably both.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.720
 They're the same agency.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.400
 It's just different branches across the world, right?

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.400
 Yeah.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.440
 Well, I mean, there was somebody who said that you've never criticized Israel before.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.560
 What is your, and I know that's not true, but what is your general take on that situation?

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.560
 That I've never criticized Israel?

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.800
 It was an internet comment, so don't take it with too much weight.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:18.320
 No, I think it was in 1976, all of my Jewish friends, it seemed like most of my friends

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:30.760
 from all through the late 50s and 60s seemed to be Jews, but suddenly the attitude of,

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:42.320
 they were starting to confound Zionism with Jewishness, and suddenly if you criticized

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:52.760
 Zionism, which I was doing constantly, they were calling you anti-Semitic.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:24:01.880
 From the mid 70s, my criticism of Zionism has been very steady.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.720
 So it turns out that internet commentator was wrong.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:11.440
 So I have a question related to that.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.880
 I mean, as I'm sure, Ray, you've noticed that if you try to seek out the truth and you hold

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:23.200
 opinions that are not very popular, you're probably going to be a little bit more alone

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.640
 than most other people.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.480
 Would you say that that's the case?

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.480
 Just because you'll be so out there for many people, and even if they don't disagree with

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.000
 you, they will think like, that's just too crazy for me to even consider, so I'm not

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.880
 going to associate with that person.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.720
 Oh yeah.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:45.200
 Look at Gilbert Ling and his students.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:55.080
 As long as his graduate students supported the work they were doing, they couldn't get

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.400
 jobs.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:09.480
 They were non-existent, and so those who wanted to continue in biology had to renounce him.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:14.880
 They just weren't doing that anymore.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.920
 So do you, in your social life, do you sometimes conceal your opinions because you don't want

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.200
 to, I don't know, drive away your friends?

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:30.120
 Or do you pretty much say what you mean, and if they leave, then so be it?

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:36.560
 I've never been a big party attender, but I never went to a party before.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:43.560
 I probably didn't offend most of the people there by talking about what I was interested

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560
 in.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.040
 Well, Ray, sometimes I feel like we've had a conversation and I've said something totally

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.720
 wrong, but you didn't necessarily immediately inject that I was wrong, and then I would

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.080
 find out three months or four months later that I in fact was really wrong.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.000
 I took that as maybe, and you do this, maybe, and again, my perception of maybe to all people,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.360
 but Maslow has that quote where he says that, this is semi not related, but when he talks

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.360
 about letting somebody go through their pain and not telling them not to feel that way,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.280
 so maybe that's a sign of respect that you don't just immediately correct somebody if

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.560
 they don't think exactly like you do?

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:35.840
 For a long time I've thought that that's a necessary thing everywhere, especially on

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.160
 any important political issue.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:49.120
 If you're in a movement, the Occupy Wall Street failed to do that.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:58.280
 They insisted that everyone had to have the same opinion and they just stopped existing.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:07.320
 If you have some things in common that you agree on, you have to respect the person for

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:14.320
 having all of those right ideas and forget about their mistakes or omissions.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:21.760
 Before we launch off in a different direction, can you say what Zionism is and maybe why

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.800
 you disagree with it?

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:30.880
 Because that might be a new concept to some people listening to this.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:38.440
 Do you know about the protocols of the elders of Zion?

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:46.040
 Those principles are being freshly stated over and over again.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:58.400
 It was an idea that was current at the end of the 19th century.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:10.320
 After Israel was founded, leading rabbis there have repeatedly restated exactly what they

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:20.480
 have in mind, definitely not staying within the borders the UN, British Empire, and United

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.280
 States gave them.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:28.200
 And then in the past few episodes and some of the other interviews you've done, you've

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.920
 been pro-Trump in this situation.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:38.680
 And I know things are very complex, but one of the main things that some people say against

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.580
 Trump is that he's in the pocket of Israel.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:48.460
 And so how do you unpack that situation?

00:28:48.460 --> 00:29:02.960
 The important thing is that from Truman down through Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, and Hillary

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:15.320
 Clinton, the main thrust of US intention was destruction of Russia first and then China

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320
 second.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:27.680
 And Trump was an interruption of that long, almost 70-year pattern.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.240
 Good stuff.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.640
 Go ahead.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:39.080
 Yeah, I was going to say, so maybe it's more accurate to instead of Zionism to call it

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.080
 Bencunism.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:46.880
 I mean, at this point I think it includes a very diverse set of people that maybe the

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.840
 majority of them are associated with the Zionist movement, but I think at this point most of

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:57.400
 the mega rich people are either inadvertently or sometimes even forced to be part of this

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:05.880
 because their interests are aligned with the interests of the financial powers of the world.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.120
 Yeah.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:17.440
 He definitely is not against the ruling class, just different factions and processes within

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.440
 it.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:30.120
 But I think the avoidance of nuclear annihilation, at least for eight years, has been a great

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120
 achievement.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:39.240
 So there's a little bit of nuance here of what power elite that staves off total destruction.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:50.760
 Yeah, the semi-conscious power elite that doesn't want the world to get incinerated.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:57.000
 And do you see, I'm sure this is very complex, but like the Rockefellers and their eugenics

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.960
 kind of killer austerity plan, is that different from the Rothschilds' Third Temple Zionism

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960
 plan?

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.600
 Or do they have compatibilities and incompatibilities?

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.320
 Yeah, I think they're compatible.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:18.000
 But were the Rockefellers necessarily interested in Israel the way the Rothschilds are?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:26.680
 No, not that I know of.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:37.040
 Either way, almost everyone ends up as disposable property.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:42.600
 At what point do you think the old school, white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, sort of established

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:47.200
 powers merged with the Zionist powers to create this global elite?

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.840
 Because I think you said in some of your interviews that it used to be those old, white, rich

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.880
 people, and then I guess sometime around the early 20th century started getting shifted

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.720
 heavily towards Zionism.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:02.760
 But at this point, they seem merged, wouldn't you say?

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760
 Yeah.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:09.440
 We can move on after this, but Rupert Murdoch being an agent of the Rothschilds and buying

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:15.920
 up all the media, do you think that was a big part of, I don't know, obviously that

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.720
 was key in controlling the opinions and thoughts of a lot of people that media take over?

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.320
 Oh yeah.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:32.840
 The New York Times, too, is in harmony with Murdoch's.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.720
 This is pretty related, but I think this was a message to Jahed.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:40.540
 You said, "The reason I talk more about biology than politics is that various radical

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:45.040
 movements generally have inflexibilities that keep them apart."

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:50.040
 And so that made me think of our current situation, like coronavirus is dying down and then immediately

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:57.680
 we have this death in Minnesota and that is propagated all over the media.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:03.160
 When this kind of thing happens, not to dissect this specific event, but when this kind of

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.880
 thing happens, what is your thought process?

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:13.400
 Is it a conditioning type thing to move us in a certain direction?

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:33.320
 Accidents, personal, stupid murders will be taken advantage of to excite racial hostility,

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:46.520
 but I think there are enough accidental racist events happening that it's just a matter of

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:57.240
 how the media presents them and who is there to either try to point out what should be

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:08.860
 done that you should immediately start fixing police forces rather than making it a matter

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:16.720
 of racial identity primarily and then postponing actual changes.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.240
 I have a question about that.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.360
 We said a few times that the rich have always used these racial tensions as an instrument

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.600
 to keep the public's attention away from the really pressing issues and forcing the

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.320
 poor to fight over crumbs while they're stealing everything.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.720
 But don't you think it's a little bit dangerous for them to be playing that game?

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:45.560
 One of these days, one of those racial incidents can lead to a revolution and in a revolution,

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.020
 everything gets destroyed, including the masters that are thinking they're in control.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:57.120
 Why would somebody continuously use that dangerous fire that they set up in the living room while

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.560
 they're sitting in the bedroom thinking they're safe, but at some point might consume the

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.000
 entire house?

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.920
 They have atom bombs backing them up.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:19.720
 They've used Israel to train the police in military tactics so that they have all of

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:27.120
 the non-nuclear military weapons that they can use.

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:37.700
 If that fails to hold down a revolution and a whole part of the state decides to secede

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:46.980
 and become democratic, then they have the tactical nuclear weapons that can be used

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.980
 for crowd control.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.980
 We've talked about this before.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:55.140
 That's called the Samsonite plan or something?

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.020
 The Samson plan is Israel's plan, basically.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.660
 At some point, Israel feels like they're starting to get overwhelmed by their enemies.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.460
 They're just going to launch their 400-plus, I don't know how many nuclear warheads.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.340
 I think they even have a count that the US Department of Defense secretary, I think it

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:13.420
 was Roosevelt, who actually gave it away.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.900
 Let's say about 400 nuclear warheads.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:20.580
 Apparently, they're all pointed to major capitals and cities and economic centers of the world

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.580
 that these rockets can reach.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:28.940
 Basically, Israel has said, "You will defend us," by you meaning the world community.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.980
 If Israel is about to disappear from the map, we'll make sure that the world will disappear

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:44.660
 as well by nuking everything.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:56.140
 In the background, for most of the Cold War, they had their doomsday weapon or doomsday

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.300
 system.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:12.420
 It was a nuclear bomb surrounded by tons and tons of plutonium to create a radiation cloud

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.380
 that would end the world.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:41.820
 People like the famous conservative, Buckley, was

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:52.860
 making the explicit argument that people should prefer to die rather than let the Soviet Union

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:58.820
 govern the world or even survive.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:07.220
 He said that God will sort us out if we're all dead.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:13.220
 We win anyway, so better red than dead.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:19.340
 That was put into the concrete doomsday system.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.660
 I just want to give an example to the people.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:28.340
 I've talked to people about potentially the U.S. government using any kind of weapon that

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.900
 they deem necessary to quell dissent.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.780
 Most of our friends are saying, "You're insane.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.620
 The U.S. government will never do that."

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.660
 But apparently they already did.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:45.180
 There was an incident in the mid-1980s in Philadelphia where the police bombed an entire

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:53.180
 block because there was one house that was housing this black militant group called MOVE.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:39:03.020
 Yeah, a helicopter dropped bombs on the roof and burned the building up and killed everyone.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.820
 Same idea as in Waco.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:19.500
 A tank with flamethrowers and sharpshooters were killing people trying to escape, so they

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:25.660
 intentionally burned the dissident Christians.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:36.060
 Even though they were, I think, mostly white, they were totally dissenting, so they were

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.980
 fit to be murdered in mass.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.180
 And, Ray, I think on the last, maybe the last episode, you talked about how, was it the

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.300
 FBI or the CIA that has infiltrated like every fringe movement?

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.700
 And of course, like a historical example of that is COINTELPRO.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:56.340
 Expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:02.260
 And that was like American Indian groups, Black Panther groups, and anti-Vietnam War

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.260
 groups.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.340
 Yeah.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:15.540
 Even more moderate groups are controlled.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:27.140
 The whole New Left was a creation of the intelligence organizations.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:43.180
 The Congress for Cultural Freedom was strictly CIA, but they created the whole idea of a

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:57.860
 New Left organization using supposedly progressive leftists.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:10.220
 You know, the Trotsky movement, after Trotsky failed to take over Russia, he started working

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:23.220
 with the Nazis and the FBI and US intelligence organizations to create a takeover movement

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:30.900
 in Russia from within, which is standard policy.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:39.860
 They undoubtedly have it in China and Russia now, doing everything they can.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:45.460
 What Georgie, I'd want to harp on as much as possible of people not believing how bad

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.820
 their government intelligence agencies could possibly be.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:55.100
 You know, like Ray, we talked about Project Northwoods, which was kind of the mock bombing

00:41:55.100 --> 00:42:01.200
 of a plane or sending a plane into, oh my God, I'm screwing this up, sending a plane

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.740
 into Cuba with like fake people on it.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.740
 But also the CIA's strategy of tension during Operation Gladio.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.620
 And one of the operatives says, you were supposed to attack civilians, women, children, innocent

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.660
 people outside the political arena for one simple reason, to force Italian public to

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.140
 turn to the state to ask for greater security.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.540
 And so people not knowing this stuff, that's just part of what they're doing.

00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:30.900
 They're kind of indoctrinating people with these things that we're talking about that

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:34.820
 are historical fact being so-called conspiracy theory.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:47.940
 I doubt that most Americans have paid any attention to the news that Syrian wheat crops

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:58.860
 across the country are being firebombed by US helicopters, which is even during war,

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.540
 it's a war crime, but it's a crime against humanity.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.740
 It's such a trivial thing.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.340
 I haven't seen much talk about it.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.740
 I have a question.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.060
 I mean, it's related, but it's more general than that.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:19.420
 Do you think that if evil triumphs and it basically has its way, do you think that evil

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.380
 is stable as a structure?

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.220
 Do you think at some point it will simply collapse because that's just not how nature

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.660
 works and it's almost like against physical laws?

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.620
 Or do you think it will last indefinitely if it achieves complete control?

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:48.540
 Yeah, they always need the abject obedience in sufficient quantity to let them have servants

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:53.780
 and murderers, assassins, and so on.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:44:10.540
 And at some point that dwindles, they get weakened by their use and their expendability

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:14.700
 makes them, I think, unsustainable.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:20.900
 Do you think that that may be one reason behind the collapse of most empires?

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:23.700
 Because they all seem to follow a pretty similar script.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:24.700
 There is a peak, right?

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:29.940
 And there is this long decline through which, of course, there is increase in authoritarianism,

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.860
 police state, et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.540
 And eventually there is this rapid collapse.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:41.980
 But this idea of evil triumphed and then it collapsed because it triumphed, that seems

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.260
 to be a repeating theme across history.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:49.220
 Yeah, they keep increasing their power.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:54.180
 The use of power is mainly to increase the power.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:45:04.300
 And when you keep increasing the power, like the concentration of wealth, just the concentration

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:16.780
 of wealth is pretty soon going to mean that Amazon owns everything and everyone else is

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.780
 expendable.

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:26.740
 So you'll have one corporation and what will they do to increase their power?

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:33.140
 The board of directors is going to start fighting for who has the most power.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.900
 I see.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:40.700
 Ray, I quoted, you responded to somebody in email and you said, "No, a person is never

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:44.700
 again the same after reacting to an aluminum adjuvant.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:49.580
 The official figures of the US government show clearly that the epidemic of chronic

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.300
 diseases began with the massive increase of vaccination in 1989."

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.780
 And that created quite a...

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.180
 I don't go on Facebook very often, but I posted that on there and it riled a lot of people

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.180
 up.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.380
 So do you want to offer more information or context about that?

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:10.360
 Because this is a very real thing that's probably in the works or it has already been worked

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.780
 out and is probably coming pretty soon.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:19.340
 What do you think people need to know about rolling up their sleeve and getting a vaccine

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.100
 from Gates et al.?

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:33.060
 The size of a baby's brain, especially in relation to its body length at birth, has

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:47.020
 been growing from early 20th century steadily down to the 1970s.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:58.940
 In some countries, it has actually in the 1980s begun shrinking and I think that's a

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:08.020
 pretty good worldwide indicator of the state of well-being and of deterioration.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:14.500
 Are you familiar with the Flynn effect, which is the parallel increase in IQ all the way

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:20.140
 up until the mid-1970s and after that it's been basically in decline and there aren't

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:23.620
 even any trials, it's just declined?

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:32.620
 Do you know of Ernest Stern's study of the SAT scores?

00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:38.220
 Yes, I've seen that and I've also seen the sperm counts and testosterone levels in males

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:42.660
 have been precipitously declining since the 70s and they're matching perfectly that

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:47.540
 declining curve in IQ as well.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:55.940
 Brain size in relation to body and IQ and probably several other indicators of general

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:05.060
 well-being have all stopped increasing and begun declining.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:14.180
 I think you can see it even in body shape and facial shape.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:18.700
 Some people pointed out, Ray, that you, I mean my limited experience of reading your

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:23.300
 stuff like some people have said and I agreed that I've never heard you say like a person

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:33.020
 is never again the same and so is there something specifically really harmful about the aluminum?

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.820
 What is it about the aluminum adjuvant?

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:43.420
 No, anything you do, you're always in process.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.500
 Heraclitus didn't miss anything.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:49:01.140
 There is nothing that is ever constant and so if you ate chocolate rather than strawberry

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:05.980
 ice cream, you're never going to be the same again.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:06.980
 That's what I thought.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.740
 It was like shifting a trajectory of a person's life in just a different direction.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:20.700
 Yeah, yeah and there are some things that shift the trajectory more seriously and more

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.260
 downward.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:31.380
 Radiation and stuff injected into your muscles or brain are especially harmful.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:40.140
 The radiation is equivalent because it affects things at the deepest levels the same way

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:49.580
 injected materials do or inhaled or swallowed nanoparticles that go everywhere in the body

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:59.020
 which are just sitting there ready to make genes out of the RNA ready to translate it

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:09.100
 into not only DNA to make the spike protein to create an inflammatory reaction that will

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:16.980
 lead to immunity but DNA that can be incorporated into our genes so that our offspring will

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:25.860
 continue making that spike protein and if we don't make enough of it to kill the person

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:38.220
 within the year before they start mass producing the vaccine, a very large portion of the volunteer

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:46.380
 subjects for this vaccine have had serious reactions.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:55.020
 They call it a grade three serious reaction that might involve hospitalization.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:51:10.100
 No one died so they went on but the incorporation of RNA will undoubtedly have effects that

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:19.860
 are going to be at least somewhat harmful, maybe progressively harmful all the way to

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.300
 killing the person.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:27.940
 In terms of transgenerational effects, I know you've mentioned this before related to

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:34.460
 the vaccines but which generation do you think would have it worst?

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.060
 Would it be like third, fourth, fifth or would it be even further down the line?

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:42.500
 It seems like the first generation that gets it gets harm but maybe it'll survive.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.980
 Then the second generation it may get skipped but the third one seems to be really where

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.460
 the bomb explodes.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:59.060
 I think it depends on what the individual confronts in each generation.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:11.100
 The number of genes specifying making a human being in our genome is somewhere around one

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:22.500
 to two percent of our DNA and around half of our DNA specifies retroviruses and each

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:32.140
 of those retroviruses is recognizable because it has a reverse transcriptase.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:41.020
 These are probably when we're under stress, these are expressed to different degrees.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:53.540
 When we're well fed and happy, we can take in something like the spike protein RNA, pack

00:52:53.540 --> 00:53:06.340
 it away as a potential virus but keep it out of the way.

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:19.700
 Transgenic or epigenetic effects are under control but anything that creates a great

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:33.940
 problem, our system opens up this vast library of genetic material, shakes out some stuff,

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:40.900
 produces exosomes from it which resemble viruses.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:46.620
 We're constantly to the degree that we're under stress.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:55.420
 Our cells are manufacturing exosomes just about the same size and structure of the coronaviruses

00:53:55.420 --> 00:54:06.460
 and other viruses and these are used to adapt to whatever it is that's bothering us, aging

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:21.460
 or infection, poisoning, whatever that shakes up the organism arouses some degree of this

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:34.940
 library of reference DNA material and adding one bit to it might not come out for 20 generations

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:47.340
 but it's still idiotic to put the most toxic protein, the spike protein, to put the RNA

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:53.860
 specifying that in our library of resources.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:55:01.660
 Speaking of messing up with our DNA and transgenerational effects, people ask you multiple times about

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:06.420
 your opinion on GMO crops and I think you usually said that something along the lines

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:12.340
 of that, these artificial genes that are there could be highly allergenic but I haven't seen

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:17.700
 you say much in terms of whether this could have a transgenerational effect.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.700
 Do you think it may?

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.700
 Oh sure.

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.700
 Everything has a transgenerational effect.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:27.900
 Are you familiar with the epicide gene that Monsanto patented?

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:32.460
 It's called EPICYT epicide gene.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.460
 I don't know.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.460
 I haven't heard of it.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:39.780
 So apparently this is, I mean, it can be Googled but it is an artificially created gene for

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:45.540
 corn that specifically makes human males sterile.

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:52.260
 Now I have no idea why Monsanto would be interested in such a gene unless they really had an intention

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:58.500
 of using it but apparently there are genes in the plants that can actually cause direct

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:02.020
 sterility effects and no vaccine is needed.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:07.980
 So I've been thinking lately about how all of these efforts to conceal the labeling of

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:13.180
 the food in the United States and even in the entire Western world to prevent people

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.900
 from knowing whether they're eating genetically modified food or not.

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:21.220
 So if the powers that be want to do population control, it seems like they can do it through

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.980
 food as well.

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:27.980
 Yes.

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:44.340
 The everything in a vaccine practically is adequate to create allergies in a young person

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:47.180
 receiving it.

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:58.660
 And if you include the nucleic acid as this new vaccine is doing, well, the old vaccines

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:10.740
 all have nucleic acids in them as dirt, egg or other animal tissue or embryo tissue that

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:15.140
 is used to grow the viruses for the vaccine.

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:22.340
 That always leaks proteins and nucleic acids from what they grow it in.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:28.060
 So those are among the things that people are being made allergic to by injecting it

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.460
 into them.

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:40.460
 That's how you create an experimental allergy in animals and no one denies that it is in

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:50.500
 the composition of genes and so accounting for the 25 fold increase in young people's

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.500
 allergies.

00:57:51.500 --> 00:58:01.820
 And now that they're acknowledging that they're putting a nucleic acid in everyone who receives

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:09.540
 the vaccine is going to have to be labeled genetically modified organism.

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:13.740
 Speaking of protection from vaccines, I'm sure you've seen that most of the adjuvants

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:21.140
 that are in there, they target the endotoxin receptor TLR4 or one of the TLRs.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:26.420
 So would it be pertinent to administer something if somebody, let's say somebody doesn't have

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:30.740
 a choice, is forced to be vaccinated, maybe they're in the military or work in the healthcare

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.740
 industry.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:38.620
 Do you think that blocking that receptor before getting that vaccine would confer some protective

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:41.740
 effects if the endotoxin?

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:50.500
 Everything anti-inflammatory that you do is going to tend to inhibit that.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:59:00.740
 Everything you do that is stressful is going to sensitize it and that's happening with

00:59:00.740 --> 00:59:04.260
 any vaccine.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:21.340
 The inflammatory system arranged around the endotoxin inflammation system, everything

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:32.100
 you do risks activating that and that activates histamine, serotonin, and so on.

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:42.060
 Everything that's involved in the coronavirus disease, so-called, the real disease is just

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:46.460
 a very standardized stress disease.

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:59.220
 That's why it overlaps so perfectly with sepsis or high altitude pulmonary edema, ARDS caused

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:14.780
 by trauma, everything that tends to kill you tends to create the same condition.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:27.300
 Some people react badly to the coronavirus where 70% or so don't notice they have anything

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:30.940
 worse than maybe a sniffle.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:44.740
 But there have been eight or ten studies that looked at the outcome of people who had been

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:59.220
 given the influenza shots and the huge campaign in Italy and the US last year to push influenza

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:04.060
 vaccine on old people.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:12.180
 According to the results of these several studies, people who were vaccinated against

01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:23.900
 influenza, according to their arguments, had somewhat less cases of influenza, maybe 45%

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:34.980
 protection, but they were as much as five or six times as likely to have other respiratory

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:36.780
 infection.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:47.580
 So, just looking at those figures, you would say that the great vaccination campaign of

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:57.900
 old people, total of approaching 170 million in the US, I don't know how many in Italy,

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:07.020
 if you doubled or tripled or quadrupled the number of non-influenza respiratory diseases,

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:14.580
 you would expect to have a much higher percentage of coronavirus infections, which is what we

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.540
 did see.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:25.060
 So in principle, just taking a hefty dosage of aspirin about an hour before a forced vaccine

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.580
 would be a decent attempt to protect yourself?

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:39.300
 Yeah, very good, because all of these things, angiotensin activates, among other things,

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.500
 the prostaglandins.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:49.460
 And if you stop the prostaglandin storm, you reduce all of the cytokine storm.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:53.060
 But aspirin is just one of the protective things.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:03:05.740
 The blockers of angiotensin itself, angiotensin receptor blockers, stop at its source, the

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:11.300
 cytokine storm, inflammatory storm.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:24.300
 And you might have heard that in Italy, one place, the mortality of men was four times,

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:32.900
 well, 82% of the deaths were men, 18% women.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:43.140
 But one big study across the country found between three and four times as many men as

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:47.060
 women dying.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:04:06.740
 And the only premenopausal women in more than 1,000 cases who died were radically abnormal

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:13.980
 and hormonal, other extreme metabolic problems.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:23.940
 And several studies have documented in the US, it's maybe two and a half times as many

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:27.100
 dead men as women.

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:34.420
 But probably in the US, more women are supplementing estrogen.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:46.020
 And estrogen, well, it's reciprocal, estrogen increases angiotensin and angiotensin activates

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.740
 aromatase.

01:04:48.740 --> 01:05:01.420
 And so women, especially after menopause, if they're taking extra estrogen, are equivalent

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:06.420
 to having lower progesterone.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:17.220
 Even in old age, men have much lower progesterone than women, but their estrogen, an old man's

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:20.860
 estrogen is often the same as an old woman's.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:27.980
 It's the progesterone that's extremely different.

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:36.660
 The other big natural difference that shows up in the figures is that high altitude mortality

01:05:36.660 --> 01:06:01.260
 is about three to four fold lower in Bolivia, western China around Tibet, and other South

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:09.820
 American countries, and looking at the high plateau states of Mexico, it was around three

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:18.940
 times as high in the low altitude states as in the central plateau states.

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:29.380
 And the only hormone difference that is extreme at very high altitude is progesterone, which

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:34.660
 increases adaptively and protectively.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:45.620
 When you're able to adapt, you keep your carbon dioxide very high, and that goes with allopregnanolone

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:51.460
 and progesterone metabolites being elevated.

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:57.460
 To shift gears a little bit, I forget what article it was, but it was a James W. Prescott

01:06:57.460 --> 01:07:03.220
 article, it's Body Pleasure and the Origins of Violence in 1975.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.500
 And just a snippet from that, it's, "And the greatest threat comes from the nations which

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:13.940
 have most depriving environments for their children, which are most repressive of sexual

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.300
 affection and female sexuality."

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:22.340
 So that makes sense to me, but I'm also interested in kind of the things we've talked about before,

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:27.780
 kind of the sexualization of the culture and how that's kind of used as a weapon.

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:34.260
 And so where is the healthy middle ground between those two things?

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:39.740
 Between middle ground, between which things?

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.140
 Do you remember it?

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:45.580
 It's the James W. Prescott article, it's called Body Pleasure and the Origins of Violence.

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.220
 And then the only thing I didn't read off is in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, like

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:54.140
 a 1946 edition, he said, "As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.220
 tends to compensatingly increase."

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.900
 And so that, I mean, just in my limited view, that kind of seems like what we're going through

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:08.140
 now, like just these ever growing series of sexual revolutions as our normal freedoms

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.900
 diminish over time.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:16.140
 And so, I don't know, maybe just your general thoughts of sexualization being used as a

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:21.340
 type of weapon against people.

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:31.900
 Prescott was a Reichian, and I would agree with the Reich that sexual freedom has been

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:37.740
 a fraud and a distortion of sexuality rather than a liberation.

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:41.900
 A deviancy, I would call it.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.420
 The what?

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:48.980
 I would call it sexual deviancy instead of sexual freedom, wouldn't you?

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.340
 Yeah, yeah.

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:59.100
 The weirdness has been amplified and the actual free expression.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:10.420
 The CIA, with Gloria Steinem, for example, as a CIA operative, creating a new view of

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:16.180
 feminism rather than erotic free feminism.

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:20.980
 It was industrial-grade power feminism.

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:26.300
 And then you trace that back to Kinsey, and apparently he was supported by the Rockefellers

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:32.020
 and on the front page, or the cover of Time magazine, the CIA mouthpiece.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.820
 Yeah, yeah.

01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:37.820
 And you don't, do you think his science was very good?

01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:50.100
 Yeah, I don't think science was really science.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:55.140
 And the other kind of tag-along question to this is, in your email wiki, you said that

01:09:55.140 --> 01:10:00.940
 high estrogen does sometimes cause insatiable sexual interest, partly because it increases

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:05.300
 adrenal androgens and partly by inhibiting satisfying orgasms.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.260
 And so I know in my experience, kind of my libido has fluctuated.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:12.700
 Sometimes I'll think my libido is great or something, and then I'll take something that's

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.980
 obviously lowering stress and it will decrease.

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:20.820
 And in talking to people, that seems like sometimes a person will be disturbed because

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:24.820
 they'll perceive their libido as to be like awesome.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:28.900
 But sometimes I suspect maybe it's the stress driving the libido.

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:35.260
 So is that something, can you clarify that statement or flush it out a little bit?

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:51.140
 Yeah, Wilhelm Reich called it the genitalization, the localization of the orgasm and losing

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:58.460
 the whole organism's function of the orgasm.

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:09.260
 He saw the real orgasm as a cosmic thing in which your whole view of your partner and

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:18.860
 the universe is undergoing a change so that both of your personalities and position in

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.500
 the world change.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:30.340
 The orgasm is a discovery rather than a sneeze in the loins.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.740
 So basically sex is an art, is a form of art?

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.740
 I guess.

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:40.660
 What do you make of sexual obsession?

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:47.180
 There are movements online from no-fap to no masturbation, anti-porn.

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:55.220
 So people are waking up to the, didn't Israel put porn in Palestine on the television or

01:11:55.220 --> 01:12:00.940
 something to like, it's obviously, why is porn free on computers and stuff?

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:08.060
 Even when I was born in 1985, seeing a pornographic image was such a rarity even in my youth,

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.860
 but now it's just like everywhere.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:16.300
 And so if somebody felt like they were really into that, what would be some things that

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:22.100
 they could do to detach, do you think?

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:33.740
 I think a good place to start would be to read some of Wilhelm Reich's writings.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:42.500
 He saw it as a very important political question that made him an anti-Nazi.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:51.820
 Well if somebody's physiology was, so again I'd be curious on your opinion about this,

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:57.860
 but maybe like the low energy hypothyroid state, like the, I'm not trying to moralize

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:01.900
 masturbation or anything, but if somebody is attracted to that, maybe that's like a

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:07.460
 low energy activity and kind of an exciting thing to do when you're in such a low energy

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.460
 state.

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.460
 Does that make sense at all?

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.460
 Oh sure.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:15.460
 It can be relaxing and break stress.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:21.620
 Exactly, like as an anti, it's like something a person can do similar to going buying alcohol

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:25.180
 or cigarettes, like there's a limited amount of things in the culture a person can do to

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:30.340
 try to dampen the stress response and that's one of the things.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.860
 Yeah.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:40.820
 Little kids often do it just to go to sleep, having fantasies and rubbing themselves and

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.820
 then going to sleep.

01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:48.780
 It helps to relax.

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:53.860
 Yeah I wanted to say so, I mean because Danny mentioned that these movements to like try

01:13:53.860 --> 01:14:00.540
 to abstain from like from consuming pornographic material online, I was thinking of a similar

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.220
 but slightly divergent line.

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:08.300
 Like this is a way of self-medication of lowering cortisol similar to what an alcoholic would

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:11.940
 do or a drug addict would do.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:17.860
 Maybe better to sort of try to search for the reasons why we're drawn to this excessive

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.780
 sexuality all the time and sort of try to remove the reasons instead of trying to abstain

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:27.820
 because I think the abstaining from one of the few things that brings relief, that can

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.380
 itself also be pathological, right?

01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.180
 Oh sure.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.180
 Yeah.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:47.020
 The obsessive trying to change your behavior as part of an obsessive attitude.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:53.380
 I'm sure you've seen these programs, the so-called abstinence education which the Bush presidency

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:56.140
 heralded and tried to impose on every school in the country.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:01.340
 I mean they failed spectacularly and at the time they said, "Oh it's because the American

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.580
 youth is so undisciplined."

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.940
 But there's probably a physiological reason behind it.

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:10.300
 Basically these people are doing these things because they feel a relief.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:15.540
 So it's really counterproductive to go and tell them, "No, you shouldn't be abstaining.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:19.460
 You shouldn't be doing these things because it's immoral."

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:22.100
 It usually has a – it kind of like backfires.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.020
 The public sometimes says, "You know what?

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:28.860
 I'm going to do this and I'm going to do more simply because the authority is telling

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.860
 me don't do it."

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:41.820
 Yeah, but the sense of a neurotic self is a very powerful barrier against accepting

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:48.180
 imposition of duty and authority.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:16:01.580
 Just preserving that little private corner can save a person from whatever monstrous

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:02.660
 situation they're in.

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:08.620
 Do you see sexuality as a liberating force in nature?

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:13.900
 Because the reason I'm asking this is because if you look at throughout history, every authoritarian

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.700
 society tried to brutally control sexuality.

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:22.300
 To this day, there are cultures out there that would kill you if you break certain sexual

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.300
 norms.

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.740
 Is it because sexuality is such a powerful force that it can quickly undermine the powers

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.780
 that be if it's left uncontrolled?

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:31.060
 Oh yeah.

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:40.780
 The authorities on why circumcision is so important recognized that it was to give an

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:50.620
 obedient, fearful attitude towards sex so that they recognized that you could be cut

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.220
 any time.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:17:08.180
 The political implications of sexuality, all the way from circumcision to Wilhelm Reich's

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:17.540
 politics, it's really worth investigating and thinking about how the personality goes

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:21.460
 through energy cycles.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:32.680
 The energy cycles are cycles of consciousness and you're constantly inventing and discovering

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:40.620
 new things every time you have a satisfactory full cycle.

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:46.220
 And Ray, part of the function of estrogen, if it is related to an insatiable interest

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:52.500
 in sex, is that like a signal that the environment is bad and that the organism should try to

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.720
 reproduce as fast as possible?

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.660
 Is that somewhat related?

01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:00.900
 Oh yeah.

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:11.820
 The worse the situation is, like in the spring when there's a drought underway, grass like

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:20.280
 wheat will rush to come to a head and produce a seed.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:26.540
 Maybe only a few little ones, but it will manage to survive the cycle by accelerating

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.940
 everything.

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:46.820
 The early puberty in girls in extremely stressed societies, nine or ten years old, while in

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:55.380
 traditional, calm, well-fed societies, especially with enough saturated fats like butter or

01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:06.620
 coconut oil, as in parts of India, puberty would normally be around 17 or 18 years old

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:14.900
 and the whole organism would have time to mature more thoroughly.

01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:20.980
 In terms of healthy sexuality, would you say that it's better to have a robust sexual arousal

01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:28.300
 response when stimulated, but not really having much of a libido response without stimulation

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:33.900
 versus this current craziness of somehow people have convinced themselves that having a high

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:38.860
 libido all the time, whether you're surrounded by a stimulating event or not, they don't

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:39.940
 care about this.

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:45.780
 Now the culture is saying being hypersexual is good, but to me it seems that being hypersexual

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.140
 is good only if the right stimulus is there.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:52.340
 If you're hypersexual all the time, then something's wrong, right?

01:19:52.340 --> 01:20:05.020
 Yeah, it's irrational if you're excited by a shoe or a toad or something else.

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:07.860
 You wouldn't be very popular among common sexologists.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:11.580
 They'll say, "Don't shame people's kinks, Ray.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:12.580
 Some people like shoes."

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:20.900
 Switching gears a little bit, finasteride, Ray, I know we've talked about this in the

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:26.900
 past and in the quote I probably have sent to hundreds of people, I think you said in

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:32.820
 2014, it was just a reply to somebody asking you what they should do having taken finasteride

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:39.380
 and you said, "I think it probably started a chronic malfunction of your liver and intestine.

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:43.500
 A simple diet is probably good, small amounts of thyroid pregnenolone."

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:49.900
 Can we just kind of flush out the details of, one, my first question being like, if

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:53.460
 a person has to take finasteride, there's already a problem.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:21:03.340
 And then two, how more difficult is the person's situation after they've taken the finasteride

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:04.940
 in your estimation?

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:09.700
 Well, first, no one has to take it.

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:19.660
 It's an irrational decision and it probably means you're already abjectly obedient to

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:20.660
 authority.

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:39.700
 It's such an unfounded, basically an insane decision.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:51.540
 And any information that you get is going to make a thoughtful person fear it.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:22:01.980
 And it's a very powerful intervention in your steroid chemistry, which especially affects

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:02.980
 your brain.

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:11.460
 The brain is the biggest steroidogenic organ, probably next to the skin.

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:24.940
 But it's changing your chemistry and to get over it, you're going to have to push the

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:33.940
 system artificially, at least as hard in the opposite direction to try to bring it back

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.660
 into a functional state.

01:22:35.660 --> 01:22:38.660
 So I want to, that's good stuff.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.660
 I want to talk more about that.

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:48.140
 When it does regrow hair, what do you think it's doing?

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:58.900
 Somehow shaking up the system, like creating an early false puberty, you can bring some

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:06.820
 parts of the system into function in isolation.

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:10.260
 And then do you think we know all the effects of what it is?

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:14.100
 Do you buy that it's just a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor or do you think it's doing a lot

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:15.660
 of other things?

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:20.980
 Oh, not really other things.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:39.220
 But these 5-reductase, both alpha and beta reductases, the steroids are central to well-being,

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:55.540
 progress of consciousness, the orgasm function itself, brain development at its foundation.

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:57.500
 I'm sure you'll like this.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:02.860
 There was a study that I found recently which showed that even in snails, if you give them

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:08.180
 a finasteride or any other 5-alpha reductase inhibitor and they confirm that it's specific

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:15.660
 to the 5-alpha reductase, the snails no longer coil.

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:22.860
 So it completely disrupts their morphogenetic field and this effect persists for several

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:23.860
 generations.

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:29.460
 So apparently dihydrotestosterone or allopregnanolone, which they didn't test which one of the

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:35.420
 two because the finasteride inhibits just the enzyme that produces both of them, but

01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:40.420
 apparently one of these hormones is extremely important for the morphogenesis of even snails.

01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:45.300
 We can only imagine what inhibiting this enzyme does to the brain and to the human morphogenesis

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:46.300
 field.

01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:53.740
 Yeah, the coiling of the brain is much more complex than the snails coiling.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:59.860
 Georgie touched on it a few episodes ago, but he suspected that when you said your liver

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:05.020
 and intestine, that dihydrotestosterone was important for intestinal function.

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:13.660
 Is that what you were thinking when you wrote this do you think?

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:26.740
 No, I just think of that category progesterone, dihydrotestosterone, all of the stabilizing

01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:38.940
 steroids as essential to holding our organism in its shape and determining its future shape,

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:44.860
 the way it coils and uncoils.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:49.620
 Specific to the digestion, apparently the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, the whole family

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:55.300
 is important for the synthesis of bile acids, which are steroid-like molecules.

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:59.860
 And if you inhibit the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, you won't be producing the bile acids, which

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:03.020
 are crucial, obviously, for digestion.

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:08.340
 And another thing I found out is that also the 5-alpha-reductase family is responsible

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:14.980
 for turning cortisol into its reduced version, which is a lot less potent and actually in

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:19.900
 some cases acts as an antagonist on the cortisol receptor.

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:24.780
 So it looks like it's a fairly systemic protective function that these enzymes have

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.540
 that doesn't even have to do much with sexuality.

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:31.780
 It's more like metabolism and digestion and stress.

01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:45.340
 Yeah, that's why I always think of Heraclitus in connection to any seemingly simple biological

01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.340
 issue.

01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:54.740
 Nothing is simple, everything goes on forever and changes.

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:57.540
 One last thing on this and then we can move on if Georgie doesn't have any additional

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:04.700
 questions, but there's a huge culture around post-finasteride users and a lot of them will

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:07.700
 say things like, "We need to find a cure."

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.140
 And so what is your thought on that?

01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.140
 I've often suspected that...

01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:13.140
 I'm involved.

01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:19.420
 Well, the idea that you've taken finasteride, it's harmed you and then...

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:20.420
 Hello?

01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:21.420
 Yes, can you hear me?

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:22.420
 Can you hear me, Georgie?

01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:23.420
 Can you hear me?

01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:24.420
 Yeah.

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:25.420
 Yeah, we can hear you now.

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:26.420
 I'll just rephrase the question.

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:38.020
 The idea of the needing to find a cure, what is your point of view on that specifically?

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:45.980
 Because if you say it's very complicated and it started with your development and everything

01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:52.740
 in your life, I think that just isn't acceptable to a lot of people.

01:27:52.740 --> 01:28:00.540
 The association with the crease in the earlobe and the altered cholesterol metabolism and

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:10.300
 everything, it says you've got to seriously back up and not look for a cure in the medical

01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:20.340
 sense, but to back up and as radically redo your life as possible.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:30.500
 Such things as, for example, going to a high altitude for six weeks at a time and eating

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:38.140
 a totally different diet, making sure that your calcium intake is very, very high compared

01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.260
 to your phosphate intake.

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:50.580
 The phosphate, for example, excess activates your parathyroid hormone, aldosterone, angiotensin,

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:54.660
 everything that destroys hair growth.

01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:59.420
 Phosphate excess is very crucial for promoting.

01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:14.740
 So doing everything, high altitude will increase the balance of progesterone and help to get

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:23.340
 the parathyroid hormone and aldosterone and angiotensin under control, but you have to

01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:33.460
 think of it at that very fundamental level of getting your energy system revved up and

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:37.820
 turning off those toxic processes.

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:43.820
 The parathyroid hormone in itself is enough to knock out the hair follicle.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:49.940
 Do you think, what is the extent of the damage to the vascular system when a person starts

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:50.940
 losing hair?

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:56.100
 Like, how much of it is stopping the processes causing the hair loss and how much of it is

01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:04.100
 attempting to reverse the damage that's already been done?

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:11.340
 I think the things they do are seldom helpful.

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:19.500
 Getting your spontaneous energy production high so that you're producing and retaining

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:31.940
 lots of carbon dioxide, energizing and renewing the follicle so that it selects and retains

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:38.660
 from your blood supply the trace minerals that it needs.

01:30:38.660 --> 01:30:46.540
 High energy is needed for that and the high energy is expressed through the balance of

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:53.980
 carbon dioxide and keeping calcium out of the cells by keeping your parathyroid hormone

01:30:53.980 --> 01:31:00.900
 low, keeping aldosterone low by doing everything anti-inflammatory.

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:04.180
 Just one other question.

01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:08.700
 You probably already answered it, but when somebody takes spironolactone or progesterone

01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:13.740
 or ciproterone acetate, what do you see?

01:31:13.740 --> 01:31:17.340
 You just mentioned a battery of different ways that it could improve things, but do

01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:22.420
 you see progesterone heating or increasing the temperature of the brain or is there a

01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:28.980
 primary mechanism or something you see as it doing to restore hair growth?

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:37.660
 Progesterone is very closely connected to maintaining oxidative metabolism and higher

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.340
 body temperature at rest.

01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:46.140
 But could you, like an area of balding scalp, is that proportionally colder over a longer

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:49.300
 period of time or is that too reductionist?

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.100
 Is what?

01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:53.740
 Evolving over time?

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:59.420
 Like, is the balding area of scalp proportionally colder over a longer period of time or is

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:01.420
 that a little...

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:10.020
 Oh, that's because it's quiet relative to the other parts of the brain.

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:15.260
 It's your thought process.

01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:19.980
 It's stabilized, but still at a good high temperature.

01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:25.740
 You can't think and plan if your frontal lobes are cool.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:33.140
 It's just that it has to be cooler than all the rest of your brain and body.

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:44.420
 And progesterone is part of maintaining that coolness by keeping the activity focused rather

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:52.380
 than attending in the direction of excitotoxicity and inflammation.

01:32:52.380 --> 01:33:02.740
 It quiets it so that it can think appropriately, but it does that against the background of

01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:07.900
 high energy, high temperature, high carbon dioxide content.

01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:17.940
 So I could not be understanding, but are you saying like a desynchronization of the brain?

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:23.780
 I know you've said the frontal lobes are supposed to be cooler and they act like a dissipating

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:27.660
 heat structure, if I remember correctly, and then the inner parts of the brain are the

01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:29.060
 hottest.

01:33:29.060 --> 01:33:32.700
 And am I following at all?

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.700
 Yeah.

01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:40.940
 The carelessness of the front part of the brain is just part of the fact that it's very

01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:52.900
 hot, but by being uninsulated relatively, it can be cooler than the inside.

01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:59.500
 So one of the functions of the progesterone is to stabilize it so that it doesn't produce

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:10.460
 heat needlessly, but also to keep the temperature up so that the energy supply is there.

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:20.460
 The balance of carbon dioxide and lactic acid keep keeping the blocking hormones like parathyroid

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:22.380
 hormone low.

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:28.740
 And then when the tissue gets colder or the brain gets colder, what would be directly

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:31.020
 behind the frontal lobes?

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.860
 Is that the part that is directly affected?

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:40.340
 And then the tissue, it gets cooler, the protective steroids drop, as you said, the parathyroid

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:49.140
 hormone prolactin rises, and then that increases the activation and mobilization of mast cells.

01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:52.660
 Is that right at all?

01:34:52.660 --> 01:35:05.060
 The whole organs, any cell, when it's happy and successful and has done its work properly,

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:11.380
 it maintains high energy, but quiescence.

01:35:11.380 --> 01:35:21.060
 And the frontal lobe of the brain is just the highest energy organ or tissue, but also

01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:29.420
 the most able to maintain a high degree of quiescence.

01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:34.140
 So in a sense, balding could be viewed as a brain excitotoxicity problem?

01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:39.140
 Is that what I'm hearing?

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:52.180
 You're not keeping the back part of your brain differentiated adequately from the front.

01:35:52.180 --> 01:36:00.020
 If you raise your whole energy production, that whole syndrome of an earlobe crease and

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:07.740
 high cholesterol and so on, it almost always goes with the chronic low temperature.

01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:16.220
 So since estrogen is such a powerful agent of decreasing core temperature, would you

01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:21.700
 say that agents that inhibit the synthesis of estrogen or block its effects, that would

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:28.980
 be a more or less right approach for restoring hair growth?

01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:38.820
 The exact function of estrogen is to block a cell from going into that quiescent state

01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:52.620
 to force it to act immediately and intensely and lead to the reproductive processes, which

01:36:52.620 --> 01:37:01.300
 if you stay under the influence of estrogen, it will never go beyond the rapid multiplication

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.380
 and growth phase.

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:14.220
 You have to turn off that glycolytic type of metabolism and go to the oxidative, aiming

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:16.540
 towards quiescence.

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:21.780
 So speaking of quiescence, I have a question about the GABA system.

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:26.100
 Everyone is a GABA agonist and there are many other drugs on the market that act on the

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.980
 same system as agonists.

01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:33.380
 Would you say it would be counterproductive to try to target that specific system because

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.380
 it would be too reductionist?

01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:42.540
 Let's say an overly excited cell, you give it a GABA agonist drug to calm it down, but

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:47.300
 that in theory, in principle, shouldn't work very well unless you also address the

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:50.300
 energetic deficiency, right?

01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:51.580
 What deficiency?

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.940
 The energetic deficiency of the cell.

01:37:54.940 --> 01:38:03.340
 Yeah, you can't have meaningful quiescence if you're simply exhausted.

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:13.580
 The Pavlovians had the idea of usually three energy states, the almost dead parabiotic

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:24.820
 state and the intermediate state of sort of frenzied activity doing its function on and

01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:31.180
 off active contraction, relaxation and so on.

01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:37.860
 And then the high energy resting state in which it's simply quiescent but totally charged

01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:41.620
 up and ready to work.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:51.620
 These are good at getting into the high energy resting state and someone about to die tends

01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:59.700
 to have parts of the brain and other tissues lapse into the parabiotic almost dead state

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:07.500
 just being quiet to save the last little bit of energy for surviving.

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:12.100
 So psychiatry more or less as a profession is wasting both its time and the time of its

01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:18.060
 patients by administering all these GABA agonist drugs for all of these anxiety disorders and

01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:22.580
 all kinds of other psychiatric disorders that are really energetic in origin.

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:29.380
 Yeah, they can be useful for a day or two if you use them to get some rest so that you

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.380
 can build things up.

01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:43.820
 But they overlap and are in a way probably synonymous with the so-called calcium channels,

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:54.580
 the excitotoxic NMDA receptors, the glutamate receptors, everything that stress and estrogen

01:39:54.580 --> 01:40:02.180
 turn on, that whole system turns off.

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:14.420
 And progesterone, carbon dioxide, and all of the other good things suppress the excitotoxic

01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:19.700
 and promote the GABA relaxing system.

01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:23.100
 Between carbon dioxide and thyroid, go ahead, sorry.

01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:33.820
 Well you can pile up the nominal calcium channel blockers with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:38.380
 and GABA receptors and so on.

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:46.220
 A pile of them will usually be more effective than one of them, but still you've got to

01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:55.460
 work on the actual metabolism and get the blockers like enfatensin and aldosterone and

01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:58.900
 parathyroid hormone out of the way.

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:04.260
 Speaking of the carbonic anhydrase, which do you think is more systemically beneficial,

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:10.540
 thyroid hormone or carbon dioxide?

01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:18.300
 People who have looked for, among all known organisms, they could find lots of them that

01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:26.740
 can live without oxygen, but they couldn't find any single-celled organism that can live

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:29.900
 continuously without carbon dioxide.

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:36.060
 So it's the without which there is no life.

01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:41.140
 So if there was a way to package carbon dioxide as a drug or a supplement and then you have

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:47.580
 thyroid as a supplement, I guess supplementing with carbon dioxide would be more systemic,

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.420
 less risky?

01:41:49.420 --> 01:42:00.100
 Yeah, it will stop the stress and very often give you a chance to recover your own thyroid

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.100
 function.

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:11.740
 A good diet, if you can adapt to 10,000 feet altitude and then get a good diet, your thyroid

01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:15.420
 will usually recover.

01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:26.740
 At 8,000 to 9,000 or 10,000 feet, everyone loses unnecessary fat, their thyroid starts

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:29.040
 working properly.

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:34.900
 Is there an equivalent, I'm sure you're familiar with Addison disease, which is adrenal failure,

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:38.860
 is there an equivalent disease for thyroid where the thyroid gland kind of completely

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:44.460
 fails as the adrenals?

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:55.380
 It used to be said to be killed by tuberculosis.

01:42:55.380 --> 01:43:03.940
 That was 150 years ago when they believed that the thyroid gland enlargement at that

01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:13.220
 time they thought might be inert by an infection, but it was probably just an extreme accumulation

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:19.380
 of colloid from hypothyroidism.

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:28.980
 I don't know of any actual confirmed disease in which the thyroid fails in itself, but

01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:41.580
 a lifetime, 30 or 40 years of supplementing too much iodine will increase fibrosis and

01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:53.220
 eventually carcinogenesis in the thyroid by driving high TSH activates cell deterioration,

01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:55.940
 fibrosis and inflammation.

01:43:55.940 --> 01:44:05.460
 And so you basically can drive it to death and fibrosis, but anytime you stop it while

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:12.220
 there's still something alive, a few cells can regrow.

01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:17.420
 So just to summarize, so apparently supplementing with thyroid is not always necessary.

01:44:17.420 --> 01:44:21.780
 If one can radically re-engineer their life, just as you mentioned, go and live at high

01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:27.140
 altitude for let's say several months in a row, change their diet, completely eliminate

01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:32.580
 stress, then at least in principle thyroid function should be recoverable even without

01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.180
 thyroid supplementation.

01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:42.620
 Yeah, and a fat person takes longer because they'll have pounds of polyunsaturated fats

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:46.740
 waiting there to come out and poison your thyroid.

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:53.140
 Speaking of thyroid, Ray, something people push back on a lot is in your TSH temperature,

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:58.860
 pulse rate and other indicators in hypothyroidism 2006, you wrote, "Healthy, intelligent groups

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:03.060
 of people have been found to have average resting pulse rate of 85 per minute, while

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:07.020
 less healthy groups average close to 70 per minute."

01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:12.380
 In my general experience of monitoring myself and talking to other people, that seems very

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:18.100
 true, but what were you specifically thinking of when you wrote that?

01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:34.100
 Oh, particular studies in which they saw, looking at different populations, just the

01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:45.620
 relation of blood circulation to brain function and the freedom from sickness and so on, the

01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:57.540
 higher temperature, a good resting temperature right around 37 Celsius goes with good brain

01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:00.740
 function and general good health.

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:08.100
 A few weeks ago on Twitter, low-carb and keto people were trying to one-up each other by

01:46:08.100 --> 01:46:11.620
 seeing who had the lowest pulse rate.

01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:15.660
 So I think 40 was the winner.

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:23.060
 They were quoting articles saying that as your pulse rate went up, you all caused mortality

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:24.060
 increase.

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:27.900
 So what is your opinion on that?

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:38.180
 There have been a couple big propaganda studies five or ten years ago, some in Denmark.

01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:47.740
 If you look at them carefully, they're just basically propaganda for selling blood pressure

01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:52.860
 drugs and things to regulate your heart rate and pressure.

01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:59.300
 And last thing, this is an article, I forget when it was, but the quote is, "The normal

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:06.020
 heart rate for a newborn should be 140, reducing to 115 between six months and one year, 110

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:11.900
 between one and two years, 103 between two and six, 95 age six to ten, and 85 between

01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:13.580
 ten and 14 years."

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:18.500
 And that just reflects the lifelong decline of the metabolism.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.500
 Is that right?

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:21.500
 Yeah.

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:28.020
 The intelligence basically goes down with the metabolic rate.

01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:42.460
 I had a chance to give the RAVEN matrix tests to some kids at different ages.

01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:53.980
 And my niece, for example, when she was eight, scored the same raw score as a university

01:47:53.980 --> 01:48:04.980
 math professor, but when she was in her teens, she scored exactly the same score and hadn't

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:07.100
 advanced a bit.

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:17.300
 And just being around kids, you can see that at eight or nine, they're as bright as they're

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:21.420
 ever going to be.

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:26.140
 And just some random questions, unless you have questions about that, Dorji.

01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:32.020
 One thing I am interested in is a half a grain dose versus a full grain.

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:37.420
 And you wrote to somebody in 2018 and you said, "If your diet lacks something such as

01:48:37.420 --> 01:48:41.360
 selenium or vitamin D that's needed for thyroid to work, T4 can interfere with the effects

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.360
 of T3.

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:48.460
 If you take 25 or 50 micrograms in a single daily dose of T4, the liver will experience

01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:55.100
 a momentary toxic overdose and over a period of a week or two will adapt to detoxification

01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:59.940
 enzymes to destroy it, with the result of the body will be extremely deficient in thyroid

01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:03.520
 most of the day and with a short period of toxic excess."

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:09.240
 So I guess what I'm getting at is, is it always safer to dose a half a grain at a time

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:17.060
 versus a full grain because the more than 25 or 50 micrograms could be harmful to somebody?

01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:24.820
 With the natural glandular material, if you take it with food, it isn't all going to be

01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:27.260
 digested for hours.

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:31.340
 Some of it is going to travel down your intestine.

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:39.220
 So with natural thyroid, you don't get such a bad effect as with a pure chemical.

01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:51.260
 I experienced it myself taking 25 micrograms of T3 only in the morning and I don't remember

01:49:51.260 --> 01:50:00.460
 how many weeks it was, but just a few weeks and my heart began pausing for seconds at

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:14.260
 a time around sunset every day and I found at sunset taking 5 or 10 micrograms and rubbing

01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:24.620
 it on the roof of my mouth, within 10 or 15 seconds, my heart rhythm was going from pausing

01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:30.980
 every 10 seconds to a restored perfect rhythm.

01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:37.540
 You know what, I think I just realized I've been reading this paragraph wrong for years.

01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:41.220
 You're talking about T3 in this, you're not talking about T4.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:46.100
 Is there an unsafe amount of T4 to take at a single time?

01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:51.500
 I was thinking the 25 to 50 was T4, but you're obviously talking about T3.

01:50:51.500 --> 01:51:02.980
 Yeah, T4 is more slowly metabolized anyway, so it's going to equilibrate into your tissues

01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:12.620
 at its background level is so much higher than T3 that the effect is going to be a lot

01:51:12.620 --> 01:51:15.300
 slower.

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:26.060
 If you lack selenium and aren't converting it, then it does build up over the weeks and

01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:36.580
 it reaches the point where it interferes with T3 and becomes antithyroid.

01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:38.260
 So one last question about this.

01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:44.740
 So if a person were using Sinoplus and they needed hypothetically two grains, would that

01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:50.300
 be, and maybe the person's sensitive, or you're talking to a random person and you don't know

01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:55.940
 how sensitive they are, would it be safer to talk about half a grain four times a day

01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:00.340
 or would one grain twice a day be perfectly okay?

01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:09.860
 Yeah, one tablet of Sinoplus is like a little over two grains of armor and one tablet I

01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:17.420
 think has 30 micrograms of T3 and so if you take that on an empty stomach and absorb it

01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:25.700
 quickly, it's going to have that upsetting effect and your liver is going to eventually

01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.740
 give you a low T3 effect.

01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:37.900
 But the one grain at a time, 10 micrograms of T3 and 40 micrograms of T4, is that risky

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:40.220
 to take at one time?

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.220
 Not with food.

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:43.780
 Food is going to slow it out.

01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:50.420
 And last question, would you chew it or just swallow the pill whole?

01:52:50.420 --> 01:53:00.860
 If you need, like I wanted my heart to not stop for three seconds at a time and so I

01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:07.740
 chewed it up and got the almost instantaneous effect.

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:15.980
 If you're having terrible insomnia, chewing up 10 micrograms can put you to sleep in a

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:18.460
 few minutes.

01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:27.660
 People with agonizing breast pain have chewed up 10 micrograms and found the pain was absolutely

01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:30.500
 stopped in 10 or 15 minutes.

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:34.260
 I have a question about supplementing with thyroid.

01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:40.580
 Considering the fact that fatty acids, especially PUFA, interfere with both the transport and

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:45.420
 the uptake and the effects of thyroid hormone in the cell, would it be pertinent to try

01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:49.540
 to lower the fatty acids around the time somebody is taking thyroid?

01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:55.340
 Like take it with niacinamide and/or aspirin or any other measure that lowers free fatty

01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:56.340
 acids?

01:53:56.340 --> 01:54:04.420
 It's always good to keep the free fatty acids low.

01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:09.980
 But it wouldn't have any kind of synergistic effect to do that when you're taking thyroid?

01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:13.900
 In other words, to get more use of the thyroid you're already ingesting.

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:18.780
 Would it help to in this specific case?

01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:30.540
 In the case of glandular thyroid, the unsaturated fats are even blocking the breakdown in your

01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:41.540
 stomach and the further metabolism in your body is being blocked at all different points

01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:45.100
 by polyunsaturated fatty acids.

01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:49.980
 Oh wow, so you won't even break down the thyroglobulin in the stomach when you're

01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:56.100
 taking the glandular?

01:54:56.100 --> 01:55:04.620
 Some of the food technology people have reasoned that the reason for polyunsaturated fats in

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:16.700
 so many seeds is to block mammalian stomach enzymes to make the seed unnutritious so they

01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:21.420
 all stop eating it because it blocks the proteolytic enzymes.

01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:28.700
 Ray, I know it's getting pretty late so I'm conscious of the time and I'll let

01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:29.700
 you go.

01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:34.060
 The last question I had for you was do you have a strong opinion about what's going

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:35.060
 on in Antarctica?

01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:41.340
 This has been a mild fascination of mine and I watched a pretty good video about it and

01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:46.780
 they threw out a bunch of things from magnetic anomalies to weather experiments to a source

01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:56.060
 of uranium and a bunch of old newspapers describing snow-free land on Antarctica and things like

01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:57.060
 that.

01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.060
 Have you studied the topic?

01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.060
 Do you have a strong opinion about it?

01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:01.420
 No, not a bit.

01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:06.420
 Have you seen the news recently about the neutrinos, the high-energy neutrinos they

01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:12.340
 found in that detector in Antarctica and they're saying these particles should not exist, something's

01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:18.060
 wrong with the standard model, but nobody's saying the obvious which may be that the earth

01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:25.340
 is creating new matter and that's the reason why these high-energy neutrinos are there.

01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:30.420
 Are they coming in a certain direction out of the earth or falling?

01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:35.900
 Yes, and they're saying they're coming out of the earth and of course the main theory

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:41.340
 is like well, clearly the assumption is they're not coming from the earth, in other words

01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:46.380
 the earth is not the source so if they're coming from the outer space, how the hell

01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:51.020
 are they going through the entire earth and are coming out of the South Pole but we're

01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:56.220
 not detecting them at the North Pole and nobody's saying the obvious which is maybe they originated

01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:57.220
 from the earth.

01:56:57.220 --> 01:57:02.500
 I just thought it's been boggling the scientific minds for the last three or four years, it

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.060
 hits the news every once in a while.

01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:06.780
 I don't know if you've seen it on the news or not.

01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:13.620
 No, that would be very important if the earth is emitting them.

01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:16.900
 Do you know the neutrino sea theory?

01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:19.020
 Dudley?

01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:20.020
 The one from Dudley?

01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:23.140
 Of course, Dudley, yeah.

01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:29.060
 I read one paper, I was only able to find one thing in a PDF file online and it's basically

01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:35.220
 saying that the stars are creating this stream of neutrinos and they're the source of all

01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:41.140
 matter and I think the Electric Universe Theory folks have been confirming that and saying

01:57:41.140 --> 01:57:48.260
 yes the electric force acts upon the neutrinos and when they split they form these cosmic

01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:52.100
 rays and all new matter that we're seeing around us.

01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:54.980
 That was just I think a minor part.

01:57:54.980 --> 01:58:05.420
 His general thing was that the universe is pervaded by a neutrino sea which possibly

01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:16.260
 has a dielectric effect and for that reason neutrinos naturally associate with charged

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:26.260
 matter, all matter being charged, so the concentration of neutrinos increases in proportion to matter

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:41.660
 and it fits with the Hindu guys' theory of gravity as a dielectric phenomenon with the

01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:51.020
 neutrino sea being the dielectric which associates with matter.

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:59.420
 I happened to look up another paper that a professor had mentioned by a physicist named

01:58:59.420 --> 01:59:12.060
 Anderson in which the presence of a monolayer of a radioactive material on a crystalline

01:59:12.060 --> 01:59:26.300
 material, in this case a radioactive vegetable oil on aluminum foil, he showed that the supposedly

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:36.060
 stochastic nuclear decay was nonrandom when the oil was spread out in a monolayer and

01:59:36.060 --> 01:59:47.500
 that paper was published in the same journal of the Italian physics journal in which Dudley

01:59:47.500 --> 02:00:03.380
 published his neutrino sea argument predicting that crystalline matter would act as a beam,

02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:15.700
 a focuser of this neutrino sea which associates as a dielectric but it would be altered in

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:25.380
 the presence of crystalline matter in which the charges are arranged in an orderly way

02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:37.620
 and he predicted that the crystal structure could regulate nuclear decay and warned that

02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:50.780
 the state of nuclear fuel in reactors or weapons could govern the spontaneous fission and make

02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:59.500
 it unpredictable so his article was a warning but Anderson's article neither of them knew

02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:06.660
 about the other but the experimental evidence happened to be published at the same time

02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:10.020
 the theory was.

02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:15.660
 So basically nuclear weapons are incurrently unstable, they may self-combust, well not

02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:16.660
 self-combust but self-ignite?

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:29.140
 Yeah, and so if there's for example uranium ore at the South Pole this could be the equivalent

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:39.420
 of the reactive stuff being focused, focusing the neutrinos and so it could be another confirmation

02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:43.220
 of Dudley and Anderson.

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:48.360
 In one of your interviews you talked about the piece of matter existing through time

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:56.580
 would convert this neutrino stream into energy and you called it a neg entropy, can you expand

02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:57.580
 a little bit on that?

02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:04.060
 Is that how basically matter is sustained as a stable substance by through this neutrino

02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:06.260
 sea that's passing through it?

02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:17.940
 Yeah, that was Dudley's view that it was participating in the mere mass attracting

02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:29.260
 the neutrinos which affect such things as nuclear decay that the mass is acting on itself

02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:39.460
 through the neutrino sea in such things as generating order.

02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:44.340
 What do you think Kozyrev was measuring when he was doing his experiments with what he

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:50.020
 called processes that emit or absorb time?

02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:55.140
 What do you think he was measuring in those experiments?

02:02:55.140 --> 02:03:07.660
 Basically just energy and when energy appears unaccountably he did calculations to show

02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:20.500
 why the passage of time is always adding a certain amount of energy to the system which

02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:29.500
 would involve Dudley's neutrino sea but Kozyrev called it time.

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:40.620
 But empirically he started his theory to predict the source of stellar energy and scaling the

02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:52.940
 mass of a star down, the mass of the sun corresponded according to his astronomical measurements

02:03:52.940 --> 02:04:01.780
 to all of the stars he was looking at and so he looked at the planets and finally the

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:14.380
 dark side of the moon as the smallest accessible planet and aiming his spectroscopic telescope

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:23.700
 on the dark of the moon with a photographic plate in it he photographed red spots periodically

02:04:23.700 --> 02:04:28.340
 in the volcanic areas of the moon.

02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:37.980
 Volcanic eruptions were recorded and American astronomers said he was just a drunk Russian,

02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.340
 there can't be volcanic action on the moon.

02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:55.060
 But most recently there's an anomalous heat emission from I think it's next to the last

02:04:55.060 --> 02:05:08.820
 gaseous planet and this very recent new data about the heat coming out of this planet fits

02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:19.700
 his predictions according to the mass all the planets except Venus are emitting the

02:05:19.700 --> 02:05:27.500
 same energy in relation to mass as the moon and the sun and stars.

02:05:27.500 --> 02:05:32.660
 Two more questions related to that, are you aware of any follow-up work after Dudley's

02:05:32.660 --> 02:05:34.060
 publications?

02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:37.100
 Anybody who took this up and developed it further?

02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:38.100
 Nope.

02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:40.060
 Nope, okay.

02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:45.180
 And if we assume that the neutrino sea is also synonymous for that electrically charged

02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:50.620
 ether or not electrically charged but ether with electrical properties, I'm sure you're

02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:56.540
 familiar with the ether drift experiments which some people say were falsified.

02:05:56.540 --> 02:06:10.380
 Yeah, it's exactly if the neutrino sea is the ether and it's attracted simply as a dielectric

02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:22.780
 very very light gas then you would have some drift, some carries some of it along with

02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:25.260
 some of it slips through.

02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:39.780
 So Dudley exactly calculated things that were consistent with the measurements.

02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:45.780
 There was a physicist who apparently repeated the experiment to detect the ether in the

02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:46.860
 80s.

02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:49.500
 He worked for Caltech and NASA.

02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:53.980
 I'm blanking on his name, I think his last name was either Silver or Silverstein.

02:06:53.980 --> 02:07:00.900
 Long story short, he found that the earth has basically a drift, it's basically moving

02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:06.180
 preferentially in space towards the Sagittarius constellation.

02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:11.580
 So he not only said that the ether probably exists but also that its flow seems to have

02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:14.140
 a preferential direction.

02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:20.580
 Would you have any opinion on why that direction may exist and is there anything special towards

02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:24.860
 the ether moving preferentially in a certain direction?

02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:38.020
 Well like the electric universe, the universe is a thing and it must obey any laws of physics

02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:51.060
 that are valid and so that's just another unexplored part of the universe.

02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:56.540
 So maybe there's more matter there and the neutrinos are drawn towards that part of the

02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:57.540
 universe?

02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:02.580
 Yeah, the universe is doing something we haven't found out yet.

02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:05.100
 What do you think black holes are?

02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:10.220
 Aside from them being a completely fake object that astronomy is trying to convince us are

02:08:10.220 --> 02:08:16.540
 breaking the laws of physics, do you think they're just special regions of space attracting

02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:18.540
 neutrinos somehow?

02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:31.140
 Yeah, I think mostly they're something designed to fit the paradigm.

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:34.540
 Have you read Seeing Red?

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:35.540
 Haldenarp?

02:08:35.540 --> 02:08:40.460
 Yeah, Haldenarp.

02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:49.900
 His observations didn't at all fit with the Big Bang explanation of redshift and redshift

02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:56.780
 goes with the neutrino sea and electric universe and so on.

02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:02.340
 So they wouldn't let him use the telescope anymore.

02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:06.740
 Speaking of the electric universe, Ray, do you have an opinion on what's it called,

02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:07.740
 the movie they made?

02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:12.180
 It's called Symbols of an Alien Sky where they think the planets used to be in a different

02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:13.180
 conformation.

02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:16.900
 Does that make sense to you at all?

02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:19.420
 For everything is changing.

02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:24.940
 But specifically they're saying those conformations explain a lot of history.

02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:25.940
 Would you take it that far?

02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:28.300
 Do you think that is a reasonable explanation?

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:29.300
 Yeah.

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.300
 Oh, nice.

02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:32.220
 Georgie, have you seen it?

02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:33.220
 It's an excellent documentary.

02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:34.220
 It's really fascinating.

02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:36.180
 What was the debate by an astronomer?

02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:41.420
 Was it Vernadsky who had a huge argument with the astronomical community who said that the

02:09:41.420 --> 02:09:44.500
 Earth has experienced a lot of cataclysms in recent history?

02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:45.500
 Velikovsky, I think.

02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:46.500
 Velikovsky, yes.

02:09:46.500 --> 02:09:50.300
 So maybe that's what he was referring to.

02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:55.620
 Maybe because of that different configuration, the cataclysms on Earth are what all these

02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:57.780
 big religions are talking about.

02:09:57.780 --> 02:09:58.780
 Yeah.

02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:06.900
 I've read him and I think his arguments are plausible.

02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:07.900
 That's everything.

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:08.900
 You know what?

02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:11.660
 The one last thing we didn't touch on that I put in the title and then we'll read the

02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:13.740
 Super Chats and I'll let you go, Ray.

02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.580
 Do you want to just talk about DHT?

02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:18.460
 What is your general rundown of that?

02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:22.600
 Because I think you've described it in email, but I can't think of an interview where you've

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:23.600
 ever really talked about it.

02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:24.600
 I'm sure you have.

02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:32.660
 But what is your general thought on dihydrotestosterone?

02:10:32.660 --> 02:10:41.540
 In general, things like that are not to be messed with unless you have a very specific

02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:58.120
 knowledge of a deficiency because if you take a little too much, any of those defining feature-creating

02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:06.640
 hormones can change the whole system in an unpredictable way.

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:17.520
 I would suggest first getting a good picture of what the problem is.

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:21.640
 There are usually more ways to fix it.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:30.960
 Correcting thyroid vitamin D and DHEA and pregnenolone will usually bring your DHT up

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:33.400
 to where it should be.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:45.320
 In something like breast cancer or prostate cancer, it's one of the things that can give

02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:53.280
 a big push to the system if you're wanting to interrupt the process.

02:11:53.280 --> 02:12:00.400
 In health, sickness and disease, do you see it ever being warranted to supplement with

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:01.400
 DHT directly?

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:06.080
 I know you said you should always correct the upstream things first, but do you see

02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:13.080
 DHT like a progesterone maybe for males or is it not that simple?

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:14.920
 No.

02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:26.080
 Pregnenolone is the first thing and then DHEA if you need a more androgenic thing.

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:34.280
 Androgen will push your neurosteroids, the crucial regulating things that you don't

02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:46.320
 want to throw out of balance and with a strong androgen like DHT, that would be one big risk

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.920
 that you could throw off your neurosteroids.

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:56.280
 Can you dive into that a little bit more?

02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:58.840
 How would that work?

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:08.440
 If you have a definite problem that you want to fix, osteoporosis or cancer for example,

02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:14.880
 then you can use it to the effect and you'll see the effect.

02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:18.000
 Doses for that for the people that do need it?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.760
 One milligram.

02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:26.120
 One milligram daily dissolved in tocopherol say or like taken with fat?

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:27.120
 Uh-huh.

02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:28.120
 Okay.

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.920
 Well, Ray, you do have that quote about testosterone and you say it's essential to have everything

02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.080
 else in place, thyroid, calcium, magnesium, protein, vitamin D, vitamin E, pregnenolone,

02:13:37.080 --> 02:13:42.040
 DHEA, then one milligram per day can have a very strong effects and a person could spend

02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:44.600
 five years optimizing those things.

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:49.000
 So do you have a similar point of view with DHT?

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.720
 You just need to put a bunch of things in place before kind of even thinking about experimenting

02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:54.720
 with it?

02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:55.720
 Yeah.

02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:06.040
 The DHT, you don't have to worry quite as much as you do with testosterone, but if you're

02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:13.080
 very sparing with the testosterone, even DHEA can feminize a man.

02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:20.200
 If he takes 25 milligrams a day and almost every day I hear someone taking injections

02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:29.160
 of 30 or 50 milligrams of testosterone per week, which is several times what a teenage

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:32.280
 boy would be making.

02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:43.000
 And so it's all going to be going towards estrogen and doing more harm than good.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
 Yeah.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.680
 I know Georgie and I have talked about this many times that that is such a common therapy

02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:50.000
 of like gigantic doses of testosterone.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.280
 And so I'm glad you touched on it.

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:58.640
 Georgie, do you have anything else before we move on to super chats and we end this

02:14:58.640 --> 02:14:59.640
 whole thing?

02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:03.600
 Yeah, I guess, I mean, my last question would relate to DHEA.

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:10.040
 Do you have an opinion of why the endocrinological industry came up with these insane daily recommendations?

02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:15.400
 I mean, I know personally an endocrinologist and they think that 25 milligrams of DHEA

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:21.800
 daily is a minuscule dosage, despite the many studies showing that anything over 10 or 15

02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:24.720
 milligrams daily reliably increases estrogen.

02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:26.760
 They just keep saying no, 25 milligrams.

02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:31.600
 You'll see studies even titled saying low dose DHEA administration does X.

02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:36.320
 And you look at the study and they use 25, 50 milligrams and they're calling it a low

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:37.320
 dose.

02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:46.880
 Well, if you find out what endocrinologists and pulmonologists, et cetera, are actually

02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:51.920
 reading, it's pitiful.

02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:58.080
 They simply don't know anything about their field.

02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:03.960
 But you think that they can at least do the, this just a mechanical work of calculating

02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:07.080
 what would be a physiological dose of DHEA?

02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.760
 Can they drop to that level of stupidity, not even being able to calculate that?

02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:22.520
 Yeah, it's a whole attitude of applying intelligence to physiology or anything in the world.

02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:28.840
 They are trained in an authoritarian system of obedience.

02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:37.240
 And it's very hard to talk intelligence to someone with that 10 or 20 years of training

02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:38.240
 in that direction.

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:46.080
 Have you ever met a doctor who managed to get shaken out of this zombified dream somehow?

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:48.680
 Oh yeah.

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:59.320
 Patients who did something like an allergy specialist who was making huge amounts, $400

02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:07.280
 an hour or something, desensitizing people to allergen, to whatever they were allergic

02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:12.680
 to by injecting a little bit of the allergen.

02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:19.520
 And they kept coming back every week needing to be desensitized again.

02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:28.680
 And he found out that giving them some T3 and magnesium at the same time, they retained

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:35.680
 the magnesium under the influence of T3 and never came back.

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:42.140
 In a week he cured all his patients and went into another business.

02:17:42.140 --> 02:17:46.400
 So what would trigger an allergy specialist to even consider T3 and magnesium?

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:50.200
 Were they somehow inspired by you or did they read something?

02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:51.200
 Okay.

02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:53.200
 Yeah, we were talking about it.

02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:55.480
 Okay, Georgie, go ahead.

02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:57.040
 No, that's it.

02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:58.040
 That's it.

02:17:58.040 --> 02:17:59.040
 I don't have anything.

02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:01.040
 Okay, I'll run through these super chats.

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:04.720
 You guys, I'd love to get through all these questions, but we would just be on here for

02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:05.720
 hours.

02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:11.880
 And so obviously for these to Ray, Ray, you got my last Ford from the AdSense from Google,

02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:12.880
 right?

02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:13.880
 Oh, yeah.

02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:14.880
 Okay.

02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:15.880
 Okay.

02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:16.880
 That was everybody here.

02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:17.880
 So you guys are making this happen.

02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:18.880
 Appreciate it.

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:19.880
 Thank you so much.

02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:21.560
 Matthew Riley, thank you for 999.

02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:24.640
 Mateo White, White shirts for 20 pesos.

02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:25.640
 Thank you.

02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.600
 This one, I'm going to break my rule and read it because it seems particularly important.

02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:30.840
 It's from tone for $10.

02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:36.080
 And he says, my cousin was shot and left paralyzed waist down, but showing signs that he can

02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:37.400
 fully recover.

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:42.440
 Any thoughts on wound induced paralysis from a bioenergetic point of view, studying T3,

02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:45.040
 T4, progesterone, CO2, and aspirin at the moment.

02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:49.280
 Ray, what do you think about that?

02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:56.880
 Nerve recovery, progesterone and pregnenolone and vitamin D and thyroid and carbon dioxide

02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:00.600
 are central things.

02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:04.320
 So just the things he was studying already.

02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:05.320
 So that's great.

02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:09.680
 Jonas for a hundred of some currency.

02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:10.680
 I'm not sure.

02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:11.680
 Thank you so much.

02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:13.920
 Janet, thank you so much for $50 wealth.

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:16.200
 Diana or Bella Glynn for 24.99.

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:19.720
 Oh, Janet says, thank you so much for doing these chats.

02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:21.680
 Diana says, thank you all for sharing your knowledge.

02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:22.680
 Thank you, Diana.

02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:25.080
 Christina Tomaj for 24.99.

02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.080
 Thank you so much.

02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:28.480
 Primitive initiative for 999.

02:19:28.480 --> 02:19:29.480
 Thank you so much.

02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:31.520
 He says, thank you for taking the time to do these lives.

02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:35.840
 Danny, Georgie and Ray, Harry Burgos for $25.

02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:36.840
 No message.

02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:37.840
 Thank you so much, Harry.

02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:41.560
 Machel, I won't even try to pronounce your last name for $20.

02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:43.000
 Thank you so much, Machel.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.400
 And then we have an extra second.

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:49.360
 I'm just going to read this last super chat and then we'll, we'll farewell out of here.

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:53.680
 But Vicky says, I guess it wouldn't really be fair if I, okay.

02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:54.680
 Okay.

02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:56.360
 I'm just going to end it there.

02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:58.200
 Vicky, forward me your question.

02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:01.160
 I'll try to answer to the best of my ability for 4.99.

02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.160
 Thank you so much, Vicky.

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:03.160
 Okay.

02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:07.560
 Ray, any parting words on the general state of things?

02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:09.720
 What are you working on right now?

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:11.720
 Your life in general?

02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:23.320
 A newsletter on the epidemic or the pandemic and concrete things that can be done and some

02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:35.120
 basic ideas on how to think about viruses and reasons to avoid vaccines in particular.

02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:37.760
 And you sent me a kind of a rough draft of that.

02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:40.440
 When do you think that will be ready?

02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:43.800
 Oh, a few days.

02:20:43.800 --> 02:20:48.640
 That was the first page changed already.

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:52.520
 And then Georgie, any parting words?

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:58.920
 I guess one last question, Ray, if you had to leave the empire, what for you would be

02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.920
 the breaking point?

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:05.000
 What signs in the environment would you say would be a pretty decent indication that it's

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.800
 time to pack up and go somewhere else?

02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:21.320
 Oh, when they interrupt my food and drugs, if they turn off my thyroid, cytomelon, the

02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:30.440
 xenoplasm and start changing the food supply, then it's necessary to leave.

02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:31.960
 What about forced vaccinations?

02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:34.960
 Would that be a good sign?

02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:35.960
 Oh, sure.

02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:36.960
 All right.

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:37.960
 I'm so sorry.

02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:38.960
 Ray, how do you think that will be implemented?

02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:45.200
 Like, how do you what what is the because so many people seem resistant to it.

02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:49.720
 Do you think working for these corporations, obviously, but what about the normal person?

02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:54.000
 How do you think they'll incentivize a vaccine besides using fear?

02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:03.240
 Well, even even normal doctors are starting to refuse vaccines for their kids.

02:22:03.240 --> 02:22:11.680
 And so the the normal American is still absolutely subservient to the stupid things their doctors

02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:13.720
 do to them.

02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:17.480
 That whole thing has to change.

02:22:17.480 --> 02:22:26.440
 The vaccines might be a catalyst for people throwing off the whole crazy authoritarian

02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:27.920
 medical system.

02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:31.360
 Great stuff, Ray.

02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:34.880
 You know, infinite appreciation for you joining us.

02:22:34.880 --> 02:22:35.880
 Sincerely appreciate it.

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:37.360
 These are special episodes to me.

02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:41.760
 And so thank you for joining us and just sharing your wisdom with us.

02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:45.720
 And thank you, Georgie, for being my partner and helping me do this because I couldn't

02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:46.720
 do this without you.

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:48.800
 Thank you, everybody listening and watching.

02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:52.920
 Ray, I'll send you an email and we'll try to set up another one of these if you're available.

02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:54.400
 And just thank you so much.

02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:55.600
 Sincerely appreciate it.

02:22:55.600 --> 02:22:58.360
 Everybody have a great, safe Friday evening.

02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:01.280
 And we'll see you guys some other time.

02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:03.720
 Take care.
