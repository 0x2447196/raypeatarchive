00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.480
 - Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.960
 Know the source, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.160
 - Well, a very pleasant good morning to you.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.160
 This is Patrick Timpone, and this is oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 Let's take off the replay button

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.600
 because we are live here this morning.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.600
 It is March 2nd, 2021, March 2nd, 2021.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.200
 Dr. Ray Peat, a special appearance

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200
 because we were iced in during the third week of January.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.880
 So he was willing to come back on

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.080
 and we're gonna get him back in a few weeks, we hope,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.180
 so we get back on a regular schedule.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.400
 But we have lots of emails

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.920
 and we never get to all the emails.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.840
 So I think it'll be good to have him on

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.040
 a little bit more this month.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 Hope he doesn't mind.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.280
 I didn't ask him if he's gonna come back on in a few weeks,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.080
 but we'll ask him on the air so we'll put him on the spot.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.920
 Just kidding, we are live.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 I believe, oh yeah, the 800 number's gonna work.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.320
 It's 888-663-6386.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.000
 Just a bit of business before we move on.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.640
 The Real World of Money with Fred Dashefsky

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.920
 will be here tomorrow.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440
 And then also Matthew Errett.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.360
 And he's gonna talk about the deep, deep, deep roots

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120
 of the deep, deep, deep state.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.140
 He's a great researcher and I think you'll have fun

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.440
 really understanding how this entity

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.880
 that we call the deep state,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.480
 how they got started and how they are existing today,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.520
 ostensibly controlling lots of things.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.960
 So that'll be tomorrow, Regenerative Farming on Thursday.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.840
 And then we're gonna do a special Friday presentation

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.300
 and not sure exactly what we're gonna be doing,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 but has a lot to do with it takes a long time to get young.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.660
 We are not doing any of the social media.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.440
 We do a few minutes before each show

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.080
 like we're doing right here.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.040
 We do our little social media post.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.780
 I don't have anything specific this morning,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.960
 but then we're working on a little chat room

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.120
 right on One Radio Network.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 So we're not on anywhere.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.440
 We just kind of gave up on them all

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.360
 because I just didn't have the time

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.080
 and it's just too much.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.400
 I'm doing enough right here with you.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.040
 So let me know if we can help at

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.360
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 Dr. Ray Peat is here.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.360
 He is an interesting fellow.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.080
 Been around quite a few years in his body.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.000
 PhD in biology.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 Way back, schools that he has taught in

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.600
 include University of Oregon, Urbana College,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.160
 Montana State University,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.720
 National College of Naturopathic Medicine,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.560
 Universidad Verde Cruzanza,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560
 Universidad AutÃ³noma Estadual de Mexico.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.040
 I didn't pronounce that correctly.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.320
 So he spent some time south of the border.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.840
 He started his work with progesterone

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.960
 and related hormones in '68.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.080
 He's done papers, all kinds of papers

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.200
 in physiological chemistry and physics, '71, '72.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.100
 But he'll go talk about most anything.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.960
 Spiritual matters and evolution and all kinds of stuff.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.600
 We're gonna talk to him more about those things

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.940
 as we get to know him even more.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.840
 But he's been on the show here on the third Monday

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.240
 for a long time.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.360
 Dr. Peat, as always, we truly appreciate you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.000
 taking the time to come on our show.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.080
 Good morning.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.040
 - Good morning.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.680
 - How are things up there on the left coast?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.320
 You doing okay?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.600
 - Yeah, the weather is remarkably good

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.440
 the last few days, sunny and warmer.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.160
 Great relief after the dark winter.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.960
 - Did you read about our little freezing episode

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.320
 we had here in Texas?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.440
 - Oh, yeah.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.200
 - Oh, my goodness.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.960
 It was really something, it was really something.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.640
 And now more and more information's coming out,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.960
 Dr. Peat, about how they just really screwed up

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.800
 with the subsidizing alternative energy

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.360
 and the windmill's frozen.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.040
 And it was just making the wrong decisions

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.640
 to make this whole thing happen.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.320
 Pretty curious how we have such a fragile grid

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.960
 all around the country, isn't it?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.440
 - Yeah, I think it lacks engineering design

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.620
 right from the start.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.760
 It could have been designed more stably.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.640
 Odd things turn up, like at one point,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.040
 someone discovered that the whole thing,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.600
 when it was integrated, resonated and tended

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.240
 to be interrupted just by resonating

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.240
 with the Earth's resonance frequency in the solar wind.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.680
 What they had done was create a huge antenna

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.200
 across the country in the power grid

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.080
 that was being interfered with just by the streaming

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.120
 energy from the sun that makes the Earth ring

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.800
 at a certain frequency.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.320
 - And then what effect did that have

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.960
 on us humanoids, anything?

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.000
 - Yeah, they were also studying the effects of that.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.600
 I think it was 11 cycles per second

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.200
 that it started vibrating at.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.200
 And that tends to drive, the solar wind apparently

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.760
 is what drives that basic brain rhythm in humans.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.600
 And so they experimented, put people in a cage

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.600
 where they could keep out those natural oscillations

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.960
 and subject the brain to an artificial field

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.960
 with varying frequencies.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.280
 They gradually slowed the vibration frequency

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.280
 below the 10 or 11 cycles down around seven or eight cycles.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.360
 The brain rhythm being artificially driven slower,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.360
 the people all got feeling sick and disoriented.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.040
 So our normal consciousness, according,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.040
 I think that was either an FBI or NASA study

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.440
 that showed that our normal consciousness

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.440
 is based on resonance with the Earth cavity.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.440
 - Oh, so actually the vibrations and the impulses

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.160
 through the wiring in the homes,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.080
 is that where that's happening?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.000
 - No, right through the Earth and the air.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.240
 - Oh, right, wow.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.680
 - So when you're in a house with wiring,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.600
 you get some of it imposed from the sun and the Earth,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.600
 but you're mainly being subjected to 60 cycles a second

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.960
 in the house.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.400
 - In the house.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.800
 We've heard over the years that 60 cycles

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.240
 is actually a little bit more difficult

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.560
 for the body to deal with than what they do 50 in Europe.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.400
 Is that true?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.400
 - No, I haven't heard that.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.600
 - You haven't?

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.160
 - But both of them are unnatural.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.000
 - Yes.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.720
 - I used to, like the area where I have a house in Mexico,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.960
 the University of Mexico built a stellar radio antenna there

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.680
 because it was so free of artificial radiation,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.640
 just a few miles from my house.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.640
 But now the, I don't suppose the radio antennas

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.560
 are very good anymore because of the cell phone towers

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.440
 that have invaded the area.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.440
 - You could feel more, just healthier,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.240
 or just happier in your body when you're there?

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.240
 - Yeah, my health always improved, even my eyesight.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.280
 - No kidding, wow.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.800
 There's quite a bit of research we've done,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.680
 shows Dr. Peat over the years about the wiring in the home

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.240
 with the 60 cycles and the white noise that it does.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.600
 You know, the dirty electricity.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.360
 And how you can actually put little capacitors in

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.280
 very inexpensively and you plug 'em in.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.560
 And they've done research with Magda Havis up in Canada,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.840
 you may know of, about affecting the blood sugar

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.600
 and thyroid and everything with this.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.440
 - Wow.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.800
 - It's amazing that we humans have done so well

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.300
 with all the different things we get thrown at us.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.800
 - Yeah, but the world health,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.640
 especially Europe and the United States,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.920
 the health and lifespan are decreasing

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.760
 rapidly in recent years.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.760
 - How they say it is, is that a fact or is that fake news?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.760
 - Well, no, the CDC matches other sources

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.520
 that the actual lifespan average

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.440
 is shortening the last three or four years.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.440
 And the documented rate of allergies, autoimmune diseases,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.080
 degenerative diseases in young people

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.360
 has skyrocketed in the last 40 years, 30 years.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.880
 - And what would Dr. Ray Peat attribute that to?

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:43.560
 - The bad foods, polyunsaturated fats, and vaccinations.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:50.760
 And another big cause is the nanoparticles

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.440
 that are being used in food industry, clothing,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.040
 soaps and shampoos, constantly exposure

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.880
 to this microscopic junk that goes right into our cells

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.760
 and turns on inflammatory processes.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.480
 - We've heard a lot of negative things about nanotechnology.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.560
 Is there any good stuff or is all things

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.700
 that are nanotechnology detrimental,

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.400
 do you know, for the body?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.400
 - Yeah, the industry talks about the great value

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.680
 of, they say, targeting drugs in the cells.

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.720
 I think that's all phony, absolute phoniness.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:41.520
 They sell ways to, for example, target extraneous DNA

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:48.640
 to do genetic engineering or gene therapy.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.600
 But when someone was doing a control

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.480
 using those commercial targeting agents,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.320
 they did a control using plain, untreated DNA

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.360
 along with those chemical targeting agents,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.880
 and they found the crude DNA went into the cells better

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.880
 than the commercial, supposedly useful material.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.920
 - I see, it actually went into the cells better.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.920
 Do we know what the nano stuff in soaps or face cream

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.360
 or whatever does inside the cell?

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.000
 Do we, as a science, show what it does?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.560
 - Yeah, the particle size is the important thing

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.780
 for the substance.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.680
 Chemistry doesn't matter as much

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.800
 as the size of the particle.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.640
 And in a certain very small particle range,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.640
 it signals activation of the inflammatory process

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.400
 and turns on the cytokines that turn on

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.880
 other inflammatory cascades.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.880
 And so if you're on the edge of a slight metabolic fatigue

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:10.440
 or weakness, then those things can really activate

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.440
 a process like lung inflammation, bowel inflammation,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.120
 changes in the brain and all of the tissues.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.440
 - We're done with Dr. Ray Peat, generally the third Monday,

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.480
 but we had the ice thing going on.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.540
 We were without water, electricity, heat.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.960
 We had just wood-burning stove in the snow.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.280
 That was about it, so we've moved him up to here.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.360
 Patrick Timpone, we are live here this morning,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.720
 March 2nd, 2021.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.720
 If you have a question, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.720
 So do we have any evidence of how to get these guys

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:54.040
 out of the body?

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.600
 Would it be the natural detox mechanism, saunas,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.760
 and just through the bowel and the kidney and stuff?

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:06.720
 - I think we have a very inefficient way

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.760
 to get these tiny things out,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.380
 but to the extent that white blood cells

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.040
 can detect and remove them,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.240
 because they enter right into nerve cells,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.200
 blood vessel walls, right into the cell,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.200
 it is not obvious to the white blood cells

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.480
 whether they need to be removed right away,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.920
 because it can start a very slow chronic process.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.840
 But when the white blood cells can catch them,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.680
 then I think the white blood cells can degenerate

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.700
 in a way that lets them be excreted

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.600
 either through the bowel or the kidney.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.420
 - Yes, I've actually seen some stories

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.820
 that there's like nano-silver

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.420
 on maybe the Kraft cheese slices

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.740
 that we don't recommend, of course,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.820
 'cause it's not really cheese,

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.720
 but to keep it fresher, right?

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.700
 The little plastic stuff.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.700
 - Yeah, people used to put a silver coin

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.380
 in the swimming pool.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.740
 Copper is very similar,

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.620
 so that you didn't have to use chemicals

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.080
 to keep down the algae growth.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.880
 Just a very small amount of,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.480
 like if you don't have a water purifier,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.440
 putting a silver coin in your water

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.500
 and letting it stand has a strong germicidal effect.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.060
 - I've often wondered about the colloidal silver craze

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.860
 that went through the natural food.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.920
 I think it's still around.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.900
 You can find a lot of them.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.820
 They're supposed to be antibacterial,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.340
 antiviral, antifungal.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.980
 Do you know anything about those?

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:59.100
 Do they carpet bomb and kill a lot of good stuff too?

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.540
 - Yeah, that's the trouble.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.380
 - That's the trouble.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.300
 - And if people get carried away with it,

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.900
 it can damage the tissues.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.500
 When I was in my teens,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.500
 I knew a woman who always wore a veil and gloves

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.660
 because she had been treated with silver

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.660
 and it turned her skin a horrible purple color.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.260
 - Well, what's the story about the real silver,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.540
 that the blue bloods,

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.300
 and they kind of got a little blue

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.980
 because they had real silver?

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:38.780
 Do you think that kept them from getting something?

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.460
 Those real silver utensils?

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.380
 - Oh, sure.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.900
 If you have a silver cup or silver spoon,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.780
 that's the idea.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.580
 It's extremely germicidal.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.140
 - Germicidal.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.980
 Ayurvedic medicine likes this idea

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.260
 of putting water in a real authentic copper cup

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.020
 and drinking some of that every day.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.140
 Do you think that's useful or viable or reasonable?

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.460
 - I think it's safe.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.740
 - So copper is a germicidal thing?

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.580
 - Copper and silver are almost equal

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.380
 in their germ killing.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.700
 - So that leads us to, of course,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.340
 the question I really want to ask you about

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.060
 before we take emails,

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.140
 is this whole germ thing.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.340
 I've sent you a video and then I sent you,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.180
 did you get a chance to look at the text

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.380
 that I sent you this morning

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.580
 about Cowan and Kaufman and the germ thing?

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.540
 So what do you think about that?

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.340
 Do you think they're onto something?

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.500
 - Their purpose is absolutely right.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:41.860
 I agree with it.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.820
 But have you seen the videos of Zach Bush?

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.940
 - I've heard about it.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.020
 I have not seen Zach's videos.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.340
 What's his argument, Dr. Peat?

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.540
 - His argument is exactly the opposite,

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.940
 but his purpose is just as good.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.380
 Both, all of them are arguing

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.020
 that there's nothing to panic about.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.860
 - Right.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.900
 - And that's my position,

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.980
 that there has been nothing unusual

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.700
 happening this last year.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.460
 It's all made up fear.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.900
 - Yes.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.020
 - Lawyers are suing the government,

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.780
 asking them where is the evidence for all of this fear?

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:27.620
 So far, the courts haven't forced them

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.700
 to give up the evidence of why it's so dangerous.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.700
 So I don't believe there really is any unique thing

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.700
 in history, it's just the annual fluctuations

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.180
 of influenza and colds.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.060
 - Yeah, but what about the deeper idea

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.580
 that Cowan, a lot of people are putting out there,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.700
 more and more.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.860
 I saw a video with about 15 different doctors

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.460
 on the whole germ theory,

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.260
 and they're saying that these things have never,

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.260
 ever been isolated from HIV to polio,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.460
 to never been isolated properly.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.700
 And that thing I sent you, they make that case.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.700
 Do you ever see a pure, real isolation done, Dr. Peat?

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.900
 - When a person takes a chemistry lab in school,

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.900
 you learn to identify chemicals with great precision.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.420
 That's the purpose of the techniques.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.300
 But you don't have to purify things to identify them.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.140
 - Mm-hmm.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:38.140
 - And that's, I think, the crux of their argument.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.260
 It's based on the mistaken idea

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:45.820
 that you have to have absolute purity

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.300
 to know something exists.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.300
 But when they talk about pure chemical reagents,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.940
 even those are, every smallest bit

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:03.220
 that you analyze, it's going to have some atoms

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.340
 and molecules of other substances.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.180
 - Right, right.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.100
 - You don't have to purify chemicals

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.540
 to identify them with certainty.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.700
 - Well, their argument is, Dr.,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.780
 because you're getting dead particles and dead molecules

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.100
 and pieces of the monkey kidneys

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.420
 where they've been in the dish and everything,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.980
 that you've never really isolated a virus,

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.540
 and it really doesn't exist, as advertised.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.340
 That's their argument.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.380
 - Yeah, but you don't have to isolate a chemical

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.620
 to be confident that it exists.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:39.620
 - A chemical, so a virus is a chemical?

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.060
 - Yeah, because it's not a living substance.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:49.060
 You should categorize it as a biological chemical.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.660
 Like insulin is a chemical.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:59.540
 And bits of short pieces of RNA,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.660
 just five or 10 base units,

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.940
 that they work like chemicals.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.380
 They can be catalytic and so on.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:15.060
 So if it isn't self-sustaining,

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.420
 like a protozoan or a bacteria

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.860
 has all of the features of life,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.420
 if it isn't self-sustaining,

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:30.420
 you have to describe it as a non-living chemical substance,

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.820
 even though complex.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.700
 But I think the problem comes in

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.940
 not looking at the actual nature of what is a virus,

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:48.460
 how did that complex chemical come into existence

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.460
 if it can only be multiplied in an organism

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.460
 like the bacteriophage or the plant viruses.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:04.460
 They're easy to get in a fairly pure form,

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:11.220
 not absolutely pure, but enough that everyone can,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:17.580
 even a beginner can make electron micrographs

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.740
 showing these things.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.740
 Where with the small viruses,

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:28.380
 the electron microscope pictures are always muddy

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.860
 and a matter of judgment.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.580
 If you see a majority of particles

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.980
 that are all approximately the same size and shape,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.180
 then you suspect that it's something.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.860
 But the evidence for even these small viruses

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.180
 is much better than the,

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.500
 oh, things like the Loch Ness monster,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.500
 and Bigfoot and so on, there are pictures of them,

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.460
 but not everyone is convinced that there is--

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.460
 - They exist.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:11.260
 - So with viruses, the evidence is about 1,000 times better

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.700
 than those other things.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.940
 It's good to be skeptical

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:21.940
 because it isn't as absolute, clean knowledge

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:29.740
 as a lot of chemical tests can achieve.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.620
 - So let me see if I can understand you, Dr. Ray P.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.820
 What you're saying is,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.780
 so are you saying that the past year

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.780
 whole germ theory thing is correct

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.020
 and viruses do go around

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.940
 and we can share them with each other?

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.700
 - I'm a critic of the so-called germ theory

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.500
 that gives causality to the germ

00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.220
 because healthy people are not subject

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.540
 to getting sick from germs.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:07.140
 So the great weakness of the germ theory

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.100
 is that you need a particular receptive host

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.700
 for the germ.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.940
 And if you just eat well,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.100
 are relatively sanitary,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.620
 and get your vitamin D in sunlight and so on,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:30.260
 then you don't worry about these viral

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.460
 or bacterial or fungal diseases.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.580
 - But you say they're out there circulating.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.420
 - Yeah, Zach Bush, I think is right.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:46.300
 You can find viruses on Antarctic ice and snow.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.180
 They're blowing everywhere.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.020
 But I think their actual nature,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:24:00.540
 many biologists just don't like to touch the question

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.540
 because how do you get this complex bit of DNA or RNA

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.380
 floating around,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.300
 capable of being adopted

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:17.380
 and causing, participating in an infection?

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:23.260
 I think there's enough evidence now going back

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.260
 more than 50 years that there is a horizontal transmission

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.580
 of nucleic acids going on constantly,

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.860
 even before DNA was identified

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.660
 as the basic genetic material.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.140
 People were seeing evidence of transmission

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.860
 of genetic information across

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.220
 extremely different biological types

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.860
 from plants to animals,

00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:01.820
 algae to protozoa to humans and so on.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.820
 And genetic engineering,

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.540
 I mentioned that as a control,

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.220
 some experimenters injected

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:18.740
 absolutely simple DNA strands

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.860
 and cells without treatment.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.980
 Cells simply took up that massive molecule

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.300
 right through their so-called membrane

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:33.300
 and integrated it into their own genes.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.300
 And a group at Harvard and MIT recently

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.380
 demonstrated that the mRNA virus,

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.380
 the strip that's used in the vaccine,

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.020
 the Pfizer vaccine,

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.700
 that that virus added to a human tissue,

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.020
 human cell culture,

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:57.140
 can be replicated by the cells

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.260
 as the virus people intend,

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.140
 but it can also be copied into DNA

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.700
 and integrated into the cell's genome,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.300
 which is specifically what Fauci says can't happen

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.220
 because he studied genetics

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.500
 to the extent that he did in the 1960s

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:25.500
 before retroviruses were conceived as a possibility.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.860
 So he says, "No, it can't happen.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.980
 "Foreign DNA can't be integrated into our genome."

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.540
 But it turns out that a huge part of our genetic material

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.100
 comes from outside material,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.220
 including virus-like particles.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:50.220
 But when you look at the horizontal transmission

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.060
 of genetic information,

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.580
 you can see that people who have drunk water

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:03.100
 contaminated with an algae,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:08.100
 that the algae DNA has been found inside their brain cells

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.780
 and other body cells.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.940
 And experimenters with food

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.260
 find that a certain amount of the DNA in food

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.660
 finds its way into our cells.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:26.500
 And when you wonder how it is

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.900
 that this DNA is wandering around

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.700
 from species to species,

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.700
 bacteria have specifically engineered a way

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.060
 so that they can,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.340
 if they are starving for a certain nutrient,

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.260
 they can mutate their genes

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.220
 over a period of a couple of days

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:55.140
 so that they can digest and assimilate a different nutrient.

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.860
 They can adapt and create new genes.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.620
 And if they're exposed to a poison like an antibiotic,

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:06.380
 they can mutate and become resistant to that.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.740
 And they can pack that information

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.580
 that's useful to them into a packet

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.460
 and transmit it to other bacteria of their own species

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.780
 or even of different species.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.780
 And that has been studied so well in bacteria.

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.420
 It's only starting to be studied.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.660
 It actually began in the 1960s,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:35.660
 but there are people who continue to study the transmission

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.220
 from one part of our body to another,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.940
 the nucleic acids,

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.660
 but also from one organism to another.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.780
 And apparently, as the bacteria naturally do that

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:58.660
 as part of their living properties,

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.980
 probably every organism has that ability

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.300
 to share genetic information.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.300
 And just for our internal repair and maintenance system,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.940
 in the last 15 or 20 years,

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.860
 people are accepting that the exosomes,

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.980
 particles just about the size of viruses,

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.660
 are circulating in all of our body fluids,

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.740
 carrying information.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:34.020
 Even a cancer cell can put out exosomes

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.740
 that induce cancer in other parts of the body.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.940
 So it's not always just a repair process,

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:46.940
 but can be a disease spreading process within the body.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:51.940
 And so if those things are constantly being put

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:57.860
 into our human milk and urine, for example,

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:03.980
 bacteria are being exposed to these exosomes,

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.180
 and bacteria can assimilate human DNA.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.700
 And the same way humans can assimilate bacterial DNA,

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.500
 human DNA can get into the bacteria and yeast.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.300
 And so just through the urine, for example,

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:28.820
 we're putting our DNA constantly into the environment

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.820
 where bacteria and fungus and other organisms can pick it up.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.300
 And then when those organisms,

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:41.500
 bacteria especially, are picked up

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:46.300
 and carried around by other organisms,

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:51.300
 then that human fragment of DNA that we emitted

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.300
 is then available to the new recipient

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.980
 via the fungus or bacteria.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:06.220
 All of the means of transmission of exosomes are known.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.700
 And so exactly the point that Cowan and Kauffman are making

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:17.900
 is that degenerated cells transmit sickness

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:23.340
 among other things, new abilities,

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:28.340
 but also new sicknesses if the transmitter was sick.

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.260
 So what they're saying is right,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:38.260
 that they are probably derived

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.100
 from other animals and sick people,

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:47.020
 but still it's not a crime to call them viruses

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.420
 because they can be transported around

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:55.380
 by bacteria and fungus and whatever.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.700
 - So before we take some emails,

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.300
 then Dr. Ray Peat, on this March 2nd day,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.260
 where do you then separate yourself

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.100
 from the research and the theories on Kauffman and Cowan?

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.700
 We'll just use those two, there's a lot more.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.060
 Where do you separate their saying

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.740
 that they're missing something or are they not?

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.820
 I don't wanna put words in your mouth.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.140
 - Oh, just that their point of,

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.060
 their series of arguments for why it doesn't exist,

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:31.060
 it's all an exaggerated sense of purity, purification.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.820
 And isolation, to identify something,

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.100
 it doesn't have to be pure and isolated.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:44.940
 And then the other point is that the word virus

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:54.740
 shouldn't be such a magical thing.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.740
 It's just a temporary potential cause of disease,

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.900
 which could be exudations from a sick person.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.100
 - But their argument that the idea

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.420
 that if you don't truly isolate it,

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.620
 truly isolate it, excuse me,

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.940
 which they argue have never been done,

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.980
 then you don't really know what you're dealing with, right?

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.900
 Isn't that what they're arguing?

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.780
 - No, no, the same with chemicals.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:29.140
 We're confident that we know how a chemical reacts

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.420
 and even what shape it has and weight and so on

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:34.980
 without isolating it,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.980
 just by identifying how it behaves and reacts.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:46.220
 The same with everything in the world.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:53.220
 You know many things exist with great confidence,

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:58.460
 but you not necessarily have to have seen them.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.100
 Have seen it in isolation.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.140
 - But if there are other little tangents

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.580
 to something like, I don't know, antibiotics

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.020
 or monkey kidneys or whatever they do in the Petri dishes,

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:14.700
 are you still then a gray area proving that this caused that?

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.900
 - Well, it's the same with causation.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.660
 It's a matter of judgment and probability.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:28.660
 And causality, you always need a relatively susceptible

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:36.620
 and sick person to cause sickness in them.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:41.620
 A very tough, healthy person can undergo tremendous threats,

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:48.060
 eating dirt and bathing in filth

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.220
 and still they're absolutely healthy.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.420
 - I think one of their, what I understand,

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:55.780
 I may be wrong, but one of their big arguments,

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.940
 all of these people, including,

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.580
 you probably heard of Dr. Lanca in Europe,

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.100
 Stefan Lanca, viruses do not cause disease,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.500
 is that if we really look and get to the point

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.660
 where we don't believe that this whole virus thing

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.500
 is something to worry about,

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.780
 either flu virus, cold virus, or alleged COVID,

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.060
 then we can begin to look at what's really causing that,

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:23.580
 diseases, which could be toxins and chemicals

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.380
 and all kinds of things, right?

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.540
 And bad thoughts and all kinds of stuff.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.340
 - Yeah, I absolutely agree with that overall purpose

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.340
 that don't make a virus a magical thing

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.460
 because then crooks in the government,

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.860
 ignorant people like Fauci,

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:47.060
 with knowledge that wasn't good 60 years ago,

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.460
 will make proclamations about what the virus is going to do.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.220
 It's all fantasy, nonsense, and lies.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.260
 - And isn't that theory, that same thought,

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.180
 the whole background for vaccines in general, right?

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:02.020
 - Right, right.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:06.940
 The smallpox vaccine actually worked,

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.420
 but it was done in a traditional way,

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.840
 scratching the skin with the bad stuff, whatever it was,

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:21.060
 would induce a sore and usually lifelong immunity

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:27.700
 to smallpox, and that scratching the skin

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.260
 or irritating the intestine,

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:36.100
 that activates, in a healthy person,

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:41.020
 that activates a resistance rather than a sickness.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:47.380
 And that vaccine was used intelligently

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:53.460
 to encircle the isolated areas

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.540
 where smallpox broke out.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.660
 They would encircle the area with vaccination,

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.020
 and over a very short time,

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.620
 were able to eliminate the disease entirely.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.820
 But that was not at all good business

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.460
 for the vaccine industry, to eliminate a disease

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.900
 from the world.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.900
 So even though they knew how to use a vaccine intelligently,

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:25.820
 activating the skin, not injecting it deep into the muscle

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.420
 where it gets into the brain,

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.360
 but activating the proper immune system,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.360
 and then using it to stop in a focused, organized way

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.900
 to encircle and eliminate the infections,

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.060
 that's how a vaccine should be used.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.940
 But because of the profitability,

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:51.940
 they're going crazy inoculating areas

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:57.900
 that haven't suffered noticeably from the sickness.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.060
 They get half a dozen measles cases,

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.820
 and they want to vaccinate millions of people

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:08.340
 instead of encircling and eliminating the disease

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.460
 forever from the world.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:15.460
 The disorganization is a ploy to keep selling

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.580
 more and more vaccines to more and more people.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.420
 - You think it's possible measles and mumps

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.260
 are just a natural detoxification process?

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.580
 - No, I think there--

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.340
 - You think there's something there?

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:31.540
 - Yeah, like a cold or herpes,

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:38.100
 a person who is out of a proper environment,

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:43.860
 like you go indoors and keep the air warm and dry,

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:48.860
 your mucous membranes get dried out and inflamed,

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:54.620
 and just any harmful agent, exosomes, junk emitted

00:38:54.620 --> 00:39:01.420
 by people in the house or that you contact,

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.740
 whatever it is, the irritant or toxin or germ

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.180
 emitted by these people will catch

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.300
 in the damaged mucous membrane,

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.660
 and then you suffer the same process.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.940
 - Dr. Ray Peat is here.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.980
 Would you mind, would you be okay with me

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:26.100
 sending this audio to Dr. Cowan and Dr. Kaufman,

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.860
 and just to, if I know them,

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.380
 they'll probably do a whole video on this,

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.580
 and maybe we can have a little discussion.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.420
 - Okay.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.460
 - Okay, with you?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.300
 - Sure.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.140
 - Cool.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.960
 Okay, stay right there.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.800
 We're gonna go to some emails.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.620
 Dr. Ray Peat, it is drrayPeat.com,

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:44.180
 or rayPeat.com, let me see if I got the right one.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.420
 And he's got a newsletter that you can check out,

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.900
 and please do if you feel so moved.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.860
 It is rayPeat.com.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.180
 It comes out every couple of months,

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:56.980
 and you just do rayPeatnewsletters@gmail.com.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.540
 Very inexpensive, and you'll see all kinds

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.180
 of really fun articles.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:04.380
 He's been around the bend here for a long time

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.460
 looking into these things, going back to,

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.260
 well, PhD in biology a long time ago,

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.420
 I guess back in about,

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:17.300
 he did his work on hormones in 1968.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.820
 So we're gonna do a quick little break here,

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.740
 and then we're gonna take your emails,

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.340
 and it'll be good if Dr. Peat agrees

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.020
 we can come back in a couple weeks

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.820
 on our regular third Monday,

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.140
 because we have so many emails,

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:32.340
 and we spent so much time on the whole virus thing,

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.100
 we're not gonna be able to get to them all,

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.900
 and even half of them.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.660
 But the colostrum sale is still going on.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.500
 Still going on.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.580
 (laughs)

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.460
 Need a little water, colostrum thing.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.300
 Hold on.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.300
 Daniel Vitalis, this idea of colostrum

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.340
 being really good for the immune system,

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.820
 tell us a little bit about that.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.180
 - Well, the thing about colostrum

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:57.980
 is that it is developed in the blood of the cow

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.220
 right before it calves,

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.340
 and it's developed so that it can format

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.260
 the immune system of its calf.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.900
 It's pretty important to understand

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.140
 that a calf would have no immune system

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.140
 if it got no colostrum,

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.860
 so it's pretty well understood that

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.340
 if you deprive a calf of colostrum,

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.820
 it's gonna have a failure to thrive,

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.140
 it might even die.

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.860
 Now, human beings are a little bit different.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.520
 We can survive without our mother's colostrum,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.660
 but we never are gonna have a fully intact immune system.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.660
 The important thing to remember

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.180
 is that we're living in an era

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.140
 where there's more people alive today

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.100
 with dysfunctional immune systems than ever before,

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.060
 and colostrum gives us the ability

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.180
 to actually restructure, rebuild,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.140
 and reformat our immune systems

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.940
 so we can really thrive in our modern world today.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.940
 - Explore, research, and order

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.400

 through Thursday using promo code.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.420
 I'm drinking a smoothie here,

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.060
 and it's kind of making me,

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.820
 (clears throat)

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.980
 I might not be able to talk well.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.020
 2021, healthy 2021.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.420
 You can save up to 60 bucks

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.180
 on some of the colostrum products

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.220
 on any Survival link on the colostrum.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.700
 Would you like to get a little AquaCare machine?

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.940
 Hydrogen's a pretty fascinating technology.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.940
 Molecular hydrogen is actually a medical term

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.600
 and device used in China, or in Japan, rather.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:39.100
 It is called Shin-Nu solution,

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.380
 molecular hydrogen, a medical device in Japan for many years,

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:45.980
 and it's been being used for folks

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:50.980
 to help rebuild after a stroke and things like that.

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.100
 Here's George on the possibility

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.340
 of using it as a nice investment.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.820
 There's a lifetime warranty

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.620
 and a one-year money-back guarantee.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.300
 This is Brown's Gas Hydrogen.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.060
 Many people have said, and we concur,

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.420
 that the number one investment we should make

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.140
 is in our health.

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.500
 Here's George Wiseman.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.580
 Last caller, I'm sorry, I didn't remember his name,

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.140
 said an investment,

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.740
 and this is really the investment kind of thing

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.860
 that you need to do.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.260
 Not my machine specifically.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.060
 I think I sell the world's best machine,

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.420
 and I do my best to maintain it

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.100
 and support the customers and everything,

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.020
 but regardless of who you get it from,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.900
 you really should invest in your health.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.900
 How are you gonna enjoy life if you haven't got health?

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.260
 How are you gonna fulfill that bucket list?

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.860
 So number one on the bucket list should be your health,

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.420
 and then you get some extra years.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.700
 I say this thing not only adds years to your life

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.980
 because the science is showing a 30 to 50% life extension,

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.220
 so I'm expecting to go to the 120, 150 years old,

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.020
 and I'd help a lot of people between now and then,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.380
 but it also adds life to your years.

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.300
 There's no sense living your last decade of life

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.860
 if you're in a hospital bed attached to machines,

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.700
 you know what I mean?

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.420
 Throwing a Frisbee and having fun.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:04.700
 It's so true, isn't it?

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.340
 Boy, if we don't feel good and have the energy

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.220
 to do what we need to do, I mean, what's the point?

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.740
 And here's an investment with a lifetime warranty,

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.460
 and also a one-year, no questions asked, money back,

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.180
 guarantee if you don't want it.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.340
 Check out this Aquacure machine,

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.380
 bubbling hydrogen gas, drinking it, breathing it.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.780
 This is real cutting-edge technology.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.940
 Check it out in our store.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.700

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.940
 We have one of the all-time best, I think, cereal.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:40.780
 I'm cereal.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:45.780
 I've used this sauna for, gosh, over 10 years now

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:50.260
 for the money and the way it works,

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.260
 the efficiency, the effectiveness.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.380
 I think I've never seen anything to compare

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.300
 with the price and the effectiveness

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.100
 of this RelaxFar Infrared Sauna.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.620
 If you'd like to learn more about it,

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.700
 go on OneRadioNetwork.com, click on the sauna ad,

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.100
 and look at all the good things there.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:12.540
 And I think you'll find that it's really something

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:17.380
 that's very powerful if you'd like to get yourself one.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.260
 Just email me for the best price,

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.260
 Just shoot me an email.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:25.100
 (upbeat music)

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.420
 - We are listener supported, One Radio Network.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.580
 - We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.260
 Always fun to talk to you, sir.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:32.820
 How do you spend most of your day?

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.140
 Are you still do lots and lots of research?

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.340
 Or I know you paint, too.

00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.740
 - Oh, a little painting, but lots of reading.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:45.540
 - Yeah, what have you been reading mostly on these days?

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.260
 - What was that?

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:51.300
 - What do you read mostly on these days?

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.700
 - Oh, it changes.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.980
 Like I'm currently working on a newsletter

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.140
 related to inflammation,

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:04.140
 but the holistic aspect of the organism

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.380
 has almost always been neglected

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.620
 as a component of inflammation.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:17.620
 And why healthy people can avoid

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.540
 getting inflammatory conditions.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:27.540
 A lot of it is simply a matter of their attention,

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:33.900
 how their brain is organized in daily work.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:38.180
 If you're scattered and distracted constantly

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.260
 by meaningless tasks,

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:46.260
 I think that seriously affects your inflammation processes

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.620
 and your immunity.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.820
 - Yeah, it makes sense though, doesn't it?

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.140
 If we're scattered around and not focused on breathing

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.700
 and who we are as spiritual beings and our strength,

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:01.060
 then it would make sense that it would weaken us.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:07.020
 - Yeah, and I'm finding things in the history

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.100
 of psychology and biology

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:13.460
 that support that in a very simple way.

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.820
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.300
 I think it's more simple than we even imagine, Dr. Pate.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.980
 I really do.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:23.500
 That if we're worried or in fear,

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.780
 my experience is that it's in the body at that moment.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.220
 It's right in there, right in there.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.420
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.900
 - Yeah, wow.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.740
 Here's Linda.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:33.780
 She says, "Great show, Patrick.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.180
 "I am a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.260
 "If you were consulting with me,

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.860
 "what would you recommend to totally reverse

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.340
 "these high blood sugar things?"

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:49.820
 - Well, first, I would identify

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.780
 the cause of the high blood sugar.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:58.700
 I think the type 2 and proposed other kinds

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.020
 of so-called diabetes,

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:04.820
 like pregnancy diabetes,

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.420
 I think these are just medical intentions

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.620
 to sell products and services.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:17.260
 It's based way back in the 1940s.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:24.020
 Research on the pituitary, pancreas, thyroid,

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:28.540
 adrenal interactions showed that

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:34.460
 the insulin was only a very tiny part

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.220
 of the blood sugar regulatory system.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:42.900
 Doctors almost always fail to check

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:46.700
 what's going on with your endocrine system,

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.500
 known to regulate blood sugar.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.500
 They just call it diabetes and leave it at that.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.540
 Give you something that directly

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.620
 lowers the blood sugar,

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.460
 even though it's achieved at the cost

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:07.460
 of damaging your mitochondrial respiratory system

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:12.260
 so that you go into an inefficient

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.100
 glucose-wasting condition.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:19.860
 Traditional side effect problem

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.300
 of this treatment of diabetes

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:26.580
 has been increased lactic acid production

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:29.900
 with serious, even deadly,

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.860
 lactic acidosis being a result.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.820
 But the principle has continued to be

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:41.420
 damage the respiratory use of glucose

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:45.220
 so that you waste glucose and lower the blood sugar.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.060
 I think the problem should be approached

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:52.140
 by looking first for what is causing

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:53.580
 the high blood sugar.

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.780
 And often it's just a chronically high level

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:02.780
 of cortisol production or of another hormone.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.060
 And if you find out why your cortisol is high,

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:11.300
 often that's a reaction simply to hypothyroidism.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:17.180
 Lack of thyroid hormone makes you unable

00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:19.300
 to oxidize glucose.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.700
 And that puts you in a stress state.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:27.700
 The stress state amplifies to raise the blood sugar.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.660
 It keeps the cells from using it

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.100
 and shifts you over,

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.820
 forcing you to run on fats

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.620
 and putting fats into your bloodstream.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:47.620
 Free fatty acids are the other essential blood test

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.620
 for anyone diagnosed with so-called type two diabetes.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.100
 Cortisol and free fatty acids,

00:50:56.100 --> 00:51:01.100
 and if possible, checking on your lactic acid level.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.540
 Your lactic acid should be at the very bottom

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:09.420
 of the so-called acceptable normal range.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:14.340
 - And is it true that simple angst or worry or fear

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.220
 can raise cortisol levels?

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:21.220
 - Right, right, as well as lowering thyroid.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.460
 - Wow.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:30.180
 - Just a very sudden onset of worry, anxiety, or fear

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:35.140
 can give you a surge of free fatty acids

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:40.140
 which will block your ability to use glucose.

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:42.300
 There's a direct antagonism

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:48.220
 when your blood fats rise in the free fatty acid form.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:52.020
 That blocks use of glucose

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:56.220
 and so you can instantly create the appearance

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.300
 of type two diabetes.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.740
 In other words, just high blood sugar

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.260
 is all they diagnose it on.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.100
 - Hi, Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.900
 We are live here this morning, March 2nd.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.180
 Here's one for you.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:12.340
 Clint Pattison says he cured

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.620
 rheumatoid arthritis not to consume vegetable oils

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.420
 as they cause leaky gut.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:23.180
 Does Dr. Peat agree I use olive oil?

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.300
 Let's see, rheumatoid arthritis and vegetable oils,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.300
 do they cause leaky gut and could be RA causing?

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.540
 - Yeah, the inflammatory prostaglandins

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:40.660
 wouldn't be made except that we eat

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:44.740
 either arachidonic acid or linoleic acid

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.220
 or linoleic acid.

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.940
 Linoleic and arachidonic acids,

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:54.180
 they call them essential fatty acids

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:59.180
 but when animals or people are put on a diet

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:04.780
 that makes them absolutely deficient

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.760
 in the so-called essential fatty acids,

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.660
 their immunity and all types of resistance

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:16.660
 to infection, poisoning, trauma, fatigue, hypoxia,

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:21.420
 all kinds of stress resistance tremendously improves

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:26.420
 when you're free of the inflammatory prostaglandins

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:31.140
 made from the essential so-called fatty acids.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:37.940
 So when you eat the high proof of vegetable oils,

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:45.240
 canola, soy, all of the popular cooking oils,

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:51.560
 you're getting a very high background content

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.680
 of the material from which prostaglandins

00:53:55.680 --> 00:54:00.080
 will create inflammation at the slightest provocation.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.560
 And it happens that olive oil contains

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.400
 maybe eight to 10% of these potentially toxic

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.000
 polyunsaturated fats.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.320
 The rest of it is safe monounsaturated mostly.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:23.160
 And those don't contribute to the formation

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.840
 of the toxic prostaglandins.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.640
 - So regular use of olive oil is,

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.760
 in your opinion, no fine?

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.320
 - Well, butter is better because it's only about 3%

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.820
 of the bad stuff.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.760
 But if you hold your olive oil down to flavoring,

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.700
 maybe a teaspoon full or so,

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.800
 it gives good flavor if it's good olive oil

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.040
 without much danger.

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.320
 But butter is like three times as safe.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.480
 - Butter is the safest.

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.640
 Isn't that interesting?

00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.260
 Here's an email.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.860
 I've been fast developing cataract on my right eye

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:05.520
 and I'm reluctant to have the operation due to sojourns.

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.280
 Any natural remedies or therapies for this?

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:15.320
 - Oh, people, my brother, for example,

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:21.200
 had a cataract diagnosed when he was about 70.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:25.280
 And in his late 70s, he went back

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.280
 and the oculist said he could see where there had been one,

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:37.140
 but there was no trace of a functioning cataract left.

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:40.180
 So people do recover from them

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:42.040
 when their physiology changes.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:48.020
 But the loss of energy to those cells

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:54.980
 that become opaque leads to them swelling

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:58.580
 just like any de-energized tissue swells,

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:01.780
 takes up water and the water,

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:04.020
 the effect is like cooking egg white.

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:10.860
 The change of the water from an organized transparent state,

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:16.440
 it becomes an opaque, like a cooked egg white.

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:22.500
 And in the cornea of the eye,

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.740
 that can happen to a woman with, for some reason,

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:31.900
 extreme water retention.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.780
 I knew someone who suddenly,

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.420
 in a period of just a few hours,

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:41.500
 went blind in both eyes because the corneas

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.180
 became white and opaque.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:47.220
 And just by bathing her eyes

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.860
 in a slightly hypertonic salt solution,

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.960
 the salt, hypertonic salt solution,

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.980
 removed some of the excess water

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:03.180
 and immediately her corneas were clear again.

00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.020
 - Interesting.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:08.140
 - And anything that can shift your balance

00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:13.140
 away from that water disorganization

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:18.380
 and retention effect can let the cataract clear up.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:23.480
 - And that solution, any thoughts on

00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.200
 how you would make that solution properly?

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.440
 - Well, saline comes into contact

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:34.860
 with the cornea directly, so it acts immediately.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:38.620
 But it can't reach the lens,

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.160
 so it isn't gonna work to,

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:46.760
 it might have an effect over a period of a long time.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:51.760
 But the problem is to get your whole body shifted

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.460
 so that your body fluids, themselves,

00:57:55.460 --> 00:58:00.460
 the blood and the fluids in the eye

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:05.740
 are bathing the eye with more water restraining effect,

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:16.500
 possibly more protein and sodium in the water

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.600
 of your bloodstream and all body fluids.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:24.780
 But probably other things involved,

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:29.780
 like keeping the external degree of oxidation

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:34.840
 in your blood and fluids, keeping that higher

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.800
 so that you don't push things towards inflammation

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.560
 and water retention.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:43.280
 - And if you were gonna mix a little salt with water

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.140
 on the outside of the eye,

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.420
 what would be the proportions you would use?

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.680
 - Oh, for the clearing up the cornea,

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:56.360
 I think she used an a quart of water,

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.240
 I think she used either two rounded teaspoons

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.680
 or maybe three rounded teaspoons.

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.720
 - In a quart. - In a quart.

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.800
 - And speaking of salt, this is a great lead

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.760
 into this question, would you please ask Dr. Peat, writes

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:13.680
 Amy, about information on Morton's pickling

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:17.320
 and canning salt that Dr. Hal Huggins used to recommend

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.080
 versus, say, a Redmond salt or a Himalayan salt?

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:23.580
 Does he have any theories on this or research to show

00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.360
 which would be the best choice?

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.600
 - The canning and pickling sauce,

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:34.520
 its feature is that they don't add iron

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:39.080
 and other materials for free flowing,

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:44.080
 it's just the sodium chloride in a very pure form.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:51.640
 For example, someone I knew worked in a blood chemistry lab

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.760
 and they would buy most of their chemicals

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.840
 from a company like Sigma or Spectrum

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.880
 and pay astronomical prices,

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:06.880
 but when they wanted chemically pure sodium chloride,

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.000
 they would just go to the store.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.240
 - Get pickling salt. - Yeah.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.640
 - So you think it's a pretty good choice every day,

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.880
 pickling salt?

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.080
 - Yeah, because the coloring material,

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.320
 if it's gray or pink or whatever,

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:25.320
 the pink is usually iron oxide or iron other chemicals.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.520
 - And the sea salts.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.200
 Of course, the sea salt people make this argument

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.520
 that we need all of these different minerals,

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.760
 but you don't resonate with that?

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:40.760
 - No, some places identify 90 or 92 different minerals,

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.800
 but most of those are toxic minerals.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.200
 - You remember Dr. Hal Huggins, Dr. Peat, right?

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.800
 The mercury guy? - Oh yeah.

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.720
 - We used to have him on the show before he left us

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.640
 and he would, almost every show, he would say,

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.480
 "I look at these blood chemistries, Patrick, every day."

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.240
 And he does a lot of them.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.760
 And he said that the people on Morton's pickling

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.000
 and canning salt had better balances

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.560
 of the everything in their blood than the people on sea salt.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.880
 He said that a lot.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.680
 - Oh yeah, it's very clean stuff.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:12.640
 - Clean stuff, huh.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.320
 And it's very inexpensive.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.960
 I mean, you can get a whole box of it for what,

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.280
 a buck or something?

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.280
 - I think it's four pounds in a box for a couple dollars.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.760
 - Here's one for you from Carol.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.080
 I'm a woman 77 years old, and lately I sometimes wake up

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.240
 in the middle of the night

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.080
 and my whole body is internally vibrating.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.000
 What could be causing this anyway to remedy it?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:34.840
 Wow.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.800
 - Oh yeah, the blood sugar normally falls at night

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.000
 as the metabolism slows down.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
 And just the very low blood sugar can give you surges

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.680
 of adrenaline that create symptoms like that vibration.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:58.200
 Sometimes with changes in many brain chemicals

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.520
 in reaction to the hypoglycemia,

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:06.200
 you might wake up with extreme clarity of thought

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.280
 or extreme panic and fear.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:15.280
 But it's derived from the fact that the liver and muscles

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.560
 should be well supplied with stored glucose as glycogen.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:26.200
 And then during the night, as we stop eating,

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:31.200
 the blood sugar falls and liver glycogen should be released

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.200
 into the blood so that we don't have surges

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.040
 of free fatty acids.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.160
 But about halfway through the night,

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:45.160
 most people do have a failure of the liver stored glycogen

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.800
 and they start putting out large amounts

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.480
 of free fatty acids.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.520
 And those fatty acids block our ability to use glucose

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:03.080
 and creates really a brain toxic situation.

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:03.920
 - Wow.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.240
 - And so waking up and having a snack,

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.520
 a glass of orange juice or milk, for example,

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.520
 gives our brain some glucose and helps lower

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.200
 the free fatty acids in the blood.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.960
 - Anything that you found over the years to do

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.400
 before bed to help this whole situation

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.320
 so you don't wake up?

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.320
 - Yeah, some orange juice, jello, marshmallows,

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:37.080
 ice cream, milkshake, emphasizing carbohydrate,

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:43.720
 experiments to stop nocturnal hot flashes and night sweats.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.720
 They would give them a huge amount of cornstarch,

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.120
 for example, any carbohydrate will do,

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.720
 but it should be along with nutrients.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:59.960
 - What's the difference between the carbohydrate there,

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.240
 Doc, with, or maybe say an organic sprouted bread

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:07.360
 or a cracker or something like that?

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.200
 Similar?

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.880
 - When you're under stress, any carbohydrate

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.400
 is better than the stress which poisons you

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.960
 with the usually polyunsaturated fats

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.960
 that get into your brain and the brain is renewing itself

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.040
 during the night so there's a huge turnover

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.320
 of brain substance and the stress is putting

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:37.760
 free fatty acids that you've eaten into your bloodstream,

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.920
 they get incorporated very quickly

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.240
 as they pass through the brain.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.880
 So your brain substance is changing very quickly

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.640
 over a period of just a few weeks,

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.640
 the brain will change its substance

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.920
 according to what you ate.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.920
 - So could this be where the whole idea

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.960
 of comfort food comes in, where you have something

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.840
 really good, like a potatoes or organic pasta or something

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.000
 and you just feel better if you're freaked out

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.840
 about something?

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:12.240
 - Oh yeah, it could be potatoes or pasta or a milkshake.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.320
 - A milkshake.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.720
 - Sugar, getting your blood sugar up

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.040
 and your free fatty acids down,

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.160
 it creates a sense of peace and well-being

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.680
 and lowers inflammation.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.600
 - Lowers inflammation, wow.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:31.600
 - Hypoglycemia is, diabetics suffer from that

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.900
 because they aren't using their glucose,

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:39.800
 they're suffering a deficiency of glucose

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.000
 even when they have high blood glucose

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.600
 because it isn't getting into the cells to be used.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:51.600
 And hypoglycemia is a powerful cause of inflammation

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.000
 just like hypoxia, it's basically suffocating

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.880
 on the energy level.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.320
 - Well Dr. Peat, you're the most fun nutritionist we know,

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.680
 recommending milkshakes and ice cream before bed,

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.560
 I mean that's great, orange juice,

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.720
 doesn't get much better than that, does it?

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.160
 - Yeah, a person shouldn't specialize in those

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.120
 if they have a weight problem,

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.840
 but milk, it happens that the high calcium

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:24.840
 to phosphate ratio of milk activates the metabolism

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.560
 so that it burns energy at a much higher rate.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.920
 Animal studies as well as human studies show

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:35.920
 that mostly the calcium but other things

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.160
 in a high milk diet are great for weight loss,

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.840
 a very great increase in the metabolic rate

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.520
 and ability to burn calories.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.480
 - Interesting, Dr. Ray Peat is with us,

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.740
 we are live here March 2nd, 2021.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.320
 We're gonna talk to Fred Dashefsky

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.000
 and also Matthew Errett tomorrow,

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.120
 Wednesday we begin at 10 o'clock or so.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.400
 Here's one for you from Alistair, Dr. Peat,

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.300
 how harmful is MSG?

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.720
 Should it be avoided completely or a small amount's okay?

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:11.800
 - I think a small amount is okay,

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.160
 but it is, glutamic acid is a brain excitant

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.160
 and especially if you don't have a protein to balance it,

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:26.120
 there is glutamic acid at a fairly high concentration

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.080
 in gelatin for example,

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:33.080
 but the other amino acids keep the glutamic acid

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:37.060
 from getting into your brain at a high level

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.700
 where it could cause excitotoxic damage.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.260
 So if you're just having pasta for example,

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.740
 even a fairly small amount of MSG

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:53.200
 could potentially be toxic.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.280
 - Uh-huh, yeah.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:58.060
 What do you think about the cold?

01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.940
 I noticed that during this,

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.740
 when I had no electricity, no heat

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:03.760
 and we were out gathering wood and all that,

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.460
 I actually felt stronger being out there.

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:10.220
 Do you think it could actually be healthier

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.600
 to live in a cold climate?

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.980
 - Only if you're regularly exposed to it,

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.500
 like animals that live outdoors

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.580
 develop a heavy coat of fur in the winter

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:28.060
 and their thyroid adjusts up

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.820
 like four times as active during the winter.

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:31.900
 - Interesting.

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.500
 - But that's because of the stimulation of the skin.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.100
 And so if you're well fed and spend your days

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.780
 doing some activity outdoors

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:46.580
 where you're constantly exposed to the cold,

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.420
 that should, like any animal,

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:53.780
 it should increase your thyroid function.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:56.380
 - If you did cold water on your face and neck

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.700
 say in the morning, really ice cold water,

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.740
 how does that affect the parasympathetic

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.940
 or the sympathetic nervous system?

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:07.860
 - It gives you a surge of sympathetic activity.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:10.140
 - Sympathetic activity, wow.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:10.980
 - Yeah.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:17.620
 They think it activates a diving reflex.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:21.620
 In babies you can see a shift of the blood flow

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.520
 like in a seal.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.020
 They drastically shift the nervous system

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:34.340
 and the sense that their face is underwater

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:37.940
 redirects the blood circulation.

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.660
 So it's mostly oxygenating.

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.660
 The remaining oxygen goes to their brain and lungs

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:49.700
 and lets the muscles live on glycolysis.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:53.420
 And the cold water on your face,

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.300
 especially if you've been overheated,

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.620
 can cause that shift of the nervous system.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.460
 When I worked in the woods

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.820
 and would be very thirsty and overheated,

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:12.140
 I would come to a stream and lie down

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.380
 and put my face in the cold water to drink.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.340
 I would feel what was probably a dangerous surge

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.980
 of nervous activity that was,

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:29.580
 I think, redirecting my blood flow to my lungs and brains.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.780
 But I would tilt it that way with my head down.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:39.220
 Usually felt like I was in danger of having a stroke

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:44.380
 or something, a very congested feeling in my head.

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:48.900
 - Years ago I read where they would take these

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.980
 Tour de France cyclists, you know,

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.900
 who were cycling all day long.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.500
 And they'd get really hot

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.980
 and they'd actually have to pack their necks in ice

01:10:56.980 --> 01:10:58.260
 so they could sleep.

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.900
 But that's almost contrary to what you've just said

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.700
 about sympathetic and parasympathetic,

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.380
 so I'm a bit confused.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.020
 Maybe that article was incorrect?

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:10.380
 In other words, these bicyclers, you know,

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.180
 they would cycle all day long

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:13.940
 in the Tour de France during the summer

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.700
 and they would be so heated up,

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:19.820
 they'd actually have to put these ice packs on their neck

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.540
 to sleep, to be able to sleep.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:27.780
 - Yeah, that's just because overheating is dangerous.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.700
 - I see.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.500
 - If you get your temperature under control,

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.940
 then your body can adjust to go to sleep.

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.940
 But the overheating turns on what my last newsletter

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:49.100
 was talking about, the heat shock proteins,

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.180
 which defend against the heat,

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:57.180
 but they do that at the expense of energy production

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:01.900
 in the efficient oxidizing way.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:06.900
 And so they lower all of your healthy adaptive functions

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:11.420
 as an emergency measure against the heat.

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:18.300
 So after overheating seriously, like an athlete might,

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.820
 then you have to do something to try to reverse

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.580
 that heat shock protein suppression

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.220
 of your proper metabolism.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.060
 - Interesting.

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.660
 So that's maybe why I sleep better and feel better

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:35.620
 when I get out of the sauna and do an ice cold shower,

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:38.380
 right out of there, and stay under that ice cold shower

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:39.460
 for five minutes.

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:45.820
 - Yeah, you don't want to overheat as long as you don't have

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:51.740
 a bad reaction like fatigue.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:56.740
 Cold water, if it's too cold, can drain your energy.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:13:04.940
 The amount of energy that we actually use for functioning

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:09.780
 is a fairly small fraction of what we emit

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.380
 by conduction and radiation.

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:17.380
 We radiate about three quarters of our food energy

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.260
 out as infrared and microwaves.

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:28.140
 And so if we're in a very cold, relative to our ability

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:34.780
 to burn calories, then our body temperature falls

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.220
 and we're seriously sick.

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:39.420
 - Do you think there's ways that we can systematically

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:44.140
 and cleverly learn how to survive and thrive

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:49.060
 on less physical food using more of the God force?

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:56.060
 - Yeah, you can survive.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:59.020
 When I worked in the woods, I knew a guy

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:04.020
 who only took one quart of water and sipped it occasionally

01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:07.660
 and only one little sandwich.

01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:12.660
 And he was very apparently comfortable,

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:18.020
 but when you look at the outcome over a lifetime,

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:22.540
 the higher your metabolic rate, the longer you live

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.580
 and the fewer sicknesses.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.580
 So wasteful heat production, uncoupling your heat production

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:37.140
 from the production of usable ATP,

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.300
 it has lots of beneficial effects.

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:44.100
 It reduces inflammation.

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.460
 - So how do we raise our metabolic rate?

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:49.980
 - Avoiding PUFA.

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:50.820
 - PUFAs?

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:55.660
 - That's the most important basic thing for most people.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:59.220
 - And what does eating in general do to the metabolic rate?

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:02.060
 If one survives on less food,

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:04.580
 is that lower or raise the metabolic rate?

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:11.900
 - If you're avoiding like a calorie-restricted diet,

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:18.940
 the benefit of it is that people eat almost none

01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:21.140
 of the toxic polyunsaturated fats.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:21.980
 - Okay.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:27.460
 - And they get lower intake of heavy metals and iron,

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:30.260
 so they're drastically reducing the poisoning.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:36.060
 The amino acids tryptophan, methionine, and cysteine,

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.460
 people are almost always overeating on those amino acids

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:45.100
 and the proteins that they get.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:50.100
 And Broda Barnes found with his experiments on himself

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:54.860
 that when he ate a high-protein, almost pure-protein diet,

01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:58.500
 he needed at least twice as much thyroid supplement

01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.900
 to keep going.

01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:01.020
 - Really?

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.580
 - Because of those particular amino acids

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:08.700
 being thyroid-suppressive and non-metabolic.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:11.900
 And so a low-protein diet,

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.860
 as long as you get just what you need,

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.780
 and gelatin is very helpful for that

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.420
 because it doesn't have the suppressive amino acids.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.660
 - So I see, so the supplemental gelatin,

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:27.140
 like Great Lake gelatin or gelatin from bone broth

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:28.220
 and things like that?

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.900
 - Yeah, gelatin and carbohydrate.

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:32.740
 - Carbohydrate.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:35.580
 - And that will support your high metabolic rate

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:39.380
 at a much lower calorie intake

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:43.420
 if you avoid the toxic calories.

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.540
 - Here's an interesting question.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.100
 Is Dr. Peat talking about the Schumann resonance

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:52.300
 affecting the magnetic frequencies of the Earth?

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:55.580
 Doesn't it also determine lightning strikes

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:59.100
 and disprove global warming as it's being sold?

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:04.140
 - I've only been concerned with its effects

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:05.500
 on the organisms.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:11.060
 But yeah, the whole electrical function

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:18.700
 of the Earth interaction with the solar wind

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:23.020
 streaming past the Earth,

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:28.900
 it's like a wind chimes sort of effect.

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:34.940
 It's activated by the streaming solar wind

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:36.980
 and the Earth resonates to that.

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.700
 And in the process, you get big shifts of electricity

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:46.380
 that undoubtedly contribute to why there are more

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:49.780
 thunderstorms in some seasons

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:54.120
 and how those interact with the solar cycles.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.780
 - Here's an email, oh, go ahead.

01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:01.780
 - Solar cycles are probably a better explanation

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:06.020
 for the data that they see and refer to

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.860
 as anthropogenic planetary warming.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.460
 - Yeah, there's more information.

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:15.760
 We like a website called Suspicious Observers

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.380
 with Ben Davidson.

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.780
 And he puts out these videos, Doc, every day

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.740
 about the whole sun and the sunspots

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:22.640
 and everything going on.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.500
 And he's been very accurate with predicting everything

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.860
 from earthquakes to floods to all kinds of stuff.

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:35.660
 - Yeah, it's partly kind of a superstition among scientists.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:39.700
 They don't want to recognize how powerful

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.380
 the sun's influence is.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:47.460
 And even the interactions of the heavy planets

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:51.180
 with the sun and the Earth, those have influences.

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:56.340
 And the traditional science people are made nervous

01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:01.020
 by it, it's too complicated,

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.580
 and they call it superstition.

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:07.460
 - Yeah, a lot of the sunspot people, Dr. Peat,

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:10.540
 suggested we could be going into much more of a cooling

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:12.740
 rather than a warming in the next--

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:18.300
 - Until Three Mile Island happened,

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:21.380
 all of the experts were predicting,

01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:25.420
 for decades they've been predicting a new coming ice age.

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.740
 But the Pentagon put out some publications

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:32.660
 following the Three Mile Island scare

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.740
 where people turned against nuclear power

01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:38.580
 because they saw the dangers.

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:43.580
 And the Pentagon needed their nuclear power

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:47.480
 as a source of material for atomic bombs.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.320
 And they didn't want people to turn against nuclear power,

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:58.380
 which they needed an excuse for why we should--

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.260
 - Why we need that stuff, right?

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:07.260
 - Give up petroleum and coal and shift to nuclear power.

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.860
 They invented the planetary warming thing.

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:13.620
 And suddenly, suddenly in just a period of a few months,

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:18.620
 the public media shifted from coming ice age

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.080
 to a coming heat catastrophe.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.040
 - Interesting, and when was Three Mile Island,

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.140
 that was, was that the '70s or '60s?

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:33.560
 - I forget exactly, or '76 or '78, somewhere around that.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.640
 - So your research shows that that was the whole beginning

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.600
 of this man-made global warming thing?

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:42.240
 - Yeah, I think it's called the "Lethal News"

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:47.040
 has a good article on the Pentagon's invention

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.480
 of global warming.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.320
 - That's correct.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.420
 A couple more, then we'll let you go.

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:57.680
 Let's see here, okay, this is Slavovski.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.400
 He says, "I've been following your dietary guidelines

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.880
 "for about three years, and I've seen huge improvements

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:05.120
 "to my health, thank you very much.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.500
 "One thing I'd like to improve more

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:11.480
 "is my high blood pressure that's around 180 to 110

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.920
 "on an average day.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.220
 "Somehow I think it's related to snoring and sleep apnea.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.420
 "My kids tell me I snore like a monster.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:22.200
 "Can you suggest any way to tackle the challenge

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.920
 "in general, what's causing the sleep apnea?"

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.320
 - Oh yeah, usually it's hypothyroidism.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:36.560
 And if you look at the people who have had hypothyroidism

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.400
 and high blood pressure, when they correct

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.400
 the hypothyroidism, it's the rule

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.520
 that they have corrected their high blood pressure too.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:56.520
 And hypothyroidism tends to lower the blood pressure.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:02.240
 Hypothyroidism compensates with high adrenaline

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.480
 and high inflammatory processes.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.800
 So hypothyroidism is a very important cause

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:09.440
 of high blood pressure.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.280
 - Interesting.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.840
 - As well as sleep apnea.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.840
 - Have you seen, I know you've worked so diligently

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.540
 with people around the world for a lot of times

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:21.400
 on the whole low thyroid.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.520
 Have you seen where people can actually use

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.160
 a little bit of the piggy stuff

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:26.800
 and get this thyroid back working

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.380
 without having to take it every day?

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:33.640
 - Oh yeah, I've seen two or three

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.000
 really spectacular examples of that.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.720
 One woman was diagnosed as having a non-functioning,

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.240
 completely dead pituitary gland.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.080
 - Huh.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:52.080
 - And all of her adrenal and thyroid and other hormones

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.280
 had gone down to zero.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.120
 And when she took, for just a few days,

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.200
 I think it was only a half a grain of thyroid supplement,

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:08.200
 suddenly that little bit catalyzed a signal

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:12.760
 that the stress situation was over

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:16.760
 and the stress had been knocking out her pituitary function.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.140
 So just in a week, everything came back.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:24.840
 And others, one woman who had been sick and disabled

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:27.700
 for I guess about 30 years,

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:34.000
 she felt better when she was taking

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.640
 a couple of grains of arm or thyroid.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:40.040
 But she decided to experiment and got a doctor

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.960
 to increase the dose up five grains a day

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.320
 was the maximum he would prescribe.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.760
 - Five grains.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.800
 - And she felt so much better on that

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.800
 that she went across the state and got another doctor

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:59.120
 and convinced him to give her five grains.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:03.200
 And she was almost back to normal

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:08.200
 after 30 years of extreme, needed a walker to get around.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.040
 - My goodness.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.240
 Now she didn't stay on the five grains a long time,

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.400
 I suspect.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.920
 - No, but she got a third doctor for another,

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.560
 she took 15 grains for a couple of three weeks.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:25.000
 And as she returned to normal,

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 it took her maybe eight or 10 weeks to cut it down,

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.720
 went back down to five grains

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.920
 and was back to work absolutely normal.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.760
 - My goodness.

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.920
 Now a grain is 60 milligrams, right?

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.600
 That's a lot, right?

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.600
 - Yeah, Broda-Barnes average patient got two grains.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.840
 - About two, about two.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.280
 - Yeah, and that's about half of what

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.400
 a healthy gland produces.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.840
 So even if you have no gland,

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.360
 you can function moderately well on two grains a day.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.920
 - Is there any reason to believe though

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.200
 that say somebody is taking two grains

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.360
 and they would like, you know,

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.520
 they're only 40 or 50 or whatever,

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:11.800
 and they don't want to really take this thing

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.360
 for another 50 years,

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.600
 that they can help this thyroid to get happy

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.000
 and not take those two grains?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.520
 Is there any reason to believe that's possible?

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.240
 - Yeah, as soon as you can unload

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.240
 all of the stored polyunsaturated fats

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.800
 that create the inflammation and the stress

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:34.120
 that requires thyroid and suppress thyroid,

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:37.040
 as soon as you can unload that fat.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:42.040
 So a thin person, the first woman I mentioned

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:45.520
 was very skinny and it just took her a week

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.200
 to get out of the stress.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.280
 The other one had hips that were

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:54.320
 almost three feet across, I think,

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.240
 and so it took her a lot of time

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.360
 to burn off some of that excess fat.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.520
 - Here's a final one, this is kind of a fun question

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.040
 from an email or a listener.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.320
 If splashing cold water on the face

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:10.600
 initiates the diving reflex,

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.640
 is it the increase of carbon dioxide

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.200
 that provides the oxygen to slow the breath down?

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.520
 - Oh, I've--

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.360
 - Do you understand?

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.320
 I don't understand the question, do you?

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.240
 If splashing cold water on the face--

01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:30.240
 - Well, I think that probably there is a lot

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:35.800
 of carbon dioxide because the remaining oxygen

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.720
 is being circulated mostly to the brain and lungs,

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.720
 and so they do accumulate a lot of carbon dioxide,

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:51.320
 but I think there's an immediate nervous signal

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.000
 to stop breathing hard, but over a period

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.640
 of 15, 20 seconds or so, the carbon dioxide

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.760
 starts having its effect of calming the stress nerves.

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:14.840
 But even though the higher carbon dioxide

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:20.520
 increases your sense need to breathe,

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.560
 I think for a diving animal,

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:29.560
 it is probably having a protective stabilizing effect.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.200
 - Finally, do you think it's important for us all

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:37.520
 to have our share of fruits throughout the week

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.640
 other than orange juice?

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.320
 It's good for us in general?

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:47.320
 - If you choose from fruits that aren't starchy

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.440
 or irritating, some fruits can be very allergenic

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:57.000
 and hard to digest, especially in supermarkets.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.920
 They aren't properly ripened.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:05.080
 Peaches, for example, are usually hard and indigestible.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.960
 - Oh, so when you get those kind of things,

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:10.280
 you bite into them, you just know

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.700
 that you shouldn't be eating that.

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:16.700
 That's a lot of starch and not ripened properly.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:17.680
 - Yeah.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.160
 - Not ripened properly.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.720
 Well, Dr. Peat, can we talk you into coming back

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.680
 on your regular time in a few weeks?

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:24.500
 - Okay.

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.340
 - Do you want to do that?

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.160
 Great.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.760
 And then we'll just dig right into the emails

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:30.080
 'cause we have so many here.

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.560
 And if you don't mind, I will send out your little discourse

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.960
 on your opinion about Cowans and Kaufman's

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.160
 and other people's work.

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.920
 I'll send it to them and we'll see what they say

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:42.120
 and maybe we'll do something with it.

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:42.960
 - Okay.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:43.780
 - Thanks a lot, sir.

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.720
 Appreciate it.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.560
 Bye-bye.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.380
 Take care.

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:50.900
 - Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:52.860
 We always agree to Dr. Peat to just keep him

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.140
 for an hour and a half.

01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:56.780
 Otherwise, we can just talk to him all day.

01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:58.020
 So that'll be fun.

01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:01.460
 We'll see what Dr. Cowan and Dr. Kaufman and others,

01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:03.020
 if they even respond, who knows.

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:03.840
 But they're good people.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.300
 I think they're gonna enjoy what he had to say.

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:10.060
 And I'm not familiar on the whole Zach Bush thing,

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:13.100
 so I'm not sure about that.

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.740
 I haven't kept up with Zach Bush.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:21.580
 But I sure do think that Cowan and, well, everybody,

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.980
 Dr. Peat, he agreed that if we could get more clear

01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:28.300
 on exactly what's going on, that we can then begin

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:31.980
 to hone in on what is causing all this stuff

01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:36.140
 we call diseases without chasing a bunch of germs

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:39.020
 that, like the COVID thing, that we know

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:41.260
 that it doesn't even exist.

01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:42.660
 - Well, it's curious, huh, kids?

01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:44.160
 Okay, so we're gonna have fun.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.940
 I will see you tomorrow with Fred Jaschefsky

01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.340
 in the real world of money.

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.900
 Also, Matthew Errett, he's gonna be here,

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.700
 and he's gonna tell you how deep state the deep goes

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:56.260
 and where to hear some of the stuff,

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.820
 and where it all started.

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:01.500
 And then a really interesting fellow

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:05.860
 up in the Northeast, Northwest, rather,

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:09.660
 and we're gonna talk to Paul, what's his name?

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:11.700
 Oh, well, his name is escaping me.

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.380
 But anyway, he's cool.

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:15.420
 Regenerative farming, and we're gonna need

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:18.060
 to be doing more of that because we saw

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:22.220
 what happened here in Texas when we had these temperatures

01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:24.380
 and the food stores finally opened.

01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:26.100
 You go in the store and there was no food.

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:29.620
 It was like, okay, wait a minute, there's no food here.

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:31.020
 What am I doing here?

01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:35.700
 I mean, seriously, it was like that during the,

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:40.340
 I think we were about, what, 10, 12 days

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:44.020
 without the basic necessities of water

01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:45.780
 and power and all kinds of stuff.

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.420
 The power was off and on.

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:49.540
 But then finally, when we wanted to get to the store

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:51.220
 and the streets got clear,

01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:56.140
 and then we went to the local HEB to pick up a few things,

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:58.220
 and they didn't have anything.

01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:00.900
 We were finding stuff to feed Doodle

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.340
 'cause she eats a lot of chicken and grass-fed beef

01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:05.820
 and organic chicken, and there was nothing there.

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.820
 I mean, the shelves were just like, phew.

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:12.200
 So I had that experience as well

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.500
 when I lived in New Orleans in the '70s,

01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:16.400
 and when a hurricane was coming,

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.840
 and they would talk about, they would predict this hurricane

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.880
 and they were pretty hardcore in New Orleans,

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.580
 and you go to the store and there was nothing.

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:28.720
 So the, I don't, this is not fear porn stuff,

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:32.840
 but these, all the stores, I don't care where they are,

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:35.600
 they're all in just-in-time inventory these days, right?

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:39.760
 They don't have a big area where they're storing stuff.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.200
 They got a few pallets of water, you'll see,

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:44.240
 few stuff that they sell a lot of, toilet paper,

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:46.640
 but no, they don't have a lot of food.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.240
 And so if the trucks ever get stopped or a highway

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:55.060
 gets an earthquake thing and main highway from whatever,

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.580
 10 from California to Texas,

01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:00.960
 there's not gonna be any food at the store.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.640
 So we have to think more about this

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.080
 and prepare for, just to take care of ourselves.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:09.240
 So we're gonna do more on the whole farming thing,

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:11.800
 and also we're gonna get George on real soon,

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.000
 George Altgeld, and talk about,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.080
 and get some people on how we can do more

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.680
 creative farming at home with the greenhouses

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:22.400
 and stuff on the balconies if you're,

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:26.160
 if you have a, you know, an apartment, stuff like that.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.760
 So there's lots to do.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:28.920
 I love you all very much.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.640
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.920
 We're running all kinds of fun videos

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.960
 when we're not running our streaming shows

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.200
 from One Radio Network, so stay in tune.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.000
 Come on our website, see what we have.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.520
 We find all kinds of crazy things, and they're fun.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.820
 And they're just more information.

01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:50.440
 We're not suggesting that everything that we run

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:53.320
 and all these different shows, that we agree with them all,

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:56.360
 this is just information, and take it for what it's worth.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.200
 If it's something that's fun, well, you know,

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.920
 listen to it and maybe explore the people.

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:05.080
 So I love you, thank you, and we will see you

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.840
 on the morrow at 10 o'clock.

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.420
