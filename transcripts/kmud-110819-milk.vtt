00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 Well, good evening and welcome to this...

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 And my name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 For those of you who perhaps never listened to our show,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 they run every month, the third Friday of each month.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.360
 My wife and I, Sarah and I, are both licensed medical herbalists.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.360
 We graduated in England with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 And we run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.360
 about a wide range of different conditions.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.360
 And we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.360
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.360
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.360
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360
 you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.360
 either related or unrelated to this month's unusual perhaps topic,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360
 all based around milk.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360
 If we get time a little bit later on,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.360
 there were certainly some questions that have been asked about the topic of cancer.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 But surprised to say that I had a listener who has been tuning in regularly

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360
 to the shows actually from Rio de Janeiro.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.360
 So she's doing this on the web.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.360
 And she had plenty of different questions about milk and milk consumption.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.360
 And there was arguments for and against milk.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.360
 And a particular seminar that was given by Pedro Bastos,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.360
 who was part of the Paleo Eat the Paleo Diet and kind of,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.360
 I don't want to say anti-milk perhaps,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.360
 but we'll come up with that a little bit later.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.360
 Anyway, suffice to say that Dr. Peat has been kind enough to join us again

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.360
 on the radio show this evening from 7.30 until 8 p.m.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.360
 We take callers and are very happy to hear from you.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.360
 And those people who have questions related or unrelated to the show

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.360
 can use that time wisely to ask Dr. Peat his advice about many different things,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.360
 perhaps if it's not just around milk.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.360
 Anyway, without further ado, Dr. Peat, are you with us?

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360
 Yes, hello.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.360
 Hi, thank you for joining the show.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 Again, as usual, perhaps there are people that haven't listened to the show before.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.360
 So would you just introduce yourself and give a rundown of your professional academic background?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.360
 I studied physiology in the biology department at the University of Oregon.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:26.360
 And I've been interested in endocrine biology and many other themes in biology since I was a little kid.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 But I didn't study it academically until 1968 to '72

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:44.360
 because I had a bad opinion of American biology from my experience with high school biology, for example.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.360
 So I've been reading lots of other national traditions and such in biology.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 So I take a critical approach to most of the things that I read.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.360
 Good job, too.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360
 Okay, well, I think probably some of tonight's--

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.360
 the reason for tonight's show was perhaps some erroneous science that was thrown as a kind of curveball.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.360
 Suggesting perhaps that there were inherent problems with using milk.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.360
 And/or I know that the people perhaps who are lacto-vegans or vegans

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.360
 would certainly perhaps benefit to hear your opinions surrounding milk.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.360
 And I've got lots of different questions so far as points that were brought up in a seminar given by Pedro Bastos,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:51.360
 who was presenting a talk on milk and had various different "science" surrounding,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 for and against, some of which we'll get into.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.360
 So in terms of-- I know that you're very big on milk.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 You're an advocate of drinking milk.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.360
 I've never consumed so much milk, I don't think, in my life, apart from when I was young.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.360
 I very much enjoyed drinking milk, but kind of grew out of it, as I think perhaps most people do.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 But inherently there's such a lot of positive benefit from drinking milk

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:28.360
 that the anti-dairy or the pro-soy groups would probably be just as well to listen and tune in to this month's show,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 because there's plenty of evidence to show that milk is actually very beneficial for you

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:41.360
 and it's perhaps in our best interest to make sure that we can get back into drinking milk again, if we don't,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.360
 if for whatever reason or another we stop drinking it.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.360
 So about some of the arguments against milk, I know that in Pedro Bastos' article,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:07:02.360
 he mentioned that insulin growth factor was stimulated fairly strongly by milk.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:10.360
 What do you have to say about IGF and/or its stimulation from milk?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.360
 How true is that?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.360
 Well, it has some of the features of insulin,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:25.360
 but it and insulin are just two of our regulatory factors

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:35.360
 and when one of them is slightly distorted, we have so many other regulatory systems

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.360
 that nothing really changes much when one is a little off-center.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:53.360
 Okay, so you're saying that there's no real significant effect from the stimulation of IGF by milk

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.360
 as opposed to the stimulation of IGF by other things that we would normally cope with?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.360
 Well, when you look at the functions in a given species,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:09.360
 animals that are very big for their species have a high level of IGF.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.360
 Okay, like elephants and...

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.360
 Well, no, big mice.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.360
 Okay, big mice.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.360
 And elephants have a very low level.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360
 Okay.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.360
 So within a species, it has one kind of effect,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:32.360
 but across the spectrum of possible animal species, it has a very different meaning.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.360
 Okay.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.360
 So it's just part of a system,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:43.360
 and our whole system has long-range adaptive processes,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:53.360
 and nutrition has hardly scratched the surface of how nutrition works in developmental biology.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:09:03.360
 Most nutrition research is done for the agricultural food industry.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.360
 They want to know how to make big animals, not intelligent, long-lived animals.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:18.360
 Right, like the cows and increasing the yield from a cow both in milk and meat.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:28.360
 Yeah, and some nutritional studies have found that your grandmother's nutritional level

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.360
 affects the development of your brain and so on,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.360
 and in animal studies, you can see it going on for four to five generations,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:45.360
 the way diet and the development of one individual goes.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:55.360
 You can see the influence generation after generation affecting the development of the whole animal.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.360
 But focusing on the size of the brain, for example,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.360
 you can't determine anything really just in one generation.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.360
 Is this genetically passed on then without actually being...

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:14.360
 Well, currently they're thinking that it's methylation of the genes,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:23.360
 but that's just the current variation on how genetic influences work.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:32.360
 When I was in graduate school, I knew Carl Lindegren, who wrote the book Cold War in Biology,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:41.360
 and he published a survey of experiments showing such things as transgenerational influence

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:50.360
 or the influence of a plant's nutrition on the heredity and development of its offspring.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:11:01.360
 Things that in the United States, Barbara McClintock was showing that stress affects the genetics of a corn plant,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:16.360
 but Carl Lindegren was reviewing older, much more radical stuff that shows that you can change the nature of a tomato plant's offspring

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.360
 by what you do to the tomato plant.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.360
 Since genetic engineering became a profitable business,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.360
 Barbara McClintock was brought out of obscurity, given a Nobel Prize, a MacArthur grant,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:41.360
 so that the Monsanto people would have someone saying, "See, this happens in nature."

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.360
 So when Pedro Basto says, "Oh, milk is bad because it stimulates IGF,"

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.360
 There's not really enough science to know.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:58.360
 It might turn out four or five generations from now that it is either good or bad.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:07.360
 For example, people who drink milk might have great-grandchildren who are much smarter than they are.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:16.360
 Well, so basically, this is a postulation or a theory that he's proposing and not really backed up by scientific evidence,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.360
 especially when you look at cultures who do drink a lot of milk and they have less cancer,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.360
 because that's the whole thing with IGF is that it could -- well, Pedro Bastos is saying it's a stimulator of cancer.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.360
 But it's also a stimulator of healthy tissue growth.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.360
 Okay, so it's out of context. He's taking it out of context.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.360
 For example, a study of the radiation effects in Japan,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:46.360
 they looked at all factors of life situation and diet and so on,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:53.360
 and they saw that people who didn't drink milk had a much higher risk of becoming demented in old age.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:01.360
 And a later study in the U.S. saw the same thing, that milk has anti-dementia properties.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.360
 So is there any anti-inflammatory component to it, or is it another mechanism which --

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:13.360
 They don't really know. That's just an association of big populations.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:20.360
 But it could involve something like the IGF, but there are so many factors in milk.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:28.360
 Just the high ratio of calcium bifosterase is one of the extremely beneficial qualities of milk.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.360
 Yeah, well, I know you're very big on calcium and for many different reasons.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.360
 Perhaps that would be a good point for people to hear in terms of the calcium content of milk

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:46.360
 and how easily bioavailable it is compared to how you would get the sufficient calcium level from other foods.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.360
 That's probably quite an interesting --

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:58.360
 Well, the next best food which people don't think about as food usually, but it's eggshell.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:08.360
 I had a relative who cured his early youthful osteoporosis by having a tablespoon of powdered eggshell every day.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.360
 Which would be about, what, 5,000 milligrams of calcium a day?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.360
 Something like that.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:20.360
 And that's in the neighborhood of what the Maasai people get during their lifetime, 5,000 to 7,000.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.360
 As an average?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.360
 So one quart of milk has about 1,200 milligrams of calcium, right?

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.360
 And then a whole eggshell is maybe 2,000 milligrams.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.360
 And that is calcium carbonate.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:45.360
 But the absorption of the calcium in milk is greatly improved by the presence of lactose in the milk.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:15:00.360
 And if you compare the different sugars, fructose is not as good as lactose, but it still is an important factor in helping to absorb calcium.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:05.360
 Glucose or starch -- starch breaks down into nothing but glucose.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:12.360
 Starch has a very poor effect on calcium absorption.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:22.360
 And when bone development was compared in rats that were made deficient in vitamin D,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.360
 one group was given starch as its carbohydrate, the other was given sucrose.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:34.360
 And despite being deficient in vitamin D, the sucrose-fed rats had strong bones.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.360
 So sugar doesn't weaken your bones like we're told.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:47.360
 No, it actually works parallel to thyroid and vitamin D for stimulating the metabolism,

00:15:47.360 --> 00:16:02.360
 which calcium, T3 component of the thyroid hormone, and fructose all have some overlapping effects activating respiratory metabolism.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:10.360
 So people who drink lactose-free milk will not be absorbing as much calcium as people who drink normal milk.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.360
 Right. And what about people that would say, "Oh, I'm lactose intolerant"?

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.360
 How would you answer that?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:25.360
 Studies of, for example, in Chinatown in San Francisco, people who hadn't grown up drinking milk

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:32.360
 were compared to people who had the same family, same genes.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.360
 But it's just a matter of what you grow up exposed to.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:47.360
 And when you take someone who has grown up without it and have them drink maybe a glass and a half total milk in a day,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:55.360
 about half a glass at a time, in just two or three weeks, they are inducing the enzymes in their intestine.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:03.360
 And when you look at various factors responsible for losing the enzymes,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:09.360
 a deficiency of progesterone and thyroid or a bacterial infection...

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.360
 Of the small intestine?

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.360
 Yeah, will cause the loss of those enzymes.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.360
 Okay, so the bacterial infection, that can directly cause a lack of enzyme production then?

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:28.360
 Yeah, and that usually develops in the upper part of the small intestine in people who are thyroid deficient.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.360
 And then those people, when they drink milk, would have terrible gas

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.360
 because the bacteria would be digesting the lactose instead of the lactase that should be normally produced from the small intestine.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.360
 Yeah.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.360
 But even those people can regain the enzyme then?

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360
 Yeah.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:50.360
 Okay, because I do come across, as Sarah, you come across people who just point blank refuse to drink milk.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:54.360
 They say, "I can't drink it, it gives me cramps, digestion, bloating, etc."

00:17:54.360 --> 00:18:03.360
 But those people can retrain themselves, they can actually start to express that enzyme.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:11.360
 I found that once they get their overall nutrition in a better state, it becomes easier and easier for them to digest the milk.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.360
 Whereas if, like Dr. Peat said, they're quite low thyroid to begin with,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:22.360
 and they have a lot of gaseous issues and intestinal dysbiosis or bacterial overgrowth,

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:27.360
 then it's harder for them if they aren't willing to change other aspects of their diet.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:33.360
 And starch tends to support the bacterial overgrowth more than fruit sugar.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:45.360
 Now, if someone, given that you said progesterone is very helpful and thyroid in being able to digest milk and/or produce the enzymes,

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.360
 why would somebody, as a question, why would somebody want to drink milk?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.360
 Why would somebody want to be able, if they want to use the argument that I can't digest it, it doesn't do me any good,

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.360
 how can we convince people that milk really is a beneficial?

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.360
 Well, can we go back to calcium, Dr. Peat?

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:12.360
 Can you tell us all the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects that the calcium alone has that's present in very absorbable quantities in milk

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.360
 and the different health benefits?

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.360
 Because when we think of calcium, we think of, oh, it's just good for your bones,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.360
 I don't need to worry about that until I turn 70 or whatever, you know.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:35.360
 Yeah, Adele Davis talked about that in the 1950s, that people think of calcifying kidneys and arteries and such and are afraid of the calcium in milk,

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:43.360
 but she already pointed out the research showing that the people who drink the least milk or have the least calcium in their diet

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.360
 have the most kidney stones and the most calcified arteries.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.360
 And that's because of the anti-inflammatory effect of calcium.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.360
 It suppresses the tendency of your kidneys and arteries and other soft tissues.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:04.360
 And is that extra calcium that's getting deposited in the arteries and causing calcification of the arteries and kidney damage,

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.360
 that's coming from people's bones, right, in response to a deficiency in the diet?

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:21.360
 Yeah, the calcium in your diet, having the anti-inflammatory and prothyrate effect is tending to direct the deposition of calcium,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:32.360
 as calcium carbonate, into your bones and keeping the production of carbon dioxide up by stimulating cell metabolism.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:45.360
 The same carbon dioxide that deposits into the bones prevents calcium from depositing in arteries and kidneys by keeping it in a soluble state.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.360
 So if you take enough in your diet, then it moves in the right direction and goes from the milk to the bone.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.360
 If you don't, then it goes from the bone to your arteries.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360
 Yeah.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.360
 The wrong way.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.360
 Unfortunately, I think a lot of people have an incorrect association with it.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:07.360
 I know one person in particular who we were working with a couple of months back had, I think, extremely bad osteoporosis

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:15.360
 and was so anti-milk because they thought, "Oh, I can't cope with any more calcium. I can't cope with the calcium."

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:23.360
 One of the factors in osteoporosis is, if not high cortisol, then high prolactin.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:36.360
 Both of those are caused by high serotonin. All of those, serotonin, prolactin, and cortisol, are anti-bone formation.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.360
 Calcium suppresses all of those.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:53.360
 Calcium in your diet suppresses prolactin, cortisol, and serotonin, allowing the other bone-building factors to be dominant.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:01.360
 So let's talk about the sugar in milk and how that helps your liver function better, and then your liver can manufacture more carbon dioxide.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.360
 The engineer just had a question about ways to increase carbon dioxide.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:16.360
 Any sugar, if you eat sucrose, it's similar to lactose, not quite as effective for absorbing calcium as the lactose is.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:26.360
 But the sucrose in fruit or honey or just plain sugar is 50% fructose, 50% glucose.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:39.360
 It just takes a little fructose to catalyze the more energetic burning of glucose, producing carbon dioxide.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:56.360
 So you don't have to eat a pure sugar carbohydrate diet to have optimal carbon dioxide production, but it's okay to avoid starch entirely.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:14.360
 Okay, yeah, so in terms of keeping your CO2 up, not engaging too much in aerobic exercises is certainly part of someone's goal, I think, to maintain high CO2.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:20.360
 I know you've mentioned bag breathing before now to re-inspire expired air as a way of increasing your CO2.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:30.360
 And I know we've touched on other things like high altitude, high altitude being very beneficial because that is also going to increase a person's CO2.

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.360
 Something as simple as baking soda stimulates bone formation.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.360
 And what's the mechanism for that?

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.360
 The carbon dioxide.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.360
 Okay, so just the carbon dioxide.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:56.360
 And that's why for broken bone treatment, CO2 treatment as an infusing gas that you basically put your broken limb into a bag that's filled with carbon dioxide.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:14.360
 Yeah, the body has such an affinity for carbon dioxide that even though there's a very high concentration inside your body compared to the atmosphere, if you put your arm or leg into a bag of carbon dioxide, it'll flow into your body.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.360
 Same with carbonated hot springs.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:28.360
 You absorb carbon dioxide out of the water, up the gradient into your body because your body basically has an affinity for it.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:51.360
 And when you move into a high altitude or happen to live in a submarine for two or three months, your bones, even after months of the body having a higher CO2 concentration, the bones are still incorporating some of the CO2 out of your blood.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:25:02.360
 That's why I feel so good when I go to the local hot springs, carbonated hot springs, Vichy and Ukiah, Vichy hot springs, because it's carbonated water that's high in CO2.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:18.360
 Okay, that brings up another point, I think, just to keep reiterating it, because I know that your own research has showed this to be a self-evident as well as a scientifically evident truth is that people really need to start looking at oxygen.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:29.360
 Unfortunately, looking at oxygen as a poison, a metabolic poison, if you like, and looking at CO2 actually in a better light than we normally associate CO2 with.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:42.360
 I would always have thought CO2, if you breathe it out, it's bad, you don't live on CO2, but actually it's very beneficial for us as organisms to have a higher concentration of CO2 than we do.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:26:01.360
 People living at a very high altitude, once they've adapted, if they go up gradually, the blood coming out of their lungs is more completely oxygenated because of the various things.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:14.360
 The effect of carbon dioxide seems to improve the diffusion of gas from the air into your blood capillaries in the lungs.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.360
 So it helps them absorb more oxygen is what you're saying?

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360
 Yes.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.360
 And then the cell will work more efficiently?

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.360
 Yes.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.360
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:31.360
 From 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.360
 Dr. Ray Peat is joining us again on the show.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:44.360
 This month's topic is pretty much surrounded milk and the benefits of milk, trying to refute some of the arguments of the paleo evolutionists.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.360
 I probably think that's a better, another question, Dr. Peat.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:59.360
 People, I know, have said in the past, "Well, as a human race," depending on what your viewpoint is, "as a human race, we've been around for millions of years and only very recently have we started drinking milk."

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.360
 What would you say about that?

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:15.360
 Well, the first thing is that a lot of people have their imaginary history of the human race.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:41.360
 Conrad Lorenz and a couple of his followers, Audrey and Morris, described the evolution of the killer ape as where we came from, that a carnivorous ape made the transition into humankind.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.360
 So meat was the basis of human evolution.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:28:01.360
 Other people are currently saying that Africans who lived along lakes or sea coasts ate fish and the brain is made of fish oil.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.360
 So they needed to eat fish to evolve a big brain.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:15.360
 But all of that is really reading backwards into history from whatever people believe in the present.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:34.360
 Okay, because I, talking about the, gosh, I don't know, the early civilization when perhaps we would have been moving out of the caves and becoming domesticators of animals and growing crops.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.360
 Grains also would have been a fairly recent food.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:52.360
 Yeah, that's pretty well documented that for the last 10 or 20,000 years civilizations have been knowing how to domesticate grains of different kinds.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:29:10.360
 And that is, I think, the good basis for starting to think about the paleo diet, that definitely grain eating hasn't done anything great for the human brain or general health.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:23.360
 So as far as the caveman diet takes people away from a grain-based diet, I think it's starting off in the right direction.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:32.360
 But there's just not enough science yet to know what the long-range effects of a given diet are going to be for sure.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:46.360
 And one of the things we can see in a fairly short range is that one of the bad features of the grains and nuts diet is a high phosphate content.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.360
 High phosphate and calcium ratio.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.360
 And even a high meat diet has a high phosphate.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:55.360
 Yeah, and a high meat diet has that same drawback unless you eat eggshells when you eat the eggs.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:02.360
 And maybe chew on the bones.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.360
 Some people eat chicken bones.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.360
 So that brings up grass-fed milk versus grain-fed milk.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:20.360
 Then the milk from cows that are being fed alfalfa and grain would be less desirable than grass-fed milk, correct?

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:30.360
 Yeah, the fresh grass has a high ratio of vitamin E to fatty acids.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:40.360
 And the grains, especially if they've been stored for a while, the vitamin E is fairly quickly depleted.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:59.360
 And cows need vitamin E in proportion to the fatty acids because the bacteria which destroys the polyunsaturated fats in any plant material like grain or leaves,

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:17.360
 the bacteria hydrogenate those polyunsaturated fats in the cow's rumen so that 98% of the polyunsaturated fat is destroyed by the cow's bacteria if they have enough vitamin E.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.360
 Right.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:24.360
 And you're saying that fresh grass has more vitamin E than the grain and the alfalfa.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.360
 Yeah.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.360
 How about...

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.360
 That's why milk tastes good from damp, wet, rainy countries.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.360
 Lots of lush grass.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.360
 I know. In South Africa, when I spent a year there, the milk tasted terrible.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.360
 I don't know if I ever saw any green grass the whole time I was there.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.360
 Same in Israel. I remember the milk in Israel was pretty bad.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:47.360
 Okay. So how about people...

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:53.360
 I know we're very strong advocates of eating organically wherever the organic alternative is available.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.360
 I know the same would be true for milk, correct?

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.360
 Yeah.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:15.360
 Mentioning Israel, they, up until they did this study, I think it was in the 1960s, they had the highest or one of the world's highest rates of breast cancer.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:23.360
 And they noticed that their dairies were using, I think it was lindane.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.360
 Oh, my goodness.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.360
 They love their pesticides.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:32.360
 As soon as they banned the use of that around their cows, as it had been banned previously in the U.S.,

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:37.360
 their breast cancer rate came down to about the European and U.S. level.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:39.360
 Wow.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.360
 Yeah. Unfortunately, they do enjoy their petrochemicals.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.360
 That's the way in agriculture is.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:52.360
 Agriculture 20, 25 years ago was pretty reliant on lots of different sprays for their crops.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.360
 And I think it was just fairly normal for them to do that.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.360
 Okay. It's 7.30 now.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:06.360
 If any listeners listening have any questions for Dr. Peat about the subject of milk, the number here is 9233911.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:14.360
 Well, there's an 800 number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD, which is 800-568-3723.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:27.360
 So, talking about hormones and/or estrogenic type effects, what's the truth in the presence of estrogens in milk?

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.360
 And that would be some people's argument for not wanting to consume it.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:39.360
 And that's the main preface with estrogen being a known carcinogen or cancer promoter.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:49.360
 The amount in milk is maybe something up to as much as one microgram per quart.

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:58.360
 But men, estrogen really is as much a male hormone as female.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:08.360
 And the natural estrogen is processed in both men and women and detoxified fairly quickly.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:16.360
 And about, I think it's 85% of the estrogen in milk, even though it's a very small amount to start with.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.360
 A birth control pill, for example, has 30 micrograms.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:26.360
 And so no one drinks 30 liters of milk in a day.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:40.360
 But the bulk of the estrogen in the milk is attached to either sulfate or glucuronic acid, which prepares it to be excreted in the kidneys.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.360
 Okay. We do actually have a caller on the air, so let's take this caller.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:51.360
 Actually, they just dropped, although now a different line is ringing here, but it's an office line.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.360
 I'm not sure. Call back caller.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:56.360
 And somebody also asked, what about homogenization?

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.360
 That's another good question.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:58.360
 I was waiting for that question.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:04.360
 So homogenization versus pasteurization versus -- I mean, how about raw milk?

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.360
 Let's start with homogenization and then go on to raw milk.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:19.360
 The process breaks the particle of fat up into such a small size that it doesn't separate by itself.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:27.360
 And that presumably is going to make any of the unstable fats in it oxidize faster.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:36.360
 So it has a small harmful effect, but considering the alternatives,

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:50.360
 if you go into a grocery store that has only homogenized, pasteurized milk and what are the other foods that you'll find in the supermarket as alternatives,

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:57.360
 they're all going to be much more dangerous as oxidants or pro-oxidants.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:04.360
 So the theory -- or I've heard this theory that, oh, it breaks the fat molecule up so tiny that then it goes in and blocks your arteries.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.360
 So that's complete rubbish then?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.360
 Yeah.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:18.360
 If the fat particle gets in your artery directly, when we secrete bile,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:31.360
 the soapy material in the bile breaks up all of the fats that we eat anyway into particles of about that same size,

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.360
 which do get directly into the bloodstream.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.360
 So we have our own natural homogenization process with our bile that our liver makes to help us digest the fats.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.360
 Yeah, that's what the chylomicron system is. It's homogenizing.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.360
 Okay, that's a brilliant answer. I like that one.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:57.360
 So then raw milk, you would consider raw milk increased in nutritional value over the pasteurized and the ultra-pasteurized and all the other treatments?

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:09.360
 Yeah, definitely it's nutritionally better, but that doesn't mean that you should eat soybeans or bread or something if you can't get milk, can't get raw milk.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.360
 Right, because you're weighing up the pros and the cons.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:19.360
 And also, too, of course, it depends what the cows are eating, like we talked before about grain-fed versus grass-fed milk.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.360
 Yeah, that's a big difference.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:36.360
 If you are getting milk from a dairy that has only one or two or three cows, what the cow ate the preceding day is going to have a big effect on the taste of the milk,

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:53.360
 the allergenicity, how well it keeps and so on. But if you have a thousand cows, milk being pooled together, it becomes a standardized product that is pretty invariable.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:38:02.360
 And sometimes people find that -- I've had a client who said that they didn't like to drink -- they didn't digest Holstein milk as well as they did Jersey milk.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.360
 And when they drank the Jersey milk, they have absolutely no problems and they can drink as much as they like.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:17.360
 So, I mean, that depends, too. And from dairy to dairy, every dairy is feeding their cows maybe slightly different food, or maybe cows are eating slightly different grass or other weeds.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.360
 There's lots of different things that can affect the milk.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.360
 Yeah, everything in the cow's environment affects the nature of the milk.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:33.360
 The hormone content varies according to the cow's stress level.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:47.360
 They talk about that very tiny amount of estrogen as a concern, but most milk has at least 20 times as much progesterone as estrogen.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:59.360
 And so if you did get some active estrogen in your milk, the amount of progesterone is more than enough to counteract its effect.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.360
 Excellent. Okay, there is a caller on the line, so let's just take this next caller.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.360
 Hello, you're on the air.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:17.360
 Hi, I would like to address the question of the nutritional value of goat milk and fresh goat cheese.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:30.360
 I understand that I feel like it's less mucus forming, and I'd like to ask your speaker to address this question.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:35.360
 Just talk to us about goat products. I'll take my answer off air. Thank you.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:43.360
 The composition is definitely different, but again it depends a lot on what the goat was eating.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:53.360
 When I was a little kid, one of our neighbors came back from the war with malaria, and they had goats.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:40:03.360
 As soon as he was able to drink his daily goat milk, he didn't have any malaria attacks.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:14.360
 But periodically he had to go to the veterans hospital for a checkup, and once when he was there, he had a malaria attack.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:20.360
 And they wouldn't let him get his goat milk, and he died from the attack.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.360
 Wow.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:31.360
 So I've heard that the goat milk protein is a smaller, more easily digestible, like the sheep's milk protein, compared to the cow's milk protein.

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:38.360
 Do you find that in your experience, Dr. Peat, that you've known other people who have had an easier time digesting goat milk versus cow's milk?

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.360
 Yeah, I've heard that quite a bit.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.360
 And do you think the size of the protein strand is what it's down to?

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:56.360
 I doubt it. I think there are so many chemical differences that I wouldn't guess what was most important.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:02.360
 I know that sheep's milk, when you look at the nutritional profile, it's very different to cow or goat's milk.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.360
 It's certainly got more fat.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.360
 It has a lot more fat and a lot more protein.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:13.360
 But when you compare, just if you're just looking at the protein and the fat and the goat's milk, it's pretty similar.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:19.360
 But I guess, again, that depends on what they're eating and which cow's milk and goat's milk they tested.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:28.360
 Okay, so going back to milk's calcium content and how physiologically important calcium is to us as organisms,

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.360
 and you've mentioned eggshells as being another excellent source of calcium,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:39.360
 is there anything else, if people refuse to drink milk and they refuse to take powdered eggshell caps to get their calcium,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:46.360
 is there what else do they have to do and how much in order to satisfy the nutritional needs for calcium and its anti-inflammatory effects?

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:59.360
 If you eat most of your carbohydrate as fruit and avoid the grains so you aren't getting excess phosphate,

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:08.360
 then probably an eggshell a day will give you all the calcium you need.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:15.360
 But where else could you get that amount of calcium if you were refused to use calcium as an eggshell supplement?

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:27.360
 Well, I suppose just a leaf-based diet would eventually get enough calcium.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.360
 No, just dark green leafy veg.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.360
 But you probably have to eat a fair amount of it to get the same.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:40.360
 Yeah, and if it's well-cooked, you get more of the nutrients.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:48.360
 There was an experiment where they gave rats a vegetable diet of fresh vegetables,

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:53.360
 and another group had exactly the same vegetables that had been canned,

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:59.360
 and the ones getting the canned vegetables lived perfectly well,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.360
 and the others wasted away, couldn't assimilate the nutrients.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:10.360
 I think we have another caller on the air, so let's see if we can take that caller now.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:19.360
 Thank you very much. The question was regarding evaporated milk and the sickening agents commonly put in there,

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.360
 like Teragine and maybe Vancine gum or something like that.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:30.360
 That's what I wanted Dr. Peat to comment on, and I'm thinking I'll take my answer off the air.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.360
 Okay, thank you for your call. Dr. Peat?

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:42.360
 The gums, in particular Teragine, I've got an article on my website about Teragine.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:56.360
 A few years ago, probably three years ago, one of the organic cream producers that most of the grocery stores stock,

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:06.360
 I started getting sick on their cream and saw that they were using Teragine in their thick whipping cream.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:12.360
 The same thing happened with some of the ice creams I had been eating for years.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:20.360
 They made me sick, and I looked at the label and saw they were adding gums.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:35.360
 Many of the cheeses are adding those as carriers for the flavoring agents, culture microorganisms and such,

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.360
 to make it easier to produce the cheese.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:50.360
 The dairy often doesn't realize that the culture organisms may be suspended in alginate or Teragine.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:45:01.360
 One researcher has demonstrated in many animal experiments that Teragine is carcinogenic,

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:14.360
 and the FDA and various agencies allow it to be used in food because they say it's only the degraded Teragine which is carcinogenic.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:24.360
 When bacteria in your intestine act on it, they degrade it, but when it goes in your mouth, it's working for the FDA, not carcinogenic.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.360
 What about evaporated milk? Does that just become more oxidized and broken down?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:35.360
 Sure, and contact with a can is another possible source of contamination.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.360
 The reason it tastes so bad is that it's heavily oxidized.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:45.360
 Okay, all right, we do have another caller, so let's take this next caller. You're on the air?

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:52.360
 Yes, my question was about sprouted grain breads and sourdough breads.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:58.360
 Whoops, we lost you there.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.360
 Are you on the air still? Engineer, is he still there?

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:09.360
 I think so. Are you still there, caller? Well, the line's still open.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:15.360
 Well, Dr. Peat, what about sprouted grains and sourdough? Does the pre-fermentation help?

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:27.360
 Well, yeah, just the soaking process, activating the enzymes in the dough, even if it's ground and can't sprout,

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:38.360
 eight to 12 hours of being moistened allows the enzymes to activate the same process that would happen in sprouting.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:45.360
 So the phytic acid, for example, is broken down into inositol and phosphate,

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:55.360
 and gluten is partly broken down so that if you soak the bread too long, you don't get a light, spongy loaf.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.360
 You get sort of a crumbly-- Cornbread loaf.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.360
 And our caller, our question and answer is back. Did you hear the answer to that, caller?

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:09.360
 I did not. I'm sorry, but my question was--

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:14.360
 Oh, gosh, we lost him again. I think it's his cell phone. He said he had lost it.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:20.360
 I'm sorry. Try one more time, caller, and the lines are open otherwise.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:27.360
 So if the caller is listening, Dr. Peat said yes, sprouting and/or soaking,

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:34.360
 specifically soaking the grain for eight to 12 hours in like a sourdough starter,

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.360
 or soaking the grain with the flour with the sourdough starter,

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:44.360
 will help to break down a lot of indigestible, toxic plant compounds.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:48.360
 Okay, well, we're probably going to get him calling back, and maybe if he was on the cell phone, he's not in such good reception.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:48:00.360
 And the protein quantity actually increases because the gluten carries so many nitrogen-rich amino acids,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.360
 which happen to make it more allergenic.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.360
 But when the enzymes release the nitrogen from the gluten,

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:13.360
 those nitrogens can be used to make new, completely different proteins,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.360
 so you get two to three times more protein substance.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.360
 So people who are trying to avoid the heavy protein, anti-inflammatory diet,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:30.360
 and they're actually getting a lot of grains in their diet, they're getting a lot of phosphorus, like you said.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:35.360
 The same thing as if people eat just a lot of meat and not very many grains, they're getting a lot of phosphorus.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:42.360
 So both of those diet spectrums are out of balance as far as calcium and healthy metabolism is concerned.

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:49.360
 Yeah, and the body can, at least in the short range, it can handle quite an imbalance.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:57.360
 Lots of Americans have been growing up on a seven to one phosphate to calcium ratio,

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:05.360
 where milk is 1.3 to 1 in the other direction.

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:14.360
 Probably the long range optimum is something like that in milk, somewhere between a ratio of one to one,

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:20.360
 up to maybe even two to one in favor of calcium to phosphorus.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.360
 Okay, good. We have another caller on the line, so let's take this next caller.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.360
 You're on the air?

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.360
 Yes, this is someone else.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:34.360
 And since you've brought up raw milk and the FDA, I want to put this out.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:46.360
 Recently a company called Rossum Foods in Southern California was busted by the FBI and the FDA,

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.360
 and I call them the "fooder allies."

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:58.360
 And the concern that I have is that basically, as opposed to bioavailability,

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:04.360
 the retail availability of getting some of these products that we would like to get,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.360
 as you indicated raw milk does have more nutrient value to it.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:16.360
 I'm curious as to what we might be able to do to preserve some of our access to these

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.360
 without governmental interference.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:24.360
 In fact, I am aware that there is a website dealing with these issues called Farm Food Freedom,

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:29.360
 and that's F-A-R-M as opposed to the pharmacy version that's sometimes shortened.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.360
 So it's F-A-R-M, Food Freedom.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.360
 And lately I've been leaving the P off of pharmacy, by the way.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:42.360
 P as in profit and pharmacy as in, well, what they seem to do best.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:43.360
 All right, well thank you.

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.360
 So any response to that I'd appreciate, and it kind of speaks for itself,

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.360
 but if you want to address that, I would appreciate it.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.360
 Thanks for all that you do in making these things known, better understood, and available to us.

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:56.360
 All right, thank you for your call.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:06.360
 Dr. Peat, so far as the availability of raw milk is concerned, what perhaps would you like to see?

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:12.360
 Oh, well, everyone should have a cow next door.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.360
 There you go.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.360
 Okay, but for people in the city?

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.360
 Then a goat if you're in the city.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.360
 A goat on the rooftop.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:28.360
 My father built a barn when we lived in southern Oregon that looked like a little cottage.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:34.360
 The cow lived, ate, got milked in this little house,

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:43.360
 and it made the neighborhood look more like a residential.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.360
 Not a farm.

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:50.360
 You were mentioning to us earlier about the pro-pasteurization people

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:58.360
 and what they support is actually coming from the National Institutes of Health and the SAIC.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.360
 I can't remember what that acronym stands for.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:10.360
 Oh, well, yeah, one of the articles warning about the dangerous estrogen metabolites in milk

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:18.360
 was done by this partnership of National Institutes for Health

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:26.360
 with the Science Applications International Corporation, I think it's called.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:34.360
 They are also effectively a branch of the Homeland Security Agency

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:44.360
 and military defense project, Internet technology, surveillance technology, and so on.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.360
 They just featured in a book I'm reading right now by Peter Dale Scott

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.360
 about the politics of heroin smuggling in Southeast Asia, and they're very involved.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.360
 The SAIC?

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:56.360
 SAIC, Security something International Consultants.

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:02.360
 There's one more caller, and I unfortunately missed how that came up.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.360
 So basically, Dr. Peat, let me just finish up this subject here.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.360
 You're saying that these organizations are pro-pasteurization

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:17.360
 because they don't want to see people have their own cow in their backyard?

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:26.360
 I think the motivation is very complex, but I think it's the new wave of what in the 1930s

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:31.360
 it was a big campaign nationally against breastfeeding babies.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:39.360
 And advocating early feeding of beans and bread and so on.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:45.360
 And that is coming back in the ghettos first.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:55.360
 They're telling women, if they're Mexican of origin, to wean their babies very early on beans.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:02.360
 I think it's motivated by kind of a class war to make it cheaper.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:11.360
 If they're going to keep having food stamps, they don't want people buying fancy food like milk and meat and eggs.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360
 Oh my goodness.

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:18.360
 Okay, we do have another caller who's been waiting a while here, and it's 7:54, so we'll take this last caller.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.360
 Hello, caller, you're on the air.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:27.360
 Hi, yes, I just had one brief question.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:33.360
 Would this phosphorus and calcium effect on our physiology be more wholesome

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:37.360
 if the milk were taken in the form of yogurt?

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.360
 I'll take my answer off air.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:48.360
 We're here about the types of yogurt, and Sarah mentioned -- what did you call it?

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:56.360
 I've been looking into this yogurt thing because yogurt is essentially the same as milk in the quantities of protein,

00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:00.360
 but it has a much, much higher lactic acid content, which is hard in your liver.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.360
 And so there's this yogurt called Faye yogurt.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.360
 F-A-G-E.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.360
 F-A-G-E, Fage or whatever.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.360
 Faye is Greek.

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.360
 It says on there, Greek strained yogurt.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.360
 And when you make cheese, you strain the whey out and out goes the lactic acid.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:20.360
 And when you make yogurt, you retain the lactic acid-rich whey normally.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.360
 Normal American yogurt retains the lactic acid-rich whey.

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.360
 So this Faye yogurt has 23 grams of protein per cup,

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:34.360
 which means they have to strain out the whey in order to concentrate the casein

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:39.360
 and the cheese-like protein in the yogurt because they don't have any thickeners in it.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:46.360
 And so that's a yogurt that's not tart because most of the whey, the lactic acid-rich whey,

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.360
 has been strained out, which makes it tart.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.360
 And actually it's not good to have a tart yogurt and to replace milk with the yogurt

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.360
 because of the harmful effect on the liver.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:08.360
 The lactic acid, besides burdening your liver, causing a tendency to hypoglycemia from not storing enough glycogen,

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:18.360
 the lactic acid also produces fibrosis, inflammation, and even contributes to the cancer metabolism.

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.360
 Okay. There's one last caller.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.360
 See if we can squeeze him in ever so quickly without going over time.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.360
 Okay. Hello?

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.360
 Yeah, you had mentioned serotonin, and you usually say it like this, that serotonin is bad.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.360
 And I've always heard that serotonin was good because it's like a feel-good hormone,

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.360
 and it makes you not depressed.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.360
 What is wrong with serotonin?

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:50.360
 Well, if you look at studies of aggression in dogs, they treat them with these SSRI drugs,

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:58.360
 and they find that after a few weeks when their aggression has subsided, their serotonin has gone down.

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:05.360
 So the drugs that are sold supposedly to raise serotonin, when they work,

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.360
 they might actually be lowering your serotonin.

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:21.360
 And serotonin is a hormone of withdrawal, anxiety, and suppressing metabolism, lowering your demands.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:31.360
 It's kind of an emergency anti-stress hormone that is necessary in context,

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:42.360
 but when you're chronically stressed, it's what causes stomach ulcers, contributes to fibrosis of every system,

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:47.360
 scleroderma, for example, hardening of the arteries, osteoporosis.

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:56.360
 The last couple of years, it's recognized as probably the main immediate contributor to osteoporosis,

00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:03.360
 which is associated with depression and many other conditions, which are actually high serotonin conditions.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.360
 So we would advise people not to use serotonin.

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.360
 And not to use whey protein powder because it's highly oxidized,

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:18.360
 and the amino acids in whey are mainly tryptophan, which is the precursor amino acid to make serotonin.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.360
 Okay.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.360
 But one other thing I just want to say is the serotonin is --

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.360
 we've just been brainwashed to believe that serotonin is a feel-good hormone

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:30.360
 because the drug companies wanted to sell us the SSRIs, which don't actually --

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.360
 they don't appear to be raising the serotonin.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:34.360
 They appear to be lowering it.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:40.360
 And those patents are expiring, so they'll be coming out with a new kind of antidepressant,

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.360
 and so we'll stop hearing so much about that hormone.

00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.360
 And then we'll have to research that.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:48.360
 Thank you so much for joining us again, Dr. Peat.

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.360
 I know people really enjoy what it is you have to say,

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:56.360
 and it is an education where many things that we hear we have to hear and rehear

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.360
 before we recognize that what we're hearing is actually the truth

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.360
 and start changing our habits and our lifestyles.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.360
 Well, for those people who've heard Dr. Peat this time around

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:08.360
 and who've asked him on the show time and time again asking questions

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:17.360
 and shooting him questions personally, his website is www.raypeat.com,

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.360
 plenty of articles, scholarly articles referenced,

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:25.360
 lots of information there that you'll be doing good to look at and take on board.

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:34.360
 Okay, so until the third Friday of next month, you can reach us toll-free on 1-888-WBM-ERB
