 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.780
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.780
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.380
 every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.680
 my wife and I, who's normally with us on the show,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.480
 are both licensed medical herbalists. We trained in England,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.480
 graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.380
 and we now run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.480
 of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.180
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville, 91.1 FM,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.080
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.680
 with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 of how to restore and protect nerves.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.480
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:26.980
 or if you live outside the area, there's whole free numbers 1-800-568-3723.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.080
 And we can also be reached toll free on 1-888-WBM-HERB

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.280
 for consultations or further information Monday through Friday.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.480
 So once again, we're very, very privileged to have Dr. Peat

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.480
 and his expertise joining us again this evening.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.280
 Are you there, Dr. Peat? Yes, hi.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:54.280
 Okay, excellent. So once again, for those people who perhaps have never heard of you

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.480
 or heard you speak or heard of your areas of expertise,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.380
 would you outline your academic and professional background

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.780
 before we get started on tonight's show?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.480
 Relative to nerve biology, that was my intended major

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 when I went to the University of Oregon as a graduate student in 1968

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.280
 because I had been interested in linguistics and psychology.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.280
 But as soon as I got there, two or three months,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.680
 I had decided to switch to aging and reproductive physiology

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.880
 because of the great dogmatism in the nerve biology field.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:46.680
 And so I spent the four years working on reproductive aging,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.080
 female reproductive aging in particular.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.280
 So I concentrated on the effects of estrogen, progesterone, thyroid, oxygen,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:04.680
 and antioxidants on the age-related changes in metabolism.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.780
 Okay, great.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.880
 And I know for probably the last 35 years, is it, or is it more,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.880
 you've been doing your own research

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.880
 and you have been in private consulting capacity previously.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:23.480
 I guess it must be 40 years, I think.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.180
 Sorry. 40 years, okay. Okay, good.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.880
 Well, I know I've managed to speak to quite a few people over the years

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.580
 who've either come into contact with you or have been, yeah,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.180
 been given good advice by you and have certainly making very good improvements in their health.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:47.180
 So it's always good to be justified by people who are corroborating what you have told them

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.980
 and where they were when they met you and where they subsequently were afterwards.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.180
 So it's always very heartening.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.180
 I know a lot of what you've spoken about in the past has been fairly controversial.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:04.680
 I know for me when we first got introduced to you, I think in 2007 or 8,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.280
 a lot of what you said was very controversial.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.480
 And in my education in herbal medicine, again, the same dogmatic,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.780
 what I now know is the same dogmatic and erroneous ideas in science was still perpetrated.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.480
 And a lot of what you've been uncovering in the last six years or so

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.980
 has certainly got me thinking differently.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.980
 Although it's very difficult to unlearn, I know it's a little bit like the constant suggestion

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.280
 that sugar is bad for you.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.680
 The general public seems to just have it as part of their fact that sugar is bad for you, the same with salt.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:46.280
 So I know the last couple of shows we've been talking about diabetes in particular.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:53.080
 And I know that your most recent newsletter was relating to nerve damage,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.180
 and how to protect and nourish nerves and restore them.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:04.180
 So I think I wanted to start by saying that the classical description of diabetes was,

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.980
 or is, a wasting disease where the excess glucose is lost in the urine

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.180
 as a by-product of protein metabolism, and the patient simply wastes away,

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:19.780
 deprived of the needed energy production to sustain the cellular functions resulting in death.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.880
 And obesity is now a universal disease recognized even here in the States.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.880
 And obese diabetics are commonly presenting.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:34.280
 So rather than the classic description of diabetes, medicine now erroneously classes diabetes

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.980
 as insulin resistance as well as insulin dependence, which is quite rare.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.380
 But the truth is quite different mechanistically and more importantly from a treatment perspective.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.980
 Would you explain the processes that you understand diabetes to stem from,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.080
 and outline your approach to its management?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:59.480
 My father happened to be an example of the traditional, original type of diabetes.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.580
 He wasted away to, I think it was under 100 pounds.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.380
 It was just a few years after insulin had come into medical use.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.880
 He didn't want to become dependent on it.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:21.680
 So he and my mother looked through the old naturopathic medical literature

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.380
 and found that brewer's yeast had sometimes cured people.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:32.880
 And so he went on a brewer's yeast diet for several weeks and recovered his weight

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.280
 and lived the rest of his life with no sign of diabetes.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.080
 Do you know how much brewer's yeast he was using?

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.280
 That was his only food basically for several weeks.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:49.480
 Now just to refresh my memory, I know the B vitamins are the important part of brewer's yeast,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.980
 but specifically?

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:58.780
 And there are steroids in it and potassium, a lot of potassium and phosphate,

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.480
 which is not for general health.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.080
 You can very easily get phosphate poisoning.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:15.480
 But probably it's one of the factors that could be involved in that effect,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.680
 maybe by having something to do with interfering with stress hormones.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.180
 Okay, so your father recovered from 100 pounds wasting away

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:33.580
 using brewer's yeast as a fairly sole dietary constituent.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:47.080
 Yeah, and the cause, I think there are probably many causes of the traditional wasting form of diabetes,

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:55.480
 but a virus is one of the plausible theories that can cause inflammation

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:02.380
 and killing off temporarily of the insulin producing cells.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:12.380
 But just very intense stress, there were experiments in which if part of the dog's pancreas was removed,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:18.080
 so it had just a smaller reserve of insulin producing cells,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:26.280
 then a single injection of a large dose of cortisol was enough to make the dog permanently diabetic.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:32.080
 Wow, so that extreme stress caused by cortisol itself is an inflammatory mediator.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:47.080
 Yeah, and then once the tissues are unable to get glucose just from that one episode of stress-induced lack of insulin,

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.680
 the cells are basically dying because they can't get the glucose they need,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:09.080
 so they call on fatty acids from stores and the fatty acid in turn kills the remaining or regenerating insulin producing cells,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.280
 so it starts a vicious circle.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:19.280
 Just in case people who are listening don't understand what a fatty acid is and a free fatty acid,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.480
 would you just explain basically what they are and how they're used?

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:35.680
 Yeah, a fat such as butter or lard or corn oil, most of them consist of about 18 carbon atoms in a chain

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:46.080
 with oxygens on one end making it acidic and the rest of it either just plain carbon and hydrogen

00:13:46.080 --> 00:14:00.480
 or occasionally with the hydrogens removed, that's called an unsaturated fatty acid with a carbon chain interrupted by pure hydrogens.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:10.180
 And those chains are attached to a glycerin molecule, three carbons,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:20.680
 technically an alcohol that forms an ester with these free fatty acids blocking the acid group

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.280
 which makes the free fatty acid water soluble to some extent.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:33.080
 And when the glycerin which is also very water soluble is combined with three fatty acids,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:41.580
 it becomes very water insoluble and that is the form in which it's stored in the fat cells

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:55.980
 because you just form a drop of pure fat in the cell and it's very reluctant to diffuse away because of its insolubility.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:05.280
 So when you need energy, you have to activate enzymes that break the free fatty acids loose.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:10.980
 When that happens from stress or hunger or fasting,

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:23.280
 these free fatty acids get into the bloodstream and enter cells and are available as energy production in the absence of glucose.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.780
 The problem is that that process also tends to keep the stress going.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:38.380
 If the free fatty acids are unsaturated, those are more water soluble.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:45.880
 And when they're polyunsaturated like from corn oil, safflower oil and so on,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:58.480
 those have a further stress inducing action that tends to keep the breakdown of fat going and the stress reproducing itself.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:05.280
 Normally, if somebody was on a, because I know people that are listening who've listened to you before

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.980
 know that you're a great advocate of saturated fats, butter and coconut oil in particular

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:17.080
 and very much against the negative health impacts of the liquid oils and fish oil in particular.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:26.080
 If somebody's consuming a lot of butter and milk, whether it's full fat or semi-fat and coconut oil,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:38.080
 the fats therein, when they are stored as fat, they don't have the same destructive or oxidative effects when they're liberated.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:47.080
 Yeah, if you store a very saturated fat like the Indians make ghee by removing the water soluble material,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:57.080
 a pure fat oil or coconut oil, which is 98% saturated, those things keep for years without breaking down.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:08.080
 But if you leave a bottle of safflower or corn oil or linseed oil open within hours or days,

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.080
 you can detect spontaneous oxidation of it in the air.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:19.080
 And that happens at body temperature with the high oxygen content of your blood.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.080
 It happens very quickly with the polyunsaturated fats.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:36.080
 But interestingly, the biological oxidation is pretty much the opposite because if you have two types of fats circulating in your bloodstream,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:49.080
 one saturated fatty acid and one polyunsaturated, your muscles will be able to oxidize the saturated fat preferentially.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:56.080
 The polyunsaturated fat tends to go into storage if you eat more than you can oxidize.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:08.080
 So it tends to be fattening if you eat a little extra of the polyunsaturated because it stores more easily.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.080
 Your fat cells can also oxidize saturated fat.

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.080
 And so they live on the saturated fat that they have stored.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:29.080
 So over the years, stress is more likely to release the polyunsaturated fats, making stress an increasing problem with age.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:35.080
 Right. So that's the thing behind what you're describing now is the component free fatty acids.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:41.080
 If somebody is eating a lot of saturated fats like butter, ghee or coconut oil,

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:49.080
 then they're not going to liberate the same free fatty acid that they would if they were consuming polyunsaturated fats in their diet.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.080
 Right.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:19:00.080
 So don't mind me, but getting back to the classic description of diabetes as being a wasting disease,

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:07.080
 which actually we see very little of, as opposed to what now is generically termed as diabetes

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:11.080
 and is very largely linked to obesity in the general population.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:20.080
 That obesity was probably directly linked to the polyunsaturated thyroid suppressive diets that people consume.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:29.080
 Yes, now increasingly seen as a fat inflammation condition, a mild chronic inflammation.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:42.080
 And a major thing that causes that is the continual spontaneous release of small amounts of arachidonic acid,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:53.080
 which is a highly unsaturated fatty acid that even if you don't eat it, linoleic acid, for example,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.080
 will be turned into it by enzymes in the body.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:07.080
 So it becomes one of the most toxic stored fats, both in phospholipids and in the triglyceride storage.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:14.080
 And when that's released, that allows it to be turned into various things,

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:23.080
 but especially prostaglandins, which are probably our biggest inflammatory problem.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.080
 These things are associated with inflammation, aren't they?

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.080
 When you damage your tissues, prostaglandins are the thing that most people might recognize as being liberated,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.080
 causing swelling and edema.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.080
 Their way, aspirin is so great.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.080
 Yes.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:45.080
 Okay, well for those people who perhaps have just tuned in, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD Galliville 91.1 FM.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:51.080
 We are very pleased and very lucky to have Dr. Raymond Peat sharing his expertise on the show tonight.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:59.080
 And the subject of tonight's show is how to restore nerve tissue, prevent the damage and/or restore it.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:04.080
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, getting back again to diabetes,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.080
 I guess I should mention the fact that we have a toll-free number, 1-800-KMUD-RAD,

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.080
 or the local number is 923-3911.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:24.080
 So back to diabetes again, how do you approach it rather than the orthodoxy with metformin or insulin

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.080
 and/or avoidance of glucose even? It's contrary perhaps.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:45.080
 If you focus on stopping the liberation of fatty acids from your tissues and inhibit their conversion to prostaglandins,

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:52.080
 you can usually very quickly lower your blood sugar quite a bit and feel better.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:22:04.080
 The two chemicals that are most practical for lowering free fatty acids and stopping the stress reaction are niacinamide,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:17.080
 which has many effects, but the first one that it's commonly associated with is inhibiting the lipase that liberates fats from your fat stores.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.080
 What do you say inhibits the?

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:28.080
 The enzyme which liberates the free fatty acids from the triglyceride storage.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.080
 Okay.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:39.080
 And aspirin also does that and several other things relating to liberation of free fatty acids

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.080
 and their conversion to the inflammatory mediators.

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:49.080
 Okay, so both niacinamide and aspirin do that job of decreasing the liberation of free fatty acids.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:55.080
 Do you know the mechanism by which that's working?

00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:08.080
 In the case of aspirin, it's both indirect and direct actions on at least two different lipase enzymes,

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:19.080
 both phospholipase and the adipose hormone sensitive lipase that insulin controls.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:28.080
 So insulin deficiency in itself liberates more of the free fatty acids.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:39.080
 And so both of these are acting directly on the enzyme, which is caused to be overactive by an insulin deficiency.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:45.080
 Just for example, I know because most people are pretty frightened, I think, for want of a better word, of using aspirin.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.080
 Whenever I mention aspirin to people, the first thing is they're always very shocked that I mention aspirin.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.080
 It's almost a complete taboo.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.080
 Obviously, when people start listening and reading the facts about it, they get a different opinion.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:02.080
 And as time goes on, they begin to realize that perhaps there's actually something very good in it.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.080
 I know that you've -- and I've read some recent articles about its antiviral activity,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:14.080
 and they're actually looking at it pretty intensively for other conditions surrounding potential virus problems.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.080
 But its main anti-inflammatory effect is pretty useful widespread.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.080
 So what would you suggest as a dose for aspirin?

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.080
 Because the other thing that people worry about is how much of the bleeding.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.080
 They may get bleeding if they're using too much.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:38.080
 And I know that you recommend using vitamin K as a one milligram per drop per 325 milligram tablet.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.080
 Yeah, especially if a person has combined antibiotics with aspirin,

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:49.080
 they might have lost the intestinal bacteria that make vitamin K.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:25:02.080
 And eating lots of cooked greens such as kale and liver and some types of cheese are the best sources of vitamin K.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:09.080
 Do you think most people produce enough vitamin K to offset any potential --

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:16.080
 I don't think it's reliable to count on your intestinal bacteria because so many things can interfere.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.080
 And we'll get into the subject of endotoxin a bit later, and that's also tied up with diabetes.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.080
 So that's pretty interesting.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.080
 Okay, so what do you think in terms of a dose of aspirin as a kind of realistic --

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:34.080
 If your vitamin K is okay, I think it's fine to take two or 300 milligrams every day.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:41.080
 And if it's to correct a problem such as diabetes or some chronic inflammatory problem,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:51.080
 then up to -- I know people who have temporarily taken 6,000 or 7,000 milligrams a day,

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.080
 like 20 standard aspirin tablets, for example.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:03.080
 A little bit off base, but I remember hearing about somebody who'd got a recovery from HIV

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.080
 from using high-dose aspirin.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:14.080
 Yeah, there was a study that the government, I think, canceled it when it looked like it was going to be too successful

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.080
 because it would be terrible for the drug industry.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.080
 And very cheap.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080
 Okay. All right.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.080
 Well, I don't want to get too much off the track here because I've got plenty of questions I wanted to ask you.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.080
 We do actually have a couple of callers lined up,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:35.080
 so perhaps we should take a couple of callers here and I'll carry on asking you about what you've recently found out.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.080
 So, first caller, you're on the air.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:41.080
 And where are you calling from, caller?

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.080
 Hello.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.080
 Hi.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.080
 This is Gina from Kansas City.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.080
 Okay. Hi.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.080
 Hi. I have a couple of questions.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:59.080
 One is about a liver enzyme. I have an high ALT.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.080
 Any suggestions?

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080
 Yeah. Okay.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.080
 What was the enzyme?

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.080
 ALT.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.080
 Oh, okay.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:22.080
 When anything is stressed, any cell, for example, just hypothyroidism, lowers the energy production of a cell,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:29.080
 makes it tend to take up water, and when it takes up water, it becomes somewhat porous

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:34.080
 and its natural enzymes leak out into the bloodstream.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:44.080
 And just by looking at the type of enzyme, you can't be sure whether it's coming from a leg muscle that you strained

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:52.080
 or overstressed or a heart muscle that is being stressed or the liver.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:28:04.080
 The liver is usually the place that you look for enzymes that are concentrated in the liver.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.080
 So, ALT is one of those.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.080
 Okay. And what was your other question?

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.080
 The other one is about greens.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.080
 What is a good amount to have?

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.080
 I cannot digest vegetables.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:30.080
 I eat leafy greens, a broth, and I do raw juice, which is the only things I can digest.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.080
 How much would you suggest I have per week?

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.080
 What's to meet my nutritional needs?

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.080
 How much of which?

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:44.080
 I think the lady was trying to describe greens as in broths, as in --

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:53.080
 The cooked green, if you eat it by the cups and the quarts, it's an adequate source of protein.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:29:05.080
 But if you aren't eating it as your main food for protein, then half a cup to a cup a day will provide your vitamin K

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.080
 and a generous amount of magnesium and calcium.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:16.080
 Those are the nutrients that quickly cook out of it into the broth.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:22.080
 And so if you drink only the water that you cooked a cup or so of leaves in,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.080
 then you get a little supplement of magnesium and calcium.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.080
 Okay.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.080
 What about raw juicing?

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:39.080
 It's pretty irritating to the intestine.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:45.080
 Plants put their most intense defensive toxins into their seeds,

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:53.080
 but their next most intense irritants and toxins are in the leaves because they don't want to be grazed.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.080
 So they put chemicals in that tend to block your digestive enzymes.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.080
 And cooking destroys most of those toxins or reduces them.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:16.080
 And so if you eat them raw and if you aren't a ruminant that has evolved a stomach to handle raw leaves,

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.080
 then you're most likely to have some digestive problems.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.080
 Okay.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.080
 Thank you very much.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.080
 Okay.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.080
 Thanks for your questions.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.080
 Let's take the next caller.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.080
 Caller, where are you from?

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.080
 This is David in Missouri.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.080
 Oh, hi, David.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.080
 Hello.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.080
 I wanted to come back to aspirin real quick if that's okay.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.080
 Dr. Peat, I've heard you in a podcast before, I'm pretty sure,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:46.080
 mention that aspirin is helpful in reducing tumor growth.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.080
 And I was just wondering about that.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:53.080
 And then the other thing is, I don't know if you're familiar with an aspirin powder.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.080
 It's called BC, and it actually has caffeine in it.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.080
 And what I've been doing, just because I have a knee that hurts me off and on, you know,

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.080
 have quite a bit of pain in it, especially depending on what I'm doing.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:16.080
 But I actually have been putting baking soda and magnesium sulfate or epsom salt in.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:22.080
 Sometimes I'll even put some magnesium chloride in and then these aspirin with this caffeine.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.080
 Caffeine.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.080
 And the baking soda, which I've heard you say about the baking soda.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.080
 I think I understood this correctly, that it creates a gradient that pulls those things into the body.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.080
 Is that also correct?

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:45.080
 It has diuretic effects and some anti-inflammatory effects from the carbon dioxide itself.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:54.080
 And the caffeine acts on some of the same enzymes that aspirin does with an anti-inflammatory effect.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:03.080
 They both increase your cell respiration and they both suppress nitric oxide,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:12.080
 which is one of our central risky pro-inflammatory mediators,

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:19.080
 which happens to poison the mitochondrial respiration, blocking it directly.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:28.080
 So caffeine and aspirin have multi-levels of defense of the mitochondria.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.080
 And will that be pulled in through the skin effectively more than likely?

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:40.080
 Caffeine goes in through the skin more easily than aspirin, but, yes, some aspirin is absorbed.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.080
 Okay.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.080
 And then so everything that you just said, I guess, applies to tumor growth to a certain degree as well?

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.080
 Yes.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:33:00.080
 Inflammation and respiratory defect is the motor for cancer growth.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:07.080
 And it happens that if you restore energy production in the mitochondria,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:19.080
 you're also lowering the inflammatory stimulants that activate cell division and spreading.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.080
 Okay. Well, thank you.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.080
 Okay. I appreciate your call.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:26.080
 We have a couple more on the line already, so let's just make sure everyone gets a chance here.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.080
 So thanks for your call.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.080
 Next caller, where are you from?

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.080
 I'm calling from Sacramento.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.080
 Okay. Hi, you're on the air.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:48.080
 I had a couple of questions for Dr. Peat about substances that induce the process of what's called mitochondrial uncoupling,

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:55.080
 which I believe reduces ATP production and generates body heat instead.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:34:01.080
 And some of these substances have generated a fair amount of controversy in the past.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:10.080
 So my first question is, if this reduced ATP production is in any way harmful to the body?

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.080
 Yes, actually.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:20.080
 The uncouplers, when it's a mild degree of uncoupling,

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:33.080
 it prevents some of the stray free radical products that happens in the more relaxed, lower intensity mitochondrion.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:41.080
 So they know that you reduce free radical damage a little by increasing uncoupling.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:52.080
 But another substance which uncouples mitochondria also lowers ATP a little bit

00:34:52.080 --> 00:35:01.080
 and greatly protects the mitochondrion from free radicals.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.080
 That's fructose.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:10.080
 Fructose absorbs excess phosphate ions.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:16.080
 Probably that's related to why it lowers the ATP.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:24.080
 But the absorption of the phosphate ions by fructose is, in a way,

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:30.080
 a direct defensive system of the oxidative system

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:39.080
 because the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme, which is suppressed in cancer,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:47.080
 it's why dichloroacetate is gaining so much interest

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.080
 because it's a chemical that reactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:59.080
 and improves the cancer metabolism in a great variety of tumors.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:09.080
 But simply lowering the free phosphate in the cell tends to reactivate this crucial enzyme

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.080
 at the top of the energy producing chain.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:25.080
 And when you are supplied with aspirin, caffeine, and fructose, for example,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:29.080
 you are not calling on free fatty acids.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:39.080
 If you load up the cell with excess free fatty acids, for example, from some stress,

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:44.080
 the free fatty acids reverse all of those processes.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:56.080
 They block pyruvate dehydrogenase by making more phosphate ions available

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:02.080
 where the sugars bind them and lower the free phosphate fatty acids,

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:09.080
 increase them, and tend to poison the crucial enzyme.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:15.080
 Okay. I guess I'll listen to that one more time on the radio.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:23.080
 So basically this process of producing heat, does that in any way negatively affect the thyroid?

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:30.080
 Because, you know, isn't that what's supposed to kind of generate heat in the body?

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:36.080
 Does this uncoupling generate heat? Does that, you know, downgrade the thyroid?

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:48.080
 It increases heat, among other things, and keeping your body temperature up to an efficient high level

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.080
 makes all of your tissues more stable.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:59.080
 Okay. So it doesn't harm the thyroid in any way, this process of uncoupling?

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.080
 Oh, no. The thyroid is very compatible with that.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:11.080
 Keeping yourself slightly hyperthyroid doesn't stress anything.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:16.080
 In fact, it keeps down those stress signals.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.080
 Okay. Great. Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.080
 Okay. Well, thank you for your call. I think we have another caller on the end.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.080
 We have another caller, and we've got a couple of questions.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:31.080
 I just want to let people know that there is a vigil going on for Tim Olson at the Bryson Fire Department,

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:38.080
 and the folks there asked if you wanted to bring anything, flowers would be great.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:46.080
 So there are folks having a candlelight vigil for Tim Olson out at the Bryson--just a vigil in general.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.080
 I don't know if it's candlelight, but there are lights there, and people are bringing flowers.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:39:00.080
 And if you'd like to bring flowers, there is a vigil at the Bryson Fire Department for Tim Olson, who passed away today.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:05.080
 We do have more callers, and let's go to one of those callers right now.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.080
 Okay. Caller, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.080
 Good evening, Andrew and Dr. Peat. This is Mike from New York.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.080
 New York. All right.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:20.080
 Dr. Peat, you mentioned earlier about using niacinamide,

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:29.080
 and I was wondering if there is a minimal dose, a range, and an upper limit for people to try it.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:43.080
 I've seen really great results from something in the range of 150 to 300 milligrams per day divided into three smaller doses.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:55.080
 But I also know people who have taken over 1,000, 1,500 milligrams for a very long time and haven't had problems,

00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:04.080
 mainly because all of the manufactured supplements are going to have trace allergenic impurities.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:10.080
 I think it's best to find the smallest amount that works for you.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:17.080
 Does niacinamide need to be balanced out with any other B vitamin or other supplements?

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:29.080
 Thiamine, vitamin B1, works with the respiratory enzymes, and of course you need all of them.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:38.080
 B12 and B1 and biotin are very closely involved with the respiratory apparatus.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:44.080
 And you've discussed many times in your articles and in interviews about the benefits of vitamin B6,

00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:53.080
 and some people have found that they do better with the active form, P5P or PLP.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:59.080
 I was wondering, aside from trial and error, if there's any other indicators or history that a person might find

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.080
 that they need the active form as opposed to the typical form.

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:09.080
 With either form of vitamin B6, it's possible to overdose.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:18.080
 And I think people are finding that the active form is easier to overdose with.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:29.080
 It used to take several hundred milligrams several months to produce toxic effects on the nerves,

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:36.080
 but some people are seeing it with as little as 50 milligrams over a prolonged time with the active form.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:46.080
 And I think it's good to start with 10 milligrams, which is far beyond the normal day's requirement.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:55.080
 Ten to 20 milligrams is almost always all a person needs therapeutically of B6.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:05.080
 And you've discussed using the carrot salad to lower the intestinal load of bacteria.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:11.080
 And I was wondering if after some months' time a person doing that has not found relief,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:18.080
 or their symptoms haven't relieved, if they were to try the -- if you're familiar with it --

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.080
 the drug metronidazole, and also goes by the name of Flagel,

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.080
 as treatment for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.080
 Would that be perhaps a safe drug for a person to try after some time?

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:37.080
 That happens to be a pretty toxic antibiotic.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:42.080
 So I think it's good to try a lot of other things first.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:52.080
 There are some bacterial products that are more actively germicidal in the intestine.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:43:03.080
 There's one that comes from Ukraine called Biosporin that has very germicidal bacteria in it.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:19.080
 And I think there are some intestinal detoxifying or disinfecting antibiotics that are a lot safer than metronidazole.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:24.080
 I understand that there's a link with a SIBO with the several conditions,

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.080
 but one of them is rosacea, for example.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:32.080
 And there's a connection with hydrogen-producing bacteria and/or methane-producing bacteria,

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:39.080
 and therefore that Flagel or Rifaximin is another antibiotic that it's gone to.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:45.080
 But if it is not safe, is there one that you would recommend before that?

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.080
 Maybe you --

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.080
 No, I haven't had experience with those.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.080
 Okay.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.080
 And this is going back quite a ways, I think six months.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:03.080
 In an interview, Dr. Peat, you mentioned anecdotally about people with leukemia treating it with raw eggnog,

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.080
 and I was wondering if you could elaborate on that.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.080
 It's very interesting.

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.080
 Well, they were using a whole eggnog.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:14.080
 I don't think it was just the white.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.080
 Oh, yes, the yolk primarily.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:31.080
 Yes, and the fresh egg lecithin itself has been shown to have antiviral activities, antibacterial too,

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:40.080
 but I think the white of the egg is peculiar for its ability to bind minerals,

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:54.080
 and the combination of the lecithin and raw egg white probably has some special germicidal effect.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:00.080
 Okay, thank you very much, and I'll let another caller on.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.080
 Okay.

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.080
 Thanks very much.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.080
 Thanks for your call.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.080
 Well, we do have another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.080
 Caller, you're on air.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.080
 Where are you from?

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:13.080
 Dr. Peat, this is the herb doctor's engineer, and two callers asked me to ask you a question.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:19.080
 I'm going to ask them in the order they came in, but you might want to answer the second one first

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.080
 because it's something you addressed already tonight.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:25.080
 The two questions are the first caller wanted to know,

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:31.080
 would like the good doctor to talk about dehydration and what are the water requirements of the body.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:38.080
 The other question was could you give a brief explanation of the difference between nutritional yeast

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.080
 and brewer's yeast?

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:49.080
 The two types of yeast, there are actually many strains, and they taste different.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:59.080
 The brewer's yeast that actually comes from a brewery generally has hops flavor in it,

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.080
 and so it's very bitter.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.080
 Yeasts have been grown specially for making nutritional supplements,

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:19.080
 and so some of them have added chemical substances such as I think selenium is one that they commonly add.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:28.080
 Basically, the yeast chemistry in itself is always rich in B vitamins.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:35.080
 Hydration, keeping your cell energy up I think is the basic thing.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:46.080
 You want to keep the cell water under control and neither too hydrated nor too dehydrated.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:58.080
 The regulating minerals, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium is part of that,

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:05.080
 keeping the balance between intracellular water and extracellular water.

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:11.080
 The thing about drinking extra water when you're not thirsty,

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:17.080
 I think thirst is almost always a good indicator of how much you need.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:27.080
 If you're drinking, for example, milk and fruit juice, that can provide all the water you need.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:33.080
 Try to add extra water. It can disturb your mineral balance and hormone balance.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:40.080
 For example, too much water in relation to the minerals tends to increase your prolactin

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:47.080
 because prolactin is a water and salt regulating hormone among other things.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:54.080
 So it's probably more important to emphasize not to push excess water

00:47:54.080 --> 00:48:01.080
 rather than to remind people to drink because usually thirst tells them when.

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.080
 Now, Doc, I know you had some other questions for Dr. Peat tonight.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.080
 Are you still going to take calls? There's one caller on the line.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.080
 Yes, we are. I wanted to engineer.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.080
 If you take any calls from people and they want to have it off the air,

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:17.080
 would you just find out where they're from because I'm just trying to build some demographics of who's using it.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.080
 Okay, I will be glad to do that.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.080
 Thank you. I mean, if they want to do it off air, otherwise we'll be asking them.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.080
 Okay.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.080
 Okay, great. So next caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.080
 Hello?

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.080
 Hello, you're on the air. Where are you calling from?

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.080
 You need to turn your radio off.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.080
 Did you hear that? You need to turn your radio off first, otherwise we'll get a lot of feedback.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080
 Hello.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.080
 Hi. So if you've turned your radio off, where are you from?

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.080
 Hi. Oklahoma City.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.080
 Oklahoma City. Okay, great. So what was your question?

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:53.080
 Okay, I just wanted to know what would you apply on your face to get rid of age spots, please?

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.080
 Okay. Dr. Peat, age spots.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:14.080
 Well, it depends on what they're made of. Sometimes high estrogen or high polyunsaturated fats can cause a fairly sudden appearance of age spots at an area that's irritated or sun exposed.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:29.080
 And changing your diet away from the polyunsaturated fats and adding a little vitamin E, rubbing some vitamin E into those spots can help to remove them.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:42.080
 There are enzymes that can break down even fairly old, longstanding lipofuscin pigment, and vitamin E is an activator of that.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.080
 Okay.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:50:04.080
 If it's largely a sun-induced spot, you might try rubbing some niacinamide, a dissolved high-potency niacinamide tablet, in just a tiny amount of water and apply that to the spot every day for a week or two.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.080
 It fades a lot of the pigments.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:14.080
 Dr. Pitt, I think this is because of estrogen and PUFAs over a long period of time.

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:25.080
 And also, the vitamin E you get in capsules, it always has some -- it's soy-derived. Is that okay, or should I go for a purer form of vitamin E?

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:45.080
 I think a purer high-potency vitamin E is good. 100 or 200 milligrams orally is probably enough, but you can put a little on a spot and sometimes that helps the enzymes to clear it out.

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.080
 Okay. Thank you so much, Dr. Pitt. I'll be talking to you soon.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.080
 Okay. Well, thanks so much for your call, Carla.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:53.080
 I don't know, engineers anymore? Okay. So we have no more callers.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:51:01.080
 But anyway, let's give out the number again, but I've only just started asking you, Dr. Pitt, what I wanted to ask you about your newsletter.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:11.080
 So the number here, if people are listening, they want to call Dr. Pitt about anything either related or unrelated to this night's show on nerve, how to restore nerves and protect them.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:21.080
 The number is 9233911 if you live in the area, or there is a 1-800 number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD if you live outside the area.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:30.080
 So, Dr. Pitt, getting back to the topic of tonight, I know actually about the treatment with aspirin.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:37.080
 You mentioned niacinamide as very good modifiers or regulators of free fatty acid expression.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:49.080
 So I wanted to ask you, even in the presence of supplemented insulin, to say, for people that are truly insulin diabetic, the nerve damages or the neuropathies, as they call them,

00:51:49.080 --> 00:52:02.080
 these processes that diabetics still get, even in the presence of insulin, and those sensation loss that they get, particularly in the feet or the soles of the feet,

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:06.080
 which are the kind of initial symptoms of so-called sugar excess syndrome.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:12.080
 How is the process at odds with excess sugar when sugar is a vital energy producing currency?

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:30.080
 I've gone through many articles. Recently, I watched a video by Gershom Zaytchek, who is a very amazing biology and medical professor in Israel.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:51.080
 He has a very good understanding of physiology, and he has a video on diabetes and explains how the increased blood glucose is called for by the brain to make up for its needs.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:53:08.080
 But after explaining the compensatory effect of high glucose for the brain, he uses the term glycotoxic for the harmful effects, supposedly, of glucose.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:18.080
 Basically, he just resorted to a word to explain how glucose affects the other organs.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:30.080
 And looking through the literature, I see that people do that without really explaining what's happening, why extra glucose would be harmful.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:46.080
 If it's within a moderate osmolarity, the mechanism just isn't explained, even though they say that it's doing the harm.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:59.080
 The changes in the nerves include everything that is failing because of lack of energy.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:19.080
 When the cells are known to be living on fatty acids, and the fatty acids are intrinsically disturbing the metabolism of phosphate, turning off glucose energy production, slowing down,

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:37.080
 and even activating nitric oxide, the respiratory inhibitor, you know that the energy of the cell being reduced is going to slow all kinds of repairing processes.

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:47.080
 Incidentally, in the pancreas, glucose stimulates regeneration of new insulin-producing cells.

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:59.080
 And it's the bad balance, too much free fatty acids and not enough glucose to defend the cells that causes them to die.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:13.080
 Anywhere that a cell is being deprived of energy and forced to eat fatty acids instead, that's now well recognized in heart failure.

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:29.080
 A simple treatment such as niacinamide can restore great amounts of heart energy production and improve the failure.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:36.080
 Drugs are being developed to do the same as aspirin and niacinamide.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:52.080
 In nerves, one of the effects of failing energy is the inability to make cholesterol and to convert cholesterol into the neurosteroids.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:56:07.080
 In a nerve or its supporting cells, the glial cells, when they're injured by anything, including lack of glucose or a lack of oxygen,

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:22.080
 they not only stop producing the defensive steroids from cholesterol, but they begin producing estrogen.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:37.080
 The nerves and all of the diabetic tissues have more aromatase than a normal person of the same age.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:52.080
 The estrogen in a healthy person, when the nerve is stressed, the activation of this enzyme, which is normally inactive in a nerve,

00:56:52.080 --> 00:57:06.080
 activates the production of a little estrogen, which sends out signals to the surrounding cells to cause them to produce pregnenolone, progesterone, allopregnenolone,

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.080
 and a whole range of protective nerve steroids.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:21.080
 But if you don't have the energy, you get stuck in producing just the estrogen, which keeps things excited and stressed.

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:28.080
 I'm sorry, but I do actually need to pause it right there and just give out some of your information before the top of the hour

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:33.080
 to let people know how to reach more of your information, Dr. Peat.

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.080
 Thanks so much for joining us again on the show tonight.

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:41.080
 And potentially next month, can we carry on? Because I didn't hardly ask you anything about the subject.

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:42.080
 Okay.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:43.080
 Okay, thanks so much for joining us.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.080
 Thanks.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:53.080
 Okay, so for those people who've listened to Dr. Peat tonight and know him, and for those people who've just heard him and are interested to find out more about him,

00:57:53.080 --> 00:58:02.080
 his website, www.rayPeat.com, R-A-Y P-E-E-T.com, he's not selling anything.

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.080
 He's just doing pure research.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:15.080
 And what really bears out the fruit of his research is the stunning amount of people who've commented on how much better they've gotten after taking his advice,

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:20.080
 doing the seemingly controversial or contraindicated.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.080
 And that's often the way.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.080
 There's lots of research out there.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:28.080
 And unfortunately, it takes a very long time to get to mainstream medicine.

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:34.080
 Unfortunately, mainstream medicine is driven by a very, very well-oiled machine.

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:43.080
 And that very well-oiled machine has some huge resources behind it to keep drugs going and to keep patients using drugs.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:45.080
 Not to say that everything is bad.

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:46.080
 It's not.

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:52.080
 It's just to say that there's a lot of hidden truth out there, which unfortunately takes a long time to come to the surface.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:58.080
 But Dr. Peat's articles are fully referenced and it's very scientific information.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.080
 So it's just common sense.

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:09.080
 And fortunately, we are seeing some of this common sense come to bear in terms of the polyunsaturated oils now being condemned.

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:13.080
 So anyway, www.rayPeat.com.

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:21.080
 And we can be reached after all Monday through Friday, 9 to 5, 1-888-WBM-ERB for further questions.

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:25.080
 So it's the Spring Bernal Equinox.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.080
 And yeah, all the best.

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:29.080
 I'll speak to you next month.

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:40.080
