 This free program is paid for by the listeners of Redwood Community Radio.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 If you're not already a member, please think of joining us. Thank you.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 [Radio broadcast]

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 And support for Redwood Community Radio comes in part from the Security Store.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 They're in the Meadows Business Park in Redway and feature watershed dry bags and pelican cases in many sizes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Both have lifetime warranties and have been tested over time in Humboldt County.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 The Security Store has solutions for all security needs and is open Monday through Saturday 9 to 5.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 They can be reached at 923-2363.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 It is 7 o'clock. This is Redwood Community Radio, KMUD, KMUE, that's KMUD Garberville, KMUE Eureka Arcada, KLAI, KLAI Laytonville.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 And on the web at KMUD.org we've got the Herb Doctors coming right up and the Herb Doctor wants to tell us something.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 I can't imagine you'll forget the intro.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 The intro? The intro music? Oh yes, no I have, oh it's track 5, that's what you're saying.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Alright, we got it.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 It's on my computer so I don't know what track it is.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Don't let me disturb you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 No, here, how about you give a little pitch for a second and I'll get it lined up and I'll get the doctor on the line and we'll jump right into it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Okay, well as everyone knows, well maybe everyone doesn't know, but folks should know that the pledge drive is running through next Friday.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Looks like the new total is $44,752 and the goal is $125,000.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 There's 19 new members and the goal is to get another 100.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And for many years now, probably 8 or 9, we've been here doing this show and as so typical of KMUD, the alternative and the unconventional, if you like, is available.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 So if you're not finding any solace in the normal, which I think most people who listen don't, it's an excellent radio station to get the alternatives.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 And the alternative view is always something that people have to dig around for normally.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 So listening to this show, you're going to get a wide variety of very alternative music, discussions, etc. etc.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 So I very much recommend people that are not members would support KMUD radio.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 I think they do a great job.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 They're a little island, if you like, or a beacon in the dark, just shining out all the stuff that they send out on the air to people listening in the hills on their own.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 So it's a great station to be connected to and I'm very privileged and feel very grateful to be able to do this once a month show, Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 So just putting it out there for people that if they're not a member, if you've thought about it, but you haven't actually made a decision,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 it's not a lot of money to keep this great radio station going that offers such a wide range of alternative subjects and keeps people connected to the local community.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 So I just brought Dr. Peat on right now because he's here.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 So thank you very much, Dr. Peat, for joining our community.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 Hey, Dr. Peat.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 Hi.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Hey, thanks for joining us.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 OK, well, it's a little impromptu, so we'll get going with the with the show right now.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 I'm just going to do the introduction as usual, just in case there's people who've never heard the show before.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And can you give a phone number to for people who might not know?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Because I know Dr. Peat has a lot of people from throughout the nation who are listening in right now.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 I would never give his phone number out.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 No, no, no, not his phone number.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 This number?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Yeah, because there are people from throughout the nation who do tune in.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 We get more calls from more areas.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 So we'd like to let those people know.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 I always give a number out.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Always give a number out.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 OK, so welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 And for those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, which runs every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 my wife and I both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And we run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So thank you for listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUG Garboville, 91.1 FM.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in any questions, either related or unrelated to this month's subject of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And if we get time, there's a recent newsletter that Dr. Peat has just finished on cataracts, water, aging and light.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 And covering the theme, the ongoing theme of anti-inflammation from some things or compounds that will cause stress.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 So thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 As usual, if you wouldn't mind just giving people a resume of your academic professional background, perhaps for those new listeners who might have tuned in to this show.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 I studied biology, University of Oregon, graduate school 1968 to '72.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Did my dissertation on reproductive aging and oxidative processes, concentrating on the effects of estrogen and progesterone largely.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 And trying to explain why an excess of estrogen resembled the physiology of aging, stress or x-ray poisoning.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And that was sort of a follow-up of my interests from the 1950s on the effects of low-level radiation on public health.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 And that's been one of my continuing interests.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Okay, so this month I got a little bit of a kind of spate of people contacting us about Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 And as your specialty was hormones, reproductive and thyroid.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 I know this is a subject that's very dear to your heart and something that you spent many, many years studying and researching.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 In terms of the condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis, I know you have a very different and kind of alternative view of it.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 And it's certainly scientifically based.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 But what constitutes Hashimoto's disease in your mind?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And its characteristic lab findings and the symptoms and the treatment of it?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And what do the temperature and pulses show?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And we'll get into temperature and pulses in a bit more detail a bit later on.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 But what do you view Hashimoto's as?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 A hundred years ago Hashimoto described it as an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by infiltration of white blood cells.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And some people actually stick a needle into the gland and diagnose on the basis of how he described it that long ago.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 But the general principle is that it's an enlarged gland that doesn't produce enough hormone.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And so you can make a guess as to its cause by looking at the blood.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 If you see that there seems to be a deficiency of the hormone in the blood and maybe some evidence of inflammation,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 such as proteins and antibodies to the proteins from the thyroid gland, then they don't bother doing the needle biopsy.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 So those two particular tests are the only real thing that medical doctors will be wanting to see as a confirmation?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Yeah. Simultaneously, a little before Hashimoto's study, people were seeing various reasons for the enlargement of the thyroid gland,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 various poisonings or iodine deficiency was recognized as the main cause of enlargement.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And being in Japan, I suppose, was why Hashimoto saw the peculiar inflammation of the thyroid rather than a blatant iodine deficiency,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 because many people in Japan eat so much iodine that they get thyroiditis from blocking the functions of the gland.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 And that classically results in increasing the TSH to overcome the blockage by excess iodine.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 But exactly the same TSH excess is produced by a deficiency of iodine.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 So what you see typically is a rising TSH driving the gland to work harder as the organism shows signs of decreasing thyroid function.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 OK. So in terms of the antibodies, how does the traditional medical diagnosis then differ in terms of the way that you would,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 because I understand that both the antibodies are looked at the antithyroglobulin antibody and the antithyroid peroxidase antibodies,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 which are generally measured to give a diagnosis, that these are actually present in people that don't have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 So people can actually have raised levels of these antibodies and not be showing any symptoms at all.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 And conversely, the identity of an antibody isn't really as clear as a lot of people assume.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 They've found that there's a great cross reaction between thyroid antibodies and joint antibodies.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 And that explains why people with thyroiditis and hypothyroidism so often have arthritis and joint problems.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 And the whole issue of explaining disease as blaming it on the immune system attacking the body.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 If you wrench your knee and sort of damage the cartilage, they've done experiments in rabbits taking a piece of foreign cartilage like from a cow,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 and it will produce very few antibodies in the rabbit. But if you twist it a little bit, structurally damage it,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 then it produces a terrific immune reaction.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 And any organ that gets strained or overworked tends to leak some of its proteins.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 And the immune system's function largely is to clean up any mess.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 In fact, there is an alternative interpretation of what the immune system is doing rather than looking for foreign invading pathogens.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 This theory says it's primarily cleaning up messes caused by anything which is pathogenic.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 So in one of the so-called autoimmune brain conditions, people have demonstrated that the presence of the antibody to the brain tissue accelerates the recovery.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 So cleaning up the mess is really constructive rather than always being the cause of deterioration.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 I've heard you, it's a little bit off base at the moment to mention this, but I just thought I'd need to bring it up because it has a relevance to what you're saying about antibodies not being a bad thing.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Now, you've mentioned before that the, for example, a condition hepatitis C, number one, it's questionable.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 I know you've questioned even the existence of it as a virus in its own right.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 But you say that the antibodies that are generally measured to show a degree of severity, the way the medical industry looks at it, is actually a bad way of looking at it because actually the antibodies to it are very important in mopping up the damage, if you like.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 Yeah, that's Duisburg's basic objection to the whole AIDS/HIV theory, but it applies to the hepatitis C at least as much as to HIV.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Right, and that initial insult perhaps to the liver, whether it be through PUFA or radiation or any other external stresses in its own right, may well...

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 Decades ago, the Egyptian government had a campaign to give a very toxic drug to the whole population because of a parasite that they were eliminating.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 And that poison causes liver damage and now a tremendous proportion, roughly half of the Egyptian population, I think it was, showed evidence of hepatitis C.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 I think it's just the after effect of that poisoning.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Right, I remember you saying that, exactly what you're talking about in terms of that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 OK, well you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Galbavool 91.1 FM.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 From 7.30 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated, this month's subject of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 I also got to say that generally we open the lines at 7.30, but it is the pledge and at 7.30 the pledge is going to be pitching the drive at 7.30.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 So, what I wanted to say was, in case people are anxious that they're not going to get enough time, we can pretty much open the lines any time from now on and take people.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Because we will be coming in and out, making sure that people are aware that the pledge is running and that we're raising money for the studio to continue.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 So, hopefully people will call in and start pledging.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 I'd just like to jump in because I forgot to read our underwriters who basically pledge every day.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000

 So if people want to join in now and ask questions about this subject or have any other questions they'd like to put to Dr. Peat or myself, please feel free.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 So Dr. Peat, I know you mentioned the antibodies not being that relevant and in some ways not seemingly being a bad thing in other conditions.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 But so far as Hashimoto's and its treatment, you always look at it as the necessity is to get the TSH down, the thyroid stimulating hormone down, which is normally quite elevated in Hashimoto's.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 Yeah, it's well established lately, last several years, that TSH itself causes many of the symptoms blamed on hypothyroidism.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 It acts on the bone marrow and many other tissues, the liver, producing, increasing the inflammatory cytokine chemicals.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 So in itself, it's a basic problem of hypothyroidism, I think.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Right, because you've always said that TSH in its own right is a chaperone for other immune or inflammatory molecules.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And so in a normal healthy person, it's a good idea to try and get the TSH as close to zero as possible.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Does it have any benefits, I mean, apart from stimulating the production or release of thyroid hormone?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 My newsletter on osteoporosis a couple of years ago went over the arguments that they're using to say that it prevents osteoporosis.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 But I think the references that I give in there show that basically it's just increasing the load of inflammation.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Okay, so in terms of the standard medical treatment for Hashimoto's, I think it's probably true enough to say that thyroxine is the main compound that they will give to a person to treat it.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Yes, if they give enough, there have been some studies in which the antibodies tend to disappear after about six months of keeping the TSH under control.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Okay, so in your opinion, because I know we've seen quite a few people that have been previously treated with thyroxine that were not getting a lot of symptom relief.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 I mean, in terms of the compound, what do you think of its efficacy or its ability to do its job?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 It in itself, in almost every situation, will suppress the TSH, even though T3 can do it.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 And sometimes maybe two or three percent of the people need T3 to work on the pituitary to suppress the TSH.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 But women in particular have five or ten times as much thyroid disease as men.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 And the reason is that estrogen interferes with the liver's ability to convert thyroxine to the active T3 hormone.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 And if your liver isn't producing some T3, your gland, which produces a ratio of about three parts of thyroxine to one part of the active hormone,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 if you give that person big doses of thyroxine, you're going to turn off that little bit of active hormone coming out of their thyroid gland when you suppress the TSH.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 And they'll go into an increasingly hypothyroid state.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And that has caused a lot of doctors to think of people being simultaneously hypothyroid and hyperthyroid,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 which doesn't make sense unless you see that they're interfering with the liver's ability to activate the hormone.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 And some people have argued that one of the needs for TSH is to induce the local enzymes in the various tissues, such as the liver, which do the conversion.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 But there have been several studies showing that you absolutely don't need the TSH to do that activation of the deiodinase enzymes in the various tissues,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 that other signals from other glands will maintain the activating enzymes.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Okay, so in terms of someone presenting with Hashimoto's, you're saying that it is reasonable to assume that thyroxine in its own right would be the treatment of choice?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Well, yeah, especially in men, but since women are the main people who have Hashimoto's, it's very likely to bring on symptoms.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 So it's very reasonable to try it, but as soon as they start getting symptoms of worse hypothyroidism, then it's time to give them the complete thyroid hormone.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Okay, and that's like you said, it's because of the estrogen.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 I know your most recent newsletter, the Cataract Newsletter, has a lot to deal with estrogen being a pro-inflammatory stress-mediating chemical that attenuates the effects of other things in the body.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah, the industry is periodically creating new myths about estrogen, and one of the things they're currently pushing.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Several years ago, they went through a wave of claiming that estrogen was an antioxidant,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 and even though it's primarily an oxygen-wasting pro-oxidative mediator, now they're pushing the idea that estrogen is anti-inflammatory.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 We do actually have a caller on the air, Dr. Peat, so perhaps we should take this. I'm sorry to cut in there, but there's a caller, so let's see if we can get this next one on air.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Hi, you're on air. Where are you calling from?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 Hi, I'm calling from New Jersey.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Okay, you're on the air, so go ahead.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Hi there. I just read the Brota Barnes book, and Hypothyroidism, the Unsuspected Illness.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 My entire medical history is in that book, so I'm very grateful that you provided that information.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 I am having a little bit of trouble. I know how to follow instructions.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 He suggests that we put the thermometer under our arm for 10 minutes before we get out of bed in the morning.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 In other words, it's a resting temperature, and I did that. I averaged over an 18-day period 96.4, but that's not my goal in telling you this.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 I started to get creative after I did that, and maybe that's my mistake. I don't know.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 I started to put the thermometer under my arm again for subsequent 10-minute increments, and I found that my temperature was continuing.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 The mercury was continuing to rise.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 97, for example, is still low, but it's higher than 96.4, or sometimes it's 95.8 or something.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 I guess what I'm wondering is I really want to find a way of accurately gauging my temperature,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 and hopefully thereby my metabolic rate, so that when I start to treat myself, I don't flip over into Graves' disease.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Have I just wasted time?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Should I just revert to Dr. Barnes' temperature test and go back to the 10 minutes, or should I experiment with this a little bit, if you were me?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 No, It would be good if you could do it for half an hour or whatever it takes to stabilize,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 but the trouble is that hypothyroid people have low tissue metabolism,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 and that often goes with high adrenaline, which cuts off circulation to your skin, fingers, toes,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 and keeps the circulation going primarily to your brain, heart, and lungs.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 So especially if you are overweight, the skin and subcutaneous fat can take a couple of hours to reach core temperature if you're thoroughly insulated.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 So it's good to check your eardrum temperature, mouth temperature, as well as your armpit temperature

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 while noticing the temperature of your fingers and toes and tip of your nose.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Is there a significant difference in a basal temperature thermometer?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 I mean, they have these separate thermometers called basal thermometers.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 What is that?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 They're just marked off so you can read them more easily and tense,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 but I don't think the small differences are that important for the thyroid guesswork.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 If you notice that your oral temperature is at all low and your fingers and toes are colder than other people's,

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 that's a good sign that your metabolic rate is low.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 And if you consider the amount of calories you need per day compared to other people,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 that's a good indication of your thyroid metabolic rate.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 And the amount of water that you evaporate is a very good indicator.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 A person should take in two quarts more fluid than they lose per day in urine.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 That two quarts would be an average evaporation if your thyroid is good.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 But many people evaporate less than a quart a day, meaning that --

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 We're waterlogged.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 Yeah, and instead of being evaporated, the low thyroid person tends to retain water.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 And there are so many indications other than temperature.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 I first started playing with Barnes's technique one hot, humid summer in Eugene when it was about 95 degrees,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 and even people who could hardly move, they were so hypothyroid, were very close to normal temperature.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 And I realized that a squash sitting on the counter would show a normal metabolic rate if you went just by temperature.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 And so checking your pulse rate and the temperature of your fingers and toes in a cool room,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 those are more sensitive indicators.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 So if I'm -- I remember you writing that if people use an electric blanket at night,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 you place less value on the basal temperature.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Am I remembering correctly?

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 Yeah, same thing as in a hot, humid climate.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 If you keep the temperature up artificially, even a dead person will be warm.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Oh, well, this is actually bad news for me because I'm in a heated room when I'm doing this.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 My temperature may be even lower.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I think what you're saying is it's more --

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 perhaps more of an art than a science in some respect,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 just because getting an absolute gauge on this is going to be very difficult because there are so many variables.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Am I approximating what you're saying?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Exactly.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 It's the whole function.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 The best single test would be how much oxygen you breathe in and how much carbon dioxide you exhale.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 That's actually showing what's going on chemically.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 And you can't produce a normal amount of carbon dioxide by being overstressed or high in estrogen.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Other things will happen other than producing carbon dioxide as you burn your fuel.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So the old-fashioned 1930s basal metabolic rate by breathing oxygen and blowing out carbon dioxide,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 that was the real thyroid test, and the temperature is just the very rough approximation of how much fuel you're burning.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Where can I go to read more about what you just said?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Is there something I can do at home?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Yeah, my website has several articles about it.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Something else you have to do is notice the changes during the day

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 because low thyroid people typically compensate with stress hormones increasing,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 sometimes mainly adrenaline, sometimes mostly cortisol,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 others including serotonin will increase especially at night.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 Histamine often increases at night.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And all of the stress hormones make your tissue metabolize,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 but not in an energy-producing way but in an energy-wasting way.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And if you take an overdose of cortisol and adrenaline, the adrenaline will make your skin get cold.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 The cortisol will make you break down your muscle tissue and glandular tissue to turn to sugar,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 and that will heat your body up.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 And some people wake up with a 98 or 99-degree temperature,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 and when they eat breakfast by 10 or 11 in the morning,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 their temperature might have fallen to 94 or 95 degrees.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 This explains a great deal for me personally, so I thank you very, very much.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 I don't want to take up any more of your time, but that's been very helpful.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 All right, well, thank you so much for your call.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 You be well.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 We are actually going to get into the whole subject of temperature and pulse measurements

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 and what the differences mean, but it is 7.31,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 and now the engineer is sitting there, and is he going to pitch or was he going to--

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 I thought that the producer was going to pitch, but I'll do a little pitch.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 I'll actually say that thank you, Dr. Peat, because you really do have a nationwide audience.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 I hear people calling in from all over,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 and I would like to put a word out to those people from all over that this is an unusual community radio station,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 and even if you live in Jersey or Missouri or wherever, you may well want to join KMUD,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 and you might want to check out some of our other talk shows

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 because they are all a little different from the mainstream.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 That's why we have them.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 We have a pitcher here in the studio, folks, so let's go ahead.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 Yeah, is this-- live? Can you hear me?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 There we go. Now you can. Wow.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 Yeah, this is Mark, sounds in the sewer.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 Just want to let everybody out there know that we have some premiums available for new members,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 a glass KMUD coffee mug.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 We've got, for renewing members, a 25-year anniversary T-shirt,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 and we've got a couple of nice radios, the Sea Crane Radio.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 I was going to actually-- the Sea Crane Radio used to be called the Zombie Apocalypse Radio,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 but maybe all the zombies actually have deficient thyroid function.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 That could be.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 It's the Deficient Thyroid Function Apocalypse Radio from now on in my book.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 And it's a great radio. It's got the solar power.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 You can power a cell phone off of that thing.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 That's for $120 pledge.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 And we also have an HD radio for $150 pledge.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 And as most people know, or maybe some people, or maybe everybody knows,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 that KMUD does broadcast in HD now, and it sounds awesome.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 And that's, again, for a $150 pledge.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 And, you know, call in and make your pledges.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 As you know, we can't really function too well without them,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 and we certainly do appreciate your listenership and your support.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 So make sure you call in, folks, the numbers 923--

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 3-9-1-1.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Or 1-800-568-3723.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 KMUD rad.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 So the phone call needn't cost you a red cent.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 I want to thank a couple of people here.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Leah LaMatina out of Trinidad came in and donated $50.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Actually, she renewed her membership.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 We also had--what's that?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Oh, okay.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 Well, we also had West Botanical Medicine pledging.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 You weren't supposed to say anything.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 That's okay.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Didn't they mark on there?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Anyway.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Anyway, never mind that.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 I was kidding, of course.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 We're very happy to support our own radio station, folks.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Okay, good.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Well, I'll turn it back over to you, gents.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 All right.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Okay.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Thanks so much for that.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Dr. Peat, okay, so that last caller, that was completely out of the blue,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 completely impromptu.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 So happy they called, and especially from New Jersey.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Talking about temperature and pulses is actually one of the next questions that I had down to ask you

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 during this next 25 minutes.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 The interpretation of a temperature and pulse shot being the questions that I have,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 I understand what you're saying about the metabolic rate,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 peripheral temperatures, sweating, and CO2 versus O2 as being better indicators.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 In terms of what's practical for people to do at home,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 I think the temperature and pulse sheet is the thing that people can get their hands on to see for themselves

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 whether or not they're reaching proper temperature or if they are cold

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 or if their temperatures are dropping.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 So can I just go through a couple of the things that commonly show up in people's temperature and pulse shots

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 and just get you to describe the basic metabolic defect, if you like.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 So if someone has, and I don't see this too often,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 but a high starting temperature in the morning when they're in bed before they get out of bed

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 and then they have the breakfast and the temperature falls.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 The first time I started noticing that was a friend who twice a year

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 had alternated episodes of extreme depression and mania.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 And in the periods when she was giving up sleep, sleeping only two or three hours a night,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 her morning temperatures were extremely high.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 But then after eating something two or three hours later,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 her temperature would fall several degrees.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 And that was during the time when she tended to be manic

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 and be under the influence of too much adrenaline and other excitatory things.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 And so I suggested that she take enough thyroid to get her pulse and temperature to be steadier during the day.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Within a few days, she had stabilized so that her morning temperature was a couple of degrees lower,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 but increased after eating instead of decreasing.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 And since doing that, she stopped having her annual up and down cycles.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Okay. So just on a recap of what you said a little while ago about cold peripheries,

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 so fingers, toes, nose, ears,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 this kind of person that you just mentioned would have cold extremities

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 because adrenaline would be driving that as a vasoconstrictor,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 but yet their core temperature would be high because of cortisol and the stress hormones?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 In general, you have to check your pulse rate at the same time

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 because if your cortisol is extremely high and destroying things at a terrific rate,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 then you're making enough heat to keep your hands and feet warm even.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 But in that situation, your adrenaline is going to be lower to let out the heat through your skin.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 And so if you have a very high temperature and the normal pulse rate

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 and then the temperature falls after you eat, your pulse rate is probably going to get slower still.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Okay. So for a low starting temperature in the morning, so someone's in bed,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 they're taking their temperature and their pulses before they wake and start moving around and generating heat.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 If they have a low starting temperature and that falls after breakfast?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Oh, that's still stress plus hypothyroidism.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 Okay. All right. And then how about if they have a low starting temperature

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 and it doesn't change after breakfast, it stays the same?

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 They probably didn't eat the right things.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 If you get enough sugar in and protein and the essential catalytic nutrients, B vitamins and such,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 then if you have any function of your thyroid gland at all,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 you're going to feed your liver enough that it should just by feeding it sugar,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 it should start producing a little bit of T3, which would warm you.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 Okay. So how about the pulses then?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 If someone's taking their pulse in bed in the morning along with the temperature

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 and they have a low pulse and then that pulse rises after breakfast?

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 That probably means that their T3 is going up from eating some carbohydrate

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 and increasing their general energy so their blood is circulating more.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 And that's something that I've seen most often in women when they're premenstrual

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 and having high estrogen blocking their thyroid.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 They'll get very cold when they get hungry and everything will slow down.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 And then when they eat, they'll warm up and the pulse will increase.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 Okay. Now how about if somebody, again, this is breakfast time and the person's in bed

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 before they move around, if they have a high pulse and then this rises after breakfast?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 Sometimes that happens when they eat eggs without enough carbohydrate.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 If you're already tending to have hypoglycemia, eating eggs will stimulate insulin secretion,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 drop your blood sugar more and cause a surge of adrenaline.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 And it depends on how you feel.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 If you're really increasing your thyroid and warming your metabolism up,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 you'll feel good when the pulse goes up.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 But if you feel like you're about to faint or go into shock,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 that happens from eating too much protein without carbohydrate.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 And that adrenaline makes you shaky then?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 Yeah. And some people wake up cyclically during the night

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 and when I was counseling dieters, there were some very fat people who would wake up.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 One of them woke up every hour during the night

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 and the other one I think was sleeping an hour and a half or so.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 And I got them to set an alarm clock to wake themselves up

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 about five or ten minutes before their expected waking

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 and to eat anything with carbohydrate, milk or juice or even a cracker or something.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 And to do that every hour and within a week,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 they were sleeping through the night and then they were able to start losing weight.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 The stress hormones that raise your temperature and pulse rate around dawn,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 they are also increasing the blood sugar.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 So in diabetics, they call it the dawn phenomenon.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 But it's the result of the stress hormones that rise during the night.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 The darkness itself is causing stress, activating hormones.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 And so in the winter, people are more likely to have disturbed sleep because of long nights.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 And getting extra carbohydrate late in the day can help you sleep longer without those episodes.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Usually it's nightmares waking people up with a pounding heart.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 That's the adrenaline, right?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Yes.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Okay.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 One other quick question and then there is a corner.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 So the last example would be perhaps a high pulse that falls after breakfast.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 That's good.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 That's the carbohydrate lowering the adrenaline.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 And when the temperature goes up and your pulse goes down, that's what breakfast should do.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Okay.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Let's take this next caller.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 You're on the air.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 Hi, what a great show.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 And before I ask my question, I'd just like to say to the audience, if you love KMUD,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 call 707-923-3911 or 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 And to decode KMUD-RAD, look at your dial and the decoder ring is right there.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 I always appreciate what you do and this show is one of my favorites.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 My question, Dr. Peat, and if it's a little too far, maybe it's in another program,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 is about the approaching secretion of radiation plume.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 I heard Dr. Helen Caldicott discussing recently on Coast to Coast AM,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 the coming plumes to Alaska around March and possibly the Pacific Northwest around July,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 June, July, and then further down the coast, subsequent to that,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 so maybe late summer, early fall of next year.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 I'm sorry, of this COVID-19 that would actually be next year at this point.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 So it could be as much as up to a year from now, but maybe less.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 And my question goes to what are the effects of radiation,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 since you mentioned that as a special question at the beginning of the program,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 along the lines of the disease you mentioned earlier, or what kind of manifest?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 Does it mimic that disease that starts with an H or does it come in other ways?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 And seaweed, what should we do to prevent it as far as iodine-ization of the thyroid?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 I want you to go and listen to the response on air.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 And again, thank you so much.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 1-800-CANADRAB or 9233-911 in the 707 area.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 So please donate to this station.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Keep this great show going.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 Okay, thank you for that.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 I do want to say that me personally hearing it, there's quite a bit of a sound of garble,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 but I did hear the very first part of it was the concern with the radiation,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 oceanic radiation coming this way to the coast between the middle to the end of next year.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Dr. Peate, did you hear what that caller was saying?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Part of it was blurred, but basically, you're wondering what to do for radiation exposure.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 Right, I think so, yeah, basically.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 Yeah, my first newsletter 30-some years ago was on radiation defense,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 and I read everything that was available at that time regarding protecting against radiation

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 and repairing the damage.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 And the research since then has pretty much confirmed what was available then,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 that keeping your metabolic rate up accelerates the repair process faster than the injury.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 And progesterone decreases the injury.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Thyroid increases the rate of repair.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 And all kinds of stress create signals from the injured cells that travel through the rest of your body.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 And so no matter if your face is x-rayed by a dentist, your whole body,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 the gonads are going to be affected by these substances emitted by the injured cells.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 So in the 1950s, Russian researchers had noticed that total body radiation had an estrogenic effect,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 would cause animals to go into estrus.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 And that was blamed generally on causing the pituitary hormones to be activated,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 because people could do it just by irradiating the head.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 But the Russian researchers irradiated the animal's foot and produced the same whole body estrogenic effect,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 showing that estrogen and radiation are producing these toxins that communicate to all the cells of the body.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 And that's why thyroid and progesterone have a basic protective effect against radiation.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 But the whole nutritional support system, magnesium is the element that's most closely involved in repairing

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 radiation damage after your thyroid is activated.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 The cells take up magnesium and enzymes are activated that do the repair process

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 when you have adequate magnesium with your thyroid.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
 And that would be from the green leafy broths that you recommend.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 Yeah.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 So whether it's chard or kale, dark green leafy broths are pretty rich in magnesium.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, I guess we can just put it out there again quickly if any other callers are in the air.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 It's KMUDRAD is the toll-free number, 1-800-568-3723, or the number if you live in the area is 923-3911.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 So my other questions that I wanted to put to you about the temperature and the pulses,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 with reference to temperature and pulses,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 are morning changes reflective of a similar metabolism seen in the lunchtime temperature and pulses?

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 Yeah, if your temperature hasn't stabilized by 10 or 11 in the morning, a low thyroid person will often,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 especially a woman with high estrogen and low progesterone,

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 their temperature and pulse rate might both fall before lunch,

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 or they might have an adrenaline attack and have a shock sensation with a fast, weak pulse.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 And so the effect of feeding, you can interpret it the same for lunch or breakfast.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 So, and how about if the temperature doesn't reach 98.6 or the pulse never gets over 70 in the mid-afternoon?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 How would you view that?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Well, people have their chronic adaptation and some people can stay very well at those average numbers,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 but on average, people have the greatest ability to resist stress and recuperate from injury

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 if their temperature is a little above average and their pulse rate is a little above average.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 So your health can be very good for most of your life,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 but you will have more resilience if your metabolic rate is higher.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 Okay, well, that was my last question.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 If the temperature is higher than 98.6 in the afternoon and the pulse is over 100.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 The brain and the immune system, for example,

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 the optimum temperature seems to be around 101, maybe even a little higher.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 And I've also mentioned you, I've also remember you mentioning that the immune system is less than,

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 if you want to say the immune system as an organism functioning at 100% being optimal,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 if your temperature doesn't reach 98.6, you are not running at 100% of your immune ability.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 Probably.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 And usually you can see some evidence in your blood tests,

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 such as unnecessarily high TSH or other pituitary hormones,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 indicating that you're driving your endocrine system and immune system unnecessarily hard.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 When things are running very smoothly on the cellular level,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 your endocrine system and immune system don't have to do very much.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 The tissue cells take care of things all by themselves.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 Okay, well, we do have another caller, so I want to make sure this caller gets an opportunity to...

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 You're on the air?

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 Hello.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 Hi, love the show, which is interesting to me because I have a completely unrelated question,

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 but my mother has thyroid issues and I have temperature issues,

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 so I've been intently paying attention to your discussion.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 Can I just ask you where you're calling from?

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 It's my first time listening to the show.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 Can I just ask you where you're calling from, incidentally? I'm sorry to butt in.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 I'm sorry?

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 Can I just quickly ask you where you're calling from?

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 Yeah, I'm calling from Redway.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 Oh, okay, just down the road.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 Carry on.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 So I just recently... I've always been a really light sleeper,

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 and I recently became hip to the idea that taking valerian tincture can improve one's ability to relax,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 fall asleep, and stay asleep through the night.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 And I've grabbed myself a little bottle down at Chautauqua, and I've been taking it,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 and I've found that it's really, really helpful.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 My brother, who also has had problems falling asleep and staying asleep,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 has been taking it with me, and we're really-- it's definitely improving our sleeping patterns.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 And I was just wondering if you know of any possibility of developing a dependence on valerian

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 or if it's counterindicated for any other medications

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 or if you know anything about that being a problem in practice.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 No. Well, I'll put it this way.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 I know valerian works on GABA channels,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 and I'm sure Dr. Peat will know exactly what I'm saying when I mention GABA channels.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 But here's the thing.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 Some people-- and it's rare-- but some people get very stimulated by valerian.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 The majority of people do find a good benefit from it,

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 and it does shut off that internal dialogue that keeps people awake when they sit and talk to themselves,

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 and especially if people wake in the early hours.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 But I know Dr. Peat's interpretation of any kind of insomnia would generally be down to high adrenaline

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 or higher than normal adrenaline, keeping people from entering a deep, restful sleep.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 So, Dr. Peat, what do you think about valerian working on GABA channels

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 and the mechanism behind insomnia?

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Well, that mechanism is very good.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 It's a very safe drug, but I think that using a drug of that sort, it's protective,

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 but it is potentially habit-forming.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 Besides my own experience when I took thyroid, being able to relax and sleep soundly,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 on one of my trips talking to doctors and such,

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 I ran into a doctor who looked horrible, said he hadn't slept for three nights.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 I mentioned my experience with thyroid and gave him 10 micrograms of Cytomel,

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 and the next night at my talk, he pulled me aside before introducing me

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 and said, "That stuff's better than morphine."

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 Dr. Peat, I don't want to cut you short,

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 but I just want to say that it is very nearly four minutes to the top of the hour.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 So, unfortunately, I'd want to cut you short here

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 and just thank you very much for being on the radio show,

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 and that will give me plenty of time to tell people how to find you and more about you.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 So, thanks so much for joining us tonight.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 Okay, so Dr. Raymond Peat has a pretty extensive website

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 with an exhaustive list of researched, scientific-based articles,

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 fully referenced on many different conditions, disorders,

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 and a lot of what he is espousing is very alternative,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 but it's very scientifically backed.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 So, it's not completely made up at all.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 It's science that's been buried, if you like,

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 and it's not really being listened to too much.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 But a lot of what he has said has been vindicated very recently.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 I just want to quickly mention the whole thing about vitamin D in England

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 and the British Medical Journal stating that the saturated fats were now no longer the bad guys

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 and that the polyunsaturates, which is what Dr. Peat has always said,

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 are actually the cause of inflammation and disease,

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 and they're having a complete rethink on the whole saturated fat thing.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 Again, with the vitamin D, it's a very good, helpful, protective molecule.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 So, yeah, Raymond Peat's website is www.raypeat.com.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Go check him out.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 And we can also be reached Monday through Friday during normal business hours.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 And our toll-free number is, you know I hardly ever use it,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 it's 1-888-926-4372.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 We can be reached for consultations any time or for further information during normal business hours.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 So, two minutes or thereabouts before the top of the hour, KMUD is the station that you heard this on.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 It's a great alternative station.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 It's a beacon in the dark, folks.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 It's like a red light on a hill.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 And unless you want to just hear standard radio stations giving standard information out,

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 help support this radio station, folks, because it means a lot.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 And especially in this very tight-knit community,

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 I would all hope that the people here value it enough to put their hands in their pockets

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 and give them some money to make sure that we all keep going on into the next year.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:26.000
 Anyway, until December, third Friday of December, as always, the third Friday of every month,

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 have a great night.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 Enjoy this wonderful fall before we get the imminent rain.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
