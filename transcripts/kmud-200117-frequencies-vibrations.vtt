00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.440
 Well welcome to this month's Ask Your Rev Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.520
 Well it's 2020 folks. It's going to be a fantastic decade. I don't know about you but I'm looking

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.200
 forward to 2020. It's going to be a good year. Okay so you're listening to Ask Your Rev Doctor

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.120
 KMU DeGalbraithville 91.1 FM. From 7 30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:31.280
 to call in with any questions related to this month's subject of vibrations, frequencies, and

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.560
 cell repair and regeneration through sound and vibration. The program is a live program. Like I

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.760
 said from 7 30 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock we'll open up the phone lines for people to call

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:52.720
 in. Dr. Raymond Peat, PhD is joining us again and as he has done for the last 10 years I think now

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.680
 is a wealth of knowledge and whilst I know he doesn't express himself as a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:08.640
 what would you call it an expert on sound he knows enough about a lot of different things that I know

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.920
 he can weigh in on the subject of some of the most interesting and recent 2019 and 2020 publications

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.080
 based on research that is accessible through the PubMed website being done in a very interesting

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.640
 field of medicine and some of the uses for excuse me for sound and electrofrequency magnetic

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:40.160
 spectrum type vibration is used in the treatment of cancer so we've got an interesting article to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.000
 open up a little bit later on. So just by way of introducing the show my name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 I run a business called Western Botanical Medicine. I've been a naturopathic doctor here for 23 years.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.680
 We manufacture our own range of medicinal herb extracts and deal with a lot of people all over

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.200
 the nation consulting about a wide range of health conditions and has for the last 10 or just over

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.280
 years been very much working with Dr. Peat to get his insight onto what I thought was the way things

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.240
 were when I graduated in 1999. I did a four-year degree in herbal medicine in England after a

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.520
 three-year degree in botany and was taught by medical doctors and physiologists and endocrinologists

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.680
 and pathologists and they all came from City Hospital in London and various other medical

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.360
 institutions and were basically teaching the same kind of dogma if you like and I know Dr. Peat and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.200
 I have opened up quite a few discussions based around the errant recapitulation of supposed facts

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:59.120
 of which Dr. Peat is very able to expand and show the defects in the understanding and the dogma

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.360
 which has unfortunately guided medical decision medical technology. But anyway without further

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.320
 ado let's just see if Dr. Peat's with us. Dr. Peat you on? Yeah. Great well thanks so much for joining

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:18.000
 us in this next decade. I want to put the question to you. I hope you'll be around for another decade.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.600
 Yeah good good. Okay so for those of you perhaps have never listened to the show before you've not

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.960
 heard Dr. Peat. Dr. Peat would you just outline your professional and academic background for

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.880
 people to understand where you're coming from? I had a master's degree in humanities and after

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.840
 about 10 years went back for a PhD in biology University of Oregon 1972

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:55.520
 on reproductive aging was my dissertation topic. Okay so reproductive aging so you've been pretty

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.000
 intimately associated with all of the factors around reproduction and organized cell growth

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.920
 to maximize the organism's potential. I know having worked with you especially surrounding

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.560
 things like you know neonatal health, children's health and the kind of foods. You're very much a

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.480
 food-based scientist in terms of not buying into the fads of all the things that are thrown at us

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.320
 through supplements but you're very much a kind of a very natural kind of approach to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.760
 treating disease and I know you don't really generally advocate a lot of supplements but I

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.480
 know that progesterone is one of your pets if you like having you probably studied that a lot

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.720
 during your PhD in terms of its use as a factor in organized cell growth and

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.600
 anti-inflammatory processes. Incidentally some of my experiments had to do with the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.760
 electrical behavior of tissue under the influence of progesterone, estrogen, prostaglandins and so

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.800
 on. Interesting okay so we're going to get into that so I don't know let's just hold that thought

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.520
 for a second so I think I'm hopefully going to be able to prime you to bring that back up again but

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.880
 you've always mentioned and this is kind of a little bit off the side of the topic thrust as

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.640
 it were but you've always mentioned estrogen as being an excitotoxic molecule and unfortunately

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.640
 most women who are listening or perhaps maybe the more educated ones that understand a little bit

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.760
 more about what you've taught over the last 30 or 40 years probably understand estrogen as being a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.960
 female hormone and you know the whole hormone replacement therapy thing really pushed it as a

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:58.240
 pro-life hormone you know they want to say that'll help your bone thinning stabilize it's good for

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.000
 osteoporosis as it were and it's good for degenerative conditions when actually it's a

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.360
 very hormone that is based and implicated in inflammation and excitotoxicity. So I was very

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.640
 excited to see the articles when I was looking for the material for today or to this evening's talk

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:30.960
 basing it on sound vibration cell signaling I was going to get I'm going to get into a little bit

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.400
 later on to get into the kind of tuning forks resonant frequencies a little bit about Rife

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.400
 although I know you've already said that you you know you found it interesting but you don't know

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.960
 too much on it so I'm not asking you to be an expert or anything on that but whilst I was looking

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:56.400
 through the paperwork I saw a very interesting article on breast cancer and the journal article

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.400
 actually wasn't one of the newer ones but most of what I saw with sound and vibrations were actually

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.800
 in 2019 and 2020 publications so I was like I was pretty blown away and I think this is becoming

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:18.400
 another resurging subject for people with science and academia are in the forefront to actually

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.080
 prove this now as being a modality it's a little bit like the whole Tesla battery car thing you

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.120
 know coming into fruition hopefully to put the whole fossil fuel thing firmly under the

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.840
 under the rug and bring forward a new clean technology but I find a lot of the articles

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.120
 that I see on PubMed as much as I know you've said in the past they are not exactly the best

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.040
 places to go and there's a lot of corruption there obviously in any medical research depending

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.960
 on who's funding it but very interesting to find in this age that we're in and definitely with the

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.160
 internet and computers at the forefront of our ability to search and index things that people

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.360
 are actually picking up a lot of these things that would have been just put down to new age

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:08.160
 just crystal dangling and you know just not being given any scientific foundation upon which to voice

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:16.800
 their findings but most of what I saw then in 2019 was fairly fairly pretty cool research that's

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.320
 being done on things that I'm very happy to see so this one particular article even though it was a

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.400
 2013 article the others that I'd like to cover with you as we go through this mainly 2019 and

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.920
 2020 documents and I'll give people a link for these people want to go and search these themselves

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:42.800
 to find out what we're talking about but this 2013 one it was titled low intensity and frequency

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:50.960
 pulsed electromagnetic field selectively impair breast cancer cell viability so this was a an

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.680
 article of which the abstracts just go through the introduction methods results in conclusion

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:04.240
 but essentially they were saying that this pulse electromagnetic field therapy was a very good

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.200
 treatment for breast cancer that didn't affect normal tissues and it was non-invasive obviously

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.240
 and could be potentially combined with existing anti-cancer treatments now I think they have to

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:23.440
 put that in there anyway as a kind of a caveat to not displace the conventional treatment because

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.600
 I think that's the dominant paradigm and but just to say that actually they found a good reduction

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.400
 in breast cancer growth using these pulse frequencies and hopefully we'll get into this

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:45.600
 in a little bit as we go on but do you have anything to add to what was used here as a kind of

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:53.920
 low intensity low frequency vibrational output that directly affected these cells

00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:02.720
 they weren't in that experiment paying attention to the effects of frequency so it was just

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:14.720
 really giving some kind of excitation to the cells but other people like the reif tradition

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:23.440
 have been trying to identify particular frequencies that are more effective at either

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:33.120
 exciting or calming the cells in the 60s people were trying to use direct current to control

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 cancer growth professor Johns Hopkins published an article saying that he had regressed mouse

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.800
 mammary tumors just using the application of direct current polarization

00:10:50.800 --> 00:11:01.360
 so just applying current but not a not not not not pulsing okay it's known that cancer

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:10.800
 is electrically excited it's like a wound that is stuck in an electrically excited

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:20.880
 at negatively charged condition okay and just I mean for the as much as much death and morbidity

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.760
 that cancer is responsible for cancer cells are not exactly strong they're pretty weak aren't

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:33.040
 they they are very fragile in a lot of ways and so I think some of the some of the work that's

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:42.400
 been done either vibrational or electrically certainly has validity in disrupting that cell

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.720
 stability because they don't particularly have very stable membranes in terms of the normal

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.400
 architecture of the cell and being electrically charged and excited I think makes them more

00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:03.760
 susceptible to vibrating energy fields yeah such as in that experiment okay so what do you

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:11.360
 when I started looking at this I saw that most of the articles that I pulled out that I want to just

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:17.840
 go through with you using this pulsed electromagnetic fields most of these and they

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:24.000
 were always obviously because that's how we do it now quoting these in hertz whereas before

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.760
 you know 50 100 years ago they were called maybe a little bit earlier than that even they were

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.760
 calling them cycles per second before they termed it hertz and before that they didn't even really

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.520
 understand or have a concept of the second before about 1830 which I found that was quite interesting

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:49.360
 that most time is well originally measured by the sun or the passage of the sun and that's how

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.840
 people measured time given that that's a celestial thing that it transcends our earthly

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:05.280
 fixation on the planet but that once they had devised this method for measuring time and then

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:12.880
 came up with the second then the cycles per second and the hertz became a scientific if you like

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:20.800
 valid measurement of frequency and then the whole industry if you like sprung up around this and then

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:29.040
 getting later on into self-agio tuning and what most musicians that I've spoken to that said oh

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.320
 yeah we just tuned to 440 hertz now and it's it's not the way it was and if you really like

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:42.480
 gregorian music or baroque music it was definitely not 440 would have been 432 hertz and how

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:48.080
 there's a subtle change in that but getting back to frequencies and how

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:57.200
 a specific frequency can affect a cell given that we are 90 something plus percent water

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.920
 all of the molecules in our body and not even the watery ones even the more kind of

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:12.240
 solid cells have membranes that are fluid and can and do respond very much to vibration and

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:20.320
 that's something that we have just been part of you know growing up and evolving and you know

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.320
 we're subjected to the sun's ultraviolet and infrared and and all those spectrums that we

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.280
 kind of live with and I think in going through some of the other discussion I wanted to hopefully

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:41.120
 bring bring your knowledge out on with the current deployment of 5g and how there is all these you

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.920
 know fairly worldwide protests about 5g and then pulling down 5g towers and this you know having to

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:55.200
 bring out these big committees to discuss this because there's such an outrage at what could

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 potentially be a very disruptive technology in some ways that we are very much organismic and

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:11.360
 sensitive to light and vibration like being frequency and all of these things whether it's

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.800
 photons of light or it's energy whether this energy is high energy obviously the radiation

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:23.760
 which is very bad for us but there's very low frequency electromagnetic fields are even lower

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:31.360
 than the kind of background they say that the earth kind of resonates at about eight I think

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:39.040
 it's eight just under just under eight hertz they were using frequencies between one one and eighty

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.600
 I think and some of these were more more down in the sort of nines tens twelves thirteen and fourteen

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.600
 hertz and actually showing that people were getting benefit from this and there's a whole

00:15:53.600 --> 00:16:00.240
 breast cancer article introduction you was you were saying again that they weren't

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:11.760
 so much focusing on the frequency of it or they weren't yeah in the 60s the doctrine there are

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:20.800
 still people arguing that cell phones aren't causing brain damage or cancer and so on but

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:30.000
 that argument that cells are pretty immune to various frequencies started back in the late 40s

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.160
 when radar was accidentally killing people who stood in front of the radar antenna

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:50.880
 and the authority opinion at that time was that it was only by overheating your brain or other

00:16:50.880 --> 00:17:00.720
 organs that electromagnetic injury could harm you and in the 1960s that was the dogma that neither

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:12.160
 sound nor electromagnetic energy below a certain frequency and energy could have any effect on the

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:21.600
 units of the cell such as chromosomes or mitochondria and a person was working with

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:35.120
 muscle cells in culture and measuring the activity of ATPase which controls the disposition of

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:43.360
 energy in the cell and they found that I think was the pitch of 440 which was very powerful

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:52.240
 at activating that muscle enzyme and they showed that the conventional theory of the cell

00:17:52.240 --> 00:18:05.760
 was impossible for that low frequency moderately low energy that the dogma says that the energy

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:17.120
 concentration per micron or any unit of space is too low to do such things as causing chemical

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:25.840
 changes but the person demonstrating the effect showed that in effect the cell structure was

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:37.040
 acting as an antenna concentrating gathering energy from several microns of space and

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:45.280
 concentrating it so that it could act on the enzyme that's the essential difference at that time

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:54.000
 the conventional opinion was that it would be impossible to make a magnetic resonance

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.960
 imaging device because of that same idea that the cell is organized randomly

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:11.600
 but it took the interaction between Gilbert Ling and his organized water explanation of cell

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:22.880
 function and Raymond Damadian who realized that if Gilbert Ling was right about how water behaves

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:33.360
 so you can make pictures of the water in cells electromagnetically and so his invention of the

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:46.960
 MRI device really changed the possibility of explaining cell function. Okay all right so

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.880
 you mentioned I just want to quickly put this up there before I just let people know how to

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.280
 call into the show yeah you mentioned that in the 50s and 60s that was happening and that just

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.480
 just triggered me to think about all the bomb testing and how they were trying to tell us all

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.640
 that the atomic bombs were completely harmless and how people could stand in front of them and

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.160
 they wouldn't get any negative effects from it so they were saying the very same thing about the low

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.720
 frequency low energy although the atomic bomb is the opposite end of the spectrum it was very high

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.680
 intensity gamma rays and it was very very damaging but they really wanted us to try and cover that

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.880
 whole thing up the whole radiation industry and that everything that we've got now from x-rays to

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:30.000
 PET scans and CAT scans has all come from that and it's still being covered covered up and just

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.520
 made harmless as it were. Yeah that's part of the reason that they deny that Gilbert Ling

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:42.320
 had an immaculate description of the cell because if his picture of the cell is right

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:50.160
 then radiation electromagnetic energy and so on is very relevant to health function.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:56.640
 Okay let me just let people know how to reach us here so you're listening to ask your Dr.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:03.040
 K. M. D. Garboville 91.1 FM the number here from 7 30 on if you'd like to call him the questions

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:10.400
 are related or unrelated to the evening subject of vibration cell signaling and everything

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:19.840
 surrounding sound and vibration as a modality for treatment the number here is 707 923 3911.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:32.400
 So again 707 923 3911. Okay so Dr. Peat that the first article then I read out the breast cancer

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:40.080
 treatment selectively damaging breast cancer cells selectively leaving regular tissue unchanged

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.240
 um was done with a frequency from 20 to 50 hertz and um they used 30 to 90 minute exposures

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:55.040
 and said that these were the optimum parameters for selective cancer cell killing activity so

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.400
 that was pretty interesting I don't know how much I didn't look at cell um cell death from

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.640
 breast cancer any further because I was looking at lots of different um types of treatment to

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:14.400
 different types of pathology that would be mitigated through sound the next one I was

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.800
 going to ask you about was some bone regeneration I found a lot of um a lot of different abstracts

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.440
 and articles um supporting this now um one of them here 2019 article in the journal of clinical

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.360
 medicine was translational insights into extremely low frequency pulse electromagnetic fields for

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.200
 bone regeneration after trauma and orthopedic surgery now if you open the link up I'm not

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.560
 saying you have it but if people want to find out what these are when you open the link up

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:49.680
 there's lots of information there showing how people with different traumas and surgeries that

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:57.040
 were done were treated with sound and how this improved osteoblastic activity so the actual

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.680
 what we understand what I understand at least at this point in time about bone building and bone

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:08.800
 breaking um organ organs within the bone so the osteoblast build it and the osteoclast break it

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.400
 down for remodeling um that this sound actually had a very specific effect on the osteoblast to

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:21.440
 improve bone mineralization and bone formation and structure so that was pretty interesting

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:26.800
 another 2019 document have you have you heard of um I don't know this kind of probably plays

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:31.920
 a little bit into ultrasound but I'm not actually sure of the frequencies that ultrasound works at

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:40.480
 the um for treating uh things they use of anything from 50,000 to 100,000

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:49.520
 but the imaging is around a million cycles per second 50,000 to 100,000 hertz um yeah that

00:23:50.080 --> 00:24:00.480
 is a very effective uh wound treatment around I think 1970 or earlier someone discovered that

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:09.920
 putting ultrasound on infected tonsils caused them to recover and become normal uninflamed

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:19.520
 and that gradually over the next 10 or 20 years they found that bone healing was accelerated

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:25.280
 and soft tissue wound healing was accelerated similar to what happened in the tonsil

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:37.120
 and part of that is thought to be the activation of of cell regenerating

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:44.800
 signals such as nitric oxide and estrogen that accelerate stem cell growth and

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:55.280
 multiplication the early stages of healing yeah okay so um if I just I quickly actually

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.480
 had this article here in front of me so I just wanted to it's like I said it's a 2019 article

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:08.160
 and they said that here um being used in the treatment of acute bone fractures

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:15.520
 and bone fracture non-unions osteotomies spinal fusion osteoporosis and osteoarthritis

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.480
 and saying that these studies favored the use of extremely low frequency pulse electromagnetic

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:30.880
 fields and saying that they wanted to establish indication-oriented treatment regimens and to

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.640
 understand more the underlying mechanisms in the sense of the cell pathways and the events that

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:41.280
 are triggered so some of the other other articles that I've got that I want to just so outline here

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:48.640
 break down in pretty fine detail exactly what pathways these things are affecting and people

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:55.040
 that are listening probably recognize the words interleukin prostaglandins and these other

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:04.480
 signals of excitation and toxicity and inflammation a lot of what was happening with this sound was

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.160
 that it was blocking a lot of what we understand as these pro-inflammatory pathways and allowing

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:16.960
 either free radical quenching of this kind of excited state during inflammation and trauma

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.120
 or was having another indirect anti-inflammatory effect.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:35.840
 The imaging of bone density or osteoporosis can be done with ultrasound you can tell the strength

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:45.280
 of a bone as well as its density if you use ultrasound and since ultrasound stimulates

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:54.560
 bone repair it would be reasonable if doctors would evaluate aging women's bones using ultrasound

00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:02.480
 but they x-ray them and x-rays actually weaken the bone and accelerate osteoporosis so

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:11.440
 it would be a good change of technology to use to switch over to ultrasound. A friend of mine who

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:22.080
 was for a year or more had had liver enzyme elevation and signs of hepatitis or developing

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:30.880
 cirrhosis had a very prolonged ultrasound examination of her liver and a couple of weeks

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:39.680
 later went back for another exam and her liver had completely recovered. I suspect it was from that

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:48.800
 very half an hour or so of looking around with an ultrasound imaging device.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:58.240
 The mechanism by which that would have had the an anti-inflammatory effect I guess if we just

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.880
 look at something like hepatitis as an inflammation of the hepatocytes,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:11.360
 inflammation quenching activity then of ultrasound would be a relative positive mechanism by which

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.080
 that could happen. I know you've mentioned in the past that ultrasound is just generally a good

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:25.200
 healing modality whether it's for bones or tissue, soft tissue or you know even yeah actually let's

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.520
 have a look here. I think the only place it shouldn't be used is around the head because

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:40.640
 tends to emulsify tissue if it's too energetic and you don't want emulsified brain cells.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.880
 No okay we do have somebody who has called in at this point in time so let's just begin

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.240
 this decades questioning with this next caller. Caller you're on the air where you're from and

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:57.600
 what's your question? Hi I'm from Texas and I have two questions. Yeah go ahead. One do you think

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:03.920
 meditation is safe if you're trying to lower breathing rate and increase CO2 or can it have

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.840
 bad effects like increasing serotonin or something like that? Dr. Peat meditation obviously we all

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.960
 think about meditation as being relaxing, calm, innovative, regenerating but what the gentleman

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:26.880
 saying about CO2? I think most people tend to hyperventilate too much and if you can just relax

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:34.800
 and stop hyperventilating you retain more CO2 and that has an anti-inflammatory everywhere

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.560
 everywhere in the body. So you'd advocate meditation correct? Yeah. Yeah definitely.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.880
 Okay cool I think you had two questions that was the first one or? Yeah that was the first one and

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.840
 do you know what could help to reduce the need for sleep aside from increasing CO2 because that

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.960
 basically helps everything. Did you catch that Dr. Peat? I missed. No not the whole. Yeah say

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.960
 that again please. Do you know what things could help to reduce the need for sleep? Oh to reduce

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:12.240
 the need for sleep. Oh yeah. Well how much sleep are you getting and what do you want to reduce it to?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:18.240
 Because I know Dr. Peat definitely advocates a good 10 hours.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:31.040
 Oh yeah if you're not getting in the deepest phase of sleep called slow wave sleep or deep sleep

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:40.320
 your tissue isn't being repaired adequately and so you need more hours of it and so if you do

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:47.840
 things that will deepen your sleep then you can reduce it to the normal six to eight and a half

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:57.200
 hours and thyroid hormone and vitamin D are two of the most important things for maintaining

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:07.840
 deep sleep. Okay and can vitamin D increase serotonin and worsen sleep or is it just a

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:15.680
 matter of getting calcium to counter that? Yeah serotonin and histamine are both brain

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:24.560
 excitatory signals and that's why antihistamines are used for improving sleep. They're

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:33.680
 both antiserotonin and antihistamine drugs do improve sleep but you can do the same thing

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:43.840
 with good nutrition lots of calcium, vitamin D and thyroid. Okay thank you so much. Thank you.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.920
 Okay now some antihistamines obviously are sleep inducing correct because they purposely make these

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:57.280
 non-drowsy producing antihistamines. Do you think there's any difference in the mechanism by which

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:10.880
 they're being? Well histamine is basically an inflammation signal and insomnia you are having

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:19.600
 in effect an inflamed brain and you can quiet it by getting the energy production up with thyroid

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:28.240
 and sugar and all of the nutrients but the antihistamine chemicals are everything that

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:38.640
 works in a different direction from adrenaline. Adrenaline is antihistamine but it is also

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:47.280
 excitatory and so insomnia usually involves both adrenaline and antihistamine. The adrenaline is

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:54.320
 attempting to turn off the histamine but if you get your energy up you turn off both of them and

00:32:54.320 --> 00:33:02.320
 let the brain relax. Right now so let's be clear about that so relax and relaxation is not negative

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:07.040
 I just want to make sure people understand this when you say you it allows your brain to relax

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.040
 that's exactly what thyroid hormone will do through the correct utilization of sugar and then when you

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:16.080
 said that during the night time is when most inflammation of the brain will happen and this

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:22.880
 is because of a lowered energy state adequate thyroid and adequate sugars prior to sleep or

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:29.520
 in the post-pre six hours to sleep and or during the night time will keep those inflammatory

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:37.920
 mediators down and reduce that inflammation and most aging changes occurring during the hours of

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.880
 sleep and darkness. Yeah because you said darkness is not good for you obviously it's something we

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.160
 can't avoid perhaps if we're in bed at night time with the lights off in a dark place but

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:52.560
 the dark is not good for us the light is actually what's very energetically stimulating for us and

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.320
 supportive etc. Okay we have another caller on the air so let's get this next caller on the air

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:04.000
 where you from caller and what's your question? Hi I'm from McKinleyville. Hey what's your question?

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:14.320
 Well I have a question about um infrasound uh we were just um embattled with a wind factory

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:22.640
 that proposed a whole bunch of uh wind power turbines and the uh proponent

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.440
 um denied that there was any effect to what's called infrasound the sound produced by these

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.760
 turbines that are below audible range and I'm wondering if you have any thoughts or information

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:45.040
 regarding biological effects of of infrasound. I think cell culture gives an insight to what might

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:54.000
 be happening uh the infrasound frequencies are something around 50 per second 30 to 30 per

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 second or even as low as 10 per second but if you're growing cells in culture that they always

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:15.040
 lose some of their uh properties that they had in in situ in the organism and one of the tricks to

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:22.560
 make cell culture more lifelike is to give it some kind of pulsation because

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:30.240
 cell physiology depends on the fact that the blood is rhythmically pulsing through the system

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:45.520
 and the pulse rate is in the intrasonic frequency and there are many other frequencies that

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:55.280
 every cell in the body normally receives stimulation nervous pulses as well as blood

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:04.240
 heart heartbeat pulsations. So thank you I take from that then you would expect there to be

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:11.920
 physiological effects from a constant infrasound. Yeah I don't know that anyone has clearly

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:22.880
 demonstrated it but you can use equivalent pulsations to show that you are changing the

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:29.760
 cell physiology in vitro. Thank you very much. Yeah thanks for your call interesting question

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:36.320
 I know there's definitely been protest groups that have sprung up around wind farm sites and

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:42.480
 potential wind farm sites I know England and parts of Norfolk in the east east of the country there

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.840
 have had a fair amount of wind farms because it's so flat and so windy but yeah interesting

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.440
 question about infrasounds well thanks for explaining that Dr. Peat well done okay the

00:36:53.440 --> 00:37:00.400
 number here if you live in the area is 707 923 3911 the lines are open now until the end of the

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:06.160
 show at eight o'clock Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us on the show and we're discussing vibrations

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.920
 cell signaling resonant harmonies and healing frequencies although we haven't really got into

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:18.080
 too much of that at this point in time but very interesting questions anyway good Dr. Peat

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:25.600
 before the next caller comes in I'm sure there'll be some more callers but I wanted to just bring

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:32.320
 out some of the parameters in which these 20 20 this is a 2020 article here so it's very new very

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:42.000
 current and I think all the time there are more and more descriptive processes to explain how

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.560
 and I think scientists basically are committed to needing to explain in full detail and I think

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.720
 that's great because I mean with detail comes disclosure with disclosure comes the possibility

00:37:52.720 --> 00:38:01.200
 of reaching some novel novel idea that might bring us into a 20th 21st century appreciation

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.720
 of good health rather than the old paradigm of radiation and cutting things out and really not

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.680
 recovering very well actually before I start I think the lights have started flashing here so

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.760
 let's make sure that we don't cut people off yeah we've got one more call it's a caller you're on

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:24.640
 the air and where you from what's your question hi I'm from Berkeley um I have a an appointment

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:33.760
 next week to start my interferon for my hepatitis C but I had a very thorough ultrasound on my liver

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:39.840
 to find that out so should I ask them if I don't need the hepatitis C I don't want to go through

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:47.200
 the interferon he said interferon are they still the ultrasound would cure me well I guess first

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:53.760
 things first um they still use I didn't think I thought they'd stopped years ago three or five

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.160
 years ago using interferon because it was so brutal okay then I don't know what they're

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.640
 going to give me I don't know what the treatment is I'm going to find out on on next week yeah I

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:07.680
 can't imagine it's interferon but Dr. Peat I know what you're saying here about ultrasound and

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:19.920
 hepatitis and uh you want to speak to that oh not not in a short time like this okay uh have you

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.480
 the only thing I think I would say to the person here that's called in about this uh potentially

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:30.480
 uh I don't know how severe your hepatitis is what parameters they've used to assess how much damage

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:35.680
 you may or may not have received I know people are so different in their presentations some people

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.320
 just don't even know they've got it don't their labs look fine they feel fine some people are

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:46.080
 crippled with it um so I don't know about your situation I think uh what I would say to you is

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:53.440
 that if your blood work doesn't look bad and you don't feel bad and you are relatively old

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.400
 sounds to me like you're dealing with it okay but it's uh you know kind of personal question

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:04.720
 they'll be asking you about your previous labs your state of health etc to make a um make a

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:16.160
 valid call on what you would best do okay I'm 60 years old was that 60 or 50 60 okay yeah all right

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:22.240
 and do you know what your lab values for your inflammatory markers are for your AFP no I have

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:28.960
 I have no idea they just said it wasn't I didn't it wasn't very bad yeah yeah it's um you know it's

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:34.080
 a very personal call uh I know people have gone both routes unfortunately I know people that have

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.840
 had uh they had the old interfere on treatment uh they failed it uh they wound up actually with

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:45.920
 cirrhosis portal hypertension they died from esophageal variceal bleeding um and it was

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.400
 terrible I know other people that have had hepatitis c for 50 years and they're absolutely

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:56.480
 fine uh even though they've got high liver enzymes which seem to implicate them in liver inflammation

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.400
 and damage and I know people that have got hepatitis they've got perfectly normal enzymes

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:07.200
 so it's a very widely presenting uh disease we want to call it a disease and I know Dr. Peat

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.160
 you're almost on the fence as to whether or not it's actually a virus or whether it's actually

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:23.440
 RNA that's leaked from cells from prior traumas yeah I think the test to identify it

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:34.320
 has done more harm than the virus itself because of of the kind of desperate attitude that they

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:41.360
 take with things like interferon I think people who probably wouldn't have had any

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:46.720
 any problem if it hadn't been diagnosed have been injured by some of the treatments they get

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:53.440
 actually on the point on the point of this subject I know years back when I'd question

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:58.160
 you for a couple of patients that I'd you know spent time with and knew personally was on a kind

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.200
 of more personal level with them now you said didn't you I thought you said that um ribavirin

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.400
 which I think was one of the treatments along with interferon that was a standard uh treatment

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.720
 uh was not well not actually that bad I think one of those and I don't think it was interferon

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.600
 you always said interferon was like massively inflammatory and and very negative on a system

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.880
 but ribavirin actually might not have been a bad compound to try but yeah I think it's less

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:28.160
 less harmful yeah okay all right uh I don't know if that helps you in any way call it but

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.680
 what I would do if I was in your shoes I would definitely assess your assess your labs and

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:41.520
 assess yourself I mean how do you feel um okay okay you know no I feel really good I feel really good

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.160
 but okay what's up one more question what about the hydrogen peroxide uh the strong hydrogen

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:52.320
 peroxide that you you do those drops say that again that hydrogen peroxide treatment with

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:58.960
 hydrogen peroxide like 30 drops a day oh no you're not talking about mm uh mmsi the miracle

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.520
 mineral supplement that's actually bleach which no no no no no it's it's actually it's hydrogen

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:10.160
 peroxide and you can bite it daisy that's a human strength or whatever uh well you start out like

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:15.600
 one drop a day and go up to 30 yeah that sounds just like mms which is actually uh um the same

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:21.040
 sodium hypochlorite which is a regular household bleach uh it was a fad and I can't believe it's

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.800
 still on the internet it's absolutely all over it and I'm kind of amazed that it's still going

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:31.920
 and it's still got such a strong following but uh you'll find testimonials about this that and

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.720
 the other on it and it starts off at one drop a day and ends up with however many drops and

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.920
 there's people writing testimonials about how it's done this and done that and it's kind of

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:49.280
 unbelievable really but um I would I would say that I would not I would not get involved with it

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.360
 Dr. Peat uh you've probably been have you heard about the mms it's like yeah there was a study

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:04.480
 in Italy that identified it as a probable carcinogen right yeah so I would probably

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:10.800
 I probably not I probably I would not go down that route ma'am okay well I sure I sure got a

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:16.080
 lot out of this call from you guys um it was great yeah thank you so much you're very welcome

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:24.240
 okay for yeah happy new year to you okay uh if anybody else wants to call in we've got uh 14

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.760
 minutes so we've got one more caller here but the number in the air if you're in or out of the air

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:36.320
 it doesn't matter where on planet earth you are at 707-923-3911 707-923-3911 and let's take this

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:43.680
 next call are you on the air call away from what's your question I was diagnosed with osteoporosis

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:52.960
 10 years ago am I could you turn your radio down ma'am I'm turning 66 in a couple of days you know

00:44:52.960 --> 00:45:02.720
 and supposedly I have a um osteopoenic spine whatever that is a femoral neck that is osteoporotic

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:13.360
 in a total osteoporotic hip however I feel fine you know I do I just walked 44 miles to get my

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.240
 tooth extracted from shelter cove the other day oh my gosh okay ma'am I guess first things first

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:23.280
 before we let dr pete answer and you'll have some vibrational thing I'd like to talk about yeah

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:33.600
 pulse waves and you know I'm a musician and I believe in music therapy sure and pulse sonar

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:41.280
 waves are able to help bone growth sure I've got articles right in front of me man I do believe it

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.520
 because you know I've been studying music my entire life I have a degree from Catholic University of

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:50.800
 America could you turn your tv down it's on in the background it's not my tv it's my radio radio

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:56.080
 yeah if you could tell me what's going on you know I am not deaf actually but you know I can hear

00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:01.200
 things and talk at the same time here I don't have a tv I've never had a tv in my entire life

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.000
 okay if you could turn the radio down that would help thank you so dr pete I know you know a lot

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.600
 about a lot of things and osteoporosis is something I've questioned you on recently but

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.960
 and I also have osteomotor hypothyroidism well there you go that goes hand in hand with osteoporosis

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:20.400
 man yes but mine's genetic from being northern italian well I'm not too sure about the relevance

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:29.360
 of that but dr p go ahead vitamin k is very important along with vitamin d and calcium intake

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:41.920
 vitamin k prevents the removal of calcium from the bone and keeps it out of the soft tissues

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:50.400
 the combination is much more effective than either one alone okay so they give vitamin k

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:56.800
 calcium and d yeah i'm perfect okay well let's uh let's just see if any other callers are going

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:03.200
 to be calling in here in the last uh nine minutes or so before we wrap the show up once again 707

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:12.480
 923 3911 and dr p is joining us once more this decade so um getting back to uh until the lights

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:20.800
 go off here but getting back to some of the um some of the measurements by which they support

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:27.760
 the abstracts that i've looked at um this one particular abstract here was showing that um

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:34.160
 exposure to a cytokine production by lipopolysaccharide which we've heard we've heard

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:40.080
 and discussed before in the past that this compound lps is responsible for inflammation

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:47.600
 cells and in this pathway the pathway of the inflammation basically adenyl cyclase and

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:58.080
 phospholipase proteins kinase c and several other protein kinases here were seemingly modulated

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:05.520
 by these sound waves and they're saying that this is evidence of why this post electromagnetic field

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:10.400
 therapy had such a significant effect on inflammation and quelling inflammation because

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:16.560
 it's directly uh interrupting these signal pathways that normal inflammation is involved in

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:26.720
 um i think normal activity has some of those uh effects anti-inflammatory effects

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:36.800
 if you're forced uh into inactivity you develop a generalized inflammation in

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:48.480
 probably all of the tissues and free activity work that is productive using your muscles walking

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:57.680
 for example rather than sitting the normal activity of muscles lowers the stress hormones

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:04.400
 and increases the constructive hormones such as progesterone and dhea and testosterone

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:13.600
 and normal activity in itself is an anti-inflammatory process and i suspect that

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:22.720
 these certain frequencies are imitating the normal rhythm of proper activity cool okay we do have

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.840
 another caller who's uh waiting here so caller you're on the air where you from and what's your

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:36.400
 question hi my name's julie and i'm from lintonville my question is um i have fibromyalgia

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:43.600
 and i'm trying to navigate through this still i've had it for 10 years but i find that when i get

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:50.880
 into a big city and i'm around a lot of uh power lines and stuff like that i start feeling a little

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:56.000
 not well so i didn't know if there was like any relationship between those two things

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.200
 well dr p you're understanding of fibromyalgia i know is a little different from the current

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:08.960
 medical uh normal model of it but i think a lot of doctors are coming around to recognize

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:18.720
 the importance of hormone balance a good thyroid function vitamin d and keeping up the constructive

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:28.240
 hormones or steroids like progesterone testosterone and dhea okay and especially as you're female i

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:34.480
 mean i don't mean this in any negative way but because you're exposed uh and in an unopposed way

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.840
 after your menstruation has stopped to estrogen that is very important for you to make sure you

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:45.040
 get adequate progesterone because it's the antagonist of the inflammatory estrogen and that

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:51.440
 in fibromyalgia uh no doubt that estrogen excess or estrogen dominance certainly has a role to play

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:59.360
 in that tired waterlogged muscles of which estrogen is a main cause oh okay well i'm 63 now so i don't

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:06.080
 have too many of those you don't you don't but you don't have any uh any way to combat the estrogen

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.880
 you're still producing you're every cell in your body is still manufacturing or can manufacture

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:15.280
 and secrete estrogen but your ovaries no longer function and so therefore you're not getting

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:21.040
 progesterone exposure which is very important to offset that okay and which is part and parcel of

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:27.360
 the osteoporosis question i was also wondering but not to uh say to dr p that we didn't mention

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:37.040
 um you know progesterone um as a yeah anyway so carry on yeah cortisol is a born destroyer

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:47.600
 and progesterone is the main antagonist of cortisol okay so um is there a book or something

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.880
 that i can get on this subject that you guys are talking about that you would recommend

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.080
 you haven't written one yet dr p about it have you

00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:02.640
 we've talked about it a lot over 10 years but nothing's materialized at this point in time but

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.000
 dr p what i would say to you ma'am is that at the end of the show i'll give that dr p's website he's

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.280
 got plenty of articles actually surrounding just what you're talking about uh although a lot of it

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.000
 is for the sake of it very science-based and um some of it may be a little hard for

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.600
 a novice to grasp it's very well grounded in science and so therefore it's it's very easy

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:28.320
 to catch the thrust of what he's saying and certainly you can find out more information

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.760
 if you're on the internet about some of those uh concepts precepts and directions that you get taken

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:38.960
 in good deal well thank you so much i appreciate your time you're welcome okay we got one more

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.040
 caller i think this would probably be the last caller before we wrap up the show but

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:50.160
 call you're on the air and what's your question away from oh i'm local uh person and i believe

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:57.040
 it was helga clark that wrote the cure for all cancers and i wonder if the doctor approves of

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:04.960
 the device that she created to you know uh tone out certain bacterial frequencies and i can hang

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:13.520
 up now i think she used just a simple low voltage direct current stimulator and that device can be

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:21.280
 used productively but i don't think she understood enough to use it productively

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:30.160
 yeah interesting oh thank you you're welcome okay so i don't know maybe we can squeeze one

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.480
 more in if someone wants to call in it's seven zero seven nine two three three nine one one

00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.880
 otherwise i'm sure we've got enough to carry on with here for a couple of minutes to let people

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:45.280
 know how they can reach dr p i think probably dr p i don't see the lights flashing here we'll say

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:51.360
 thank you very much for your time uh this month i look forward to next month uh obviously we

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.960
 as usual but thank we didn't get we didn't get into as much as i thought we might do so we've

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.760
 got material for next month if you're available i'd love to carry on the subject it's definitely

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:07.120
 very interesting okay thank you okay so for those people who've listened to the show this evening

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:16.160
 and or listen to this on the audio archives or on the web um dr pete's web address is www.raypeat

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:24.880
 r-a-y-p-e-a-t.com uh he's got a huge list of articles that have been written that are fully

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.000
 referenced scientific articles that you would expect to see in any good journal uh fully

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:36.480
 referenced for the things that he's saying so it's not just his opinion um there's many many

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.680
 articles from all sorts of different pathologies so go take a look at his website uh like i said

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.400
 a lot of it's uh very science-based so maybe a little bit um tough chewing for some people to

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.960
 get through it but nonetheless uh what we need is good science to underpin a good direction to go in

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.120
 because i don't think the medical model we're using at this point in time uh is a particularly

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:02.080
 good model it's certainly uh fairly damaging in some cases and it does not really tolerate too

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:07.760
 much criticism about it so anyway uh what we do here on this show once a month from the third

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:14.160
 friday of every month from 7 to 8 pm is discuss alternative uh treatments alternative approaches

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.720
 and indeed bring up some old past uh research that's been done that may either be revived in

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:26.080
 the light of current knowledge or just because it's become forgotten it's just valuable to bring

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:32.960
 it up again to make sure people recognize that there is and has been and still is answers um

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:39.920
 that are there and available so that people don't have to go down one particular route to get treated

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:48.320
 for a disease um it's not always one pill works for everybody obviously it's very far from that

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:53.040
 and i would encourage everybody to do their own research there's plenty of alternatives out there

00:55:53.040 --> 00:56:00.080
 and like that lady who called in with hepatitis you know obviously if she is close to cirrhosis

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:05.200
 and she's dying and there's nothing else that can be done obviously there's a potential treatment

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:10.320
 for her which you know in the light of current research seems to show some fairly significant

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:16.080
 results i won't say it doesn't but obviously you've got to understand it in the context that

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:22.080
 dr p understands things in so it's not the last thing to do it's not the first thing to do perhaps

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.120
 but it'd be the one of the last things to do if everything else has failed um anyway so my name's

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:32.720
 andrew murray i run a business called western botanical medicine i produce herb extracts of

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:38.800
 medicinal plants i was trained in europe i graduated in england and we do what we love

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:45.280
 we've been doing it over 20 years now so all the best to everybody out there who's tuned into the

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:51.920
 show who maybe supports our products and our business our whole whole aim is to help you

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:57.840
 naturally anyway thanks for your time and until next month happy new year
