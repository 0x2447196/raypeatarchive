00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
And welcome back to the Source Nutritional Radio Show.

00:02.600 --> 00:08.400
And if life seems like a big mystery to you, you might want to sit down and talk with Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.400
Dr. Peat, are you on the phone today?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
I am.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.000
Aloha. It's nice to have you back as our guest today.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
We got such a nice response from our show last Saturday, Dr. Peat.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.800
I always tell people, because Karen and I work in the natural food store,

00:21.800 --> 00:24.600
people come in all the time and we get a lot of good feedback.

00:24.600 --> 00:29.280
We get people's comments. But I wanted to start out this morning, Dr. Pete, I have in

00:29.280 --> 00:35.360
front of me a book you wrote, Mind and Tissue, about Russian research on the human brain.

00:35.360 --> 00:41.840
And I wanted to ask you, because in the news lately there's all this talk about brain damage

00:41.840 --> 00:46.000
to the football players in our country. Have you heard this story?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Oh, not recently, but yeah, I know that there's a lot of brain damage in football.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
I guess everybody was shocked in the sports world last week with Junior Seau's suicide,

00:58.000 --> 01:05.680
and it was very sad, because a lot of us enjoy sports, especially since 9-11, it's a good distraction. But

01:05.680 --> 01:10.360
can you tell us a little bit about this book, Mind and Tissue, and the research you have

01:10.360 --> 01:13.600
on the human brain and how things work?

01:13.600 --> 01:29.200
Well, maybe you've been hearing about the use of progesterone. I think they say it's in the last stage of clinical trials before getting approval to

01:29.200 --> 01:35.520
use progesterone for treating brain injury.

01:35.520 --> 01:51.160
After many years of animal studies treating with progesterone, they've advanced to the, applying it to people with recent brain injuries, and it has the

01:51.160 --> 01:56.040
same good effects in humans as it does in animals.

01:56.040 --> 02:07.080
Even if you cut out a nerve in a rabbit study, for example, several years ago, they removed a centimeter of nerve and then put

02:07.080 --> 02:15.640
a fiber bridge across the gap, but impregnated the fiber with progesterone and found that

02:15.640 --> 02:25.440
the progesterone even facilitated the complete regeneration across a missing piece of nerve.

02:25.440 --> 02:35.360
The Russian research interested me because there were, here and there across Europe in

02:35.360 --> 02:47.760
the 18th century, there were a few researchers thinking in an integral way about what an organism is and what sickness is, and realizing

02:47.760 --> 02:55.680
that the whole organism is involved in the sickness process, and the thing that most

02:55.680 --> 03:02.400
obviously makes a whole organism a unit is the brain and the nervous system, and that's

03:02.400 --> 03:06.960
something that people have been aware of for thousands of years.

03:06.960 --> 03:13.960
But in the 18th century, doctors, a few doctors, actually started thinking along that line.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.520
But it didn't go over well in England, Germany, and France.

03:18.520 --> 03:26.740
But for some reason, a little later in the 19th century, it really took off in Russia, and there was a

03:26.740 --> 03:36.220
whole branch of medicine that they called nervism, realizing that the brain is a factor

03:36.220 --> 04:00.400
in everythingâ€”cancer, tuberculosis, allergies, trauma, etc. And the famous Sechenov, who was, before Pavlov, had set the research

04:00.400 --> 04:06.520
program to study how nerves work, what a reflex is, and so on.

04:06.520 --> 04:30.640
And so when Pavlov began integrating central thing to how an organism

04:30.640 --> 04:31.640
exists.

04:31.640 --> 04:49.880
Pavlov said that the digestive system is an animal's closest contact with the world, and it uses its nervous system to integrate its reactions to the world.

04:49.880 --> 04:57.400
And so he studied the innervation of the digestive system basically as a way to understand what

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
an organism is.

04:58.400 --> 05:06.520
Well, when we talk about progesterone, Dr. Pete, and we do sell it in our store in Kailua, people

05:06.520 --> 05:13.160
will always ask me, are there like foods that naturally have progesterone in it that they

05:13.160 --> 05:14.160
can eat?

05:14.160 --> 05:29.640
Milk, milk and cheese are the only foods containing measurable amounts of progesterone. I really like your information about progesterone being an anti-androgen.

05:29.640 --> 05:34.920
How would a man use this if he were balding, for instance, and can you, would you remark

05:34.920 --> 05:51.560
on when you see thinning adherence scale from both men and women, what that relates to? About 35 years ago, I had been experimenting with the oil-dissolved progesterone, and a

05:51.560 --> 06:03.480
bald man in his 30s asked me for suggestions, and I suggested rubbing some of this oil progesterone

06:03.480 --> 06:05.240
on his scalp.

06:05.240 --> 06:12.800
And he came back two or three weeks later with fuzz on his head and was all enthusiastic

06:12.800 --> 06:16.480
about it and started telling his friends.

06:16.480 --> 06:29.520
And I sort of discouraged the use of it because if a man puts on too much progesterone, it has anti-testosterone

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
effects.

06:30.520 --> 06:43.080
And if a man isn't expecting it and is willing to stop using it or adjust the dose, it might

06:43.080 --> 06:46.640
make him think he's losing his virility.

06:46.640 --> 06:58.120
And so occasionally I would mention it to a man, but for about 30 years I avoided talking

06:58.120 --> 07:09.200
about it because so many men were just obsessed with the idea of growing hair and explaining what it does to their

07:09.200 --> 07:12.200
testosterone was too involved.

07:12.200 --> 07:16.880
But how would that affect a baby boy?

07:16.880 --> 07:20.000
Say if you had a baby that had brain damage or...

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Oh, sure.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.320
If there's any... When a man has something more serious than baldness, I don't

07:27.320 --> 07:37.800
hesitate to tell him what it does physiologically. And a child, the same thing, if they have

07:37.800 --> 07:47.000
something really serious, then you don't mind if they delay their puberty a while. And so that's all it would do is delay puberty?

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
It would not make them become transsexual or something odd like that?

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
There hasn't been much research using it on kids or even young animals,

07:59.000 --> 08:08.440
but animal studies suggest that delaying puberty is very, very good for the personality and

08:08.440 --> 08:11.720
the general health of the animal.

08:11.720 --> 08:20.160
The more stress they're under, the earlier puberty begins, and precocious puberty is

08:20.160 --> 08:27.800
starting to be a big problem around the world because of exposure to estrogens and such.

08:27.800 --> 08:39.800
And the brain basically stops developing at puberty, and so in countries where the diet

08:39.800 --> 08:50.080
doesn't have so much polyunsaturated fats. Puberty used to come around the age of 18 in places that had a lot of coconuts in the

08:50.080 --> 08:52.560
diet, for example.

08:52.560 --> 09:00.920
And the brain and personality have a lot more chance to develop if it is delayed for several

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
years.

09:01.920 --> 09:07.000
I actually heard that same information from Dr. John Gray, the author of the book

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Women are from Venus and Men are from Mars.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
He's definitely from Mars.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I like what he had to say.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
You're kind of reinforcing what Dr. John Gray said,

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
if you can actually naturally, in a way, delay puberty,

09:22.000 --> 09:32.640
that it enhances the brain growth in the child. Now how about, what about if you had a, say a baby boy who fell into that autistic spectrum

09:32.640 --> 09:37.800
and you wanted to use pregnenolone and progesterone, would that be fine and dandy?

09:37.800 --> 09:41.960
Is there any precaution that we should take into consideration in using pregnenolone for

09:41.960 --> 09:50.520
kids? Well, pregnenolone is even easier to use. It doesn't have any known so-called hormonal

09:50.520 --> 10:08.960
effects in itself. It does seem to help the body handle the tone of connective tissue and sphincter muscle and such, those

10:08.960 --> 10:12.600
aren't recognized as hormone effects.

10:12.600 --> 10:20.280
So pregnenolone isn't considered a hormone, but it's a precursor, like a nutrient for

10:20.280 --> 10:25.000
any tissue that does use the steroid hormones.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
So it just helps balance the things that the body is naturally trying to do.

10:33.000 --> 10:55.360
Progesterone will neutralize the component in pregnant women is that it stabilizes

10:55.360 --> 11:04.040
every physiological process, and it's there in these massive amounts, hundreds of milligrams

11:04.040 --> 11:07.080
of it being produced every day late in the

11:07.080 --> 11:19.000
pregnancy process. And those huge amounts prevent any surges of estrogen or testosterone

11:19.000 --> 11:29.560
or cortisol, anything that destabilizes the developmental process is blocked by these huge amounts of

11:29.560 --> 11:30.560
progesterone.

11:30.560 --> 11:40.520
So that, for example, the adrenal steroid albosterone that regulates salt balances,

11:40.520 --> 11:48.040
if you have too much albosterone and a lot of progesterone, you don't have salt retention

11:48.040 --> 11:51.320
the way you would with just too much albostrone.

11:51.320 --> 11:57.580
And if you don't have any albostrone, but you have lots of progesterone, you don't lose

11:57.580 --> 12:11.600
salt catastrophically the way you would just for the deficiencies. All of the steroids functions are represented in the single molecule of progesterone, even

12:11.600 --> 12:16.060
without it being converted into anything else.

12:16.060 --> 12:31.600
For example, in the 1940s, Hans Zellweg was studying all of the steroids and having his assistants inject large amounts

12:31.600 --> 12:39.680
against all kinds of different conditions, and even removing the adrenal glands from

12:39.680 --> 12:48.760
a rat, if they were giving these large injections of progesterone, the rat would live with perfect

12:48.760 --> 12:54.840
health, a fully normal lifespan, no adrenal glands at all, just progesterone.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.280
Wow, that's amazing.

12:57.280 --> 13:05.320
So as far as, since you mentioned how profound a role progesterone plays in brain development in babies.

13:05.320 --> 13:10.960
If that were missed out on during the pregnancy, could one compensate somewhat after the birth

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
if they knew it would cause the damage?

13:12.960 --> 13:16.560
Could they give their child progesterone and pregnenolone to try to repair some of that

13:16.560 --> 13:17.560
damage?

13:17.560 --> 13:27.120
That was sort of overlooked because of the doctrine that the brain and the heart don't regenerate, but

13:27.120 --> 13:35.640
now in the last 10 or 20 years since stem cells have been recognized, a few people are

13:35.640 --> 13:38.120
starting to think about that.

13:38.120 --> 13:48.440
Stein's studies of brain injury show that the progesterone is actually helping to regenerate the destroyed

13:48.440 --> 13:58.280
parts of the brain, but the animal studies show that the brain really continues growing

13:58.280 --> 14:01.080
throughout the lifespan.

14:01.080 --> 14:09.760
About 40 years ago, a sort of compendium of changes that occurred during the aging process

14:09.760 --> 14:18.640
measured the amount of DNA in the brain and found that the human brain contains a steadily

14:18.640 --> 14:29.160
increasing quantity of DNA up to the age of 90 and more, showing that the cells keep increasing throughout

14:29.160 --> 14:35.920
the whole adult lifespan, contrary to the idea that growth is something that happens

14:35.920 --> 14:36.920
only in childhood.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.080
Yeah, that's interesting to me.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.560
I actually never heard that.

14:40.560 --> 14:46.180
Now, if I wanted to administer Pregnenolone to one of my grandchildren, what would a good

14:46.180 --> 14:48.400
average dose be for a child?

14:48.400 --> 14:52.520
What would I maybe want to give to a grandchild?

14:52.520 --> 15:00.280
I know that you said that it's non-toxic, but as far as pocketbook savings, what would

15:00.280 --> 15:04.520
be a good average dose if you wanted to try to repair some brain cell damage?

15:04.520 --> 15:07.040
No one has ever studied that officially.

15:07.040 --> 15:13.680
So we could just take a stab at trying maybe 100 milligrams a day and see what happens?

15:13.680 --> 15:17.840
Well for an adult, even 10 or 15 milligrams.

15:17.840 --> 15:26.320
I've seen people snap out of a depressed mood minutes after taking 10 or 15 milligrams.

15:26.320 --> 15:36.160
And the body normally produces about 30 milligrams a day of pregnenolone at least, 30 to 60,

15:36.160 --> 15:38.000
something like that.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.160
And even those very small doses are sometimes enough to just stop a stress reaction.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.200
Well, what if somebody wanted to use it for a facelift effect?

15:47.200 --> 15:51.280
Could we use 300 or 400 milligrams with no problem?

15:51.280 --> 15:54.080
Yeah, for an adult.

15:54.080 --> 16:11.720
I've seen one person said he was getting no results, couldn't feel anything from 300 milligrams. A couple days later he called back and said he had taken a heaping spoonful of it and

16:11.720 --> 16:15.240
woke up looking like he had had a facelift.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.840
How many milligrams would you guess is in a heaping teaspoonful?

16:18.840 --> 16:31.320
Well for a year I took a heaping teaspoon every day on average and ate a whole kilogram in a year.

16:31.320 --> 16:38.560
So I was getting about 3,000 milligrams per day just to see how it felt.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
How did it feel?

16:39.560 --> 16:40.560
Very good.

16:40.560 --> 16:48.000
It didn't feel that much better than 100 milligrams a day though.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.600
I see, so it would be just something that people could safely experiment with until

16:51.600 --> 16:54.440
they find what the dose for them would be?

16:54.440 --> 16:57.760
Yeah, but you have to be careful with the excipients.

16:57.760 --> 17:02.280
So many products have strange junk.

17:02.280 --> 17:07.520
I don't advise eating, you know, stilica for example is something that's in

17:07.520 --> 17:17.240
a lot of products and methylcellulose isn't good. Just have to be careful of what the

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
additives are.

17:18.240 --> 17:25.000
Is there any pure pregnenolone on the market anymore? Oh yeah. There's one company in the U.S.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I don't remember their exact name.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Is it Life Extension?

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
Well, I don't think they have a pure powdered without excipients.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
They do have some good products.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.920
There's one company that sells 20 grams of bulk progesterone for $20.

17:48.920 --> 17:52.680
You can find those things on the internet.

17:52.680 --> 17:57.520
We really like your progesterone and we've experimented with that and I have to say that

17:57.520 --> 18:03.120
I know you speak about it taking an excess, people can feel a little loopy and we felt

18:03.120 --> 18:07.520
that way and it's actually kind of a relaxing, nice feel.

18:07.520 --> 18:17.280
Yeah, you don't want to experiment with any of those things when you aren't completely

18:17.280 --> 18:29.040
at leisure and don't have to do anything, because I've talked to people who would take a fourth of a teaspoon of progesterone mixture and

18:29.040 --> 18:30.040
feel drunk.

18:30.040 --> 18:34.920
Now why does such a small dose cause that feeling in some people?

18:34.920 --> 18:44.440
If they don't have the antagonistic estrogen cortisol, then they feel the full effect of

18:44.440 --> 18:46.480
that much progesterone.

18:46.480 --> 18:55.080
Other people, if their thyroid is low and their estrogen high, 100 milligrams of progesterone,

18:55.080 --> 18:57.800
they can't feel a thing.

18:57.800 --> 19:07.240
So regarding the cortisol and estrogen, is it possible that anybody is really low estrogen?

19:07.240 --> 19:09.240
Has that ever happened?

19:09.240 --> 19:11.240
Occasionally, yeah.

19:11.240 --> 19:21.000
A very slender person sometimes has a safely low amount of estrogen.

19:21.000 --> 19:25.440
So that wouldn't be something you'd be concerned about?

19:25.440 --> 19:30.600
It's more the pregnenolone and the progesterone that would sort of maintain a balance of all

19:30.600 --> 19:32.600
the other hormones?

19:32.600 --> 19:47.560
Yeah, the healthy people tend to keep their estrogen low most of the time, and when they're in the low estrogen time is when they can be very sensitive to a big

19:47.560 --> 19:52.280
dose of either testosterone or progesterone.

19:52.280 --> 19:57.080
Now as people age and they tend to get the little weight accumulation, if they're taking

19:57.080 --> 20:00.840
an adequate dose of progesterone, why does that happen?

20:00.840 --> 20:04.940
Why does what happen?

20:04.940 --> 20:06.560
Why do they continue to gain weight?

20:06.560 --> 20:11.840
I know some people who are using thyroid and progesterone continue to gain weight.

20:11.840 --> 20:17.200
Depends on what they're eating I suppose.

20:17.200 --> 20:29.240
If you don't eat the right things to support heat production and good energy production, a lot of it will get stored as

20:29.240 --> 20:31.760
fat.

20:31.760 --> 20:37.920
Some people just eat too much fat or too much starch.

20:37.920 --> 20:46.720
The unsaturated fats and starches in general are probably the main causes of obesity.

20:46.720 --> 20:59.840
The unsaturated fats turn off the processes that raise heat production and have a catabolic

20:59.840 --> 21:13.760
effect on your protein, muscles and such. And the starches stimulate the processes that synthesize fat rather than just accelerating

21:13.760 --> 21:16.760
the burning of the sugar.

21:16.760 --> 21:23.640
So I'm going to ask you in my own case, I do take thyroid and I take pregnenol and progesterone

21:23.640 --> 21:25.680
and I'm still cold.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.800
So would it be safe for me to add some DHEA to see if I could kick that heat production

21:29.800 --> 21:30.800
up?

21:30.800 --> 21:39.520
My first suggestion would be to check your intake of calcium and sodium as well as magnesium

21:39.520 --> 21:40.520
and potassium.

21:40.520 --> 21:47.600
But calcium and sodium are often the things that are missing when someone is putting on

21:47.600 --> 21:51.480
fat instead of producing energy.

21:51.480 --> 22:01.560
I think 2,000 milligrams of calcium per day is a good, safe, standard amount.

22:01.560 --> 22:06.320
For example, a quart and a half to two quarts of milk will provide enough calcium

22:06.320 --> 22:10.120
to keep your machinery running so you're burning calories.

22:10.120 --> 22:16.880
Okay, so you don't necessarily recommend it in a supplement form as much as a food form?

22:16.880 --> 22:27.920
No, the best supplements of calcium would be eggshell or some oyster shell from a clean part of the ocean if you can find that.

22:27.920 --> 22:34.240
But even those aren't as well assimilated as from milk and cheese.

22:34.240 --> 22:39.480
Now that's what I always heard about the oyster shell based calcium products Dr. Pete, that

22:39.480 --> 22:42.160
they were very hard to assimilate by the body.

22:42.160 --> 22:49.040
But if you're just tuning in, you're listening to the Source Nutritional Radio Show with our guest today, Dr. Raymond Peat. And Dr. Peat,

22:49.040 --> 22:52.720
when we started the show, we were talking about some new research that's come out that

22:52.720 --> 22:58.080
has kind of debunked the fish oil supplement industry, saying it does not affect heart

22:58.080 --> 23:04.000
health. And considering that fish oil supplements is one of the top five nutritional supplements

23:04.000 --> 23:05.960
that today's doctors are recommending, what's your feeling about fish oil supplements is one of the top five nutritional supplements that today's doctors are recommending.

23:05.960 --> 23:08.360
What's your feeling about fish oil supplements?

23:08.360 --> 23:14.840
Oh, studies like that were coming out seven or eight years ago or longer.

23:14.840 --> 23:25.560
Like 40 years ago, yellow fat disease was associated with eating too much fat fish.

23:25.560 --> 23:33.720
It was known to be seriously toxic as long ago as the 1950s, 1960s.

23:33.720 --> 23:48.300
But when the so-called essential fatty acids, linoleic acid and linoleic when they were identified with not only cancer, but heart disease and clotting

23:48.300 --> 23:49.300
diseases.

23:49.300 --> 24:00.420
Then the fish oil industry stepped into the advertising scene and started saying that

24:00.420 --> 24:06.640
those were the safe unsaturated fats.

24:06.640 --> 24:14.880
But it was just as the fats that were promoted in the 1950s, as they were being incriminated

24:14.880 --> 24:23.600
as toxins, then the fish oil came in and said, we're not as toxic as those fats.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.280
And that's true.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.640
They break down so fast that they

24:27.640 --> 24:34.040
don't have the long-range effects in the stored tissues

24:34.040 --> 24:41.080
that the linoleic and derivative arachidonic acids have.

24:41.080 --> 24:45.400
But it's only by being less toxic.

24:45.400 --> 24:53.360
If you do an experiment and are feeding your control animals a deadly amount of linoleic

24:53.360 --> 25:02.600
acid, such as corn oil or safflower oil, and then you add some fish oil, it will slightly

25:02.600 --> 25:07.000
block those toxic effects of the linoleic acid.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
And that's how they do the research to show the health benefits from fish oil.

25:13.000 --> 25:21.000
But if you compare it to coconut oil or butter or no fat, the fish oil always turns out toxic.

25:21.000 --> 25:29.080
They were showing toxic effects in humans seven or eight years ago. For example,

25:29.080 --> 25:35.840
raising the C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the blood.

25:35.840 --> 25:42.160
Well, you mentioned butter, which happens to be my favorite food. I have a horrible

25:42.160 --> 25:47.840
craving for butter all the time. Is there a problem with exceeding a certain level of butter?

25:47.840 --> 26:08.960
Yeah, you can get fat on butter, but in context, its main you need, such as calcium and sodium, to keep

26:08.960 --> 26:16.880
your metabolism going at a high level, and adequate protein.

26:16.880 --> 26:23.320
And gelatin happens to be a protein that you can increase considerably without worrying

26:23.320 --> 26:27.920
about increasing inflammation and the

26:27.920 --> 26:33.600
protein in milk, casein especially, is an anti-stress type of protein but

26:33.600 --> 26:41.760
especially if you supplement that with gelatin, the balance is very

26:41.760 --> 26:49.000
anti-stress and as a consequence, anti-obesity.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And how do you recommend that we use the gelatin?

26:52.000 --> 27:02.000
Oh, it depends on your needs for treating inflammatory bowel disease and liver disease,

27:02.000 --> 27:06.240
kidney disease, diabetes, and so on.

27:06.240 --> 27:13.000
They've used as much as an ounce or two of pure gelatin

27:13.000 --> 27:21.240
added per day, even more people sometimes use temporarily.

27:21.240 --> 27:31.440
And it's important to have a good gelatin without additives and it generally should

27:31.440 --> 27:37.000
be thoroughly dissolved rather than eating it as a powder.

27:37.000 --> 27:47.280
It should be mixed with hot water or milk until there are no granules left so that it's easy to digest.

27:47.280 --> 27:51.720
So would it be unusual for someone to be allergic to gelatin?

27:51.720 --> 28:00.880
Yeah, I think it's unusual, but some people think they react more to pork gelatin than

28:00.880 --> 28:10.080
to beef, but the only reactions I've heard, it's mainly just poor digestion of

28:10.080 --> 28:11.560
it getting gas or something.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.280
And so how could one offset that initially?

28:14.280 --> 28:17.440
Could they take some digestive enzymes temporarily to...

28:17.440 --> 28:20.560
Or just try a different brand of gelatin.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.000
Some people do okay with beef gelatin rather than pork.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And you think the Great Lakes gelatin is a good?

28:27.000 --> 28:36.000
Yeah, they have both kinds and they also have hydrolyzed that some people think it's much easier to use

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
and they think it might digest more easily.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.600
Well, I'm intrigued that you mentioned that it has an effect on diabetes. How would that be?

28:45.600 --> 28:49.440
I think it's the anti-inflammatory effect.

28:49.440 --> 28:58.640
Diabetes is basically an inflammatory problem resulting from a chronic accumulative effect

28:58.640 --> 29:08.600
of the polyunsaturated fats that interfere with the use of sugar by the cells and at the same time

29:08.600 --> 29:16.720
have a toxic inflammatory effect on the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin.

29:16.720 --> 29:28.360
And those cells, incidentally, are actually being regenerated constantly.

29:28.360 --> 29:37.640
Cells in other parts of the pancreas are gradually transforming themselves into the insulin-producing

29:37.640 --> 29:38.640
cells.

29:38.640 --> 29:50.600
So, it's like a stream of stem cells constantly waiting to replace the beta cells that produce insulin

29:50.600 --> 29:51.600
as they're destroyed.

29:51.600 --> 29:59.920
But if your body is saturated with the toxic unsaturated fats, every time they get replaced,

29:59.920 --> 30:06.080
they're killed again by the breakdown products of the unsaturated fats.

30:06.080 --> 30:14.280
So are you saying that diabetes has more to do with these polyunsaturated fats and they're

30:14.280 --> 30:18.600
blocking the metabolic process than it does with sugar?

30:18.600 --> 30:29.000
Yeah, in fact glucose is a factor in helping to regenerate the beta cells.

30:29.000 --> 30:38.160
Well the unsaturated fats are killing them, but just increasing the sugar isn't enough

30:38.160 --> 30:48.480
if you don't remove the unsaturated fat from the diet. 150 years ago in France and England, a couple of doctors

30:48.480 --> 30:59.440
demonstrated curing their terminal, wasting away diabetic patients by giving them 8 or

30:59.440 --> 31:10.380
10 ounces of sugar per day, along with other foods, where they had been losing pounds per week of body

31:10.380 --> 31:18.580
weight, they quickly stopped producing such huge amounts of glucose in their urine and

31:18.580 --> 31:20.740
their weight loss stopped.

31:20.740 --> 31:28.000
And within a few weeks, they had returned to good health, no diabetes at all.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
Wow. What are the types of oils that you would recommend, Dr. Peat?

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Oh, well, butter and coconut oil.

31:36.000 --> 31:46.240
But again, I'm intrigued about what you just said, because pretty much everything has those oils that are so corrupt in them, like all the packaged

31:46.240 --> 31:48.560
foods, pretty much all of them have those oils.

31:48.560 --> 31:54.880
So could it be that our obesity epidemic has much to do with the over-ingestion of those

31:54.880 --> 31:56.880
polyunsaturated oils for so many years?

31:56.880 --> 32:11.560
Yeah, if you look at the consumption, food consumption records, U.S. Department of Agriculture, for the last 40 years, you see that fat consumption,

32:11.560 --> 32:21.080
which is mostly the polyunsaturated seed oils, increased about 7% during these years, while

32:21.080 --> 32:25.000
sugar consumption decreased by about 1%.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Wow.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.600
You didn't mention olive oil, Dr. Peat.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.200
Is that one of your favorite oils?

32:31.200 --> 32:42.040
It's very good for flavoring and has very good drug actions, the so-called anti-oxidant

32:42.040 --> 32:46.000
factors or anti-inflammatory factors.

32:46.000 --> 32:53.000
But it also has 8 to 10 percent or even more of the polyunsaturated fats.

32:53.000 --> 33:02.000
So you shouldn't use it in bulk, but a spoonful or two per day is fine.

33:02.000 --> 33:10.280
Wow, that's really interesting. So, if you have a child with diabetes, from what you just stated, it would probably be

33:10.280 --> 33:15.160
possible to actually repair that pancreas if they abstain from all the polyunsaturated

33:15.160 --> 33:17.640
oils and get their thyroid in order?

33:17.640 --> 33:27.440
Yeah, from the research, that is what I think is the case.

33:27.440 --> 33:35.040
Before I was born, my father was a diabetic, and insulin was already institutionalized

33:35.040 --> 33:38.040
as the only treatment.

33:38.040 --> 33:47.720
And he was putting out a tremendous amount of sugar in his urine and had gone down in weight

33:47.720 --> 33:51.120
to something like a hundred pounds.

33:51.120 --> 34:10.480
And he refused to get on the lifetime insulin injection program. He looked at the old Nature of Pathic and Traditional Medicine texts and found that

34:10.480 --> 34:15.600
brewer's yeast was a traditional remedy.

34:15.600 --> 34:30.320
And so he ate brewer's yeast only for, I guess, several weeks, he completely recovered and progressed and his wife was able to eat

34:30.320 --> 34:31.320
everything just like anyone.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.320
Wow.

34:32.320 --> 34:36.920
Yeah, we like to put brewer's yeast on our popcorn at nighttime as a snack.

34:36.920 --> 34:44.880
Now, let me ask you again, with that in mind, would that be a recommended avenue for a parent

34:44.880 --> 34:46.860
to do with a child, say for instance their

34:46.860 --> 34:50.740
diabetes occurred after having mono or Epstein-Barr?

34:50.740 --> 35:05.000
Well, I think the nutritional factors in the diabetes, in the bird's yeast, are offset by some potential toxic factors.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
The starch, the high phosphorus content, and the estrogen

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
are things that you have to take into account.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
If you're just curing something over a period of a few weeks,

35:18.000 --> 35:25.440
you don't worry about nutritional imbalances and allergic reactions and such.

35:25.440 --> 35:36.080
But I think it's better to get the same nutrients from fruit, eggs, and liver, and milk, rather

35:36.080 --> 35:43.080
than counting on brewer's yeast to do it, because of the possible toxic effects from

35:43.080 --> 35:44.760
eating too much brewer's yeast.

35:44.760 --> 35:48.800
Okay. And I know this is a really, this is not a fair question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.

35:48.800 --> 35:54.000
If there was one thing that you would tell someone, especially a child who had diabetes,

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
if there was one thing they should eliminate from their diet, what would that be?

35:57.000 --> 35:58.500
Oils.

35:58.500 --> 36:02.000
Okay, but that would not include coconut oil, I'm assuming.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
No, butter and coconut oil are pretty safe.

36:05.000 --> 36:14.800
They have about 2 or 3 percent of the dangerous fats, but those are a minimal danger compared

36:14.800 --> 36:17.600
to the benefits of the saturated fats.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.600
Our phone lines are lighting up here, Dr. Peat.

36:19.600 --> 36:21.000
We only have a few minutes left.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.080
Somebody called in and asked the question if they already have a goiter or are taking

36:25.080 --> 36:30.640
these various life-supporting substances that you recommend, pregnenolone, progesterone,

36:30.640 --> 36:34.320
thyroid hormone, and coconut oil, is there any danger in taking that if somebody has

36:34.320 --> 36:35.880
an existing goiter?

36:35.880 --> 36:36.880
Yeah.

36:36.880 --> 36:52.340
I think people who have a noticeably enlarged thyroid gland should use a thyroid supplement or a good, simple

36:52.340 --> 37:02.160
protective diet until they have shrunk the gland before they use any of the steroid supplements

37:02.160 --> 37:08.920
such as progesterone, because I've known a few people who did have a huge gland

37:11.080 --> 37:15.840
who took progesterone and it normalized

37:15.840 --> 37:20.840
the function of the gland so that it was able

37:21.240 --> 37:29.000
to secrete the hormone instead of storing it, but they went into a hyperthyroid

37:29.000 --> 37:36.200
state, and since they knew what was happening, they didn't worry about it.

37:36.200 --> 37:47.480
But when women, usually in their early twenties or around menopause, when they go into a hyperthyroid

37:47.480 --> 37:56.880
state with a 125 resting pulse, for example, and extreme amounts of sweating and oily skin

37:56.880 --> 38:07.680
and so on, doctors will immediately want to destroy their thyroid, but when they know that the gland is normalizing itself, then

38:07.680 --> 38:14.440
they can just set it out for sometimes two to four, five weeks as the gland unloads.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.440
Well, that's so fascinating.

38:15.440 --> 38:18.440
Well, we have a caller on the line.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.320
Aloha, welcome to the Source Nutritional Radio Show.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.840
You had a question for our guest today, Dr. Raymond Peat.

38:23.840 --> 38:30.000
Yes, I had two and I'll listen on the radio. What then do you think is the best ratio between

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
omega-6 and omega-3? And also, have you ever heard of leptin?

38:36.000 --> 38:44.000
Leptin, yeah, leptin is part of the inflammation promoting system.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
They said it was a sticky protein.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
A what?

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
A sticky protein that disrupts a lot of things in your body.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
She says it's a sticky protein?

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Leptin, that's L-E-P-T-I-N?

39:00.000 --> 39:12.280
Yes. in. It's a little peptide produced by the fat cells, which it was promoted by the drug

39:12.280 --> 39:21.220
industry 10 or 15 years ago as a cure for obesity, but then it turned out that it also

39:21.220 ---> 39:23.000
promotes inflammation and cancer.
