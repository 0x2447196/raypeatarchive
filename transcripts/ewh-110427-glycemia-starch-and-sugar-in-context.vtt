 Need one more reason why your Safeway store is just better?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.100
 How about free Cuisinart Classic Cutlery or Elite Flatware?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.700
 That's right! For every $10 you spend, earn a free stamp saver you can redeem for Cuisinart items.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.800

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.700
 available at the in-store display.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.000
 Present your items and stamp saver at checkout.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 It's simple. Spend $10, get your free stamp saver, start collecting.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
 Safeway. It's just better.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.200
 Love.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:46.500
 You're listening to Holistic Living, brought to you by EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.200
 And now, here are your hosts, Josh and Jeanne Rubin.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.500
 What up, everyone? This is Josh and Jeanne Rubin from EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 For some reason, at the beginning of every show, we have a problem with that little intro that we have.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 And it's so great, but who cares?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.400
 Welcome again for a great show.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.200
 We're going to have Ray P. on once again.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.300
 And prior to me doing his intro and talking about the show, of course, I want to tell you a little bit about what we do.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:22.200
 For those of you who don't know what we do or who we are, we own a â€“ we say a wellness company down in San Diego area, Carlsbad, California.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.100
 We work with people that have GI problems, hormone problems, you know, physical problems, a little back pain,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.400
 things like that from all over the world.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.100
 And we get clients as far away as Norway, Israel, Switzerland.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 So we work with a lot of clients via Skype, long distance, phone, as well as in person.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.800
 So check out our website at EastWestHealing.com if you want to learn more about what we do,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.900
 as well as check out our webpage because there's a lot of great resources on there, websites, articles, YouTube, things like that.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 And you can get linked from our website to our YouTube page, blog, Facebook, all those great things.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 Stay tuned as well, our website in the next three months is going to be changing dramatically.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.900
 So we're really excited about that.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.300
 We're going to be launching some products and things like that.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.900
 Definitely stay tuned.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.100
 So today's show, once again, is we're going to have Ray Pion.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.500
 We're going to be talking about basically sugar and really kind of dispelling some of the myths about sugar,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.900
 and really talking about why we need sugar, the types of sugar, and what Ray's thoughts are on sugar.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:32.900
 And for those of you that don't know Ray or what he's about, you can visit his website at RayPeat.com, R-A-Y P-E-A-T.com.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.900
 Ray is, has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, and he specializes in physiology.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.900
 He's taught at many schools from the University of Oregon to different naturopathic schools, to other schools down in Mexico.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.900
 And he started his work in regards to hormones, such as progesterone and things like that back in the 1960s.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.900
 So if you want to learn more about him, definitely check out his website.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 He's got a lot of great articles.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.900
 They're very in-depth.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.900
 He does have a lot of good books that you can buy.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.900
 They're on back order right now because he's just a little bit, I guess, overwhelmed and inundated by e-mails.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.900
 So before we get them on, one thing I wanted to bring up was, once again,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.900
 you know, for a lot of people, they're e-mailing Ray, and they're e-mailing Ray.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 And the thing about Ray is he's a very humble guy from how I know Ray,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.900
 and he's going to keep basically answering your e-mails, and he's going to keep doing it.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 And the problem is, this is the reason why he's put up sending the books, because he's super busy.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.900
 So I've said before, all this great information, you know, he's kind of a scientist.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
 He's not a nutritionist.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.900
 And all this information is due to, obviously, being able to do the research.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.900
 So all I ask, this is not what he asked, this is all I ask, that if you keep e-mailing him

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.900
 and he keeps sending you e-mails back, you can go to his website, you can find his address,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.900
 and all I'm asking, or all me and Gina are asking is, send him some money.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.900
 I don't care if it's a dollar.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.900
 I don't care if it's $5, $10, or $500.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.900
 Please send him something because this great information can't get out unless he can do the research.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.900
 And the more time you take, essentially, for free, in a sense, he can't do this research.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.900
 So please, and I know for a fact people are not doing it because I've talked to people that is very excited about,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.900
 oh, they send me back all this information, I'm reading it over, it's a super long e-mail,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900
 and then I ask if they sent him anything and they say no.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 So please, please send him something.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900
 So let me get Ray and Gina on.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.900
 Let me see if I can click them in.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.900
 I think we're in, Josh.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 We've been on.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 Yes.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900
 Yeah, I can hear you.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.900
 Are you there, Ray?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.900
 Yes.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900
 So, Ray, I don't know if you want to add anything to what Josh was just expressing,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.900
 and I'm not sure exactly what your thoughts are on that.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 We just want to make sure that people are respectful of your time and energy.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.900
 Yeah, I'm sending fewer very long answers now that more people are writing.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 I'm trying to condense my answers.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.900
 Yeah.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.900
 Yeah.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.900
 Awesome.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.900
 Well, we appreciate that you take the time to do so.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.900
 I know we've got a lot of people's interest as far as what it is you do

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.900
 and what you've learned through your research.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.900
 So, again, we appreciate that.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.900
 Yeah.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.900
 And I know a lot of people appreciate it too because, you know,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.900
 our listeners on the show and inquiries we get in regards to your stuff,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900
 the buzz is out, and you're definitely making a difference.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 And I know -- well, my perception is that's kind of what you want.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 So it's great stuff.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.900
 So we definitely appreciate it.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.900
 So hoping everyone heard that.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:36.900
 So let's talk about sugar, starch, glycemia, all these important things.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.900
 Or I should say, you know, it's in our industry.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.900
 This is probably the one topic that really people are interested in because there's so much out there.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.900
 So I guess starting off before we get to nitty-gritty, you know,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.900
 there's many different types of sugars, and you can kind of touch on that.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.900
 I'm sure we'll touch upon it.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.900
 But you have so many people out there saying don't eat sugar.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900
 Sugar's in everything.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.900
 It's going to take away from it, cause diabetes, cause insulin resistance,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.900
 creates cancer, and increases ages in the body.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.900
 You know, you name it, it's bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.900
 And then we look at your research, and it's completely different.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.900
 Now, of course, we have to talk about the type of sugar,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.900
 but kind of what got you started on really focusing on starch or sugar or glycemia?

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.900
 One of the things was reading John Yudkin's book,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.900
 the English guy who wrote a book saying that sugar causes heart disease.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.900
 And he was very clear showing that sugar increases cholesterol,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:44.900
 and that was back in the time when everyone was saying cholesterol causes heart disease.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.900
 And I was very impressed by his research.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:58.900
 But since I saw cholesterol as a protective factor from studying progesterone,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.900
 I saw that if you were deficient in progesterone or under stress,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:11.900
 your body would increase production of cholesterol to make more progesterone to protect your systems.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.900
 And so I believed Yudkin was on the right track.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.900
 And since I saw cholesterol as protective rather than harmful,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:30.900
 I took his evidence to mean that sugar would help resist stress.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.900
 So that started me along that line.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.900
 And I had been a migrainer for all my life,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:50.900
 and I gradually came to see that a change in my rhythm of eating in relation to activity

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.900
 was usually what brought on a migraine attack.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:04.900
 And often I would have very odd food cravings just before the migraine appeared,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.900
 and even shortly after eating I would get food cravings.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:16.900
 And I started trusting those cravings and eating again,

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:24.900
 and I found that if I ate enough sweet stuff like a quart of ice cream when I felt a migraine coming on,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.900
 it wouldn't come on.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.900
 And I was also a sort of a problem sleeper.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.900
 If I stayed up just an hour or two after my normal bedtime,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:44.900
 then my sleep would be disturbed even for a couple of following nights.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:52.900
 And one night I was talking on the radio, and I wanted to keep going hour after hour,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:59.900
 and I had a friend go out and buy me huge milkshakes about one an hour,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:07.900
 and I was able to keep talking until 1 a.m. and didn't have any problem at all going to sleep.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:20.900
 And so I recognized that I had a peculiar need for sugar when I was doing anything unusually stressful.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:29.900
 And so that started me thinking more about the physiology of it.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.900
 Now, there's so many myths out there about it that when I say "it,"

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.900
 I think we have to start elaborating, I guess, on the types of sugars, you know, monosaccharide, ditachoride,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.900
 or whether it's a fruit or if we're just talking straight sugar.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.900
 Now, there's so many myths out there.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:53.900
 I guess getting into the physiology, most people don't advocate using carbs/sugars to actually increase health.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.900
 I mean, most people out there, like the paleo diet, are saying high protein, low carb.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:03.900
 And all these people say if you want to lose weight, which we know that doesn't mean it's healthy, eat high protein, low carb.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.900
 And you kind of go the other way in a sense.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.900
 Now, physiologically, what's the importance of getting the sugars in our body?

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:17.900
 At one time, I was experimenting with chocolate as a source of magnesium.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:25.900
 And I found that bitter chocolate, like coffee, was extremely high in magnesium and some other nutrients.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:33.900
 But chocolate happens to be very high in leucine, and it would give me low blood sugar,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:42.900
 and I would crave something to eat very shortly after eating a lump of black chocolate.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:50.900
 And that started me thinking about the amino acids in relation to blood sugar.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:58.900
 And I saw that several of the amino acids in proteins are powerful insulin stimulants.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:12.900
 And when you eat protein by itself, you stimulate insulin secretion, which is needed to metabolize the amino acids.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:22.900
 But in reaction to the insulin, your liver has to put out glucose to keep your blood sugar going,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:28.900
 so your brain and blood cells and kidneys and so on can keep working.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:40.900
 And if your liver is somewhat low on glycogen, then every time you eat protein and have an insulin secretion,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:49.900
 your body secretes a compensating amount of cortisol to bring your blood sugar back up.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:55.900
 But the cortisol brings your blood sugar up at the expense of protein.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:05.900
 And so partly cortisol, the first tissues that cortisol breaks down are your thymus, gland,

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.900
 and other immune cells and the muscles.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:15.900
 And if you eat lots of protein, in spite of the high cortisol,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:23.900
 you can keep your balance such that you are replacing your muscles and thymus gland,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:31.900
 but you are running on a constantly high cortisol secretion.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:44.900
 And my previous interest in diabetes, I had seen that doctors simply neglected to measure hormones

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:51.900
 that were related to blood sugar when they would prescribe insulin.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.900
 Calling a person a diabetic, they said they needed to take insulin the rest of their life.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:07.900
 But having some of these people test their cortisol, we saw that very many of these so-called diabetics

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:17.900
 just had very high cortisol, and sugar happens to be the best thing for lowering cortisol to normal.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:26.900
 And since high cortisol gives the impression of diabetes causing high blood sugar,

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:34.900
 you get the unexpected effect of when you eat sugar, you lower the cortisol.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:42.900
 And some of these people had a very quick recovery from their so-called diabetes.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.900
 Now, I wrote a couple of things down besides the 20-plus questions I have.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.900
 Talking about cortisol, I'll take a little tangent here.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.900
 There's so much out there on adrenal fatigue.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.900
 In my perception over the years is a lot of people took Hans Helier's work

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.900
 and kind of misperceived what he was putting out in regards to his general adaptation syndrome.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.900
 And you talk about high cortisol and using sugar to actually lower cortisol.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.900
 What about people that have low cortisol?

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:16.900
 Is that possible or is that just a fluctuation of maybe being hypoglycemic?

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:22.900
 In Helier's studies, he never talked about adrenal fatigue.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:29.900
 Exhaustion was his word when you would stress an animal terribly.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:38.900
 The first couple of days it would get ulcers, and if it didn't bleed to death, it might adapt.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:46.900
 But if you kept the stress up, you would eventually kill the rat from stress.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:55.900
 And he had the different phases, the shock, the adaptation, and the exhaustion phases.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.900
 And in the exhaustion phase, the animal would die from stress.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:10.900
 And he very early in his studies found that pregnant animals didn't need their adrenal glands.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.900
 And as soon as they would have a litter, then the next stress would kill them

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:24.900
 because their progesterone was no longer being produced to compensate for the adrenal absence.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:36.900
 And so he gave some animals a daily dose of progesterone after taking out their adrenal glands

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:44.900
 and found that they would live a full, normal, healthy life lacking their adrenals absolutely.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:50.900
 So the adrenals are there to regulate your sugar and salt,

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:59.900
 and it happens that progesterone just as nicely regulates sugar and salt metabolism.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:07.900
 And to produce these hormones, either progesterone or the adrenal hormones,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:15.900
 you need various nutrients, but especially to convert cholesterol into pregnenolone

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:24.900
 and then the other steroids, the essential factors are thyroid hormone and vitamin A.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.900
 And those are so closely connected that they travel in the blood on the same protein

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:38.900
 and are taken up by the steroid synthesizing cells on that protein,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.900
 transported right into the mitochondrion for enzymes.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:53.900
 And you use those to convert cholesterol into the pregnenolone and the other steroids.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:17:03.900
 So if a person is deficient in vitamin A or thyroid, their cholesterol tends to rise,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:11.900
 trying to compensate for the deficient ability to produce the adaptive hormones.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:20.900
 So with a thyroid or nutritional deficiency, you can be deficient in the steroid hormones,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:26.900
 but it isn't the fault of the adrenal glands.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.900
 The adrenal glands are extremely adaptive.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:37.900
 When someone wants an animal that can't produce adrenaline,

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:44.900
 since the core of the adrenal gland is where adrenaline is produced,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:51.900
 they would scoop out the contents in the adrenal capsule, including the cortex,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:59.900
 and there would be a layer of adrenal cortical cells left in this capsule,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:07.900
 and within just a few days, the adrenal cortex hormones would have regenerated.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.900
 So you can basically destroy the adrenals.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:17.900
 And if you have a few cells left and have good nutrition and thyroid function,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.900
 the adrenal cortex will regenerate very well.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.900
 Right. And I think it's important for everyone to know,

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.900
 the reason we're talking about this kind of caveat is because cortisol is a glucocorticoid.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.900
 It's going to regulate blood sugar, and so many people are doing labs and saying,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.900
 "I need supplements," when we need to look at blood sugar.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.900
 Are we eating the right foods?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.900
 Are we eating the wrong foods that we can't even break down?

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.900
 Are we eating foods that block sugar from getting in the cell?

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:49.900
 Yes. That's where fructose and sucrose come in,

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:58.900
 because fructose is the most powerful sugar at regulating blood sugar both up and down.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:09.900
 It's been used in diabetics for decades as a small supplement to help bring down their blood sugar,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:19.900
 but it also is effective in hypoglycemia because it helps to regulate insulin production

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:26.900
 and slowly turns into glucose, helping to regulate glucose use,

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.900
 whether you're low or high as the starting point.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.900
 Can you give some examples for people that are listening and might not know,

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.900
 like where would they get fructose?

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.900
 Oh, health food stores used to sell pure fructose.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:50.900
 I don't know if they still do since the sort of mania about it has started or the phobia.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:20:01.900
 But I think some bakeries use it, but I don't recommend it in any of those prepared foods

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:13.900
 because it's almost always combined with starches, and starches have a very quick ability to turn into glucose,

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:26.900
 where fructose is a very slow, controlled converter into glucose, and so it regulates insulin.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.900
 I want to take another little caveat because you were talking about insulin earlier

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:35.900
 and something a lot of people get confused about, and it even kind of confused me at the time,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.900
 is in your article you talk about insulin,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:45.900
 and you talk about how insulin itself has been found to account for only about 8% of the insulin-like activity in the blood,

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.900
 with potassium being probably the largest factor.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.900
 Can you elaborate on that a little bit for everyone?

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:59.900
 Yeah. Several things imitate the function of insulin.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:13.900
 For example, if a diabetic exercises, just whatever the exercise is doing is increasing the cell's ability to take up and use glucose,

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:19.900
 the leucine in some foods like chocolate acts like insulin

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:29.900
 and will duplicate the functions of insulin to let you use your sugar faster.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:37.900
 But potassium in these studies, they found that potassium itself has that effect,

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:46.900
 and that's probably one of the things involved in exercise insulin-like action.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:22:00.900
 And since fruits are one of the best sources of potassium, that is another thing that makes fruits a good food.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:08.900
 Usually they have about 50/50 fructose and glucose.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:17.900
 A sucrose molecule is one half fructose and half glucose.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.900
 And besides that balance between glucose and sucrose,

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:30.900
 the fruits always contain a lot of potassium and some other minerals.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.900
 Magnesium is another one that helps regulate glucose.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:44.900
 So when you take, for example, orange juice or grape juice or the fruits,

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:52.900
 the high potassium content reduces the amount of insulin you have to secrete to handle those.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:23:05.900
 And that accounts for why they're much more smoothly handled than a similar number of calories in the form of starch.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.900
 Right.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.900
 So kind of going with that, you know, obviously we know that you're an advocate of sucrose,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.900
 and we'll talk about the different types, but you're talking about fruit.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.900
 I guess for the listeners, what types of fruits do you recommend,

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.900
 and which ones do you think, I guess, could hurt us versus help us?

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.900
 Because I know one of your biggest things is everyone out there is looking at what is good for us,

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.900
 kind of your philosophy, and I don't want to speak for you, but it's almost like what actually can hurt us.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.900
 So maybe talking about some of the fruits that you think are beneficial and why in regards to sucrose,

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.900
 but also some of the fruits that could actually be not beneficial for us.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:55.900
 There are -- almost all of the sweet fruits are on balance better than the alternative of eating bread

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.900
 and pasta and cereals and such.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:10.900
 But among the sweet fruits, there are some factors that make a choice possible.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:20.900
 For example, bananas, unless they're ripened to the point that they're sort of a translucent amber mush,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:30.900
 the average way people eat bananas is almost all starch with enough sugar to make them pleasant tasting.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:44.900
 But the high starch content is not an ideal food, not only because it has a great tendency to stimulate insulin,

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:53.900
 but also because when you don't eat it with a lot of fat, the starch grains actually can get into your bloodstream,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:02.900
 and large starch grains are often bigger than red blood cells, so they clog your small arterioles

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:08.900
 and cause chronic tissue injury.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.900
 Gerhard Volkheimer was the person who did that,

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:20.900
 and some of his articles with very nice photographs, micro photographs of plugged arteries

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:37.900
 and of the starch grains actually in process of being absorbed into the bloodstream and lymph system are on the Internet.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:46.900
 Besides the starch problem with some fruits such as bananas, you have the allergy problem,

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:54.900
 and I think that's partly because of the industrialization of banana farming,

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:03.900
 use of a lot of chemicals, and just overuse of the soil stresses the plants.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:13.900
 And you've heard of the latex allergy, probably corresponding to the banana allergy.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:22.900
 Both of those, the rubber trees and the banana plants are both highly industrialized, stressed crops,

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:33.900
 and I think it's the defensive stress substances that the plants evolved to kill insects that were attacking them.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:47.900
 Those highly cropped species produce this insecticidal enzyme, which happens to be highly allergenic to humans.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:59.900
 And so even apples, some brands of apples have quite a high allergen content,

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.900
 and cooking many of the allergenic fruits makes them safer to eat.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.900
 And the same with the starches.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:14.900
 Very well cooked starchy fruits are much safer than the raw fruits.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:23.900
 And a third factor in fruits to watch out for is the serotonin content.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:35.900
 Bananas, again, excel in their high serotonin content, which has, before people were aware of it,

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:44.900
 they were diagnosing intestinal tumors when they found high serotonin content in the urine,

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.900
 because some tumors produce excess serotonin.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:28:01.900
 And if you eat bananas or prunes and plums, kiwis, several types of fruit are high in serotonin,

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:11.900
 so that's just one factor to be aware of, but starch and allergens are probably generally more important.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:27.900
 And pretty much that leaves some things like watermelons and grapes and citrus fruits, oranges in particular.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:35.900
 Now, do you -- would you put mangoes in the allergy category and the pineapples in the banana serotonin category?

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:45.900
 Yeah, pineapples are known to have a fairly high amount of tryptophan that can contribute to the serotonin.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:53.900
 And mangoes, I'm not sure -- they're in the same family as poison oak.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:29:03.900
 And in the tropics, after I had enjoyed about a kilogram of mangoes, some people said,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.900
 "Oh, didn't you know about mango sickness?"

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:16.900
 And it's well known in the tropics, but I think it's partly that they are sort of a fibrous fruit,

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:30.900
 and partly if the fiber isn't handled by the right bacteria, it can cause toxin production in the intestine.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:41.900
 My next newsletter is going to be relating to the issue of fiber, soluble fiber or anything,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:54.900
 any carbohydrate that isn't sugar can potentially feed bacteria that produce toxins and cause systemic stress.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.900
 Awesome. We look forward to that one.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.900
 I want to talk about the gut, but talk a little bit more about serotonin.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:07.900
 I'm not sure where I read this, and I could have read it incorrectly, but you talk about CO2,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:15.900
 and when you talk about hibernation in relation to serotonin, but also glucose in the body playing a factor in that.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:21.900
 And I don't know if it was -- if you're having low glucose blood sugar levels and you're releasing the cortisol,

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:28.900
 and you go into that gluconeogenesis state and you break down your tissues, if you have that excess serotonin,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.900
 I'm not sure where I'm going, but what's the connection between all that?

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:41.900
 Serotonin, like endotoxin and histamine, serotonin is a major trigger of the stress adaptation system,

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:55.900
 and so it turns on the hypothalamic protein hormone that turns on the pituitary hormone that turns on the adrenals.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:02.900
 So serotonin works at a very basic level to increase the stress reaction.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:14.900
 And the Internet is full of people saying that sugar will raise your serotonin,

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:20.900
 but I think what they're meaning is that you feel good after you eat a bunch of sugar,

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:27.900
 and feeling good is supposed to mean that your serotonin is up,

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:37.900
 but actually it's free fatty acids which cause your brain to take up more tryptophan and make more serotonin,

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:45.900
 and you produce more free fatty acids when your blood sugar is low and when you're under stress.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:54.900
 So stress or starvation, hypoglycemia, will make you produce these free fatty acids

00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:06.900
 which will send serotonin into your brain and trigger the adaptive stress reaction which brings out the cortisol.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.900
 So if we're not eating the right foods, we're not getting enough sugar, protein, fat, whatever,

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.900
 we're not storing it, which we should talk about.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.900
 There's a question from a listener that emailed me and wanted to know,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:23.900
 if they want to lose weight, is it important to actually metabolize fatty acids and use fat for energy?

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.900
 And you're actually saying the opposite of most people, it's actually harmful.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.900
 Can you elaborate a little bit more on the dangers of liberating free fatty acids

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.900
 besides the whole serotonin connection?

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:46.900
 When you're at rest, the resting muscle is metabolizing a very small amount of fuel,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:54.900
 just a maintenance amount, but its fuel at rest is fatty acid.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:02.900
 And at maximal activity, you are burning almost pure sugar.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:14.900
 So at rest, the fat is being handled by your muscles and not causing any great rise in free fatty acids.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.900
 The muscles use it just about as fast as it's released.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:31.900
 But if your liver is well energized with thyroid hormone, all the nutrients including adequate sugar,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:42.900
 your liver is able to treat any excess free fatty acids produced by stress as any other toxin,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:53.900
 and your liver can attach glucuronic acid to these fatty acids and excrete them in the urine and bile,

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:58.900
 just as if it was insecticide or something you had eaten.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.900
 So a healthy liver, keeping your liver well energized with thyroid and sugar,

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:11.900
 will gradually help you get rid of stored fat.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:22.900
 And when you exercise on, for example, a low carbohydrate diet

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:28.900
 and start mobilizing more and more of these free fatty acids,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:34.900
 some of them at an extreme will turn into ketones.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:41.900
 And the ketones are good, safe energy for your brain and heart.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.900
 It's the free fatty acids that don't turn into ketones which are harmful.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:57.900
 The problem with most of the free fatty acids is that on our current or 20th century diet,

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:04.900
 these tissues are pretty well filled with polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:13.900
 And these, when they're liberated, instead of supporting the full high-reach metabolism,

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:20.900
 they suppress the mitochondrial metabolism by interfering with the thyroid hormone

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.900
 in proportion to how unsaturated they are.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:32.900
 And so as soon as you get stressed enough to start eating your own stored fats,

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.900
 these stored fats, if they're polyunsaturated,

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:41.900
 happen to block the thyroid function and turn your metabolism down.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.900
 And so within two or three days of going on a diet,

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:56.900
 a person's metabolic rate drops so tremendously that at the end of 10 to 14 days,

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:02.900
 they have lost very little weight, but almost all of that weight is muscle tissue

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:07.900
 because of the stress produced by the low blood sugar.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:14.900
 So when they put people on a moderate low-calorie diet for the same length of time,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:20.900
 they find that they lose mostly fat and very little protein tissue.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:32.900
 So it's the degree of the free fatty acids being mobilized that suppress your ability to burn calories.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.900
 Right. I hope everyone kind of gets that.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.900
 But the bottom line is if you don't take in the right types of sugars,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:43.900
 you actually facilitate the stress reaction, which facilitates the catabolic reaction.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.900
 And if you're storing toxins in your liver or gut, you can't detoxify them.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.900
 If you have polyunsaturated fatty acids in your tissues and you start breaking down your tissues,

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.900
 you lose weight because you're losing muscle mass,

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.900
 but now you're just perpetuating the stress cycle,

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.900
 which actually will downregulate the immune system and the thyroid.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:05.900
 So you might "be losing weight," but you're actually doing it in a very unhealthy way.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.900
 I want to go back to the fruits a little bit because I know you talk about ripe fruits a lot,

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.900
 and I want you to touch on that for the listeners,

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:20.900
 but also when you talk about oranges or orange juice, why you recommend no pulp.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:26.900
 This next month's newsletter is going to discuss that,

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:33.900
 but basically it's that any pulp is a potential food for bacteria.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:39.900
 They did experiments with rats, giving them various kinds of fiber.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:48.900
 Many of the most popular health food fibers increased the toxin formation in their intestines,

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:57.900
 and they found that with fiber added to the diet, fiber that could be fermented by bacteria,

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:03.900
 the animals became both anxious and aggressive.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:17.900
 Just leaving that fermentable fiber out, the animals were friendly and confident.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:28.900
 The commercial orange juice in the last few years, there have been new technologies developed.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:34.900
 You might have noticed that there's more pulpy orange juice on the market.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:42.900
 I think it was about 15 years ago the Environmental Protection Agency told the industry

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:53.900
 that their mountains of waste from making orange juice were attracting too many insects and other pests,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.900
 and they had to find a way to dispose of it.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:05.900
 One of the technologies that they used to dispose of it was to dissolve it with enzymes

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:13.900
 and to leave a large part of the pulp dissolved in the orange juice.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:22.900
 When you squeeze a ripe orange naturally, if you let it stand in a glass in the fridge for a few hours,

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.900
 the bottom will be orange and the top will be clear,

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:32.900
 but much of the commercial orange juice, the fiber has been chemically altered

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.900
 so that it will never settle out.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:43.900
 It's actually a new chemical substance that people have never eaten before.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:52.900
 It's like any of the other gums or fibers that can be intestinal toxins.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.900
 Right. It's almost like caromaginizing the juice.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:03.900
 Many of these fibers that people were thinking they were eating to protect against colon cancer,

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:15.900
 some of them actually increase the incidence of colon cancer in experimental animals.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.900
 So now they're using humans to dispose of all the -- everything.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.900
 Instead of throwing it out for the insects, we're just becoming the disposal.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.900
 That's great. Cool. Awesome.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.900
 It's the same thing that happened in the fish industry.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:38.900
 The fish factories, canneries were creating mountains of either land polluting fish waste

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:44.900
 or they were dumping it in the oceans and creating messes in the surrounding ocean.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:55.900
 And they were told to clean up their factories and getting rid of the various components of the waste

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.900
 that contributed to the marketing of fish oil.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.900
 Right. Amazing.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.900
 Now, going back to the thymus, I know at least what I've read,

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.900
 everyone says as we age our thymus shrinks, yada, yada, yada.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.900
 And you talk about how -- I'm not sure what article, and I could be quoting it incorrectly --

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.900
 how as we age, your thoughts are because of poo-fizz and radiation and all these different things,

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.900
 and because we're basically not getting the right types of sugars,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:28.900
 and we're in this catabolic state -- lost my train of thought here --

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.900
 that we basically -- we'll actually shrink the thymus because we're in that stressed state,

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.900
 and it's not normal for that to happen.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:40.900
 Maybe that's why we're seeing all these autoimmune diseases or people in a weakened state.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:46.900
 Yeah, one of the functions of cortisol is to maintain blood sugar,

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:54.900
 but one of the ways it does that is to block the use of sugar for most purposes.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.900
 Red cells can keep using it in the presence of cortisol,

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:08.900
 but immune cells that the thymus consists of mostly can't use sugar in the presence of cortisol,

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:15.900
 and the presence of cortisol forces them to metabolize fats,

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:21.900
 and especially unsaturated fats will quickly kill the thymus.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:31.900
 And it only takes -- I think it's about three hours typically for the thymus gland to disappear during profound stress.

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:41.900
 And so if a person is killed really instantly at a young age, they'll still have a thymus gland,

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:48.900
 but if it takes them a few hours to die, the thymus gland disappears,

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:59.900
 and that's really part of the reason that they've thought that the thymus disappears in adulthood

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:08.900
 because by the time a person is dead, they will have gone through some stress that melts the thymus gland very quickly.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:20.900
 And given the right nutrition and hormones, the thymus can almost as quickly regenerate itself.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.900
 Interesting. Huh.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.900
 Yeah, I mean, it's amazing how many people have adrenal fatigue or have an autoimmune disease,

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:36.900
 and it's amazing that people aren't looking at physiologically what the body's not getting.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:41.900
 And a lot of the times, like you say, people's meals are either fat deficient or protein loaded.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:49.900
 A lot of times, carb deficient, meaning the wrong types of carbs or sugars per se.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.900
 So talking about fruits and things like that, you know, you talk about fruit juices,

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.900
 you've talked about which things to stay away from because serotonin content in the fiber,

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.900
 you know, so people know what fruits -- what about vegetables in regards to sugars?

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.900
 What's your thoughts on the different vegetables?

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.900
 We've talked about polyunsaturated fatty acids, so I don't want to go tremendous into that,

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.900
 but what about like -- what are some of the vegetables you recommend and why?

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:21.900
 Well, the low fiber, low starch things, there are a few of them that are called vegetables.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:27.900
 For example, small summer squash, they're actually fruits,

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:36.900
 but since they end up more starchy, they're usually thought of as a vegetable.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:46.900
 But if you eat a tender summer squash with some butter, the small amount of starch in it,

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:52.900
 if it's well cooked and eaten with butter, it's very similar to eating fruit,

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:59.900
 high potassium content, high magnesium.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:03.900
 So would you say that most of the vegetables you recommend are either very close to the ground

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.900
 or even below the ground?

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:14.900
 Yeah, generally the roots don't have -- fruits are almost designed as food.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:23.900
 They're food for the seeds, and so they aren't designed as a tissue that has to replace itself,

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:28.900
 like the leaves are part of the energy factory of the plant.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:36.900
 And the roots are essential, but they're protected against grazing animals, for example,

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:46.900
 and so they have antifungal chemicals more than anti-grazing animal chemicals.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:58.900
 And so aside from those mild toxins that are mostly directed at bacteria and fungus,

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:06.900
 the roots are pretty free of the plant defensive toxins.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:15.900
 And so if they're cooked, for example, young turnips and young potatoes

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.900
 that haven't maximized their starch production,

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:26.900
 eaten with butter after being thoroughly cooked are pretty safe.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:35.900
 And potatoes are almost unique among the plant materials.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:45.900
 The liquid part of the potato in between the starch grains happens to have the equivalent

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.900
 of amino acids besides some protein.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:47:00.900
 These are keto acids, which are -- they can be used as fuel by the brain and heart

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:12.900
 as a substitute for sugar or fatty acids, and they're really an ideal anti-stress fuel.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:18.900
 But they can also be, just by attaching an ammonia group,

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:24.900
 they can be turned instantly into the essential amino acids as needed.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:31.900
 And so apart from the starch, the potato is a very amazing food.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:43.900
 And I've seen a few cases of people who had basically incurable problems, undiagnosed,

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:51.900
 but they were clearly dying, who just juicing a few pounds of potatoes and cooking the juice

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:58.900
 with a centrifugal juicer, you throw out the starch grains almost completely,

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.900
 and then you cook it just like you were scrambling an egg,

00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:09.900
 and the juice coagulates so it's sort of like limp mashed potatoes.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:17.900
 And this provides both energy and the essential amino acids,

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.900
 but without stimulating insulin or cortisol.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:30.900
 So it's sort of an emergency food for almost any stress problem.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:39.900
 R.L. Veitch is the famous ketone researcher who -- his ideas are now being applied

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:49.900
 to cure Alzheimer's disease because the ketones provide energy that the deteriorating brain

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.900
 can't get from either fat or sugar.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:49:02.900
 And so I think potato juice would be a fairly economical and safe way to get the ketones

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.900
 that Veitch has been recommending.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:13.900
 K. When using the potatoes, Ray, would you still suggest using it with a carbohydrate and a fat

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.900
 because it would be considered a protein or would it be used by itself?

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:21.900
 How exactly would you go about using that as a therapeutic tool for somebody?

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:30.900
 R.L. Well, the people that I've known who used it, one was a man who hadn't slept for months

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:42.900
 and had almost no mentality, but his sister made him a big bowl of the cooked juice,

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:48.900
 and before he finished the bowl, he was asleep.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:54.900
 It simply energized his brain enough that the stress hormones that he had been suffering from

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.900
 for months disappeared.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:02.900
 And another one was a girl who couldn't digest anything.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:09.900
 She tried all kinds of food, but she had wasted way to about 65 pounds.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.900
 Every time she would eat normal food, she would burp ammonia,

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:23.900
 and that was what gave me the idea because R.L. Veitch had used his synthetic ketones

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:32.900
 for treating kidney disease patients who had the problem of disposing of excess ammonia

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.900
 if they ate proteins.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:42.900
 And since I knew that potatoes contained the ketones, I made her some juice,

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:49.900
 and she ate it without burping ammonia and digested it perfectly well.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.900
 And just a few days of doing that and she was completely recovered,

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.900
 just went straight up to 130 pounds.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:05.900
 So, fascinating.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:13.900
 There are lots of tropical fruits that contain some, at least, of these same keto acids,

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:22.900
 but several times over the last several years I've tried to get together the stuff,

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:33.900
 but the chemical companies now won't sell even keto acids and such things to independent researchers

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:40.900
 because of the new homeland security laws.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.900
 Right.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.900
 Let's kind of skip a beat a little.

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:51.900
 What's your thoughts on honey and maple syrup?

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:58.900
 Honey is basically almost pure sugar with some minerals,

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.900
 and so it's a good food.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:11.900
 It isn't that much greater than just plain white sugar, but slightly nutritious.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:18.900
 And maple syrup is probably, chemically, it's probably more nutritious than honey.

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:25.900
 It has a very high potassium and good magnesium content,

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:30.900
 but the problem is that it's heat-treated, boiled down,

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:38.900
 and very hot oxygen-exposed glucose can make some allergens,

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:50.900
 so you have to be cautious with any of the dark, concentrated sugars like molasses from cane sugar

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:56.900
 or the maguey agave sugar, the same thing.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:02.900
 It's boiled down until it's potentially allergenic.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:05.900
 Now, when we brought it up, because we have a lot more questions,

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:10.900
 when we brought it up, let's talk a little bit about sugar itself, sucrose,

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.900
 which is that nice acronym, white table sugar,

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.900
 the white sugar that everyone says stay away from.

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:21.900
 You know, you've got people like Dr. Lustig talks about the toxicity of it,

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.900
 sugar, the bit of truth, I mean, everything bad about it.

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.900
 And then we have you who recommends it for particular reasons,

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:33.900
 and I think most people are probably listening in for this more than anything.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:39.900
 So, can you just kind of break down what it is, why you recommend it, how you use it,

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:46.900
 why you feel it doesn't cause diabetes, you know, I guess as much as you want?

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.900
 Okay.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:54:02.900
 For about 45 years now, the mechanism of how diabetes comes to exist has been understood.

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:19.900
 It was an Argentine who did the first studies that just sort of incidentally showed that sugar was actually protective against diabetes,

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:31.900
 but some Israeli researchers over the last 15 years or so have very clearly shown that it's the polyunsaturated fats.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:38.900
 This was very clearly set up by a man named Randle,

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:45.900
 and some people refer to it as the Randle cycle except there's no cycle involved.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:55.900
 He showed that as your free fatty acids increase, your ability to use glucose decreases,

00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:08.900
 and that has been seen in hospitalized patients when they give them an intravenous emulsion of soy oil, for example.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:17.900
 Within 15 minutes, their ability to metabolize glucose has practically disappeared.

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:25.900
 The Randle cycle is the instantaneous diabetogenic effect of the fatty acids,

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:35.900
 but if you do that chronically, you not only block the various tissue cells from using glucose,

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:46.900
 but you gradually overstress and poison the beta cells in the pancreas from being able to keep producing insulin.

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:54.900
 In some of the studies that I mentioned in a couple of newsletters,

00:55:54.900 --> 00:56:05.900
 they have found that sugar stimulates regeneration of the beta cells in the pancreas.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:08.900
 That was back in the 1940s, right?

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:17.900
 Well, that regeneration was just about five years ago, but it was in the 1940s

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:24.900
 that the first research was showing that sugar was protective.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.900
 So why do you think there's so much misconception?

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.900
 I mean, you have all these people saying it's bad.

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:34.900
 I mean, I have my theories on it, but it's a sucrose, so it's glucose or fructose,

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.900
 and how do you recommend people using it, or do you recommend people using it?

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:42.900
 And can you actually take too much of it in the body?

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:48.900
 Yeah. You can produce the toxic effects in the animals.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:57.900
 That's what so many people are doing, giving them 60% of their diet as sucrose or fructose.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:09.900
 And at that point, you can make them fat and get various signs that they interpret as harmful.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:14.900
 But a lot of these studies, even at the very high levels,

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:20.900
 they're exaggerating taking things as signs of harm,

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:25.900
 which are actually signs of adaptive, corrective functions

00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:35.900
 that if you extrapolate from their results that they get in five weeks or 10 weeks in animal studies,

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.900
 if you extrapolate the very data that they're publishing,

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:46.900
 it would look like the animals would have a better outcome at the end of their lifespan

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.900
 if they stayed on even the high fructose diets.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:58:00.900
 But there are a lot of these studies that are very clearly designed as propaganda against fructose,

00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.900
 and I don't have any idea what their motivation is,

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:12.900
 but they're biologically and biochemically irrational and irrelevant.

00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:20.900
 Probably about 100 people have sent me certain studies.

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:25.900
 Three or four studies in particular keep appearing.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.900
 Somehow they're circulating on the Internet.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:35.900
 And when you look at those studies that are being used as propaganda against fructose,

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:42.900
 they contain information that suggests even large amounts of fructose might be therapeutic.

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:55.900
 But going back 20 or 30 years, you see enough research that it's actually defining the mechanism

00:58:55.900 --> 00:59:03.900
 so you can somewhat judge how much fructose in the diet is safe.

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:13.900
 For example, there were studies in which they added to just a standard lab cow mixture,

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:26.900
 they would add the ability to drink, say, a 30% sucrose water, a very syrupy solution,

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:34.900
 or they could choose Coca-Cola plus their lab cow and drink as much as they wanted,

00:59:34.900 --> 00:59:41.900
 or different percentages, but usually a pretty high percent of sucrose in the diet.

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:49.900
 And these animals, given, for example, Coca-Cola or the equivalent in sucrose,

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:58.900
 were able to eat 50% more food than the animals on just the lab cow without getting fat.

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.900
 In other words, a tremendous increase in their metabolic rate.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:10.900
 And that's one of the clues to the protective therapeutic effects of fructose,

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:18.900
 is that it catalyzes your ability to oxidize glucose at a higher rate.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:24.900
 So for a failing heart, for example, or a damaged liver,

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:33.900
 it works like the active T3 part of the thyroid hormone to increase the production of ATP

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.900
 and get the cell going as a catalyst.

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:45.900
 And it doesn't really take very much fructose to have that boosting catalytic effect.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.900
 So there's -- I don't know what the minimum is,

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:55.900
 but just a very small percentage of your diet can have an extremely beneficial effect.

01:00:55.900 --> 01:01:02.900
 And then there's a middle range where it's still not clear how much is safe.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:09.900
 And then the extreme range where you're eating almost nothing but sucrose or fructose,

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:16.900
 where you do get some degenerative processes.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:26.900
 But those are being misrepresented really out of context by so many people.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:30.900
 Now, would you say it's not the sugars themselves,

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:36.900
 but it's our diet that's high in the unsaturated fats that essentially makes the sugars look bad?

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.900
 Yeah.

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:46.900
 When you look at the figures over the last 50 years for the national diet in the United States

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:53.900
 and a few other countries, a few people are saying that it's the high fructose corn syrup

01:01:53.900 --> 01:02:00.900
 or the white sugar or something that's causing these degenerative diseases, diabetes, obesity, and so on.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:14.900
 But the real figures show that what's increasing is calories and polyunsaturated fats and starches

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:22.900
 and actually a slight decrease in the proportion of the sugars in that total.

01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:31.900
 But the calorie consumption has increased, but mostly through starch and polyunsaturated fats.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:38.900
 And those are the things that I think are well established for causing obesity

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:42.900
 and a lot of the degenerative diseases.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:49.900
 In the case of insulin, it's very clear that it's polyunsaturated fats.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.900
 Because it blocks sugar from getting in the cells, so it keeps your blood sugar levels high all the time?

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.900
 Yeah.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.900
 Okay.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.900
 Well, it's not just that they're considering the amount of sugar that's been taken,

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:10.900
 but how phobic people are to sugar, how it's clearly not having an influence,

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.900
 looking at the numbers, just like you were saying, Ray.

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:14.900
 I've always thought that the same.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.900
 I just never knew how to -- just didn't know what it was I was looking at.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.900
 So it makes perfect sense with the shift in the diet.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:31.900
 Yeah, there are some studies that show that the toxic effect of these fibers

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:40.900
 that can cause anxiety, aggression, and bowel cancer, fats defend against those processes

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:44.900
 by probably suppressing bacterial growth.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:53.900
 And the best fats at suppressing bacterial and fungal growth in the intestine are the saturated fats.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:04:01.900
 So butter and coconut oil, for example, are protective against the fibers.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:07.900
 So it's important to include some of those in your daily intake.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:19.900
 If you get enough protein, 80 to 100 calories or more -- 80 to 100 grams per day or more,

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:28.900
 and if you consider the importance of fat and the essentiality of protein,

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.900
 then that leaves you only a certain amount for carbohydrate.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:42.900
 And that, I think, is where fruit sugar and other sugars are a safe bet,

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:47.900
 even if all the rest of your calories are in the form of fruit and other sugars.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:54.900
 I think that's safe, as long as you're getting your saturated fat and protein.

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.900
 Great.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.900
 Yeah, I think people need to realize it's all about balance.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:00.900
 He's not just saying eat carbohydrates by themselves.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.900
 We always say it's all about the balance of macronutrients, proteins, carbs, and fats,

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:10.900
 the right type, the right ratios at the right times, but always having them together.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:16.900
 One thing I noticed, Ray, is what are your thoughts on -- people are storing glycogen in their liver.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.900
 What would cause someone to not be able to store enough glycogen,

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:27.900
 or what would cause the liver's inability to release the glycogen?

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:32.900
 Well, thyroid deficiency is the most common reason for that.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:39.900
 The enzymes are very sensitive to the presence or absence of thyroid.

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:44.900
 Selenium is needed to activate the thyroid,

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:50.900
 and ultimately the other B vitamins and all the nutrients are needed.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:56.900
 But the most common problems are low thyroid and low selenium.

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.900
 But to use the selenium to activate the thyroid, you need glucose.

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:14.900
 And the fructose happens to be the best stimulant for the liver to store glycogen.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:23.900
 The current phobia people are talking about fructose increasing triglycerides,

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:32.900
 but before it does that, it powerfully helps the liver to replenish its glycogen stores.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:39.900
 And then if you eat too much, you can eat a lot of excess sugar,

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:50.900
 but since it stimulates your metabolic rate, it takes a big excess before you start converting much of it to the triglycerides.

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:55.900
 Those triglycerides are then available for storage in your fat tissue.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:05.900
 So the animal studies show that you can eat lots more calories in the form of sugar

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:14.900
 before you start storing the triglycerides in your adipose tissue.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:20.900
 So going off that and talking about the fructose in the liver, do you feel that there's a such thing as, you know,

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:21.900
 having an intolerance to these things?

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:26.900
 Because there's some people out there that say, "Oh, when I have fruit, it doesn't matter what I have it with,

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:32.900
 I just completely crash and I get spacey and I can't even have like one ounce of juice."

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:33.900
 What are your thoughts on that?

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:37.900
 I mean, can we have an intolerance to these things or no?

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:49.900
 Yeah, some people who have been low thyroid for a long time have bacteria living right up the top side of their intestine,

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:59.900
 right up near the stomach, and some people even get conditions that will support fungal growth in their stomach.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:13.900
 And those, usually about two or three people somewhere in the world are in that condition where if they drink juice,

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:22.900
 they'll get drunk because their stomach is brewing alcohol at a high rate.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:29.900
 But short of that, lots of people have a reaction from bacteria high up in the intestine,

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:35.900
 which are competing for their absorptive systems.

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:45.900
 The bacteria get the sugar as fast as they do, and usually the bacteria live in the lower parts of the intestine,

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:55.900
 and the sugar is usually absorbed very quickly in the upper part of the intestine and doesn't reach the bacteria.

01:08:55.900 --> 01:09:08.900
 So if someone has been under stress and low thyroid, they can have that bacterial problem that makes them sensitive to sugars.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:14.900
 So how do you work around that? Just introduce things a lot slower or just take other...

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:28.900
 It's probably analogous to the lactose problem. They talk about a lactase deficiency, but bacterial toxins injure the lining of the intestine.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:36.900
 These studies have, I think there was one or two that showed a similar effect with sucrose,

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:48.900
 but quite a few studies have shown that sickness can create the lactase deficiency.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:10:02.900
 Low thyroid, low progesterone, or a bacterial infection, those are three of the known factors that affect the intestine's ability to break down lactose.

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:16.900
 And so you can, besides using small amounts of milk, or in the case of the juice-sensitive people, small amounts,

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:26.900
 you would want to experiment with things that suppress the bacterial growth and replenish your thyroid and progesterone levels

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:33.900
 so that you can produce the proper sucrose and lactase enzymes.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:42.900
 And that's one of the things that the fungicidal root vegetables can do.

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:53.900
 Raw carrot contains its defensive antibiotics that allow it to live in moist soil without rotting.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:11:07.900
 And so if you grate a carrot or just eat raw carrots, you're suppressing a lot of these bacteria and fungi that will cause food reactions.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:16.900
 Another plant that grows in dark, moist conditions are the bamboo shoots.

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:26.900
 They're white because they haven't been exposed to the sunlight, and so they're growing in humid, warm conditions,

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:33.900
 and they are a good source of antibiotics.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.900
 Now, we've talked about it a couple times, but it keeps coming up, and I know it's a big topic for a lot of people.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:41.900
 And I know your view on it is very different than other people's views out there.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:47.900
 And this whole thing on candida, now we know that we actually have that inhabiting our GI system.

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.900
 It's a symbiotic relationship, and you have a lot of people out there saying,

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:56.900
 "Well, if you have a candida overgrowth, that you need to cut out all sugars from the diet."

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.900
 Now, what's your take on why do we get the overgrowth?

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:06.900
 And from what I've read, your belief -- I could be speaking wrong -- is because we're not getting enough sugar,

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.900
 because they feed on sugar.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900
 So they're not getting enough.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900
 They're going to overgrow to kind of go elsewhere.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.900
 It's almost like an immune system reaction.

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:28.900
 Rene Dubot, who was a bacteriologist mostly, mentioned that -- I think he had some pictures of the candida-type yeast,

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:30.900
 which were starved.

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:40.900
 And when they're fed sugar, if you have a lot of them in your stomach, you can get drunk on the fermenting sugars.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:48.900
 But in the intestine, normally, if they're living far enough up that they even get the sugar,

01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:53.900
 they should be way down in the lower intestine.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:13:01.900
 Your sugar should be absorbed in the upper couple of feet, two or three feet of intestine.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:09.900
 But if they do get sugar, the worst they can do is make ethanol.

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:15.900
 And ethanol in small amounts isn't at all harmful.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:27.900
 And Dubot showed that if you starve these yeasts that are just happily making some ethanol out of the sugar,

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:38.900
 when they don't get sugar, they start sending out pseudopods, or pseudohyphae, I think he calls them,

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:46.900
 which are invasive filaments that will sink into the intestine looking for sugar.

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:52.900
 And that's the point at which they can actually travel through your intestine

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:59.900
 and get into your systemic tissues looking for more glucose.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:09.900
 So really, having sugar in your diet, if you have a fair infestation of yeast for some reason in your intestine,

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:20.900
 sugar is a defensive means while you're trying to figure out how to get rid of the yeast,

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:27.900
 which carrots will usually do fairly quickly.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.900
 Interesting concept, yeah, I mean, there's so much out there,

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:35.900
 and I find there's so many people that are doing the "fungal diet" and actually it makes it worse.

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:41.900
 And then we find when they follow a lot of your philosophies, it actually downregulates it.

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:48.900
 And I think, of course, the hyperadrenaline, hypocortisol state has a lot to do with it downregulating that.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.900
 Just a little caveat, this is a question from a listener.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:57.900
 What are your thoughts on like Stevia and Xylitol, all these other "sweeteners" that everyone is pushing?

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.900
 Are they harmless? Are they harmful?

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:05.900
 In themselves, I think they're pretty harmless,

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:13.900
 but the problem is that there have been quite a few studies in both humans and animals

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:22.900
 in which the sweet taste activates your sugar metabolizing systems very powerfully.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:29.900
 And one of the consequences is that they tend to increase your appetite,

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:37.900
 and they make you eat or want more calories than if you had eaten sugar.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:43.900
 And so as a diet food, they're ineffective.

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:52.900
 And the fact that they're causing such major changes in things like glucagon and insulin

01:15:52.900 --> 01:16:09.900
 and several of the related glucose handling systems, they haven't been in enough situations

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:14.900
 that people really know what the long-range effects are going to be.

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:22.900
 They might contribute to chronic stress, for example, by constantly confusing your system,

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:29.900
 telling your glucose regulating systems that you're being provided what you need,

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.900
 and then it turns out that you aren't,

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:40.900
 and so it triggers more of the cortisol to maintain the blood sugar.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.900
 One of the things we do notice with people, and this is quite common,

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.900
 is when we use the fruits and veggies, all goes well, people are feeling great,

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:52.900
 when we start to filter in the sugar and using the sugar syrup,

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:58.900
 cooking it down in small amounts over time, we're noticing that some people do get acne.

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:03.900
 What are your thoughts on the acne? Is it because of insulin? Is it because of androgens?

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:09.900
 Is it a liver detox issue? Is it maybe a vitamin A deficiency?

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:17.900
 I think things that activate your skin cause it to produce more moisture and oil

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:22.900
 and make it more attractive for germs to grow,

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:33.900
 and vitamin A is essential for several defensive processes, including the immune system,

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:41.900
 and all of your surfaces become susceptible to infection in a vitamin A deficiency,

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:51.900
 but especially an increasingly warm, moist, functioning skin needs more vitamin A.

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:57.900
 The thyroid, which uses vitamin A to make the steroids,

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:04.900
 will make your skin moister and oilier under most conditions,

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:11.900
 and so sugar activating your thyroid revs up your ability of your skin cells

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:15.900
 to produce what they should be producing,

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:22.900
 except if you're deficient in vitamin A or some other immune factor,

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:27.900
 then you're going to grow bacteria in your skin.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:32.900
 So it's more of an immune system kind of inhibition that's creating it.

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:39.900
 Would you recommend cutting out the sugar itself and using more of the fruits and vegetables

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:43.900
 until you kind of bring the system up a little bit more?

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:47.900
 Because I find with a lot of people this is quite common, especially in women,

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:52.900
 and I'm trying to figure out if it's a detox liver issue, adding in the vitamin A,

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:57.900
 it's not really doing the trick, or should we just cut out the actual sugar syrup,

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:02.900
 use the fruits and vegetables, and then we bring the body up to more of a homeostatic state?

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.900
 Do we add in the sucrose?

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:12.900
 Well, eggs and shellfish and fruits and cheese and milk,

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:18.900
 all of these are very effective at improving your immune system.

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.900
 Okay.

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.900
 Have you ever heard of Emanuel Cheraskin?

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:27.900
 He was a dentist who did nutrition research.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:36.900
 In one of his surveys, he plotted the number of symptoms people chronically had

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:40.900
 against the amount of vitamin A in their diet or supplements,

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:49.900
 and he found that from very low vitamin A intake all the way up to 100,000 units a day,

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:59.900
 the symptoms and complaints decreased very consistently as the vitamin A increased.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:07.900
 And I think that's because of its role in making the antistress hormones and the immune factors.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.900
 Right.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:15.900
 If your thyroid is low, too much vitamin A will suppress your thyroid.

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.900
 They have to be exactly balanced.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:25.900
 And so some people who take big doses of vitamin A get symptoms of vitamin A deficiency

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.900
 as well as thyroid deficiency.

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:34.900
 And the higher your metabolic rate, the more vitamin A you need and can use.

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.900
 So up there --

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.900
 Sorry.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:44.900
 Acne is a good indicator that you're doing something out of balance,

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:48.900
 but it's hard to guess without blood tests.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.900
 Right.

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:52.900
 Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:56.900
 Now, I know your take on this, but for the listeners, what's your take on insulin resistance?

01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.900
 Like what do you feel is creating this?

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:01.900
 Because everyone says it's sugar.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.900
 We work with people all over the world, and we start talking about eliminating grains,

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:08.900
 and we start talking about vegetables and fruits and sugars.

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:12.900
 Everyone's so afraid they're going to get insulin resistance or diabetes and all these things.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:17.900
 What are your thoughts on what's creating it?

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.900
 It's the polyunsaturated fats, very clearly.

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:30.900
 In many of the animal studies, sucrose, because of its fructose component,

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:35.900
 increases the ability to dispose of glucose nicely.

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:42.900
 So either increasing insulin sensitivity or not affecting it,

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:50.900
 but still preventing hyperglycemia from eating more sugar.

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:56.900
 And you can instantly demonstrate the effect of polyunsaturated fats,

01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:01.900
 by blocking the ability to use glucose.

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:05.900
 And for people that listen to the early access, people can really start thinking outside the box

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.900
 and never believe everything you hear.

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:08.900
 Really do the research.

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.900
 If you listen to one of our first shows with Ray, if you visit his website,

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.900
 you read his articles on unsaturated fats, it really makes a lot of sense.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:19.900
 And then start applying some of the principles to see if it works.

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:20.900
 And it's a process.

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.900
 Just because you have a negative symptom doesn't mean you're not moving forward.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:28.900
 The healing process and his recommendations, if you can piece them together from the shows

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.900
 and his articles or working with someone, it's an entire healing process

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:34.900
 and it takes everything to the next level.

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.900
 It's not just about eating food.

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:40.900
 It's about eating the right types, ratios, frequencies to meet your metabolic needs.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:45.900
 And really finding out based off Achilles reflex or pulse and temp,

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.900
 if what you're doing is actually working.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:50.900
 Are you pushing yourself thermogenic?

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.900
 Which is very important.

01:22:53.900 --> 01:23:03.900
 I think you should usually see a good result within an hour or at most a day or two

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:12.900
 when you start avoiding the harmful things and getting the necessary things.

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:13.900
 It is pretty rapid.

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:16.900
 You're making us sleep, man.

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:17.900
 I love it.

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.900
 You're enthusiastic.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:22.900
 You make it seem so easy and it probably is.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:27.900
 So what would you say if someone does start increasing their --

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:29.900
 let's say they start eliminating all the poofers,

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:32.900
 they start eating "according to your philosophy,"

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.900
 they're increasing their sugars and they're finding the balance,

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:37.900
 but they're still getting a low temperature,

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:41.900
 would you say that maybe they've been in such a deficient state for so long

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.900
 that it's going to take a little bit longer?

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.900
 Or is it maybe their body detoxing from the unsaturated fats?

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:50.900
 Or is maybe what they're doing just off?

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:57.900
 Well, frequent feeding is one of the things that will help to keep from having the

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.900
 up and down reaction.

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:08.900
 The fatter a person is, the longer it's going to take to get away from those

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:12.900
 stress reactions every time you forget to eat the right things.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:18.900
 And women with a monthly cycle have to keep that in mind,

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:29.900
 that the ability to handle sugar and fat varies with the amount of estrogen,

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.900
 thyroid, and progesterone.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:38.900
 And so typically women will have a relapse after a couple of weeks when they get

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:41.900
 into that part of their cycle.

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:53.900
 And women should think in terms of that maybe six weeks before they can get past

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:57.900
 the cycle of ups and downs.

01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:02.900
 Now, talking about that, you've talked about progesterone a little and thyroid

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:06.900
 and its relation to sugar and its importance.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.900
 Can you elaborate a little bit on estrogen and how that plays a role in the

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.900
 inflammatory cycle of not getting enough sugar in our body,

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:17.900
 or the right types of sugar I should say?

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:24.900
 Surprisingly, some of the things that are blamed on fructose,

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:32.900
 such as increasing triglycerides, estrogen has been known to do that.

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:41.900
 Cortisol is really the main thing that increases the so-called inappropriate

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:45.900
 blood lipids.

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:51.900
 Good triglycerides made from sugar or other carbohydrate really aren't harmful.

01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:57.900
 They're just evidence that you're under stress and eating more than you need.

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:05.900
 Insulin and cortisol are usually the main factors increasing triglycerides.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:16.900
 But estrogen tends to interfere with the oxidation of glucose and shifts you to

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:25.900
 being forced to oxidize polyunsaturated fats and tends to give you lower blood

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:30.900
 sugar problems, at least temporarily under the influence.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:39.900
 And chronically, all of the effects of impaired glucose oxidation and increased

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:43.900
 reliance on fatty acids.

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:52.900
 And the oxidative metabolism is disturbed in numerous ways by an excess of

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:55.900
 estrogen.

01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:01.900
 Androgens and progesterone and thyroid are all protective against those effects

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:06.900
 of estrogen.

01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.900
 Now you're talking about frequent eating and that's something we really try to

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:13.900
 get people to do because A, we see a lot of people actually under eat calorically,

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.900
 which is kind of reiterating what we talked about.

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.900
 But when people get sugar cravings, what are your thoughts on sugar cravings?

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:25.900
 Is it really just listening to your body and your body saying, "Hey, I need more

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.900
 sugar," in a sense?

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.900
 Yeah, sometimes salt will help with that.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:39.900
 Women on their monthly cycle at high estrogen times will typically have either or

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.900
 both sugar and salt cravings.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:49.900
 And women avoid eating salt, for example, because they're told it will cause them

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.900
 to retain water.

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:58.900
 But it's also a diuretic, so if they overcome that phobia and eat salt just as

01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:04.900
 they crave it, it will usually prevent many of the symptoms of the premenstrual

01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:08.900
 problem of water retention and edema.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.900
 The sodium helps to increase your metabolic rate, so you use sugar more

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:16.900
 efficiently.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:22.900
 So when you have a sugar craving, having something both salty and sugary is

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:25.900
 probably the best.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:27.900
 Interesting.

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:31.900
 Now, can you really eat too much sugar?

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:32.900
 I mean, is it dangerous?

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:33.900
 Can it happen?

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:37.900
 Or right now would you say that people are so deficient that it's not really

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.900
 possible?

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:44.900
 Yeah, your appetite is a pretty good guide.

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:50.900
 When you get low blood sugar, if you have a very concentrated form of sugar

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:57.900
 rather than fruit, if you eat a pound or two of candy, for example, you'll

01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:59.900
 probably feel sick.

01:28:59.900 --> 01:29:07.900
 It probably is injuring your stomach just by its osmotic concentration, and it

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:15.900
 can cause diarrhea when it disturbs your intestine and stomach enough to

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:21.900
 overcome the adaptive ability to absorb it and handle it.

01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:31.900
 But most of the claims of people like Lustig are really based on a lot of

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:38.900
 mistakes and misleading interpretations.

01:29:38.900 --> 01:29:45.900
 I advocate using the fats regularly every time you eat.

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:52.900
 It's good to have some fat and protein at the same time.

01:29:52.900 --> 01:30:00.900
 So I think appetite will usually tell a person that something is wrong if they

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:05.900
 try to go several hours with nothing but a lot of sugar.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:06.900
 Right.

01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:07.900
 It's all about the balance.

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.900
 All about the balance.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:12.900
 Yeah, I mean, there's just so much out there.

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:17.900
 I mean, this is a topic that, you know, it's kind of endless, but, you know,

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.900
 from studying your stuff over the years and incorporating it, it's definitely

01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:25.900
 made a change, not only in our lives but clients' lives, because so many --

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:29.900
 you know, it's like in front of us, so many people are overweight and so many

01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:33.900
 people are staying away from these types of carbohydrates and sugars.

01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:38.900
 And most people advocate staying away from "sugar" to lose weight.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:43.900
 Would you actually advocate staying next to it to lose weight?

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:48.900
 Yeah.

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:53.900
 Stimulating the metabolic rate, different studies say that it increases your

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:58.900
 fatality by 25% or 50% to burn calories.

01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:00.900
 Right.

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:05.900
 And if you're backing that up with a balance of saturated fats and good

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:11.900
 proteins, it really is a help for losing weight.

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:17.900
 But two other factors that help to increase your metabolic rate are salt

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:24.900
 and calcium, and that's why I advocate cheese and milk as good proteins,

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:29.900
 because of their high calcium content, which helps to raise your body

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:33.900
 temperature and metabolic rate.

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:36.900
 Great.

01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:37.900
 Great stuff.

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:39.900
 So I guess I'm kind of out of questions.

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.900
 If we have any callers that have questions, feel free to call in.

01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.900
 I had a lot of people email me questions.

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:50.900
 I'm not sure if you want to add anything else, Ray, in regards to sugar,

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:53.900
 the stress reaction, the body hormones.

01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:56.900
 But I think people listening to this, of course, probably listen to it over

01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:00.900
 and over again, and if they connect the dots, it all makes sense.

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:04.900
 And I think my biggest -- my recommendation or my perception of Ray's

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:09.900
 work is you have to really read through it and connect the dots, because

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:11.900
 it's not -- it's there.

01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:14.900
 You just have to really read through it and start connecting things and

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:15.900
 make sense of it.

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.900
 And when you do, it's going to be very enlightening.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.900
 A little brain-twisting, but very enlightening.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.900
 So do you have anything to add, Ray?

01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.900
 No.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.900
 No?

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:33.900
 I think we covered a lot of really great stuff today, and I'm very excited

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:38.900
 about getting it out there and allowing people a little bit more information,

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:43.900
 because it's been a big question for a lot of people, and it's -- I think

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:48.900
 it created a lot of clarification on the matter.

01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:54.900
 Yeah, I'm -- I've been thinking of writing an article about fructose

01:32:54.900 --> 01:33:01.900
 and sucrose beyond the one I did on diabetes or the glycemic index.

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:03.900
 I think that would be brilliant, Ray.

01:33:03.900 --> 01:33:08.900
 I think I've read that article at least 20 times, kind of decipher it

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:09.900
 and break it down.

01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:12.900
 But it's so fascinating because it really is understanding the different

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.900
 types and how the body is able to metabolize and use that energy

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.900
 efficiently.

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:23.900
 And it's clear that people have gotten very confused that all the different

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:26.900
 things that they're reading and that are being presented to them is what's

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:27.900
 right and what's wrong.

01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:31.900
 And this, again, is the way the body works, makes perfect sense.

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:32.900
 Yeah.

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:33.900
 And --

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.900
 Hey, Ray, we have a caller.

01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.900
 Do you mind taking a caller?

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.900
 Okay.

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.900
 Let me get them all.

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.900
 Caller from 847, you're on the air.

01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:44.900
 Yes, I'm here.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:45.900
 Hello.

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.900
 Hello.

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:47.900
 You're on the air.

01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:48.900
 Yes, hello.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:49.900
 Do you have a question for Ray?

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.900
 Yes, I have a question for -- yes, I do.

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:53.900
 Go for it.

01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:58.900
 Okay, I wanted to ask him, I have problems with drinking milk that it

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:00.900
 creates a lot of mucus, cow's milk.

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:03.900
 It's not so much so when I have goat's milk.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.900
 What I'm wondering is I still have starch like in the form of corn.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:12.900
 If I stopped all that kind of starch, would I be able to tolerate milk again?

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.900
 Would it not make me mucousy?

01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:24.900
 Yeah, goat's milk is fine, and cheese, if you can get cheeses without additives,

01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:30.900
 they're nutritionally just about as valuable as fresh milk.

01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:41.900
 But the starches in corn and other grains are complex enough that a lot of

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:46.900
 them won't be digested by human enzymes, and so they feed bacteria.

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:54.900
 And the type of bacteria that you happen to have will govern the kind of

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:56.900
 reaction you have to those starches.

01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:06.900
 So having a food like raw carrot in your diet regularly helps if you're going

01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:09.900
 to eat some starches periodically.

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:16.900
 Carrot helps to reduce those allergy effects that cause mucus.

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:22.900
 Does that answer your question?

01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:23.900
 I could probably switch back.

01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:27.900
 I was wondering, so I could probably -- I'd like to go back to cow's milk

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.900
 because it's cheaper and it's easier to get.

01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:35.900
 So I guess that if I had the carrot, then I would be able to go back to cow's

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:37.900
 milk and get off goat's milk.

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:43.900
 And sometimes changing the brand, I've noticed that at the same supermarket,

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:50.900
 one brand of milk will cause digestive irritation, something the cows ate,

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:57.900
 I think, and if the milk tastes good, I find it usually is easiest on my

01:35:57.900 --> 01:35:58.900
 digestion.

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:05.900
 And some people have told me that the ultra-pasteurized milk that was heated

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:10.900
 to a very high temperature, it's a little lower in some nutrients,

01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:15.900
 but people tell me that they can handle that better than fresh milk.

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:20.900
 And other people react to that but don't react to fresh milk.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:26.900
 So trying -- switching brands of cow's milk might make a difference.

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:27.900
 Okay.

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:28.900
 Thank you very much.

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:29.900
 I appreciate it.

01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.900
 Thank you.

01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:32.900
 Thank you.

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:36.900
 I have a quick question.

01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:41.900
 You keep mentioning the raw carrot, and I completely understand the purpose of

01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:42.900
 it.

01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:48.900
 Would you recommend eating that by itself, or would you recommend eating it

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.900
 along with other sugars?

01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:55.900
 It contains a little bit of sugar, and that's pretty much the only thing you

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.900
 absorb from it.

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:02.900
 If you eat a lot of it and have a low thyroid, you might absorb enough

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.900
 carotene to have an antithyroid effect.

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:09.900
 So you want to look at the palms of your hands occasionally,

01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:13.900
 see that you aren't getting orange calluses.

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:21.900
 But it prevents the absorption of anything you eat with it or slows it

01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:23.900
 greatly.

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:29.900
 So you don't want to eat a big plate of carrot salad when you're eating your

01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:35.900
 main meal because you might have low blood sugar for a couple of hours

01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:39.900
 because it's blocking the nutrients.

01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:40.900
 Okay.

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:41.900
 Perfect.

01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:43.900
 We've got one more caller.

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:45.900
 Do you want to take one more caller, Ray?

01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:46.900
 Sure.

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:47.900
 Okay.

01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:51.900
 Caller from 417, you're on the air.

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.900
 Yes, thank you.

01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:59.900
 I was referred to Dr. Peat a couple months ago by someone I have actually

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:01.900
 stage 4 melanoma.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:06.900
 And anyway, I've not gone through the traditional orthodox approaches.

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.900
 They really have no hope for what I'm doing.

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.900
 And I changed my diet pretty radically based on what I understood Dr.

01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.900
 Peat to teach.

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:18.900
 And essentially, I guess the question is this.

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:23.900
 I was instructed to eat potatoes and sugar but balance it with cream of

01:38:23.900 --> 01:38:30.900
 tartar for the potassium content and to eat saturated fats,

01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:36.900
 butter and coconut oil and actually rice products, no gluten, et cetera.

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:40.900
 And I just wondered if there was anything else because I know there are

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:43.900
 people out there who may not have melanoma but they do have cancer or they

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:47.900
 know people who do have cancer or people who have immune suppressive

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:54.900
 disorders that if that's what a diet for someone such as myself,

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:57.900
 that's the most conflicting problem I have is no matter where I turn,

01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:00.900
 they say eat this and then don't eat this.

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:08.900
 And then I found Dr. Peat's suggestion is very impressive and that it makes sense.

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:12.900
 And so anyway, my biggest struggle right now is what should I eat knowing how

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:17.900
 critical my body condition is that I can't afford to make mistakes in this

01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:19.900
 point forward too much.

01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:23.900
 How does your intestine react to things like potatoes?

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.900
 Actually, it has responded very well.

01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:30.900
 I have no issues there at all.

01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:34.900
 I've gotten so much weaker, not since I started what you told me,

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:36.900
 but I was getting weaker before that.

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:39.900
 So on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm probably about a 3 or so.

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:47.900
 I just don't have the energy to do a whole lot of anything.

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:54.900
 Are you getting enough calcium from cheese or milk or something?

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:55.900
 Probably not.

01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:59.900
 Actually, I was told by a person not to take calcium,

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:03.900
 that they did a urine sediment test or something and said I had too much

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:04.900
 calcium.

01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:07.900
 So no, that's one thing that I am low on.

01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:12.900
 I'm probably intake-wise, I really haven't really eaten,

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:16.900
 except for butter, that's probably about it.

01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:23.900
 The parathyroid hormone tends to promote tumor growth and eating plenty of

01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:29.900
 calcium and adequate amounts of vitamin D and vitamin K,

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:34.900
 K1 and K2, help you handle the calcium.

01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:43.900
 And I think it probably takes 1,500 milligrams a day of calcium anyway to

01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:48.900
 get your parathyroid hormone down into a safe range.

01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:50.900
 Okay.

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:57.900
 So supplement with -- I have been taking vitamin D at least 5,000 units a

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:01.900
 day, and I have eaten a lot of vitamin K from vegetables,

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.900
 although I've been cautioned not to eat too many of those now,

01:41:03.900 --> 01:41:07.900
 even though that's -- I've eaten very nutritiously and healthfully in the

01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:08.900
 last decade.

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:09.900
 That's what's so surprising.

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:15.900
 And I think, though, that maybe I did too much with seeds and nuts and

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:16.900
 veggies.

01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:22.900
 I'm not sure, but for whatever reason, my body gave out.

01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:31.900
 Yeah, I think seeds and nuts are a problem for anyone because of the

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:34.900
 unsaturated fats in them.

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:43.900
 And coconut oil, I think refined odorless coconut oil can be a big part

01:41:43.900 --> 01:41:46.900
 of your calorie intake.

01:41:46.900 --> 01:41:53.900
 Some cancer therapies have used, I think, as much as five ounces a day

01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:57.900
 of refined coconut oil.

01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:58.900
 Mm-hmm.

01:41:58.900 --> 01:41:59.900
 Mm-hmm.

01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:03.900
 One final real quick thing here, and that is -- because I do a lot of

01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:06.900
 research, and that's been kind of my life anyway, and not to your degree,

01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:14.900
 but that there is a physician in Ohio who advocates this heavy use of fish

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.900
 oil for cancer therapy.

01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:23.900
 And then I found a research paper and actually spoke to the physician back

01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:26.900
 in Boston who has done all these studies.

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:30.900
 I know mice are not the same as humans, but how fish oil had a profound

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:36.900
 impact on melanoma in these laboratory results that they have over the last

01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:38.900
 five years.

01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:43.900
 And so, again, I realize that there are articles that talk about fish oil

01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:48.900
 being detrimental for colon cancer and other things, and then you might find

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.900
 it beneficial here or there.

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.900
 But I know that wasn't your subject matter today with fish oils.

01:42:53.900 --> 01:43:00.900
 But, again, do you have any impact in terms of how that might be where the

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:05.900
 lab mice have profound improvement with fish oil?

01:43:05.900 --> 01:43:08.900
 People who funded those labs in the laboratory, I mean,

01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:12.900
 that's a huge factor in regards to what they're looking for, in my opinion.

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:15.900
 Do you use any aspirin?

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:20.900
 I have just started recently taking that.

01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:23.900
 I was told that that had an anti-inflammatory impact,

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.900
 so I just started that.

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:34.900
 I just heard from someone about a week ago who has -- he was on the anti-AIDS

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:37.900
 drugs and getting sick, but he stopped them.

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:40.900
 And he's now using 4 1/2 grams a day of aspirin.

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:47.900
 And his blood tests showed that all of his immune factors that aren't known

01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:55.900
 to promote inflammation and tumor growth, they were all down in the normal range,

01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:59.900
 and aspirin seems to be the basic thing.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:07.900
 I've had outbreaks of things that a couple doctors were sure were melanomas,

01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:10.900
 big, black, growing things.

01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:19.900
 And when I have an outbreak of those, I a few times have applied either

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:27.900
 progesterone or DHEA near them, and they quickly moved away or disappeared

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:28.900
 or fell off.

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:36.900
 But basically increasing my thyroid to the point where I'm hypermetabolic will

01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:45.900
 make all of the visible ones dry up and stop growing or eventually fall off.

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:46.900
 Okay.

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:50.900
 And so would taking desiccated thyroid be a good idea?

01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:52.900
 No.

01:44:52.900 --> 01:45:00.900
 What I've always used since the original armor stopped being available 20 years

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:07.900
 ago, I've been using either Cytomel or Sinomel, a Mexican version of Cytomel,

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:12.900
 which is quick-acting, and so you can adjust the dose up and down.

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:19.900
 So if you get too hypermetabolic and out of breath, you can stop taking it

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:25.900
 for a few hours and come back to a comfortable level.

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:32.900
 But I've seen several people -- someone just a few weeks ago had a mole that

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.900
 was growing and was about two inches long, and within a week,

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:42.900
 when he took big doses of Cytomel, it had disappeared.

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:44.900
 Wow.

01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:45.900
 Impressive.

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:46.900
 All right.

01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:47.900
 All right, Matt, I'm going to take another call.

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:48.900
 Yes, sir.

01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:49.900
 I'm going to take another caller.

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:50.900
 Thank you very much.

01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:51.900
 Yeah.

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:52.900
 Thank you.

01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.900
 Thanks for calling in.

01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:55.900
 Okay, we've got time for one more.

01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:56.900
 Do you mind taking one more caller?

01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:58.900
 Sure.

01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.900
 I meant to ask you this at the beginning of the show.

01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:01.900
 This is a huge caveat.

01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:06.900
 Do you prefer that we call you Ray or Dr. Peat, or what do you prefer?

01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:07.900
 Ray's good.

01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:08.900
 Ray's good.

01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.900
 Okay, I just want to make sure, you know.

01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:13.900
 I meant to ask you at the beginning of the show, but I always call you Ray,

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.900
 and it just happened, and I know you're a PhD, so I want to make sure that if

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:18.900
 you want to be called doctor, I'll call you doctor.

01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:22.900
 Yeah, PhDs aren't doctors under law.

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:25.900
 I know, I know, but some people, you know.

01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:28.900
 Okay.

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.900
 Caller from the 610, you're on the air.

01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:31.900
 You got a question for Ray?

01:46:31.900 --> 01:46:33.900
 Hi, yeah, my name's Andrew.

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:39.900
 I have -- I guess they call it delayed sleep day syndrome, so I usually can't

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:45.900
 fall asleep until 4 or 6 a.m., and then I can't wake up until late in the

01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:51.900
 afternoon, and I wonder if that's a problem with adrenaline.

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:54.900
 The sound is very spotty.

01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:57.900
 All I could hear was a problem with adrenaline.

01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:58.900
 Oh, I'm sorry.

01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:05.900
 I haven't fallen yet, so I can't fall asleep until 6 in the morning?

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:11.900
 Oh, for falling asleep, sometimes a very small dose of thyroid.

01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:19.900
 One doctor who had been awake for two or three days, absolutely awake, I gave

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:23.900
 him 10 micrograms of cytomelan the next day.

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:26.900
 He said, "That stuff's better than morphine."

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:33.900
 I've been taking Xenoplus, and it worked the first day, and then the effect wore

01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:35.900
 off.

01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:41.900
 Yeah, the sugar is the next best thing.

01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:50.900
 I use a glass of sugar with maybe two or three tablespoons, a glass of warm

01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:57.900
 milk, and three tablespoons of sugar dissolved in it will usually have an

01:47:57.900 --> 01:48:00.900
 effect similar to the thyroid.

01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:02.900
 Oh, okay.

01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:03.900
 Thanks.

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:06.900
 I have one more quick question.

01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:12.900
 I heard that you can use just pure T3 to figure out the thyroid dose that you

01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:18.900
 need, and then later you can go back and switch that over to a desiccated or to

01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:20.900
 Xenoplus.

01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:27.900
 Yeah, for a person who's in a hurry, that's the way to find your total required.

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:28.900
 Okay.

01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:35.900
 So when you're converting the dose, how much -- how does the T3 convert to the

01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:38.900
 T4 in equivalency?

01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:49.900
 The traditional equivalency is 100 micrograms of T4 are equivalent to 25

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:55.900
 micrograms of T3 or one grain of traditional armor thyroid.

01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:56.900
 Okay.

01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:02.900
 That really depends on how much sugar is in your diet and how high your cortisol

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:04.900
 is and several things.

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:10.900
 So those are just traditional rough estimates, and it might be very different

01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:13.900
 for some people.

01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:16.900
 Is there a dose that some people find works really well?

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:19.900
 Like are people using 30 micrograms or 60?

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:27.900
 Well, the body only produces four micrograms per hour typically, and so

01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:33.900
 whenever you take more than that, if you're going to take 10 micrograms, it's

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:40.900
 good to have it with food so you don't absorb so much that your body experiences

01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.900
 the excess.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:50.900
 It's good to supplement in something like two micrograms per hour on average.

01:49:50.900 --> 01:50:00.900
 So 10 micrograms with lunch will spread out for a few hours as you digest.

01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:01.900
 Okay.

01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:02.900
 Thanks a lot.

01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:06.900
 Thanks for calling in.

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:07.900
 All right.

01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:08.900
 So I think that wraps it up.

01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.900
 We're almost out of time here, unless you have anything else to add in there,

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.900
 because I think we covered a lot today.

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.900
 I know I learned a lot.

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:19.900
 I'm going to have to listen to this show another 10 times again.

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.900
 Anything else to add?

01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.900
 I don't know.

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:25.900
 Okay.

01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:27.900
 Well, once again, we really appreciate you coming on.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:33.900
 I know the listeners really honestly appreciate not only coming on the show,

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:40.900
 but the work you do, the honesty and modesty that you have, and just the

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.900
 philosophies that you're putting out there.

01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:45.900
 So we definitely appreciate everything you do.

01:50:45.900 --> 01:50:47.900
 Okay.

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:50.900
 Thanks for having the show.

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:51.900
 All right, Ray.

01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:52.900
 Have a great day.

01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:53.900
 Thanks, Ray.

01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:54.900
 Have a great afternoon.

01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:55.900
 Okay.

01:50:55.900 --> 01:50:56.900
 Bye.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:57.900
 All right, bye-bye.

01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:01.900
 All right, guys, there you go, another show with Ray.

01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:03.900
 Keep in mind, I just want to say something.

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.900
 This philosophy, it's not cookie-cutter.

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.900
 It's not take this much of that, this much of this.

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:11.900
 Eat this fruit and you'll be awesome, or eat this much protein and fat,

01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.900
 you're going to be great.

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.900
 Everything is person-dependent.

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:18.900
 And that's the tough part with this because it's not cookie-cutter.

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:22.900
 And you have to keep in mind that, you know, Ray makes it seem so easy,

01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:27.900
 and I'm sure it is, but I know it's challenging for a lot of people.

01:51:27.900 --> 01:51:29.900
 And you can't just start eating the foods he recommends and go, "Oh,

01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.900
 this doesn't work."

01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:33.900
 It's all a process of fine-tuning.

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.900
 And that's when this really comes in.

01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:38.900
 And, at the same time, if you're thinking about buying supplements

01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:42.900
 or medications he's talking about, they're actually quite useless if your

01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:45.900
 nutrition, frequencies, ratios, calories is not in order.

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:47.900
 You can actually cause more harm.

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:50.900
 So don't start jumping on the Internet and buying T3.

01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:53.900
 It can actually make things a lot worse and take it and convert it into

01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:55.900
 reverse T3.

01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.900
 So make sure you really study his philosophy.

01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:01.900
 You know, go to his website, listen to our radio shows.

01:52:01.900 --> 01:52:02.900
 You can work with people like us.

01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:03.900
 We have clients all over the world.

01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:07.900
 There's other people out there as well that are trained in his philosophies.

01:52:07.900 --> 01:52:10.900
 You know, so definitely find someone because it's not easy.

01:52:10.900 --> 01:52:15.900
 It's a process, and it's a process of really understanding the body and the

01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:19.900
 foods we're eating and how our body reacts to them and how to adjust based

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:21.900
 on our metabolic demands.

01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:22.900
 So hopefully you enjoyed the show.

01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:24.900
 We don't have our next show scheduled.

01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:28.900
 I got an e-mail, Ray, thinking about maybe doing it on salt and dairy or

01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:30.900
 something like that.

01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:34.900
 But definitely appreciate everyone tuning in again and supporting us.

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:35.900
 It really means a lot.

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.900
 And that's about it, guys.

01:52:37.900 --> 01:52:39.900
 I'll see you guys later.

01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:43.900
 Great day.

01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:46.900
 Need one more reason why your Safeway store is just better?

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.900
 How about free Cuisinart Classic Cutlery or Elite Flatware?

01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.900
 That's right.

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:54.900
 For every $10 you spend, earn a free stamp saver you can redeem for

01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:56.900
 Cuisinart items.

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.900
 Once you've collected between 30 and 60 stamps, you can start shopping for a

01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:03.900
 variety of Cuisinart cutlery or flatware available at the in-store display.

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.900
 Present your items and stamp saver at checkout.

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:06.900
 It's simple.

01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:10.900
 Spend $10, get your free stamp saver, start collecting.

01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:12.900
 Safeway, it's just better.

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:13.600
 Better.
