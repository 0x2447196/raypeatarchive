00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
 So you have mentioned before that folks, if they want to start taking a thyroid, that

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.840
 they start slow and do it maybe even half a grain or something for a couple weeks.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.240
 So you think that's a good idea to get the body kind of used to it?

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:30.400
 Yeah, that is a traditional way to stay on ideally a month because your adrenaline and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.280
 cortisol are going to come down as the thyroid comes up.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.200
 So at two weeks you might seem just right and then you start slowing down again when

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.300
 your adrenaline comes down towards normal.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.480
 So maybe 30 grains, half of a tab might be a good thing for a few weeks or a month.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.560
 Yeah, and watching those measurements because it's like a sawtooth pattern.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.160
 You rise to normal and then your hormones adjust and you slip back and then you increase

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.200
 the dose and rise to normal for a while and then if you normalize your adrenaline and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.480
 lower your stress, then your metabolism slows down again for a while.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.120
 So that's why if you do both you can kind of gauge.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.720
 So what you want is after an hour after eating around 11 or so, the ideal would then be the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.680
 more 98 temp and more higher pulse rate?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.760
 Yeah, 80 or 85 in the middle of the day is a good pulse rate.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 Wow.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:52.000
 So 75 at least and 85 or 90 is okay and temperature 98 or 98 and a half.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.800
 So could you diagnose for Patrick here?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.320
 I'm like 60 all the time.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.120
 Just doesn't change.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.120
 I mean it seems fine to me.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.240
 For me, Doc, if I had 75 I would think I'd be like total anxiety or something.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.120
 Oh no, the thyroid, one of the things it does by lowering the stress hormones, you feel

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.800
 more and more relaxed.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.920
 But the higher pulse rate.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.160
 But how you feel is a good indicator.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.760
 You don't want to push it into the anxiety because that means you're turning on your

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760
 stress.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760
 Sure.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.680
 So serotonin is an additional complicating factor.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:50.360
 The vagal system and the adrenaline system is one complication of interpreting thyroid

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.760
 function but the serotonin also tends to go down as your thyroid comes up.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 And the serotonin is a promoter of hyperventilation.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:16.640
 And so the low blood glucose, low oxygen consumption person often will have an actual hyperventilation

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.440
 driven by the increased serotonin.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:30.560
 And that serotonin disturbs both your adrenal mineral regulation and your parathyroid hormone.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.240
 It drives your parathyroid hormone up.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:44.760
 And that is worse if you're low in either calcium intake or low in vitamin D. And that's

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.800
 why I talk a lot about calcium and vitamin D in relation to thyroid.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:04:00.960
 Because low thyroid means usually higher serotonin activity, hyperventilation, disturbed calcium

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.320
 metabolism and dependence, need for more vitamin D.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.160
 We talked a bit about dopamine last hour.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.000
 How does dopamine play into the whole, what we've just talked about, the last 10 minutes,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 dopamine?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:27.080
 It's similar to the adrenaline or sympathetic nervous opposition to the shock tendency of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.000
 the vagal or sympathetic system.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.480
 It's the body's balancing factor for serotonin.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.000
 You can get too much of both of those and you get symptoms like nightmares.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Insomnia.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:58.600
 Yeah, insomnia and the water and salt regulation become a problem when those go up.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:08.680
 So you want to keep your serotonin down and under control and then your dopamine will

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.200
 take care of keeping things in balance usually.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.600
 So on the shock idea, you're talking about it could be a traumatic event in someone's

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600
 life.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:31.040
 Yeah, an emotional shock will turn off your thyroid function and all of those other, the

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:41.400
 adrenals and the parathyroid system tend to get out of control as your thyroid goes down.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.680
 I wonder why though, after you get over the shock and you forgive the shock person and

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.560
 all that and spiritually and emotionally, that these thyroid wouldn't start to get

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.120
 its act together without the meds.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:04.600
 I think that's because of the tissues having been slightly deranged by storing PUFA in

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.840
 their vats.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.480
 Usually young people can take a big shock better than people in their 30s and 40s when

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:22.800
 their tissues are destabilized by the fat.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:31.520
 An emotional upset will more reliably cause a chronic thyroid problem in a person in their

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.120
 30s than in their teens.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.400
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.960
 Oh, that's my dog there just shaking.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.960
 Hi, doodle.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.440
 Say hi to Dr. Peat.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.720
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us and you can see on the show page there where he has a bi-monthly

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.880
 newsletter every couple of months and very, very affordable.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.200
 You can click on there and sign up and get some cool stuff and help support him so he

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.520
 can buy paints and stuff.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.480
 It's good to have a little stuff coming in here.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.520
 So here's one for you.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.520
 This is pretty fun.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:13.760
 What's more effective, eating a whole orange, drinking its juice, or eating marmalade?

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:24.040
 The marmalade has the extract of the peeling which has a lot of therapeutic things.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.560
 I haven't seen any real comparisons, but people occasionally have advocated eating

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.920
 the peeling raw, but that's extremely hard on the stomach.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:45.920
 Cooking the peeling extracts some of the anti-inflammatory protective things.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:53.600
 Naringin and naringin are major protective factors in orange peeling that you get in

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.240
 the marmalade.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:02.440
 The added sugar is an added anti-stress factor that supports your thyroid.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:15.120
 But ideally, the juice, you can get all of those good things in the absence of good orange

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120
 juice.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.480
 Marmalade is kind of a medical substitute.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:31.360
 If you have good oranges, you wouldn't want to eat the number of oranges it takes to make

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.240
 a gallon of orange juice.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.720
 It's fine to drink a gallon of orange juice in hot weather, but all of the fiber in an

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.160
 orange would probably be a burden to your digestive system.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.880
 Here's a good one.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:57.200
 Would you ask, "I experience malabsorption that no matter what or how much I eat, I stay

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200
 underweight.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.520
 Symptoms like gnawing, ulcer-type pain that flares up at night to cause insomnia, and

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.560
 eating iron-rich foods like organ meats, which were previously well-tolerated, now exacerbate

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.560
 this pain."

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:19.280
 So, getting some ulcer-type pain at night and can't seem to gain weight, can you gauge

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.060
 what might be going on for this person?

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:32.600
 My personal experience and knowing half a dozen other people, usually men, in their

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:45.280
 20s and 30s, some individuals can eat several thousand calories a day without gaining weight.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:56.440
 I've known people who weighed, for a normal height, weighed 130, 140 pounds, very, very

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:04.280
 skinny, who were eating three or four thousand calories a day.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:14.080
 Based on my own experience, when I first supplemented thyroid, I was in my late 30s, I think, suddenly

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.240
 I didn't need to eat so much.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:24.720
 My calorie requirement dropped in half simply by adding thyroid.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.840
 So I suggested that to these skinny men who were eating three or four thousand calories

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.440
 and staying very skinny.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.080
 Suddenly they had the same experience.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.540
 They didn't have to eat more, but suddenly they put on muscle.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:49.200
 That shows that thyroid is an anabolic hormone when it's in the right balance.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:59.640
 But if it's deficient and you're running on adrenaline, your cells know that the energy

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.640
 isn't being produced in the right way.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.000
 It's being produced by the stress of adrenaline.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.160
 So you're burning calories under the influence of adrenaline because the cells can't retain

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.400
 the magnesium that stabilizes the energy level of the cell.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:31.360
 Your thyroid can use the oxygen and produce the ATP and be fairly efficient in those ways,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.560
 but in the absence of a certain amount of thyroid, your cells lose magnesium and so

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.560
 they have to make the ATP again.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.840
 So you're making ATP at a high rate but losing it because it breaks down in the absence of

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.000
 magnesium.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.840
 Supplementing magnesium for about an hour will relax and stabilize the cells, but you

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:08.640
 need a certain amount of thyroid to make the cells retain it and stay in that efficient,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.640
 relaxed condition.

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:17.960
 It's a matter of letting your cells relax so that they can build themselves up instead

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.520
 of being constantly running and stressing themselves.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:30.360
 So that's where the thyroid is visibly a very powerful anabolic hormone.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:38.080
 So that's a little color intuitive because isn't often hypothyroidism connected with

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.440
 overweight?

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:50.880
 Very often, but if you look at the old textbooks, at the beginning of thyroid surgery, they

00:12:50.880 --> 00:13:00.920
 forgot to replace the thyroid hormone with a powdered or squashed up animal thyroid gland.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:08.880
 And when a person's thyroid gland was removed, they went into cachexia.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.800
 They looked like an advanced cancer patient, worse than sarcopenia.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:21.960
 Sarcopenia to an extreme degree, they wasted away in the absence of the thyroid hormone.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:30.760
 And that's what's happening to these often young or middle-aged men who are just moderately

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:39.920
 hypothyroid, but it's enough to move them into that cachectic or sarcopenic state of

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.240
 not being able to build their muscle fast enough.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.280
 That's really interesting.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.280
 This is from Cindy.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280
 She's in Alabama.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:54.120
 "I've been told that when a person has Hashimoto's or other autoimmune issues, they should not

00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:00.360
 use natural desiccated thyroid medications such as Armour or Nasothroid because the body

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.880
 will attack these because they are natural?

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.160
 The body supposedly does not attack the synthetic medication like Synthroid, and I prefer not

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.000
 to use the synthetic.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.040
 What is your view on this?"

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:26.400
 The autoimmune so-called condition is an excited, inefficient state, like when the cell can't

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.640
 retain magnesium, it stays in an excited state.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:40.960
 And if there's a hormone additionally increasing the excitation like TSH, it stimulates the

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.720
 thyroid gland.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:49.440
 And if it gets the nutrients it needs to make the hormone in the right balance, not too

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.800
 much iodine, then the cell is energized and works.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:05.200
 If something is lacking so it can't produce the thyroid hormone, the TSH keeps rising,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:13.240
 stimulating it more, driving it harder, stressing it more until it is killing the cells causing

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.560
 thyroiditis.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:28.960
 And in a condition of inflammation, your immune system comes in to activate the turnover,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:35.680
 the phagocytosis of the damaged, overexcited, overstressed cells.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:45.920
 The immune system is clearing up a damaged tissue, and that has been experimentally shown

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.800
 several times.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:59.800
 For example, in artificially inflamed brains in animals, they find that what they thought

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:08.880
 was autoimmune inflammation of the brain caused by a virus or some external cause was actually

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.880
 being remedied by the immune system.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:23.560
 If they removed that so-called autoimmune antibody, the inflammation killed the animal.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:31.600
 The immune system antibodies directed against self, if they're properly supported, are cleaning

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.920
 up the damaged tissue, remedying the problem.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:44.040
 And people have demonstrated that where you have the so-called autoimmune antithyroid,

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:54.280
 antiglobulin, antiperoxidase enzymes specific to the thyroid, if they supplement enough

00:16:54.280 --> 00:17:05.040
 thyroid to lower the TSH, you stop producing the antibodies, and the antibodies, when they

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.440
 finish cleaning up the damaged tissue, will gradually fade away.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:16.600
 It takes several months of keeping the TSH low, but there have been several publications

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:23.600
 demonstrating that the condition corrects itself after several months.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.760
 Wow, that's pretty trippy.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.920
 That applies to things like rheumatoid arthritis and several other types of so-called autoimmune

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920
 conditions.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.880
 Let's see, this is from Wendy.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:48.480
 Wondering if Dr. Peat knows anything about the Pearlsium powder that we promote.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.020
 It's made from just pearls.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.800
 If he thinks that would be a good source for calcium.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.180
 Do you know anything about that product?

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.180
 Made from what?

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.180
 Pearls.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.180
 Pearls.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:05.320
 Calcium carbonate, I think, is the best supplement.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.320
 Calcium carbonate.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:14.320
 Egg shells and oyster shells and other sea creatures' shells.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.320
 But you don't have any experience with the pearl itself.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320
 Pearl?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320
 Yeah, pearl.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320
 No, no.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:27.320
 Chinese medicine, all you've had to use is pearl for different things, and that's what

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.320
 she was asking.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.320
 Yeah, they're made of calcium carbonate.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.320
 Oh, they are?

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.320
 Oh, good.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.320
 So that's a good source, then.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320
 Yeah.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.320
 Good.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.960
 And the other question, well, I was glad to hear.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.960
 We thought so.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.760
 Would calcium, another source of calcium would be in fish bones, she's asking.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.960
 I used to eat sardines with fish bones.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:52.120
 They seemed digestible, but now with avoiding proofers, would the bones from cod or some

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.820
 other source be good as calcium source for those with sensitive guts?

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:09.820
 It is a calcium source that is okay, but the trouble is that it is calcium phosphate, and

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:18.580
 phosphate has an excitatory effect, and most people are overloading on phosphates, and

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.140
 so the bones will move in the right direction.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:31.900
 But if you're still eating a lot of meat, or meat and grains and legumes, for example,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:40.340
 are overloading you with phosphate, and so calcium phosphate helps, but it isn't as effective

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.340
 as calcium carbonate.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.020
 The carbonate, you like the carbonate.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.020
 I love this.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.860
 Cheryl writes, "Cody, she's in Florida."

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.860
 Well, thanks, Cody.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:56.980
 "I'm interested to know," oh, you asked Dr. Peat, "how long he sleeps each night, and do

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.020
 you sleep uninterrupted sleep?"

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.380
 She's asking about your sleep.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:10.900
 It depends on how good the weather is, how good my food was, and so on, but seven and

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.940
 a half to nine hours, it's variable.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:23.620
 Usually I wake up during the night and have some milk and sugar or orange juice to lower

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.020
 the stress.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:31.540
 Having milk at bedtime will lower several of the stress hormones.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:40.860
 I've got in the habit of, if I wake up in the night, having some sugar and milk or orange

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:49.740
 juice and milk, and that resets the hormones so that you don't experience the same amount

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.820
 of stress around dawn.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.820
 Yeah, what fun.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.980
 So you put, say, if you would have milk in the middle of the night when you wake up,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.420
 would you put actual sugar in there or honey or maple syrup?

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.420
 What would you use?

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.780
 Pure white sugar is the safest.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.780
 Really?

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.620
 Single figure.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.500
 Pure white sugar from Hawaii, right?

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.780
 Why is that the safest over ... You would think honey or maple syrup is a better choice,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.780
 no?

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:26.380
 Honey is very good, but if the bees happen to eat something you're allergic to, you can

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:34.580
 have an allergic reaction to the plant substance that gets into the honey.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:45.740
 Actual sugar is extremely nutritious for minerals, but the heating process makes the sugar allergenic.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.260
 I didn't know they heated it.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.140
 I thought they just kind of dump it out of the old tree.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:22:01.340
 It comes out in a very liquid, slightly amber color, but a very pale, thin liquid, and it

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:08.980
 has to be evaporated, and they use heat to evaporate it.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:16.420
 Theoretically, you could do it at room temperature with a high vacuum, but it's economical to

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.420
 heat it.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:27.780
 In the heating process, there are small amounts of amino acids in the juice as well as minerals,

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:36.780
 and when you heat glucose with an amino acid, it produces a toxic reactant.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.380
 Your go-to is C&H pure cane sugar from Hawaii?

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:46.260
 Well, actually ... You could probably get an organic one, though, can't you?

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:51.940
 Yeah, you can, but it's so well washed.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:23:01.380
 You get 99 and more percent pure sucrose, but I think beet sugar might even be better.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.660
 Oh, beet sugar.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.660
 Is that white?

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.660
 Oh, sure.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.180
 Yeah, they're washed.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:16.180
 They would be brown, but they wash the molasses away, and the molasses is brown partly because

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:22.380
 of the heat process reacting amino acids with the glucose, making a brown substance that

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:35.420
 is similar to the substance that's produced in aging, reacting glucose with amino acids.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.940
 Have I read or did I dream this, that a lot of the beets are genetically modified now?

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.820
 You want to do organic?

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.340
 Oh, probably.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.860
 You hopefully aren't getting any proteins.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:53.500
 The proteins are the allergenic, toxic form, and that's what genetic modification does,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:59.540
 is make new proteins which are toxic and allergenic.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.500
 Here's one.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.980
 I know that Dr. Peters recommended raw carrots, cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots for the antibiotic

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:13.780
 properties, but that our gut bacteria can get used to these.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:24.180
 Is just alternating with those enough, or should one supplement with doses of antibiotics?

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:34.620
 If you're having a problem with hormone imbalance and stress, at a fertility clinic about 35

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:43.540
 years ago, they had the theory that infertility might be caused by germs, and so they gave

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:52.700
 some women antibiotics and didn't do much for their fertility that they saw, but a lot

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:59.300
 of them said that their PMS and headaches had gone away.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:04.340
 So they started measuring their hormones, and they found that in fact it had improved

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:14.020
 their fertility balance by lowering estrogen and cortisol and increasing their progesterone.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:20.940
 That wasn't just a fertility clinic in humans, but people then tested it in animals, and

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:28.980
 a course of antibiotics reliably lowered estrogen and cortisol, the stress hormones, and increased

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.380
 progesterone.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.260
 That's the idea of the fiber.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:45.260
 When the fiber is working, it is binding and eliminating estrogen so it isn't reabsorbed

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.060
 and passed through the liver repeatedly.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:56.460
 The fiber eliminates estrogen, that lowers the stress, so your cortisol goes down, and

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:02.180
 that combination allows your progesterone to be retained properly.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.140
 Go figure.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.140
 That's really interesting.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.140
 I sure like Dr. Peat's show.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.140
 Thanks for having him on.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:15.060
 On a previous show, Dr. Peat mentioned possibly placing a red light at your bedside with a

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.420
 timer to come on intermittently through the night to eliminate the reduce of stress caused

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.820
 by darkness.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:26.780
 Did you further ask about implementing this idea and if it would be helpful or not?

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.980
 Maybe somebody else mentioned that.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.580
 I don't know if you said that.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.580
 Sorry.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.620
 Did you talk about that idea of intermittent red light?

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.620
 Yeah.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:41.420
 I've tried different things, and it bothered me to have it come on in my face.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:51.180
 So I made a paddle or a belt with LEDs and found that putting it on my leg didn't bother

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:52.820
 me so much.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:27:00.180
 And shining red light on your blood, anywhere in your body, has a de-stressing effect.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:09.540
 But I have not consistently used that.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:20.380
 I think it's adequate to have a chronic daylight, continuous incandescent or sunlight during

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.020
 the daytime is enough to lower your stress.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:31.580
 But I think it is good to have an air ionizer running all the time, especially during the

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:42.780
 night, because negatively ionized air activates your lungs' ability to lower serotonin and

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.580
 lower the stress of night.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.580
 What's an air ionizer?

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.580
 What does it do?

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.580
 I don't know if I know about that.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.260
 Oh, that's a negative ion generator?

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.460
 Yeah.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:28:05.460
 It adds electrons to the oxygen and it creates, in effect, radical, as far as your lung enzymes

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:16.580
 can tell, it's activated metabolic oxygen, more immediately accessible to destroy serotonin

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.660
 as it reaches your lungs.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:26.540
 And the lungs are constantly keeping your serotonin in check.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:34.620
 When a person has a digestive problem that wakes them up at night with various symptoms,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:41.580
 including insomnia, that irritation of the intestine is putting tremendous amounts of

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:49.660
 serotonin into your blood, carried on the platelets, depending on your lungs to inactivate

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.060
 it.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:29:02.140
 And if your estrogen happens to be high, then your lungs are relatively inactive in destroying

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.540
 the serotonin.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:12.500
 Many things can make your lungs inefficient, leaving the serotonin active, causing insomnia.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.820
 What do you do in a case like that in the middle of the night?

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:20.140
 What would be any kind of symptomatic relief?

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.140
 Milk and sugar.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.140
 Milk and sugar, huh?

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.140
 Yeah.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.500
 Good old milk and sugar.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:31.520
 Last month, Sue, she's in Canada, she talked about how, Dr. Peat talked about how protein

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.660
 powders except for gelatin contain some toxic amino acids.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.500
 Please ask Dr. Peat whether hydrolyzed collagen powder is as effective as gelatin powder for

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.980
 protein and whether it has toxic effects.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:57.540
 I know that the amino acids tryptophan, cysteine, and methionine are the ones that are susceptible

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:03.780
 to toxic oxidation, and gelatin just doesn't have those.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:12.820
 And so you can predigest the gelatin into the amino acids.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:23.860
 Hydrolyzed gelatin is short peptides and some free amino acids.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:33.200
 As far as I know, they're easy to digest and are no more problem than natural gelatin.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.740
 So you like the Great Lakes gelatin and those kind of products as protein powders go, you

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.500
 like those the best, is that what you're saying?

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:50.700
 Yeah, or making your own gelatin with chicken back wings and legs and feet.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.940
 Yeah, we've been doing it with the feet in a crock pot and boy, is there a lot of

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.940
 gelatin in there?

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.940
 Holy cow, yeah, it's a lot.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.180
 You put that in the fridge and it's just solid, just like solid as a rock.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.700
 Yeah, that's very good protective nutrition.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:16.140
 An adult can use a very high proportion of their protein as gelatin.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:23.140
 A growing kid needs some of those potentially toxic amino acids.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:32.940
 Tryptophan and cysteine are needed for growth, but once you have achieved full growth, all

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.340
 they're needed for is things like the turnover of cells.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:43.540
 Renewal is running at a lower rate than expansion of volume.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:49.380
 I should mention that a fellow, Tony, has put together a really nice little array of

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.340
 these red incandescent lights, the chicken lamps.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.560
 There's five of them and they're on a board with a little switch and it's in our store.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.420
 Very well built and you can just probably set this guy somewhere in your living room,

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.740
 I guess at night or wherever you stay, and just shine the red light on you and it'll

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.340
 be beneficial, wouldn't it, Dr. Peat?

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.740
 It doesn't have to be all that close to you?

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:16.340
 No, and it penetrates very well.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:25.860
 Red light, if you've looked at your hand against the sun, you can see red light coming through.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:34.460
 That's because red light penetrates very well and the blue and green light is absorbed superficially.

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:41.180
 So, relatively weak red light will penetrate your tissues.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.580
 So the length, the distance between these lights is not critical?

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:50.460
 No, the brighter, the quicker it works, though.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.460
 Sure.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.620
 These guys get pretty hot, so I guess you have to gauge that of how warm you want to

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.620
 be.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.620
 Yeah.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.960
 In the winter, though, I mean, just keep warm.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.620
 How important is an optimal thyroid function to consider, writes an emailer, for stomach

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:12.300
 acid production due to the high concentration of mitochondria in parallel cells where stomach

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.300
 acid is produced?

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:27.220
 Thyroid makes carbon dioxide and the carbon dioxide is flowing in proportion to your metabolic

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.220
 activity.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:36.260
 So you have a high oxidizing function governed by thyroid that creates the stomach acid.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:44.380
 So you start with carbonic acid and use that to energize the production of hydrochloric

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.780
 acid.

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:51.700
 So low thyroid would often be correlated with low stomach acid?

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.860
 Yeah.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:34:02.620
 Low digestion, all of the digestive processes tend to slow down, but gastroparesis is supposedly

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:10.860
 a mysterious condition that is usually immediately remedied by thyroid supplements.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.860
 Oh, my goodness.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.860
 Well, let's see.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.860
 It's time to go here.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.860
 Let's see.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.860
 Let's do a couple more, then we'll let you go.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:28.860
 What?

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:36.220
 Oh, there was one here I thought was interesting.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:42.780
 Many Catholic monks somehow live past 100 who are nothing but bread and water.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.580
 Do you think their lack of movement may have conserved their carbon dioxide?

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.580
 That's a great question.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:35:01.740
 Yeah, the church, both the Orthodox Church in the Caucasus region and the Catholic Church

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:08.180
 in South America, for example, they've been keeping marriage, birth, and death records

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.300
 for hundreds of years.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:21.860
 And they've documented lots of people living 130, 150 years and more in these areas.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:30.300
 In England, they keep pretty good records going back several hundred years.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:41.180
 And they have the record of one old guy, Old Parr, they called him, lived into his 150s

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.780
 according to good documents.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:55.860
 He was taken to visit the king because he was such an exceptional person.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:01.860
 He died shortly after visiting the king and changing his diet.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:16.020
 He said he had habitually eaten cheese and bread crusts, a very cheap, minimal diet.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.900
 But he died after having some banquets with the king.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.060
 Oh, because they eat all this rich food, the kings?

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.100
 And he died.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:33.660
 And an autopsy found that there was no disease in his body in his 150s.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:47.300
 And in Abkhazia in the Caucasus and Vilkabamba in the Andes, there are well-documented multiple

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.780
 cases of people in their 140s and 50s and older.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.740
 What kind of diets today get to 140?

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.380
 Very simple diets.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:06.580
 And those are high altitude areas where they have both sheep, goats and cows.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:15.220
 And so they eat a good proportion of milk and cheese in their diet, as well as having

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:22.580
 the high altitude environment that spares their carbon dioxide.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:40.580
 And the monks and priests have usually a very simple, routine diet.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:47.300
 I think sometimes they might fall into just the right balance of nutrients, not too much

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.420
 meat, for example.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:57.700
 Meat is a very pro-aging thing because of the low calcium, high phosphate content.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.740
 I think the high phosphate is probably one of the life-shortening things.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.780
 Oh, there we are with the phosphate again.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:11.700
 You don't generally think, or maybe I don't, I'm just not thinking properly about bread

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:19.100
 as being nutritious, but I guess it depends on the original grain and how it's made and

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.100
 everything?

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.020
 A little bit, yeah.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:32.860
 If it's made traditionally, letting the yeast rise gradually, keeping the grain moist, the

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:38.660
 grain thinks it's sprouting when you let it leaven naturally.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:44.700
 The moisture activates enzymes that break down the gluten and reduce the toxicity and

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:46.020
 make it more digestible.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:58.740
 So it's a reliable, simple carbohydrate source and it does provide the trace minerals.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:07.020
 If they have cheese or milk to balance that, the calcium becomes the predominant mineral,

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:11.300
 which I think has an anti-stress, life-prolonging effect.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.820
 Well, that's kind of fun.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.500
 You could just live on toasted cheese sandwiches and milk.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.020
 That'd be kind of cool.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.100
 Okay, finally, what's your take?

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.420
 I don't know if we've ever asked you about this, about the whole gluten thing.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:29.940
 Give us, to kind of wrap up your opinion on what's going on with this gluten sensitivity,

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.660
 where how it began and stuff.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:45.060
 Partly the seeds and grains have their plant defense systems.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:56.820
 Leaves contain insecticides and flavor irritants that discourage grazing from cows and insects

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.260
 and worms and such.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:06.140
 And the seeds are very important for the plant's survival, just like the leaves.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:15.820
 The worst toxins tend to be put in the seeds to block digestion and cause as much trouble

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.700
 for the predator of the plant as possible.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:30.300
 And polyunsaturated fats are able to inhibit digestion if they're an oily seed.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:41.620
 And the high-gluten seed, the gluten itself, is able to block digestive processes and cause

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.740
 inflammation.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:55.180
 There are parts of the gluten molecule that have similar effects to estrogen for creating

00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.580
 allergic reactions in the intestine, inflammatory reactions.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:09.540
 And if you let the enzymes activate the seeds so that, as far as it knows, it has succeeded

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:21.980
 in becoming a plant, then the intense toxins of the seed have been inactivated and you

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:33.380
 have the stem chemicals, which are much less toxic than either the mature leaf or the seed.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:47.300
 So leavened bread is detoxified, basically, when it's soaked for about 12 hours in moisture.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.020
 So is the gluten sensitivity, it's a real thing?

00:41:51.020 --> 00:42:02.580
 Yeah, it's an objective thing that if your immune system is very active and stable, you

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:09.860
 can adapt to it and pass it along quickly enough without damage.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:17.220
 Have you had experience with some of this real ancient wheat, einkorn, the real deal?

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.460
 Have you ever experienced any of that?

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:30.260
 If they aren't leavened, the smaller seeds have some of the more intense toxins, same

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.220
 with small beans.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:40.380
 The embryo is the larger part and the storage protein is smaller, but there are some very

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:47.060
 intense allergens in the smaller, more primitive seeds.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:53.300
 So it's still important to make sure they're well leavened.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:59.820
 So the leavening, the yeast and the sourdough make it nicer for us?

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:03.780
 Yeah, less allergenic.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.620
 So if you were going to do some sprouts, do you do sprouts at all?

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.340
 Do you make your own sprouts at all?

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.340
 Not for many years.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:17.020
 If you were going to do some, somebody wants to know what would be your favorites to do,

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:22.180
 the most digestible is what they're asking, George.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:30.820
 They're all vastly more digestible than the seeds, but they should be cooked.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.100
 To improve their digestibility, they should be well cooked.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.500
 You cook sprouts as well?

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:45.760
 The Chinese, either a bean or a grain.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:54.380
 If it's fully sprouted, it develops at least twice as much protein value as was in the

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.860
 bean or the grain itself.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:04.140
 So you're getting an actual protein supplement when you're sprouting.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:09.060
 We used to do black beans and other beans, aduki beans, and you can sprout those guys

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.460
 just on a wet towel, right?

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:15.180
 You can see a little tail come out and then you can cook them.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:20.300
 So it really zoops up the protein, huh?

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.660
 At the same time that it's reducing the allergenicity and toxicity.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.900
 You can pretty much sprout any kind of bean, can't you, Doc?

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.980
 Can you soak them first and sprout them?

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:37.100
 Yeah, if they haven't been sterilized, which some products in the U.S. supermarkets have

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.740
 been irradiated or heated or chemically treated.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.220
 Do you know if they can irradiate organic?

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.740
 Do we know if that's a protection, being organic?

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:54.180
 I haven't heard what the latest standards are, but they're pushing in that direction.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.180
 Are they?

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.180
 Yeah.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.620
 Well, Doc, so it's such an honor to have you on and people love you and you're just one

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.420
 of our most popular podcasts around here.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.700
 You get a lot of hits, so thank you for that.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.620
 Final question before you go.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:13.740
 Are you focused on anything in particular research-wise that maybe we'll talk about next month or

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.860
 anything that really has your interest?

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:30.180
 Yeah, I'm trying to put together a more systematic picture of how serotonin fits into stress

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:35.860
 and aging.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:50.580
 It probably is a point where intervention to reduce sickness, autoimmunity, and age-related

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.380
 degenerative conditions.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:46:00.540
 I think aiming towards lowering serotonin is going to be one of the most productive

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:02.820
 things.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:13.540
 I see research moving in that direction, contrary to the powers of the pharmaceutical industry,

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:22.180
 which want to still say serotonin is wonderful stuff and you should buy our antidepressants.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:34.100
 But there are alternative antidepressants being demonstrated to be safer while lowering

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:43.020
 serotonin and promoting health rather than degrading health.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.060
 So that's the research you're working.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:51.580
 Just off the top, did I ask you, sorry, if I did some natural ways to lower the serotonin?

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:54.500
 Did we talk about that?

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:59.180
 Yeah, we've already covered a lot of them.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:06.540
 Thyroid, vitamin D, calcium, sugar, and the things in orange juice.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.260
 Oh good, all our favorite things, yeah.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.460
 Calcium and orange juice, vitamin D. Good.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.940
 Well, Dr. Peat, thanks for being here.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.300
 We'll see you in about a month or so and maybe we'll have more to talk about serotonin.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:27.260
 Dr. Peat's website is raypeat.com and we'll have a link to that and also right to a place

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.380
 where you can sign up for a headset.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.060
 Every other month, how much does your little...

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:37.780
 Twenty-eight dollars by email.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:38.780
 For how long?

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.780
 Two years.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.780
 That's great.

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.780
 Twelve issues.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:42.780
 Good for you.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.820
 So every other month you get twelve issues for twenty-eight dollars.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.820
 Good job.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.780
 All right, Dr. Peat, thank you for being here.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.340
 We'll see you real soon, okay?

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.340
 Okay, thank you.

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.340
 Yes, sir.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.340
 Bye-bye.

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:56.500
 Dr. Ray Peat, wow, it's just great fun, isn't it?

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.620
 Isn't it cool having him on?

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.260
 Yeah, man, when he answers these questions and starts talking about research that people

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.820
 were doing twenty, thirty, forty years ago, it's like, "Whoa."

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.180
 Yeah, so there's some good stuff here for you.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.820
 Please pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:17.340
 We tried to do the best we could with getting all the emails and we skipped around to try

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.740
 to get a wide variety, and I think we went through a lot of them today.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:22.740
 I'll see you tomorrow.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:23.980
 We're going to do our money show.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.980
 That'll be fun.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:32.900
 It's been a couple weeks with Fred Dashefsky, Andy's partner, Andy Goss's partner, and he'll

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.060
 be here with the real world of money, so we'll have a good time.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.060
 And then Carrie Rivera, she's going to be here on Thursday, and Carrie's quite a gal

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:47.700
 and has done terrific work with diet and gut and the autistic kids, and she's messed around

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:55.820
 with the Miracle Mineral Supplement, and so it'll be quite a fun show on Thursday.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:58.540
 So thanks for your ongoing support.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:04.260
 We appreciate it if you feel itchy fingers and you have some money to spend on your health.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:09.140
 We've got a lot of cool products, as you know, from Ken Roller's things to Brandon Amelani's

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:18.420
 to Daniel Vitalis to now that we have the hydrogen machine getting some pretty good

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.820
 hits on the hydrogen machine.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:33.100
 This one fellow, he said, "I love the Brown Gatsby machine."

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.660
 This is Edward in Florida.

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.660
 I love it.

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:41.940
 And if you notice that less appetite and better sleep, and I have, and I really got to watch

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.980
 that because the last thing I need is to eat less.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:49.260
 You just live on hydrogen, you know, it's fine if you're going to be a monk or something.

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.580
 So it was so funny he said that because I have noticed, so I'm just going to have to

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:59.660
 work through that and just make sure I keep eating so I don't wisp away with the wind.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:00.660
 But these are cool.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:05.300
 But anyway, so we have a lot of great products, and don't forget if you'd like to get a

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:09.860

 I'm at your service so I can help with anything.

 I don't get far from my computer.

 We're out in the country, but I'm checking email several times throughout the day.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.140

 That's all you do, right?
