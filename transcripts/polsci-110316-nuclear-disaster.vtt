WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Alright, this is WMRW LP1 and I think I have Maggie on the line. Maggie, can you hear me?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Yes, I can and I'm right here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Okay, great. That doesn't sound too bad.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 We're talking to Maggie Gunderson today. This is Politics and Science on the 16th of March, 2011.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 And today we're discussing our nuclear catastrophe in our world today happening in Japan.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 And after Maggie's off, we'll be talking to Raymond Peat.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is a physiologist from Eugene, Oregon, talking about how to mitigate the effects of radiation.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Maggie Gunderson is founder and president of Fairwinds Associates

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 and a freelance paralegal specializing in environmental nuclear safety and energy litigation in federal and state administrative law hearings.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 And you worked in the nuclear industry for a while, right Maggie, as did your husband Arnie?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Yes, we both did. That's where we met.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Well, thankful that you're with us here today.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 And I was hoping you could bring us up to date with what exactly is happening over in Japan

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 and what the ramifications are for that part of the world and for us.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Okay, well, the news that just came during the last hour is that all the fuel has boiled dry.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Say that again. We lost you there.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 All the fuel has boiled dry in Unit 4.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 And that's within the spent fuel pool. It's not in the reactor itself.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Now that was a full core offload.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 So that's a tremendous amount of radioactive fuel that is getting very, very hot.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 And there's a fear that it could catch on fire.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 If it catches fire, those particles become airborne.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 It's a worse scenario than having a meltdown.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 It is?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Yes, it is.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Because that radiation will travel anywhere.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 If there's a meltdown, it does get into the water table, but you're able to monitor.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 You might even be able to -- they might even be able to corral some of the contamination

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 and do things to mitigate.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 But this is airborne, and this will go wherever the air blows.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It's like if you see someone smoking a cigarette and somebody just walks past and the plume changes.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 The plume can move in whatever direction the wind is blowing, toward Tokyo, toward the U.S.,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 toward mainland China and, you know, across the rest of Japan.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 It can go whichever way the wind is blowing.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And I know --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Go ahead.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 I know Chernobyl was terrible because it was an explosion, and that forced the radiation --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 and that was a core meltdown, wasn't it?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 No.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 It wasn't.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 There was a graphite fire.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 The Chernobyl plant is a graphite plant and was not a liquid reactor like we're talking about.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 And there was a fire in the graphite.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Only -- at Chernobyl, only 90 -- well, only 3% of the radiation is safe.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 The other 97% is still inside the containment inside the sarcophagus that they built around it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 This accident, since the containment has failed, this radiation is getting out to the environment.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 As a matter of fact, the U.S. Surgeon General was on a tour in California and spoke of the fact that anyone in the U.S.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 should consider getting potassium iodide to protect their thyroid.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 It would be a prudent thing to do.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And the NRC announced today and the State Department announced today that they told all personnel in Japan,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 U.S. personnel in Japan, to go at least 80 miles away from what's happening.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 And that's more than double what the Japanese are saying.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And the NRC is usually -- I never thought of them as being actually that worried about low-level radiation.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Well, it's not low-level radiation.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 It's not an explosion like a bomb, but it's not low-level radiation.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Okay.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 There are no more personnel on site operating the plants.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 They've had to remove them because the radiation levels are too high.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 So basically, they're just running their course.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 They're running their course.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 They do have people who are risking their lives to keep putting water on the plant and taking care of the plant.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 That way to try and keep -- they're pumping seawater up there.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 But there's no operational things that they can do.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 And so that's the fuel rods.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Are they the ones -- is number four one of the reactors that was out of commission?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 And so all the fuel rods were waiting to be --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Yes.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Okay.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Had been offloaded into the fuel pool.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 So what's really scary about that is that there is no -- there are no rods to put in,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 control rods to put in to slow down the reaction.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 The fuel rods are in the fuel pool, and there's no way to -- as the water burns off,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 there's nothing to keep that fuel pool cool.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 If the fuel gets really hot and starts a chain reaction, it cannot be stopped

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 because there's not anything to moderate that chain reaction.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 That was the difference with Chernobyl.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Chernobyl's a plant that works -- as the chain reaction is going on inside,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 the operators have to work really hard to pull it back.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 It's like a gas pedal pushing downwards all the time.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 In the Japanese plants, which are the same as the Vermont Yankee plant,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 they're boiling water reactors, the same vintage, same design.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 They're Westing -- I mean, they're General Electric boiling water reactors.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Also, both General Electric and Westinghouse now are owned by the Japanese.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 The boiling water reactor works -- you have to push the gas.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 You have to push the reaction to happen, and you have a lot of control on it.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 But they don't have control on this because this is the spent fuel all just sitting there together.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 There's no control rods in there.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And as the decay causes many chain reactions, you could have a fire or a meltdown in the fuel pool itself.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 That's about as technical as I can get.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 You listed on your website that I'm a nuclear expert, and I am an industry expert,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 but I'm a paralegal, and I'm a mediator.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 That's the angle.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 I'm not as technical as Arnie.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 Okay.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Well, you're probably more technical than I am and most of the people listening,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 so I think that suffices.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 So that's just going into freefall, basically.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 And what's the state of the other reactors?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 There's six of them there; is that right, at that Fukushima power station?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Yes.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 And there are--well, two of them already are in partial meltdown.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 What happens when the reactor is operating and when they stopped it?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And when the storm came up, when the earthquake started, they stopped the reaction.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 The emergency system worked, and the reaction was stopped.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 But when they couldn't keep the reactor cool, there are things that--

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 there's 5% of the heat is decay heat, and that is what has kept burning.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 The other 95% was stopped, but the decay heat is enough to keep boiling off all the water.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 The diesels had gotten swamped by the tsunami, so they didn't have any backup power,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 and they couldn't cool the reactor for a really long time, any of them.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 From my understanding--and this has been changing hour by hour,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 so I can't be totally clear on what's happening.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 I saw three different reports before I came on with you.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Two reactors have had a partial meltdown.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 You know, they have parts that are melting down, and how bad that will be will depend on

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 how much seawater these employees who are risking their lives being in such a high radiation area.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 I mean, it's just incredible.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 They are pumping in tons of seawater to try and make like a lake under the reactors.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 These reactors are raised, so--and in a boiling water reactor,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 the control rods come up from the bottom into the reactor itself.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 So, whereas the pressurized water reactor--and I worked on pressurized water reactors.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 I have never worked with boiling water reactors.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 I worked on nuclear fuel reload core design, so that's doing the calculations for the fuel,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 each fuel reload on TWRs.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 However, you know, whether it's a year, 18 months, whatever, the utility has decided to run for it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 And the BWRs, the control rods come up from the bottom.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 So, those daughter products can come through.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 The bottom of the reactor is not as tight as on a pressurized water reactor.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 It's very tight.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 The control rods come down from the top.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 So, those daughter products that are generating all this excess heat are slumping into the bottom

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 and making a molten mass, and that is coming out of the bottom of the reactor.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 That's why they're trying to cool it.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 They're making a lake underneath that between the base of the metal reactor and, you know,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 the vessel itself and the concrete base of the containment.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Someone asked me, "Is this special concrete?"

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 And I said, "Special nuclear-grade concrete."

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 It's concrete.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 It's just regular concrete.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 I mean, like you would find on a bridge or something.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 There's not a special nuclear grade to it.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 And how long can that hold up to temperatures that I've heard are like 2200 degrees?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Well, as--no one knows.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 I mean, we're in uncharted territory here.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 The fuel pool can get up to 4000 degrees.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 And we're in uncharted territory.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 And when there's some studies I looked at them today,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 and NEI, the Nuclear Energy Institute, which is the lobbying arm of the industry,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 is saying this, you know, there can't be a fire in the fuel pool where there's already been one.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 There's, you know, a containment can't leak where two of them have blown their lids off.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Right, so this--

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 We need to go back and look at the general design criteria on every nuclear plant.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 And a lot of them are just--they're too old.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Vermont Yankee, Oyster Creek, Pilgrim, these are very, very old, old, old plants

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 that don't have any current safety standards around them.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 And they have been--all of the parameters under which they were built have been grandfathered in.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 So they don't need the current regulations.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Yeah, that's scary.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 And Vermont Yankee got an uprate 10 years ago, I think.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 So it's actually--

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 The uprate is really a frightening thing because if there's an accident at Vermont Yankee,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 then there is 40% more radiation than a normal accident because of the uprate.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Even though the uprate was 25%, the way the daughter products act, the way the material acts,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 you get 40% more radiation in the uprate.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And the emergency evacuation plan was designed around the way the plant was built before the uprate.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 It is not possible to get everyone out before there would be a lethal dose

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 if there was a severe accident at Yankee like there has been here

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 because there's just--the evacuation plan, emergency plan does not work.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And we only have a few more minutes, Maggie Gunderson.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 I was wondering, people would say, well, Vermont Yankee is not at risk

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 because it's not an earthquake zone and there's no danger of tsunami.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 But it is next to a river.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Is there a flooding danger there?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Yes, there is a flooding danger there.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Hurricanes that could knock out power or do something to unstabilize the grid,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Vermont Yankee's backup power is diesel just like the plants in Japan.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 If they were involved in a flood or a hurricane and couldn't operate,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 then there's no backup power there.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And if a huge storm and flooding knocked out the service water that cools the plant

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 and that comes out of the Connecticut River, or a terrorist.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 I mean, one of the things Union of Concerned Scientists has really worked hard,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 pushing the NRC on the threat matrix since 9/11, since 2001,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 on there's not enough protection at these intake structures.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 And if somebody took a Miami Vice-style boat and filled it with dynamite

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and ran it in there and knocked out the service water at the same time

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 the diesels were knocked out somehow, you couldn't cool that plant.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 And the NRC does not consider that a realistic part of its threat matrix.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 They don't even consider these as possibilities.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 Well, that's not very reassuring to say the least.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Maggie, I know you're not a meteorologist,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 but do you know how the fallout from what's happening in Japan might behave?

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Have you talked to anybody who has an opinion about that?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 I don't know that.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 And, again, no one knows.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 I mean, will a lot of that come across the Pacific and come to the U.S.?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 There's extensive data from bomb testing that was done in the Pacific originally,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 and a lot of that strontium and cesium were carried to the U.S. during those tests

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 and absorbed into kids' muscles and bones and things.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 So I don't know.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 No one knows.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 We're in uncharted territory.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 This accident is worse than Three Mile Island, worse than Chernobyl,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 and is the worst accident that this world has ever seen of any kind of industrial accident

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 or any kind of--you know, in terms of an illness,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 the only other thing that was as bad as this was the bubonic plague, but that ended.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Here there's a half-life of hundreds of years on some of these radioactive isotopes

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 and plutonium, and these plants are running amidst some plutonium in them.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 There's going to be 250,000-year waste left.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Jeez.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Well, it sounds like you were once, I assume, in favor of nuclear power.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 It sounds like you may have changed your position.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 That's correct.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 I was in favor of nuclear power.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 I believe--you know, I'm a woman, and I was part of Jobs for Energy Independence,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 which was a U.S. organization, and I was working in the nuclear industry in part

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 to make sure when there's plenty of energy available, women and minorities have jobs.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And when energy gets really costly or there's economic issues, women and minorities lose those jobs.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 So that's why I began in the nuclear industry.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 And the scientists had assured me it was the safest thing, and I don't believe it anymore.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Well, I can see why.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Maggie, I'm going to have to--oh, go ahead, please.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 I hope I've answered all your questions, and I want to tell everyone, please, to be praying

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 or thinking for the people of Japan.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 This is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 All right.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Thank you very much, Maggie Gunderson, and I hope to check in with you again soon.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 Okay.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 You're very welcome, John.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Take care.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Yeah, you too.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Bye.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Bye.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 All right.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 That was Maggie Gunderson, who is founder and president of Fairwind Associates.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 She's a freelance paralegal specializing in environmental, nuclear safety, and energy litigation

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 in federal and state administrative law hearings.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 So I'm going to put on some music.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 And let's see, something by Tom Waits, and I'll be back with Dr. Raymond Peet, physiologist,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 and we'll be talking about radiation, its effect on life, and how to mitigate the negative

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 effects, which I think is all they have.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 All right.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Here's Tom Waits.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 All right.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 I'm back live here on the 16th of March with Dr. Raymond Peet, who's a physiologist and

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 a biologist and a science historian from Eugene, Oregon.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Ray, can you hear me?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 Yes, very well.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 Oh, good.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 You sound great.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Well, thanks for coming on today.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 I thought, considering the catastrophe and tragedy that's happening in Japan right now,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 we'd talk about radiation, which is probably going to be circulating around the globe,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 and some of it will be heading toward the United States and Canada, I'm sure.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 And I thought maybe we could talk about radiation's effects on the body and ways that it can be

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 mitigated.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 So maybe you could start out just by talking about radiation.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 The first issue of my newsletter in 1981 was about the issue of radiation damage.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Radiation damage?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Yeah.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And I read lots of mostly Soviet research.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 They were the ones mostly interested in how to repair damage.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And the main factors are the amount of magnesium in the cell and the metabolic rate.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And it happens that thyroid hormone is what's needed for the cell to retain magnesium at

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 a high level.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 And this old research that I reviewed 30 years ago, the central idea was the high metabolic

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 rate activating repair processes so that once the damage was done, it was almost immediately

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 repaired.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 The thyroid function was very high, allowing cells to retain magnesium.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And just in the last couple of years, a group studying the radio-resistant bacteria, they've

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 been found in several situations.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 They were discovered at Oregon State University when they were sterilizing food with super

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 intense radiation in cans.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 And the irradiated food, after a few weeks, rotted.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 And they found there were bacteria that survived millions of rad.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 And this type of bacteria just recently was found not to have any special resistance of

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 its DNA, but the protein system that repairs the DNA is what is uniquely resistant to radiation

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 damage.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 So the DNA can be torn into tiny fragments, but if you have the enzymes left for repairing,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 the bacteria re-establish their DNA from tiny little scraps if their proteins are good.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 And this group recently discovered that manganese is a central factor for the survival of these

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 bacteria.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And what the manganese is doing is catalyzing very fast metabolism of glucose.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.840
 Hey, Ray, I'm going to interrupt because we're having the same phone problem again where

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.840
 it's clipping your voice.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:41.840
 Yes, it's a terrible echo.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.840
 Oh, you're getting an echo.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.840
 I didn't know that.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:44.840
 Yeah.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.840
 How's that?

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.840
 When you talk now, how is that?

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.840
 That may have decreased.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.840
 There's a slight echo, but it sounded like there were three of us for a while.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.840
 I just don't understand why it's doing that.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.840
 Well, try it again and we'll see if it goes.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.840
 I may call you back and see if we can get rid of that.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.840
 Okay.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.840
 Anyway, the very fast glucose metabolism is almost all turned into carbon dioxide.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:29.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:58.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:40.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:28:06.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:16.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:42.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:52.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:29:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:22.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:42.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:30:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:22.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:42.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:31:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:22.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:42.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:32:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:22.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:42.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:33:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:22.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:42.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:34:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:22.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:42.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:35:02.840
 And it's a very, very fast process.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:09.840
 You said before that radiation is very similar in its effects to estrogen.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.840
 And people actually take estrogen as a supplement in hormone replacement.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:22.840
 Could you comment on the similarity in the effects of radiation and estrogen?

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840
 Yeah.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.840
 A lot of this research was done in the late 1930s.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:43.840
 And the estrogen functions were identified as similar to suffocation and stress and radiation.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:53.840
 And about 50 years later, when the concept of estrogen receptor was introduced,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:02.840
 there was a great push to distract people from the biochemical effects of estrogen

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:11.840
 and blame all of estrogen's effects on the actions of a receptor protein,

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:19.840
 which was supposed to activate the genes which create the female traits.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:27.840
 It turned out that that was really the research was supported by the Atomic Energy Commission.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:34.840
 And it claimed that estrogen is not metabolized in the cells where it's acting.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:40.840
 And 20 years later, that was proven to be absolutely false.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:45.840
 And the fact that it was supported by the Atomic Energy Commission

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.840
 and done by a man who had been working in chemical warfare,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:56.840
 I think, makes up the whole foundation of the receptor theory suspect.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:07.840
 Because the 1930s research was very clear that any stress activates,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.840
 including the protein that is now called the estrogen receptor,

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.840
 any injury to the organism increases the appearance of the estrogen receptor

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:25.840
 as well as the estrogen function, which include inflammation, water uptake,

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:37.840
 suppression of the respiratory function, and eventually atrophy and fibrosis and calcification.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.840
 And cancer.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.840
 Yeah.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:46.840
 And radiation has those similar effects, I understand.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.840
 Yeah.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:57.840
 Biochemically, they seem, my dissertation was part of it was trying to find anything different

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:03.840
 between radiation stress and estrogen's effect.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:10.840
 And I couldn't find any basic physiological or biochemical difference between them.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:19.840
 They both interfere with oxidative metabolism and activate the stress metabolism.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:30.840
 So I think that means that we have evolved estrogen simply as a way to activate certain biological processes,

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:39.840
 cell division in preparation for implantation of the embryo and uterus,

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.840
 cell division to develop the breast to give milk,

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:51.840
 and cell division in the pituitary to activate prolactin secretion.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:59.840
 And it takes only about 12 hours of exposure to estrogen to get those processes going.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:10.840
 So I think the biological meaning of estrogen is just like a quick jump start function for certain processes.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:18.840
 And the chronic use of it is completely contrary to the real biological research

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:28.840
 and really has no foundation other than the marketing departments of the drug companies

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:35.840
 and whatever the military has in mind.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.840
 How does the military fit into this?

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:48.840
 Well, they are the ones that promoted the concept of the estrogen receptor.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:55.840
 Elwood Benson went from working on chemical warfare to working on the estrogen receptor.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:05.840
 And his group and the people in it have formed a tradition supported by the Pentagon.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:15.840
 Some of them have been working more recently at Lawrence Livermore Radiation Lab on the estrogen receptor.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:21.840
 So for 60 years now it has been of great importance,

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:30.840
 first to the military and the Atomic Energy Commission and now to various government agencies.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.840
 That seems a little bizarre to me,

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:42.840
 but I guess they were always looking for things to use as weapons basically.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:56.840
 Yeah, at different times they have been interested in its birth control effect, population control.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:01.840
 That's one of the things they were studying, I think you've written about this,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.840
 they did releases of large amounts of radiation

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.840
 and then studied the effect it had on population and sterility and such.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:24.840
 Yeah, and estrogen is really a more controllable way to sterilize the population.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:32.840
 Maybe you could talk a little bit about the danger we face from what's coming out of Japan now

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.840
 and this tragic meltdown of the nuclear reactors.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.840
 Is this particulate radiation that we're going to be exposed to

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.840
 and that's going to go up into the atmosphere and travel around the globe?

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.840
 Yeah, as long as it stays very high in the atmosphere and doesn't rain out,

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.840
 it isn't going to do too much harm.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:02.840
 But if it doesn't rain out in the Pacific

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:08.840
 and if it happens to get through a dry spell for a few days across the Pacific

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:15.840
 and then rains out wherever it comes down, it will do a lot of damage.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:24.840
 A few of the bombs that exploded in Nevada happened to stay in the air

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:33.840
 until one of the fallout clouds rained down in Pennsylvania, I guess,

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:39.840
 was the one that Ernest Sternglass happened to be on the site

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:48.840
 and saw that his radiation measurements were showing extreme contamination

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.840
 while the government was saying nothing had happened.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:59.840
 That started Sternglass on his research on what was really happening

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.840
 and he showed how the U.S. Public Health Service

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.840
 was collaborating with the Atomic Energy Commission

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.840
 and even state government agencies to put out false information

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.840
 and destroy the actual data.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:24.840
 So whatever we're going to hear from the governments of Japan and the United States,

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:30.840
 I don't think there's any precedent for thinking there'll be any truth in it.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.840
 I was just reading the introduction to a book about Chernobyl

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.840
 that was published in this country just recently and edited by Janet Sherman

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:47.840
 and that book starts off with saying that you'd think that the governments

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.840
 would want to study the actual data of these accidents

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.840
 to improve the safety of nuclear power plants

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.840
 and to understand what happens when things go wrong.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.840
 But this Russian scientist was saying that all this information was suppressed

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.840
 after the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.840
 And it sounds like you're saying that you think the same thing will happen now,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.840
 most likely from...

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.840
 You can't have a nuclear industry

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:24.840
 or a popular nuclear deterrent idea

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:29.840
 if people understand the dangers

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.840
 that are very likely to happen

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:41.840
 from things that are fairly uncontrollable.

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:47.840
 Mining the material and disposing of the material

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:54.840
 are sources of radiation exposure

00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:01.840
 and they are now talking about avoiding the carbon increase in the atmosphere

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.840
 to prevent global warming,

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:13.840
 but they neglect the amount of carbon used in mining and manufacturing.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:21.840
 There's a great petroleum expense in producing the fuel

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:27.840
 and the factories for making the atomic energy.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:34.840
 So it's very polluting in the carbon sense

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:41.840
 as well as the much worse pollution from the mining debris

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.840
 and the waste disposal problems

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.840
 besides the leaks from the installations themselves.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.840
 Yeah, I think one of the reassurances we're always told

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.840
 is that nuclear power doesn't even...

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:02.840
 The emissions from nuclear power doesn't go above the background radiation.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.840
 One of the things that bothers me is that

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.840
 the background radiation is always going up

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.840
 and they're allowed to adjust the standard by which they set that,

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.840
 their emissions to that background radiation

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.840
 and it's going up because of their own emissions.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.840
 So there's a little bit of an escalating loop that's going on

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.840
 whereby everybody around nuclear plants and all of us

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.840
 are getting more radiation as time goes on.

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:36.840
 The type of radiation is crucial in its biological effect.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:42.840
 The industry has the tricks of comparing living in Denver

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.840
 or flying in an airplane

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.840
 with breathing fallout from the nuclear industry

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:59.840
 and it's completely ignoring the well-established fact

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.840
 that the gamma rays that they're counting in Denver

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.840
 or in airplanes have a low energy transfer to the tissues.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.840
 They go through so fast they don't react.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:20.840
 And at lower altitudes, they talk about less radiation exposure

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:27.840
 but actually at sea level, you're getting tertiary and secondary cosmic rays

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:34.840
 which have more energy delivery in a toxic way to your tissues.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:41.840
 So actually Denver has less biologically effective radiation than sea level.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:52.840
 And another trick they use to make it seem like radiation isn't necessarily harmful

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:58.840
 is to show an alpha emitter and a detector

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.840
 and then put a sheet of typing paper in the path

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:09.840
 and showing that it stops the alpha particles from passing through.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:16.840
 But if you inhale an alpha emitter,

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:23.840
 when that particle goes, it's going to hit a cell, not a sheet of typing paper.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:30.840
 And the fact that it will stop in a sheet of paper

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:37.840
 means that it has a 100% delivery of its energy to the tissue

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:43.840
 and it's the delivery of energy that causes the tissue damage.

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:49.840
 Not exclusively, when gamma rays pass through you,

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:56.840
 they give up a little of their energy in a scattering manner.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.840
 So they have a very low linear transfer of energy

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:10.840
 but they still do damage by a partial giving up of their energy.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:16.840
 So the low velocity is what really harms you.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.840
 And so if you inhale a particulate that's radioactive,

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.840
 even though it might not be that much radiation,

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:30.840
 it's the fact that you're just getting all of it in one place that makes it so serious.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:37.840
 Yeah, the beta radiation from iodine and strontium and cesium,

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:45.840
 basically all of it's going to be absorbed when a particle decomposes in your tissues.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:51.840
 It's not as locally intense as alpha particles

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:57.840
 but it's much more effective at tissue delivery

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:02.840
 than x-rays or gamma rays just passing through your body.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.840
 I see. And just for those of us who don't know,

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.840
 could you just quickly summarize what alpha, beta and gamma mean in terms of radiation?

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:19.840
 Alpha particles are actually an atomic nucleus

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:27.840
 and so it's a big fat particle that stops easily when it runs into cell material.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:40.840
 A beta particle is an electron which is much more able to pass through cells without being absorbed

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:46.840
 but it still is a particle of matter or of electricity.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:54.840
 X-rays and gamma rays are photons so they're analogous to light

00:50:54.840 --> 00:51:05.840
 and the certain frequencies will resonate more with the living substance

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:17.840
 so that x-rays have a fairly intense interaction with living material compared to gamma rays

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:24.840
 but still they can be equated, the amount of energy delivered to the tissue,

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:34.840
 linear energy transfer, LAT, is how you compare the different types of radiation.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:38.840
 And so I suppose it's impossible to make this comparison

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.840
 but I'm going to ask you anyway because maybe there is a way.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.840
 If we have fallout from some accident like we're having from Japan,

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:55.840
 how does that compare to going in for medical x-rays or dental x-rays?

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.840
 Is there a comparison to be made?

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:05.840
 Oh, yeah, the thyroid is damaged by all of them

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:18.840
 but if the cloud is very fresh close to the factory, iodine has a half-life of eight days

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:22.840
 so it takes three months to disappear.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:26.840
 So if it's your thyroid you're worried about

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:32.840
 and if the cloud has taken a long time to get to you

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:40.840
 then it could be that the x-ray to your head and neck would be the worst.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.840
 But usually the fact that you breathe in or eat the particles

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:54.840
 is going to mean that the fallout is worse, considerably worse than just having a dental x-ray.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.840
 Now I know there's a scientist named Dr. Christopher Busby

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:07.840
 and he's criticized the safety standards by which the international agencies grade

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.840
 how much radiation a person can take

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.840
 and I think he's basically talking about what you're talking about here

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:20.840
 which is that the standards that they use now take everything,

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:25.840
 all doses of radiation as if it's a whole body dose

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:30.840
 and it doesn't take into account as if it's spread evenly through all your tissues

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.840
 and he's saying that they don't take into account the fact that it's often quite localized

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:42.840
 and therefore causes much greater damage because the energy is all focused on one part of the tissue.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:52.840
 Yeah, the dental x-rays tend to cause cancer of the eyeball, the brain, and the thyroid

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:59.840
 but the estrogenic effect will cause a series of dental x-rays

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:07.840
 to make a pregnant woman deliver and a premature underdeveloped underweight baby

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.840
 just by the systemic estrogen effect

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:16.840
 but it does cancerize the things that are closest to the exposure.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:29.840
 And the government's tendency has been to use whatever measure sounds the least threatening

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:37.840
 such as failing to make the distinction between the local dose and the total body dose

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:46.840
 and they've done the same thing with interpreting the danger of the fallout from the atomic bombs in Japan

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:57.840
 where the bomb smoke went in a sort of a triangular pathway downwind from the explosion.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:03.840
 They drew a circle around the center of the explosion

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:11.840
 and averaged out the people at a certain distance in any direction

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:17.840
 and tended to make the people who were actually exposed to the fallout disappear

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.840
 by averaging them 360 degrees around the circle.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.840
 I see, thereby lowering the incidence of problems.

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.840
 Yeah.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.840
 Well, Ray, I'm sad to say that we're out of time.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:36.840
 Maybe you could just, if you could, maybe it's not possible to summarize quickly

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:42.840
 the things that people could do to mitigate radiation problems.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:50.840
 Yeah, eating seaweed, kelp, and if you have a bottle of iodine,

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:56.840
 you can paint some on your fingers and toes and soak up some of it for your skin.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:03.840
 And all of this shouldn't be done until the cloud is actually here

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:10.840
 because excess iodine is toxic to your thyroid in itself.

00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:14.840
 But if there's an intense cloud passing over,

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:19.840
 then these external sources of iodine will protect your thyroid,

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.840
 but they won't protect the other tissues.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:29.840
 So keeping your thyroid function up is the ideal way to do it.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.840
 I see. And that's done with coconut oil and--

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:38.840
 Yeah, sugar, coconut oil, and when possible, a thyroid supplement.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.840
 Okay.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.840
 Dr. Raymond Peet, thanks so much for being on tonight.

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.840
 Okay, thank you.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.840
 We appreciate it, and we'll talk to you soon, I hope.

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:49.840
 Okay.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.840
 Bye for now.

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.840
 Bye.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.840
 And thanks for listening tonight.

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:58.840
 This has been Politics and Science.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.840
 I'm John Barkhausen, and that was Dr. Raymond Peet,

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:07.840
 and you can find out more about his work at his website, rayPeat.com.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.840
 That's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T dot com.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.840
 A lot of very interesting articles.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.840
 And let me just remind you that the fundraiser,

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:26.840
 although it should be over, is still going forward on slow mode.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.840
 We're at about $8,320, and we've got to get to $9,000.

00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.840
 So we really appreciate all of you who have donated

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.840
 and all of you who are about to donate.

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.840
 We just have a little bit more to go,

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:42.840
 and we'll have our operating expenses for the entire year.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.840
 All donations are tax-deductible.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:46.840
 And how do you do it?

00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:49.840
 Well, you can go to WMRW.org and click on the pig

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.840
 to make a credit card or PayPal donation,

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:59.840
 or you can send your check to WMRW, P.O. Box 95, Warren, Vermont, 05674.

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:04.840
 That's P.O. Box 95, Warren, 05674.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.840
 And this program and the following program

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:09.840
 present the viewpoints of its producers and participants

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.840
 and don't reflect an official opinion of any other person or organization.
