00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Okay, we're in 2011. Happy New Year to you all.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 It's the first show of the year.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville locally where we consult with clients

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 about a wide range of conditions,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 and we recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It's become increasingly obvious over the last few years at least

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 that if you really want to get a point across,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 you cannot just mention it once or twice,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 but that varied topics encompassing the same root subject

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 will result in a coherent view of the matter in question.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And association is, after all, an excellent tool for improving the memory.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 We get a lot of very positive feedback concerning Dr. Ray Peat,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 who's joined us on many of our shows now.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 And again, he's joining us tonight,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 and we'll discuss the role of inflammation in the disease process

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 and reiterate some root causes and ways to avoid generating inflammation generally.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Okay, so good evening, Dr. Peat, and thank you so much for joining us again.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Happy New Year.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Oh, yeah. Hi.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Hi, Dr. Peat. Sorry to interrupt you, Andrew, but...

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Go on.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 We need to say...

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 What are you trying to say?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Basically, there's a disclaimer.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Okay.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 The views and opinions expressed throughout this broadcast

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 are our views and opinions,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 and they do not reflect the station's thoughts and ideas.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Absolutely.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Not necessarily. They might agree, they might not.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Oh, absolutely they might not.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Time will be made for other viewpoints.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Thank you for joining us.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Very good. Okay, so 2011 kicks off with a good old disclaimer.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Okay, so to get back to Dr. Peat,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 thanks so much for joining us.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 As always, for folks who've not listened to our show before,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 let alone perhaps heard you on the shows,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 would you perhaps just go over your academic and professional career?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 I was a student and teacher in the humanities

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 for about 10 or 15 years

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 before I studied in graduate school a biology,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 basically nerve biology and reproductive biology.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And I've taught a few courses in biochemistry and immunology

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 and other things.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Okay.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I know you've extensively written papers,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 fully referenced papers on many different topics.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 And I know that a lot of the programs that you've joined us on

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 have really been a broad range of separate subjects,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 but interrelated in many different ways.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And I know the topic for tonight's discussion

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 is the role of inflammation on the human body.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 What inflammation does, how is it generated,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 how can you do something about it?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 But perhaps people that are listening,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 would you just briefly discuss what you think we all understand

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 when we hear the word inflammation?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 And then we'll go over the broad view of inflammation in a newer thinking.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 The thinking is actually fairly old,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 but it's been brought up by contemporary doctors.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 So what do you think people first understand when they hear inflammation?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 How do we understand it?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 About 50 years ago or so, when I was in school,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 they were teaching that inflammation is part of the curative healing process.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 So we needed to kill germs and heal.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 But in the last 10 or 20 years,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 the change has been seeing it occurring in all of the degenerative diseases,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, heart disease, arthritis, and so on.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Okay.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 So it's pretty abrupt in the 20th century

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 that there was this sudden change to seeing inflammation

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 as at least not all good, maybe all bad.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Okay. Do you know that from...

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 I was reading a little bit about Plato and Aristotelian views of medicine,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 and I know from an inflammatory point of view,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 they definitely had a different metaphor for understanding it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Given that the doctor, Ilya Metchnikov,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 and later on, Raymer, was it?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Gosh, you can describe the doctor, Jamie.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 That's it, yeah.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 With the view of inflammation that both Ilya Metchnikov

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 and the later doctor have brought around,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 would you describe the difference between it

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and how fundamentally it makes such a big difference

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 to the way we should understand what it is that causes it

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 and how to help ourselves?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Metchnikov had worked primarily as an embryologist,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 understanding the organization of developing primitive organisms

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 and more complex.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And when he saw the phagocyte process,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 when he put a splinter in an organism

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 and saw cells gathering around it,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 he interpreted that in the context of what he knew best,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 which was how the organisms create and maintain their body structure.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And it was partly the fact that the Nobel Prize went simultaneously to him

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 with that very biological view of immunity

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 and to Ehrlich, who was working with chemical poisons.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 And the idea of immunity as killing bad organisms

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 took over throughout the United States

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 and most of the world for most of the 20th century.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 And that, as Americans started studying the white blood cells

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 and the thymus gland and things that we think of as part of the immune system,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 they were influenced by the drug industry, Ehrlich's,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 looking for the bullets to kill the evil organisms.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 That passed over to thinking about antibodies and cells

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 as aimed primarily at organisms that are trying to take over.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 It reminds me of how you've described the progression of hepatitis C being--

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 well, we're told that it's this nasty bug,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 but maybe it's just the body's trying to rearrange something

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 and there's an inflammation and a process that's going on that is from damage.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Yeah, the retroviruses in general, we've got lots of them,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 and they seem to be as much part of us as anything,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 and they don't do anything that for sure is harmful.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 And if you mess up an organ like poison the liver,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 you get a bunch of these retroviruses, which they're--

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 why they call them retro is that normally DNA makes RNA and RNA makes protein,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 but there are enzymes which will turn RNA into DNA,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 and that was first observed in 1979,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 but at that time, Trochan and Lamarck, they had been totally weeded out.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 In the late 1940s with the Cold War, all of Lamarck's followers

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 were fired from all of the teaching positions in the U.S.,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 and so in 1979 when the idea that information could go from RNA to DNA was demonstrated,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 my professors unanimously said it's impossible.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Lamarckian and not permitted.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Just to let people listening understand, the-- excuse me.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 DNA is a thing in our cells that codes for the manufacture of proteins

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 and many, many things that are necessary.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 RNA is the messenger, the transcription factor for producing the DNAs.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 If the retroviruses then can actually manufacture DNA,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 that DNA then can get into our mitochondria

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 and/or affect a change in its own right because it's DNA.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 And some of the people inclined in the direction of Lamarck,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Barbara McClintock and Lee Senko,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 they had proposed that you can get genetic change.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Eventually Barbara McClintock got the Nobel Prize for it,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 but about 40 years too late,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 demonstrating that they believed that information can flow from the environment into the DNA,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 and some of these people were actually saying that there should be enzymes

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 such as are seen in retroviruses,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 enzymes that can create new DNA in response to environmental experience.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Well, that reminds me about that test.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 I think you said it was in Egypt, Dr. Peat?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 There was-- in many countries there was a schistosomiasis epidemic.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 It was pretty chronic, and a very high percentage of Egyptians had it,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 and they were treated for that with some chemicals that injured their liver.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 And now they say that it was caused by spreading a virus,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 but other experiments suggest that just the chemical treatment

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 that was aimed at killing this parasite could have been enough to cause the livers to express retroviruses,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 one of which is now called hepatitis C.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 So it's looking at the disease as a damaged particle rather than an infectious organism.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Yeah.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 I think this is what Peter Guzburg is suggesting

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 when he says that the retrovirus of HIV, for example, isn't known to be a cause of immunodeficiency,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 that he suggests that it's the result of chemical poisoning.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And I remember reading about five years ago an article from Dr. Stefan Lanka

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 who was also putting down the HIV hypothesis for-- or the viral hypothesis for HIV.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Okay, so back to inflammation.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 In terms of the inflammatory process then,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 and how we-- or I understood it from school and from university studying physiology,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 how does the newer view or the older view, explained in a newer way, describe inflammation,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 and how does it differ?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Well, if you look at the injury of the fetus, it heals without inflammation,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 and it doesn't produce a scar, and basically it's perfect healing.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 At a very early stage, you can split the embryo, and each part of the embryo will grow into a complete animal.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 But later in development, you can cut or otherwise injure a part of the fetus,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 and it simply zips itself shut, makes new cells, and doesn't leave a scar or inflammation.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 And it's after being born that inflammation as we know it occurs.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 We need to all crawl back into our mother's womb.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Yeah, and there are two things that happen when we're born.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 One is our carbon dioxide exposure goes way down, and the oxygen availability increases greatly.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 So a shift away from carbon dioxide, which is anti-inflammatory.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 And at the same time, when we're no longer protected by the uterus and placenta, which act as a filter,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 and they let very little polyunsaturated fat in so that practically all newborns are considered deficient in the essential fatty acids, so-called.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 But these begin building up during childhood from practically any diet that we're exposed to,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 and that combined with the reduced availability of carbon dioxide,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 you can account for basically all of the features of inflammation and degeneration

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 that are distinct from the prenatal healing process.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 We still have some of the features of prenatal healing, and they can be recovered to some extent.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 For example, if you pack a wound with sugar, it practically heals without a scar,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 and that's partly because it's not exactly approaching prenatal conditions,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 but it's giving an extremely generous supply of sugar, which can be used to make carbon dioxide.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 This is behind the Greeks using honey in deep wounds.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And the sugar makes it unnecessary for the cells to metabolize any of the fatty acids,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 so that even if the organism has been eating them and integrating them into the tissue's presence of sugar,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 it makes it possible to energize and repair cells without drawing down more of these unsaturated fats,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 which produce all of the features that we know of as inflammation as distinct from healing.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Just to summarize for some of our listeners, in case you haven't heard of polyunsaturated fat,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 these are liquid vegetable oils that are present in almost everybody's diet,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 and you can avoid them to some extent by avoiding any liquid vegetable oil apart from olive oil,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 and eating coconut oil and butter in place.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Okay. For those listeners who've just joined, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED, Garboville, 91.1 FM,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of inflammation.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Okay. So, those two things then, the decrease in carbon dioxide and the increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 if people started to increase their carbon dioxide content,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 I know we've mentioned in the past bag breathing as a very simple way to do that,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 and/or living at elevation, if that's possible.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 But a higher elevation.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 A higher elevation.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And cutting out polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 What else could be done in a person to lessen their chance of the inflammation that might otherwise be generated?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Another of the very basic things promoting inflammation rather than healing is the endotoxin from bacteria

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 that can be absorbed into the bloodstream.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Okay.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 And if your liver is well-nourished and well-energized, it can cut out practically 100% of the endotoxin.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 But if the intestine is stressed in any way, which can be nervous stress,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 increasing the adrenaline that cuts down the blood supply,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 the reduced blood supply does things like release histamine and serotonin,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 which make the intestine more permeable, letting more of the endotoxin get into the bloodstream.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 And the endotoxin does the same thing throughout the body.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 It increases the permeability, lowers the energy, and increases the inefficiency that shows up as inflammation

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 in its various things such as swelling, turning red, local heating because of the high blood supply.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Okay.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 So basically stress is a big killer along with other things that promote inflammation.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 I know for our listeners, I've just been thinking while Dr. Peat's been talking about stress,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 that there's lots of herbs that can help to de-stress you.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 I know thyroid is also something that can help your body work better and not run on so much adrenaline and stress hormones.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 And a lot of people who get extremely stressed are often running on adrenaline to keep their metabolism up

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 rather than running on an adequate amount of thyroid.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 So, Dr. Peat, do you have anything else to add to how we can help minimize stress?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Keeping the intestine as clean as possible, moving stuff along,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 raw carrots or bamboo shoots happen to be antiseptic vegetable material that doesn't feed the bacteria

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 and tends to suppress the bacterial growth so that it doesn't come too far up the intestine.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 And they also bind the endotoxin and other chemicals that should be eliminated.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 If the intestine is sluggish, what the liver has excreted into the bile trying to get rid of

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 will be reabsorbed farther down the intestine and come back to poison the liver.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 And if you keep a stream of good, clean material moving through,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 you can lower the toxins that should be excreted.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And that would include unwanted hormones including estrogen,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 which the liver should be able to 100% eliminate as they reach the liver.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 And it will reduce the endotoxin and shift the serotonin and histamine

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 such that it will also lower the cortisol production.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And that total pattern will increase the good hormones, progesterone and testosterone, for example.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 And for those who might like a nice recipe,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Dr. Peat suggested that if you add apple cider vinegar or lemon or lime juice

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 to raw grated carrots with some salt and coconut oil or olive oil,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 that it's even more antimicrobial, antiviral, antibacterial,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 as well as antifungal with the apple cider vinegar.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about using anti-inflammatories

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 as another means to lower inflammation in addition to what we've talked about briefly for foods and avoiding foods?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Some of them are very helpful.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 I mentioned that cleaning the intestine will lower the production of cortisol

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 and raise the pregnenolone, testosterone and progesterone.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 These are natural, most powerful anti-inflammatory things to stabilize.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 The fetus is exposed to an extremely high concentration of progesterone until it's born.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 And so keeping our production of progesterone as high as possible

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 can make a big difference in susceptibility to inflammation and degeneration.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 But aspirin and related things, a lot of fruit chemicals are similar to aspirin and have a protective effect.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 What particular fruit chemicals?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 I'm specifically thinking of neringen and neringen in oranges.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Okay. Is that in grapefruits as well?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 There's another one in grapefruit that happens to poison an enzyme system in the liver,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 letting estrogen accumulate tremendously.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And this is such a well-known medical fact that in Fortuna Maternity Ward,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 they say we no longer serve grapefruit juice to our pregnant mothers because it interferes with the hormones.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 They didn't specify that it blocked the P450 enzyme that helps the liver excrete excessively high

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 or all of the excess estrogen.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Okay, so neringen. And then is there anything else that you think of?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 No.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Okay. Do you know, have you heard or have they done in the past?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 I can't imagine they haven't.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 But animal experiments, modeling after keeping the CO2 concentration high,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 keeping all the inflammatory products that would normally be associated with an animal's diet

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 or their environment out and measuring different things to see how they performed or how long they lived.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 Oh, yeah. About 70 years ago, people were noticing that food restriction could increase lifespan 30 or 40 percent.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 Then it has gone through phases in which they saw that this could happen in even adult animals

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 could live longer and healthier by reducing the food intake.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 But then they started trying different specific foods.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 And it happens that the foods which are eliminated are those which produce inflammation in various ways.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 For example, the polyunsaturated fats and the amino acids that contribute to inflammation,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 such as tryptophan and methionine. Just eliminating one of these will increase longevity about 30 or 40 percent in animal studies.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Okay.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Wow, that's a lot, 30 to 40 percent.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 So these Indians that live to 120 years of age, live in the Himalayas.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 I mean, the Andes, sorry, excuse me. Are they just not eating any polyunsaturated oils?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Do you know anything about that?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 At high altitudes, all of these long-lived cultures in South America and the Caucasus and Nepal,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 they all lived at fairly high altitudes and were surrounded by glaciers in most of the cases

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 so that they were drinking water that was fairly recently high-altitude snow,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 which happens to be isotopically different from sea-level water.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 It's been refined by a repeated distillation as it rains out going to higher and higher altitudes.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 It becomes metabolically stimulating light water, where average water contains some of the metabolic-flowing heavy water.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 But at the same time, the atmosphere at high altitudes is very low in oxygen,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 and so people retain more carbon dioxide in their tissues.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 That's another resemblance of the prenatal condition.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 And generally, they are sheep farmers.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Sheep can live at relatively high altitudes,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 and so they tend to either eat vegetables, fruits, or cheese, lots of cheese and milk-related dishes.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 That's very interesting.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 The thing about the rainwater, that's pretty interesting.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 I know from an alchemical perspective, the first prerequisite is to distill water seven times to be used in experiments,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 because the alchemists always believe that each successive distillation raises the energy of the water.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 I've read an article about storm water, water that was only collected during electrical storms.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 I did read an article about water, because many, many years ago,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 I never thought there was any difference between regular water, tap water, or whatever.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 It was all water to me. It was all H2O.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 But it's actually very different, and a lot of papers have been written on the subject of water

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 and how different energetically they are and what difference they make in the body

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 and how available the water is to the body and to the cell.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 In the 1930s, when they first made isotopically heavy water with deuterium replacing hydrogen,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 they found that it slowed biological processes, the daily rhythm, nerve conduction.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 In 1950, they showed in mouse experiments that it tremendously accelerated the aging process,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 all of the features of aging, slowing metabolism, and dying prematurely were produced.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 But it took about 50 years after that before people started experimenting with the light water

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 from which the heavy water had been removed.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And they found that, for example, they were experimenting with it in Russian space vehicles,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 and they found that the condensed sweat had been filtered,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 and it was a very light water resembling glacier water.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 So what water do you recommend people drink, Dr. Peat? Do you have one?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 No. You have to go to a senior at Glacier.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Okay, so you have to go 15,000 feet in, right?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 This is probably why they bottled glacial water, right?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Yeah, if it really is that.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 It happens that some plants will absorb the water at high altitudes and concentrate it even more.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Sugar beets, for example, intrinsically eliminate deuterons,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 and so they have light hydrogen incorporated into their tissues.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 If they grow in Colorado at a high altitude where they're getting already refined water,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 then the beet sugar contains the equivalent of glacier water.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Wow. Cool.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 I wonder what kind of altitude beet stops growing at, though, because I don't know.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 It's not that cold-hardy, is it?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Yeah, they're fairly cold-hardy, but I don't know the altitude limit.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Okay, well, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 From now until the end of the show, you're invited to call in with any questions

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of inflammation,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 and our guest speaker is Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Okay, so until people start calling.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 The cell communication thing is quite interesting to me in terms of, I think, when people--

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 when we were taught physiology, we were taught about phagocytic activity, engulfing cells,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 and cell-drinking activities, and I understand that these descriptions are not that accurate.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 The language with which it's been described is pretty erroneous, if you like, to use a better word.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 What do you think about, in the context of what you understand, cell communication,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 cell-to-cell communication?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 I think it works on many different levels, but I think the important one has been sketched out

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 by starting with people like Albert St. Georgi, who demonstrated that cells, muscle systems,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 and secretory systems and such are tuned electronically to the properties of the molecule that are--

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 they talk about them as quantum chemical features,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 but it's just the way the electrons resonate in the particular molecules,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 and that's because the whole cell is tuned to resonate to certain substances.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 There's a recent lecture by--I think his name is Luca Turin,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 a Google lecture on pharmacology,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 but it is showing the current vitality of that idea of Albert St. Georgi,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 another person, May Wan Ho, has a website talking about the coherence of an organism,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 and her website has a picture of a worm made through a polarizing microscope

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 showing that there is coherence on the atomic level all the way through the little worm.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 I think that kind of coherence, electronic or chemical and electrical interaction,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 is at the basis of such things as cell recognition.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 There are the lock and key processes, enzyme, substrate, and antibody, antigen recognition,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 but the important things for communicating between cells, I think, are a whole step beyond the lock and key.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 Okay, before we go any further with that, I know there's a couple of callers on the line.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 At least there's one on the line for sure.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 Paula, you're on the air?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Hi.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Hi, good evening.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 I have two questions.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 One is if you and Sarah could give a phone number to contact you.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 And my other question is for Dr. Peat.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 I've been doing the carrot thing, and this is very interesting to me.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 I'm just fascinated with it.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 But I have an unrelated question, and that is I've been getting off of Prozac that I took for many years,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 and I'm having all of what they call discontinuation syndrome, which I would call drug withdrawal,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 but, you know, like agitation and sweating and so on.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 And I was wondering, are there herbs that one can take to help alleviate that discomfort while it's going on?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Yes, yes, there are herbs that you can take to help alleviate the discomfort of withdrawing from Prozac.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 I was doing it partly because I'm worried about the influence of the serotonin uptake inhibitors on my bone structure.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Right.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 I remember you called before and Dr. Peat had said --

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Right, right.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 So I'm well into it, and I'm surviving, but I was wondering --

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Well done.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Dr. Peat, do you have any recommendations?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Yeah, the good effect of those serotonin uptake inhibitors, I think it's really other things, not at all serotonin.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 I think it's in spite of the serotonin.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 And if you look at the history of serotonin, you see that in the 1950s,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 it was discovered to be what makes the carcinoid syndrome or the carcinoid tumor so bad.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 And the tumor itself, instead of turning almost all of our dietary tryptophan into niacin,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 these tumors turn the bulk of it, more than half of it, into serotonin.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 And so they flood us.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 They're worse than Prozac.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 And the features well-defined for this massive overdosing of serotonin

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 are a good insight into what's going on with the drug industry.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 The people flushed, became depressed, anxious, and aggressive under the influence of serotonin.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 They developed arthritic pains, a whole range of inflammatory degenerative symptoms.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 The skin would eventually thicken.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Heart valves would become fibrotic.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 And these are things that are now being seen associated with the uptake inhibitors,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 osteoporosis, heart disease, breast cancer, obesity.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 And here serotonin is the supposed good guy,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 and it's just another mediator of inflammatory responses.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Well, I don't think it's that good because getting off of it is really awful.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 It must have been doing something else besides making me feel a little better.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 There are good ways to get off.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 I think pregnenolone, thyroid, and coffee are very helpful.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Coffee?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Yeah, you have to adjust to the coffee,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 but it goes with thyroid, sugar, progesterone, and so on as part of an anti-inflammatory system.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 When we were talking about the anti-inflammatory substances,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 I should have mentioned caffeine as one of them.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 And also, too, with caffeine, if you're already running on a lot of adrenaline

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 and you get very low blood sugar, if you drink caffeine, that can worsen the symptoms.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 But if you restock your liver's glycogen stores through eating sugars

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 that are lower glycemic index, but more importantly, non-starchy sugars,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 then your body will not respond to the adrenaline like it would if you were very low blood sugar.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 So that's a process of adapting.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 Great. Now, could you give me a contact number for you and Andrew?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Yes. Are you within the 707 area?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 Yes, I am. I'm in Laytonville, so I'm not that far away.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 Okay. So it's 986-9506 and extension 2 to ask questions, extension 3 to set up a consultation.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 Oh, okay. And you're in Garberville, right?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 Yes. Our clinic is located in Garberville.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Okay. I just couldn't find you in the phone book, so I thought this month I'm going to get your phone number.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Thank you so much, and thank you, Dr. Peat. I'm reading things on your website.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 It's so informative. Thank you.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Thank you. Okay. I think, is there another caller?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 Well, someone had a question about Arnica, how it works, and how to use it.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 Okay.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 So Arnica is a very anti-inflammatory flower, and you really need to have an oil made from Arnica.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 You'd want to make a macerated oil, and this is how we make it.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 And then we don't actually sell it to stores for retail like we do our herbal tinctures.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 Does it grow around here?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 No.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 No, it grows at high elevations. I mean, I imagine it grows--

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 European Alps is--

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Well, and also in Montana.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Yeah.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 It's Arnica Montana is the Latin name.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 But it doesn't grow around here.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 I don't know if you could get it to grow around here because it is such a high elevation plant.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Yeah. I think the strict sense of the word Montana is mountain.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Well--

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 [Laughter]

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 I thought it did grow in the U.S.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Well, no, maybe up in Montana there's lots of mountains up there, so it's definitely not--

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 I thought it did grow in the mountainous United States.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Anyways, we can check on that and see if I'm right or wrong here on the Montana.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 But you want to make a heat maceration in order to extract the anti-inflammatory compounds,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 and you don't want to take it internally.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 I definitely don't recommend you take it internally,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 but it can really help to alleviate bruises and tendon sprains and tears

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 just by rubbing the oil on the affected area immediately after the injury.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 It works really, really well.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 I've seen lots of evidence for it myself.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 It's one of those-- How does it do that?

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 How does it stop the inflammation?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 Maybe Dr. Peat understands the physiological effects of Arnica. I don't know.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 No.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Okay. All right.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Okay, so that's that one. There's no more questions. Okay, so--

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you about the cells' communication from one cell to another.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 You were talking how they can communicate to each other,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 and I think there is also a study that you mentioned to me about cells communicating even through, like, a piece of plastic.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Yeah, that was-- The Gerbichs in the 1920s and '30s were demonstrating that.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 If you used quartz that passes certain frequencies of ultraviolet,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 they demonstrated that cells could stimulate cell division across the thin sheet of quartz,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 and that is being taken up again in the last 10 years, more people demonstrating coherence.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 There are variations on that.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 One person is arguing and demonstrating that cells sense and respond to infrared frequencies,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 but most of the work is in the ultraviolet frequency of communication.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 Okay. Excuse me.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 You mentioned May Wan Ho and then the other person was Albert St. George.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Could you spell his name, please?

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 St. George, S-Z-E-N-T hyphen G-Y-O-R-G-Y-I.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Okay, St. George. Okay, good.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Okay, so the main thing in our bodies is that everything communicates properly.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 It's when things don't communicate properly that the problems occur.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 So in terms of-- I know you've mentioned before from an energetic point of view,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 the use of thyroid hormone or improving your diet to improve your own hormone thyroid function,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 that communication is benefited by a higher energy, and that's the function of thyroid.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Yes, the carbon dioxide is one of the sort of a hormone of metabolism.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 It acts like a universal hormone, keeping everything in the optimal condition.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 For example, it holds histamine and serotonin in a bound position, holds calcium in a bound position.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 So if you just hyperventilate and lower your CO2 within a minute, your platelets, for example,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 which carry most of the serotonin in your blood in a harmless state,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 just a minute of hyperventilation will cause the platelets to release the serotonin

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 and immediately cause capillaries to become permeable, leaking fluid out into your lungs.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 So you can create pulmonary edema with a minute of hyperventilation

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 just because you've messed up the carbon dioxide concentration.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 Okay. Wow. Okay, pretty dangerous, huh?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 Okay, back to retroviruses a little bit.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Because this, again, is something that I've not been familiar with at all.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 I think the way that we're indoctrinated with the way things are supposed to be is that

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 all these little things are viruses, they exist, and they're all different,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 and they all cause different problems.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 Are you saying that ultimately we coexist with a wide range of retroviruses,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 none of which normally give us any problem until some other insult?

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 Yeah, I think Duisburg said we all contain hundreds of them.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 And we do--when there's an injury to the tissue, we do form antibodies,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 and some people will say that's evidence that they're an alien thing.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 But many years ago, someone did an experiment, I think it was rabbit cartilage.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 They removed a piece of cartilage,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 and they would replace the untampered with cartilage in one group of rabbits,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 and it would just--it didn't produce any reaction.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 But if they twisted the cartilage just enough to damage the structure,

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 just as you would if you fell and twisted your knee or something,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 when they put that one back in the same rabbit,

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 it produced--the rabbit produced antibodies to it like it was an alien thing.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 But what that means about antibodies in the case of our antibodies to retroviruses

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 or whatever is that they're a part of a cleanup process.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 Something is disturbed, the antibodies are part of preparing the situation

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 for our phagocytes to go in and remove the damaged material.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 Okay.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 So we're looking at the immune system instead of this killer attack system

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 that just kills and attacks all these different bugs.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 Perhaps it's just a rearranging--a house cleaner just goes in there,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 and it just cleans and mops up this little bit of damage here

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 from the milk that's spilt on the floor.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 Just fairly recently, someone showed that in a traumatic brain injury,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 the presence of antibodies to the injured tissue corresponds to the healing.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 The absence of the antibodies lets the tissue deteriorate,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 so it's pretty well established that it's a cleanup process.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 And in the thyroid, people think about autoimmune antibodies as causing the problem,

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 but just an excess of thyroid-stimulating hormone because something is blocking the function,

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 the pituitary increases its drive against the thyroid gland,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 and that overstimulation causes something like inflammation,

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 and the body is cleaning up the damaged or stressed thyroid cells when it produces antibodies.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 And so if you keep the thyroid-stimulating hormone low enough,

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 the cleanup will proceed and the antibodies will disappear.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 Wow. It's very different to current thinking and what we're all told is the way it is

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 so that I guess drug companies can sell their drugs.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 It's probably--I don't mean to be cynical, but there's probably some truth in it for sure.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 Okay, for those of you who are listening,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMU Decalvo, 91.1 FM.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 And from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, the next, oh, at least seven minutes,

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 people are invited to call and have any questions.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 We do have Dr. Raymond Peat here.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 He's a very well-published scientist and researcher, and we're very pleased to have him on the show.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 We've been talking about inflammation and the role of inflammation

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 and all the things that can cause inflammation and how to help yourself.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 Getting back to--in case we get any--we don't get any calls.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 So look out. We have a caller, I think.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 Are you on the air? Hello?

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Hi.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 Hi. You're on the air.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 Thanks. I'm sorry. I tuned in about midway through.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 I'm not sure if you've covered this, but I'm interested in your thoughts on eczema

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 and relationship to leaky gut and digestive stuff.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat, what's your view on eczema?

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 Say it again. I didn't hear.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 The lady was asking about eczema in relation to leaky gut and/or--

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 Well, the celiac disease is one of the causes of both skin disease and arthritis.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 The celiac disease, among other things, will allow endotoxin into your circulation.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 Right.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 And low thyroid is probably the most common thing associated with just ordinary eczema.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 And that's because when your thyroid is low, the circulation to your intestine is poor,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 the serotonin is high, and this combination of endotoxin and serotonin, for example,

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 cause the skin to have abnormal growth patterns.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 Would psoriasis then be in the same category?

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 I think so.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 That's so interesting.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 And that's why when people who have eczema and psoriasis take liver herbs like dandelion and burdock,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 that they notice an improvement.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 It's generally not enough to cure them, but they do notice an improvement.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 The curative effect has to be more of a combination of looking at the whole system like the thyroid and the diet

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 and how that influences an overall inflammation.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 But working on the digestive tract definitely makes a big difference with eczema and psoriasis.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 Thank you.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 And can I ask one more question in relationship to the celiac disease?

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 Sure.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 Do you think the tests that test you for gluten allergies are good?

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 Accurate?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Yeah, accurate.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that question?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 Well, they can very clearly demonstrate the enzymes involved in it,

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 but I think gluten is toxic in itself to anyone.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 It's just that some people are more resistant to it.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 It has an overlap with the transglutaminase enzyme, which is -- there's a lot of it in the skin and in the intestine,

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 and it happens to be an enzyme that's activated by estrogen.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 And I think that's why women have more of a problem with it,

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 but it isn't that it's some particular disease.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 It's that gluten is just absolutely not intended as a food.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 The seeds create the protein and gluten as a storage form,

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 but also as a byproduct it discourages animals from eating it

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 because it contains these amino acids that contribute to inflammation.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 So the seed intends it to cause inflammation in your intestine,

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 and a very tough person can withstand it for a long time,

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 but it's not a good idea for anyone to eat it.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 And traditionally, Europeans ate bread, but it was always soured,

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 and the actual souring process does change the gluten into a less allergenic form,

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 although some people still react adversely to it.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 And soaking it for 12 hours or so increases the protein value tremendously

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 while destroying the gluten.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 So soaking your grains before making the bread

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 and then also souring them for 12 hours.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 You know, bread now, sourdough bread is risen in 3 or 4 hours.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 If that, maybe even 1 or 2.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 I asked a baker and he said 20 minutes.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 Wow.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 And that's not enough time for the cultures in the starter

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 to actually break down the gluten and change it into a much less allergenic form.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 So traditionally, we never ate bread products like we do today.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 And in fact, a lot of the European cake recipes don't even call for flour

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 because flour was a highly prized possession to have in Europe,

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 and most of the cakes and desserts were made with eggs and milk and sugar and not flour.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 And now, the rules have switched, but I know we're running out of time now.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 I mean, sorry, values have switched, and flour is cheap, and butter and eggs are expensive.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 Well, we are coming to the end of the show now.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 We've only got a couple of minutes left,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 and I don't want to rush the information that we'd like you to know about Dr. Peat's website.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 So thank you so much again for joining us, Dr. Peat, and sharing all of your knowledge with us.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 Okay.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 For all of those people that have listened, Dr. Raymond Peat's got a very good website

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 with a pretty extensive list of referenced material on many different subjects,

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 from thyroid to progesterone and other related hormones to the fish oil experiments and many, many other things.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 So do take a look. His website is www.raypeat.com.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 And that's the R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 And guess what? He's not selling anything.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 Okay, very good information, well-researched.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 Yeah, can't say enough good things about him.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 And I've seen a lot of very positive situations turn around using his advice.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 So thank you very much.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 And we did have one last caller who wanted to caution people that I assume from her own experience

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 that soaking the wheat does not take care of her allergy issues.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 Okay.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 Be warned.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 No, definitely a lot of people still have difficulty eating grain products,

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 not just wheat and gluten-containing grains, but a lot of different grain products, even with soaking.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 Probably the main reason is because of the effects they have on the intestines.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 Maybe we can cover that in the next show.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 But we can be reached, Andrew and myself, Sarah, can be reached, like I gave my number out before,

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 707-986-9506 or toll-free 888-926-4372.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 And the acronym for that is WBM Herb, Western Botanical Medicine, WBM Herb, H-E-R-B.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 For further consultations or more information.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 Thank you.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 And thank you and good night.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 Now, happy New Year to you.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 It's 2011.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 Hopefully it's going to go on for a bit longer.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 Well, we could talk about that later, too.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Okay.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 Have a good night.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
