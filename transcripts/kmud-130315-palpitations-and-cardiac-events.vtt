00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 My name's Sarah Johanneson-Murray.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 For those perhaps who've never listened to our shows, they're run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who qualified in England with a degree in herbal medicine

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 and produce our own certified organic herb extracts here in the USA, in California.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 And we have a practice here in Garbovore where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Once again, we're very pleased to introduce Dr. Eamon Peat to the show. He's going to share his wisdom with us.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 This week, or rather this month, the day's topic is the subject of palpitations,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 but it also interweaves many current subjects related to palpitations,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 which are things like the hormones, progesterone especially,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 and also other factors associated with blood clots, myocardial infarcts, and other cardiac events that are pathologically bad for us.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Anyway, to cut a long story short, let's welcome Dr. Peat to the show. Thank you for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Okay, so what I think we wanted to bring out this evening was the subject of palpitations,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 and I know that there's many other factors involved in palpitations, but we're going to probably home in on a couple in detail.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Does Dr. Peat want to give our listeners a detailed description of his background?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Yeah, I forgot to ask you, didn't I? My fault.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Oh, not very detailed, but I studied physiology at the University of Oregon.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 I was there for several years, 1968 to '72, and the circulatory system wasn't my main interest,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 but I ran across interesting work done in the 1940s by one of my science heroes, Albert St. Georgie,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 who happened to be studying the effects of estrogen and progesterone on the heart of animals and blood vessels.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And his work exactly matched what I was doing in animal aging and the effects of those same hormones.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 So I was interested in the circulatory system as it relates to the endocrine system especially.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Right, I know your main interests are anti-aging and hormones surrounding stress and aging.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 I think a lot of what we thought we knew from mainstream medical education and regurgitated popular news, the media,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 it seems pretty erroneous in the light of published, albeit rarely included, research that's available.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 I'm specifically referring to the ongoing hormone debate, and we'll get into HRT as a subject perhaps a little later.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 But for now, with a common thread throughout tonight's topic of palpitations and the cardiovascular effects,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 together with the papers that are published showing the dangerous effects of estrogen

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 and the beneficial effects of progesterone and testosterone as well as thyroid hormone,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 what are we to understand of the misleading advertising surrounding estrogen's supposedly positive effects?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 It's the standard thing that gets into the news or the science journals or the universities.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 It's strongly influenced by the giant corporate interests, and estrogen happens to be a very profitable thing,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 multi-billions of dollars per year, so they can control the public perception of the hormones in their interest.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Part of the idea of selling estrogen as a beneficial thing was that women live longer than men,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 and since they were selling estrogen as the female hormone,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 they said that it must be estrogen that accounts for why women live longer

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 and have lower incidence of heart disease before menopause.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 So at one point, they actually did a trial of giving estrogen to men,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 and when they started having more heart attacks, they stopped the experiment,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 but that didn't kill the idea that estrogen is heart protective.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 So for 50 years, they carried on promoting the idea of giving estrogen to women to protect their heart

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 and the Women's Health Initiative results came out with women having more heart attacks on the estrogen trial.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 So why did they start with estrogen? Why didn't they start with progesterone?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Because there's only one product, one substance that really has the effects of progesterone,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 and just about anything that is interfering with the use of oxygen has estrogenic effects.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Several extracts of soot were demonstrated to be estrogenic.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are very estrogenic.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Even cyanide has some estrogenic effects, or putting a plastic bag over an animal's head,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 or irradiating any part of the animal with x-rays or gamma rays is estrogenic.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 So the concept of estrogen is something very easily brought to market in a product

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 where progesterone is one single molecule that can't be imitated exactly with any alteration.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 And what about the price difference to manufacture estrogen versus to manufacture progesterone?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Yeah, the fact that soot extracts are estrogenic means that you can produce it for less than one cent per dose

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 if you want to, where progesterone has to be exactly duplicated.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 For years, they were extracting it from the corpus luteum of sow ovaries,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 and it took tons of ovaries to produce a few grams of progesterone.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 So they found how to manufacture it from plant steroids that were closely similar in structure.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Like wild yam and trillium and other herbal products.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Yeah, with a few chemical alterations, they could become exact copies of the progesterone molecule.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 But since no one could patent that one substance,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 they introduced small changes, making it no longer progesterone.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 But they said it was close enough to progesterone that it would be better than progesterone

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 because they had a patent on it and could advertise it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And they devised tests that had something in common with the real progesterone molecule,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 a certain change in cells of the uterus.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 But that let them call it a progestin or progestogen because it had something in common with progesterone.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 But they implied that it supported gestation.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 But in fact, these were the chemicals that were the basis for the birth control pill

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 because they prevented gestation.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 So really, they should be called anti-progestins.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 So there's so many different things that can patent and manufacture a drug from soot,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 which is just black soot from a fireplace, I guess, right?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Yeah.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And all those other things you mentioned, whereas progesterone takes a lot of ovaries

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 and a lot of plant material to produce it, so it's much more expensive.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 And also then the effects in the body, then estrogen has --

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 I wouldn't say -- you didn't say it has a wider range of effects than progesterone, but that it's --

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Well, it does.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 It affects every system, but in pretty much exactly the opposite way that estrogen does.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Any tissue that's injured will begin producing its own estrogen.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 So the idea that a woman is estrogen deficient at menopause is just a complete fabrication.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Someone was measuring the estrogen manufactured in a monkey's ovary

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 and to measure the change from the blood going into the blood coming out of the ovary as a control,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 and they measured the blood going into the arm and the blood coming out of the arm of the same monkey

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 and found that the monkey's arm was producing more estrogen than the ovary.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 And since women at menopause still have their arms and legs,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 there's no way that they're going to have a decrease in the basic estrogen.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 So there's another medical myth that we've been told.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 In the menopause, you're suffering from lack of estrogen when, in fact, you're suffering from a lack of progesterone.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Yeah, that has been demonstrated and published, but in books rather than journals.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 The journals are so controlled by the industry that you get real science in a lot of books

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 that never gets into the medical indexes or journals.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Or at medical school, people are not taught what the research is showing.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Yeah, the medical schools teach what the medical journals publish,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 and that's always at least a generation behind the science journals.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Like 50 years. It takes 50 years once they prove something, right?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 50 years for it to come into practice?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 Yeah, I compared the biological abstracts publications or the chemical abstracts on topics related to medicine to the Index Medicus,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 which was the print forerunner of PubMed,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 and found that typically even the most important things took 20 years before they were mentioned in Index Medicus

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 after they were already in a generally accepted scientific existence.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 The first mention in the medical literature was generally that it was not a valid medical concept,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 and like vitamin E, medical journals for several decades were saying it was a very dangerous substance and shouldn't be taken.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 It's a good job it comes around, albeit slowly.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 I wanted to ask you, getting to the subject of palpitations,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 I know that quite a few people that we've come into contact with in practice have mentioned palpitations as being a feature of their physiology,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 if you like, and they complain of it.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 It may not be the major thing that they come in to consult for,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 but palpitations seem to be fairly high amongst the people that we've seen.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 I know that you've mentioned palpitations are being probably recognised more frequently as a sign.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 So far as the heart and the hemodynamics are concerned,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 I know that you've mentioned, and it's been shown in research,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 that estrogen actually precipitates arrhythmias,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 whilst progesterone has shown to have an inhibiting effect on arrhythmias.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 So would you perhaps explain the physiological interactions at work which cause muscle contraction in the first place,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 and then listeners can follow the outline and then we can get into the subject of the actual palpitations?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 One of the very recent articles on that topic concluded that estrogen causes sudden cardiac death and progesterone prevents it.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 And what they were talking about was the arrhythmia caused by prolonging the excited phase of the heart action.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 And the electrocardiogram has several phases,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 and the last phase of that is called the repolarization wave or the T wave.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And when that has repolarized the cell, the cell is ready for a good, strong next beat.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 But if it is delayed by staying in the excited state too long,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 the atrium might send a signal for a new beat,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 and if it superimposes on that excited state, the cell can't recover enough to have a proper full beat,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 so it will have a slight premature convulsive movement,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 but not an effective pumping stroke unless it has fully repolarized.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 And estrogen is the basic thing that tends to extend the excited state.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 It's similar to what happens in epilepsy.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 During periods of greatly excessive estrogen, the brain cells can't get out of the excited state,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 and there's an epileptic seizure.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Progesterone prevents that by quickly accelerating the restoration of the readiness state

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 or the relaxed state of the nerve.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 The same thing in the heart muscle or skeletal muscle.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Any kind of cell that's excited is quickly restored by either progesterone or thyroid.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Both of them have the energy restoring effect in slightly different ways.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 The thyroid increases the energy production needed to relax the nerve or muscle.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Progesterone stabilizes the relaxed state so that it can hang on to the energy produced by thyroid,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 where estrogen interferes with both of those processes,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 slowing the action potential is what they call the excited state electrically.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Okay, good.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 All right, I just want to let people know while you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD.gov or 91.1 FM.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 And from the 7.30 to 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 to this month's subject of palpitations and cardiac events surrounding them.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 If you're in the area, the number is 923-3911.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 If you live outside the area, the number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 We're very pleased to be joined again by Dr. Raymond Peat, and he's our guest.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 So people can either call him with questions related or unrelated.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Okay, so, yeah, you mentioned the other thing, that thyroid hormone is also able to allow muscles to relax

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 and that this is another way of showing that the energy that's necessary to allow that relaxation is made possible through thyroid hormone.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 When the cell is in its excited state, besides the electrical changes that are being measured,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 many other properties of the cell are changed.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 For example, one of the immediate obvious effects of estrogen excess is that cells take up more water or release water more slowly.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 So in this one second or a fraction of a second state of excitation of nerve or muscle,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 the cell momentarily takes up a little bit of water, swells up a little bit, and then as it relaxes, it squeezes the water out.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 And so if you are having the premature contraction and not letting it relax fully,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 the cell is actually getting a little waterlogged with each of these false beats,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 and that's an effect that estrogen has on every place that it acts, whether it's pituitary, uterus, breast tissue, or heart, or nerve.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 It's causing a slight waterlogging and swelling of that cell.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 So is this why so many women had heart attacks then when they did the HRT trial,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 was it because the estrogen they were taking was suppressing their thyroid and causing the waterlogging and blocking the progesterone,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 and they just had an elevation of estrogen?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 Yeah, one of the differences between heart failure in women and in men is that the diastolic or relaxation phase is more often defective,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 or obviously defective in women.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 And in that poor diastolic relaxation, the cells become progressively more waterlogged and unable to relax.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And in that over-hydrated state, they also can't get rid of the calcium that comes in when the water enters.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And so it ultimately can lead to actual calcification of the heart.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 There was a picture published by the Mexican Heart Institute of a very old woman's calcified heart that looked somewhat like a bone.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 And there was a famous story, 19th century story, about someone who was cremated and had a limestone heart.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 I think the idea for the story came because people actually do get such highly calcified hearts.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 But it's really the end stage of that chronic over-hydration, over-excited inability to relax.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 And this is all principally because the calcium is being taken up and deposited in the tissues.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 The other thing I wanted to bring out was that the oral contraceptive use in women over 37 was related, if they were smoking,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 was related to a much higher incidence of stroke and heart attack.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Yes, there have been a lot of theories about that.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 I suspect that the fact that estrogen increases the carbon monoxide in tissue probably overlaps with the high chronic exposure to carbon monoxide of smokers.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 Okay.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 So you, let me think now.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 The air pollution, carbon monoxide, is highly associated with increased heart events and hospitalizations for heart attacks.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Okay.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 So in terms of palpitations, what would you see as being a kind of a route to get to in order to restore somebody's ability to have normal contractions?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 There are a lot of things other than the electrical property of the heart or the hydration.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 The blood volume is one of the factors.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 For example, high estrogen women are susceptible to varicose veins ultimately or before that just swelling or distension of the veins.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 For example, putting your hand straight down, sometimes the veins on the back of the hand swell up and the legs tend to do that in the high estrogen phase of the menstrual cycle.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 And when the veins in the legs are distended, much of the body's blood supply is in the legs.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 And so it isn't coming back to the heart at the normal speed.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And this means that in that condition, if the woman stands up and her blood tends to fall into her legs, there will suddenly be a smaller return to the heart.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 So the heart doesn't have very much blood to beat.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 So it has fast little strokes because the blood simply isn't being returned.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 And so that situational arrhythmia or tachycardia is not necessarily connected to the electrical instability, but simply to the way the blood isn't getting sent back to the heart.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 But that again is linked to high estrogen causing the veins to distend and to swell up.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Yeah, progesterone increases the smooth muscle tone in the wall of the veins.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 And so if your progesterone is deficient, the veins bulge with a very slight pressure on them, just like holding your hand.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 If you hold your hand at your waist, if your progesterone and other things are right, you won't see your veins.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 But if you're low in progesterone or under stress, even at waist level, you're likely to see bulgy veins.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 So there you go, women. There's a good way to see if you're aging or under stress is if your veins on the back of your hands are bulging at waist level.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 I frequently look at our clients and analyze what the veins on the back of their hands look like at that level to see how well their body's responding to supplementation.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Okay, well, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD Galliford 91.1 FM.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And from now until eight o'clock, you're invited to call in either about the subject,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 which we have Dr. Raymond Peat's expertise sharing with us, which is palpitations and other cardiac anomalies,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 or any other questions that people would have also.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 So the number to ring if you're here in the area is 923-3911, or if you live outside the area, 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 And I think we have a caller on the line.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Hello?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Hi.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 Where are you from? Can I ask where you're calling from?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 Oh, hi. I'm from New Jersey.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Okay, cool.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 Now, my phone is really poor quality, so I'm going to try to keep this short.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 First, I appreciate what you all do.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 I have many questions, not only for Dr. Peat, but also for Drs. Murray.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 But also I saw something -- however, today on Dr. Peat's site, I saw something that I think maybe he would want to know about.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 There is a SENSA weight loss system linking to one of your pages.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 And are you aware of that?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 No.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 Let me tell you which one it is.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 It's the article "Calcium and Disease, Hypertension, Organ Calcification, and Shock vs. Respiratory Energy."

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 And it's in a sentence that says -- that begins, "A low-protein diet similar to that eaten by a large proportion of women,"

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 and then it goes on from there.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 But the words "protein diet" are a link.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 I pressed -- I wanted to see what you had to say about that.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 I was taken to a commercial for SENSA.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Wow, thanks for warning Dr. Peat about that.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Yeah, thanks.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Would you like me to write a letter to the FTC to complain?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 I'll take a look at it.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Could you email me?

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Do you have my email?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 No, would you like me to email the station or something?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Well, my website has my email.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Go straight to Dr. Peat's website.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 It is an email address.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 If you go to Dr. Peat's website and push on "contact," you can email him.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Maybe you can copy and paste the link.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Okay.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 If you go to --

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Okay, I'll do that.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 I'll do that.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 But now since this thing came up, me personally, I'm not in any danger of taking SENSA.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 I assume it's junk, especially when they act like this.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 But what is your understanding?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 What is SENSA?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 And on a physiological level, what happens when we take SENSA?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 What is that?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 I've not heard of it either.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Do you know anything more about it?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Is it an acronym?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 I've seen commercials for it where you sprinkle something on your food

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 and it makes you not -- and somehow you don't eat as much.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And I'm wondering if it's like -- it changes the taste of food, or so they say,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 enhancing the taste of food, and therefore you don't want to eat as much.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 And now that just sounds like MSG to me or something.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 I've never heard of it.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 Oh, okay.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Okay.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 So I'm going to leave it there then, and I will e-mail the link.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Okay, and just for our listeners, if you want to contact Dr. Peat,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 you can go onto his website at www.raypeat.com,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 and there's a little Google search area you can put in something there.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 So you put in "contact," and then it will come up with his contact details,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 and you can e-mail him through his web page.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Okay, it sounds like the last caller had come across something very useful to know, Dr. Peat,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 so I'm glad for that.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 Thank you.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 I'm going to sign off.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Thank you.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Somebody's obviously inserting some malicious hyperlink into one of your articles apparently.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So good to hear about that.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 And I would imagine that the sensor is probably chunk.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 So, okay, I don't know if we had any more callers on the air.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 If we do, let's take the next caller.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Well, this wasn't entirely human health related,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 but somebody just wanted to say how excellent Maria, the new assistant at Garberville Vets Clinic is,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 because it was a medical show, so they put that out there.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 And I'll personally ask, what's the herbology of nettles?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 I've been eating a lot lately.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 What's the what of nettles?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Nettles, stinging nettles, like nutritionally and whatnot.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Right, well, they contain a lot of calcium, actually.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 It's one of the-- probably the herbs that contains the most calcium.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 So obviously, we recommend people to consume egg cells as a source of calcium because they're even richer.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 But it's a very pertinent question in some ways, Michael,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 because this time of year is probably the most nutritious time to eat nettles.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 So when they're about 18 inches tall, you can cut them just down to more or less ground level

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 and steam them in a small colander inside a pan with just a small amount of water

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 and steam them for about 10 minutes.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 When they become very limp and flaccid, they go fairly brownish in color.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 And that's a problem.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 And the liquid is beautiful.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 It tastes so mineral rich and will contain quite a lot of calcium.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 So it's one of the-- it's also an antihistamine for allergies, et cetera,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 for people that are suffering from seasonal rhinitis and those kind of things.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 It's the perfect time of year to make your nettle salad.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 And I like to put olive oil and a little squeeze of lemon.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Absolutely.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 And a little cheese on top.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 And, of course, a little feta cheese.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 It doesn't go too far.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 Okay, good.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 I don't know if there's anybody else on the line.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 So, okay, it looks like there's one more caller.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Let's take this next one.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Hello?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And where are you calling from?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 I am in Eureka right now.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 I'm from Southern Humboldt, though.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 Eureka, California.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Okay, cool.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 I was interested in the heart palpitations or the estrogen and progesterone conversation,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 but you had mentioned briefly that there's something to do with the effect of seizures,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 of epilepsy as well with estrogen.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Did I misunderstand that?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Blood what?

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 There's a connection.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 She's asking about the connection between epilepsy and estrogen.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 I've got an article on my website about that in detail, but it's been known for around

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 70 years that there's a premenstrual type of epilepsy.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 And that eventually led to animal experiments in which they showed that the ratio between

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 estrogen and progesterone mainly is what governs the stability of nerve cells as much as any

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 cell.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 But when the ratio is too high, just a slight stimulation can set off an uncontrollable

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 volley of activity, leading to seizures of different types.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 It's correctable very easily by metabolically lowering that ratio, increasing progesterone

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 and excreting estrogen faster.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 And you can figure this ratio out by asking your doctor to do a blood test for estradiol

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 and progesterone and looking at the ratios between the two.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Okay.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 A friend of mine has exactly that with her cycle, so she'll be thrilled to find this

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 out.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 So it's on your website, though?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 There's a whole article on his website.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Okay.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 All right.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Okay.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 I think we have another caller.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Actually, we had a caller who would like me to tell them more about eating nettles and

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 how I eat the nettles.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 And the one important thing is that the nettles do not sting you once they're wilted.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 They actually don't.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Or if you've cooked them a little bit.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 You can chew them right on and they don't sting.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 It's pretty amazing.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 So what I do is I actually go with a glove and I grab the very tip of the plant and I

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 snip off just the very, very tip, even though they are only 18 to 2 feet, inches to 2 feet

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 tall.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 And then I saute onions and I throw them on top of the onions.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 And I've been making mainly Indian food with them, where I dump Indian curry spices and

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 sour cream on it and make like sog and peas and stuff.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Or else I make soups with it.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 And you said to steam them for 10 minutes.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 I find they cook a lot longer than you'd think for that.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 So I cook them 20 to 30 minutes even.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 And for people with sensitive digestions, if you don't, if all that fiber is a little

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 bit too much for you, if you do boil them and then drink the liquid, that's where most

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 of the minerals will come out into anyway.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 So it's also very nutritious that way for people with more sensitive intestines.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 And I'm steaming just the very, very top little growing tip that I snip off.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Not much stem fiber.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 And I was thinking about chopping more of it down to feed my chickens.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 But as it is, I just kind of trim the patch.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 And if you're really careful with your fingertips, you can snip them off without gloves.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 I was trying that.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 But when you do it for a few hours, you end up getting stung a lot.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 I know.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 OK.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 So just to remind folks, if you're listening, we've got Dr. Raymond Peat with us again,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 sharing his wisdom on physiology and hormone physiology in particular with relation to

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 palpitations and cardiac failure.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 The next question, if you let me just say again, once again, if people are in the area,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 it's 923-3911.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Or if you live outside the number, the number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 So Dr. Peat, talking about myocardial infarct, I read an article here saying that prostaglandin

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 synthesis, prostaglandins being an inflammatory mediator causing kind of vasoconstriction,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 is actually relieved by progesterone.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 And both in angina and myocardial infarct, progesterone is a pretty important compound

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 if it can be got to a patient in a very short order because it will actually restore the

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 system.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 It's very much like cortisol as an anti-inflammatory inhibiting the many different kinds of inflammation

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 promoting things, but prostaglandins are probably the most important ones for people who eat

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 quite a bit of unsaturated fat.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 But it doesn't have the harmful side effects of taking cortisol or the synthetic glucocorticoids

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 as anti-inflammatories.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 So is this like if you have a heart attack and you take aspirin very shortly after or

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 progesterone, do they both work the same way in blocking prostaglandins?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Yeah, they both stop the inflammatory process which leads to tissue damage and the brain

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 is more sensitive in many ways than the heart and there has been research going on now for

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 several years showing that if you can get a big dose of progesterone to someone who

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 has had a potentially fatal head injury, they will have a high survival and recovery rate

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 because the progesterone stops the progression of brain damage.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 It does the same thing to any tissue that's injured, stops the progression by reducing

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 inflammation.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 So for traumatic brain injury or myocardial ischemia or any other event like that, it's

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 a pretty restorative compound.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Let me have a caller on the line.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 So let's take the next caller.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Yeah, I came in at the end of the discussion about heart palpitations and hormonal imbalance.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 I was wondering is it estrogen dominance or low estrogen that typically causes the palpitations?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 It's estrogen dominance or a poor ratio of estradiol to progesterone.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 So even if the progesterone is maybe fake progesterone in the form of birth control,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 that can lead to the heart palpitations you're discussing?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 Some of the synthetic progestins so-called in birth control or others actually have some

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 protective effects.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 There's one called drospironone that is probably the closest to natural progesterone that they've

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 come up with in function and it's being used to treat heart failure for example where natural

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 progesterone would be the best overall treatment but this is a patented drug that is now being

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 accepted because it opposes the pro-inflammatory effects of aldosterone, the salt regulating

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 steroid hormone which progesterone is the natural antagonist of that.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 But this synthetic is a very relatively safe drug for protecting the heart against failure

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 and fibrosis and inflammation.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 But are you aware that they use that progesterone in the birth control pill?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 I think there is either that or a very similar one in a European birth control pill.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 I don't know how personal I'm allowed to go or if I'm allowed to talk about a particular

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 product.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 I'm curious because I had a terrible, terrible time while on the Mirena IUD and that type

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 of synthetic progesterone is what I believe, not knowing much at all, triggered my intense

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 bout of palpitations.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 I'm wondering if you're familiar with Mirena.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 No, I don't know.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 I'll look up the actual drug name in Mirena and then maybe we can help you out a little

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 bit better there.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 Yeah, I'm wondering if there was maybe, I just have no idea.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 To me it was the only thing that could have caused my palpitations.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 I had it removed and I'm still experiencing them sickly during ovulation and I'm wondering

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 if that's just kind of normal as my body adjusts.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Like I said, I don't know if I'm allowed to ask too much personal stuff.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Was that an IUD did you say?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 Yes.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Yeah, a progesterone releasing IUD.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Just the presence of an irritant in the uterus will lower your natural progesterone.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 So even if it's releasing progesterone, I think it's likely that the effect is by reducing

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 your ovaries natural production.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 And over time my body should begin to produce natural progesterone again, hopefully?

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 Yeah, as soon as the irritation stops and if your diet and everything else are good,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 it will recover quickly.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Okay, so I looked it up and it's levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 That's the progesterone form.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 But I guess if you said the presence of an IUD is going to be increasing estrogen and

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 irritating the whole system, then graded raw care is a great way to lower estrogen, keeping

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 your proteins up and saturated fats.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Those things that all help get your...

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 What was the first thing you mentioned?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Graded raw carrot.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 Okay, cool.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 Well, there you go.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 It was just so interesting.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 I turned on the radio and this is exactly what I've been experiencing.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 So thank you very much for your input.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 The graded raw carrot, by the way, is there basically to mop up excess bowel estrogen.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 And other toxins.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 Yeah, and other waste products.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 So it does have a very real effect in lowering excess hormone from the bowel.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Okay, so we've got two more callers on the line.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Actually, they're both.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 I asked for them.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 The first question was a comment saying that juicing nettles is excellent, best spring tonic ever.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 So juice your nettles in a wheatgrass juicer.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 And the second question, it's a little long, a little long for me.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 When progesterone is rubbed into the skin, apparently it doesn't go into the body except as one big lump.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 And would you please talk about skin progesterone?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 It sure does.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 Dr. Peat, go ahead.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 What was the last phrase?

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 It doesn't go into the body.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Into the skin.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 When it's rubbed into the skin, it goes into the body as what did you say, Michael?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 As a big lump, according to the caller.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 But, you know, comment on skin progesterone.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 It's very absorbable, right, Dr. Peat?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 Yes.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 If you stick your finger in it and if you're familiar with the taste of progesterone, in about a minute you can taste the progesterone.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Same idea as putting DMSO on your skin.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 The progesterone just goes right through so that you can get the systemic effect pretty quickly through your skin.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 Right.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 I've rubbed on a lady who had heart failure, I've rubbed olive oil on her arm.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 And then I rubbed progesterone, probably about a teaspoon of progesterone, which had about 90% vitamin E and 10% progesterone.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 And within half an hour, the veins on the back of her hands were completely flattened.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 And to start with, they were very elevated.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 So it definitely gets absorbed into the skin pretty quickly.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 It's just quantity and quality.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Quantity of how much you use and the quality of the product.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 Okay, there's one more caller, so let's take this next caller.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 Actually, it's another. I asked a question for them.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 How do you spell your name? And you don't have to answer this.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 How old is Dr. Peat?

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 How old?

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 How old are you, Dr. Peat?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 76.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 And he wants to know how you spell your name.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 P-E-A-T.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Like the peat moss that you can burn.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 That smells wonderful to burn.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 We tell people regularly. I'm surprised Mark had to ask.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Anyway, okay, I think he's talking to another caller who's coming on in,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 but at this point in time, he's not flagging me that there's anyone actually there.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 Okay, so I wanted to pick up where you left off last,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 talking about aldosterone as being a bad compound in the body

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 that I think we're naturally exposed to as part of the kind of kidney and renin-angiotensin system.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 Yeah, there are several things that will start that process towards hypertension

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 and inflammation and degeneration.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 Low blood sugar is enough to start the process signaling your kidneys to send out renin

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 and starting the process to produce aldosterone.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Not eating enough salt is another thing that raises the aldosterone.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 If your blood vessels leak for any reason, if something makes them permeable,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 such as hyperventilating, you lose a little blood volume,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 and anything that lowers your blood volume or sugar or sodium

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 will cause your kidneys to activate the process that ends up increasing aldosterone,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 and the aldosterone has the central function of making you not lose sodium so fast.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 Keeping the sodium inside your bloodstream helps the blood to absorb water

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 so that it doesn't form edema. It stays in the circulatory system, nourishing the tissues.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 But the side effects of that essential regulatory aldosterone,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 the side effect is to lose--instead of losing sodium, you lose potassium and magnesium,

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 and the loss of potassium and magnesium are very important in causing the heart rhythm problem.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 The repolarizing restorative process of the heart muscle means that the cell can retain magnesium and potassium

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 and excrete the excitatory sodium and calcium.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 And so if you're restricting salt or having hypoglycemia or losing blood volume for any reason,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 your aldosterone is going to tend to make you lose the stabilizing magnesium and potassium,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 and all of your cells will tend to become unstable electrically and functionally.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 Excellent.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 Is this why pre-menstrual women tend to swell?

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 Is this another reason why, because of the dropping progesterone, they have rising aldosterone?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Yeah. Protein deficiency is another thing that will start this whole process.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 And salt deficiency?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 Protein, salt--

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 Sugar.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 Sugar.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 Yeah.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 Hypoglycemia.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 Another excellent reminder. Thank you, Dr. Peay.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 I know you've mentioned several times on many different shows how important sugar and salt are,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 contrary to popular belief.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 I think we've got one more caller on the line, so let's take this next caller.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 I think there's another coming in.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 Caller, you're on the air?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 Yeah, hey.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Hi. Where are you calling from?

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 Phillipsville.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 Phillipsville, California, folks. Okay.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 Go ahead.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 I'm on the road. I'm in the studio.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 I am sorry, but I tuned in less than ten minutes ago, but this information is very relevant to me.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 I would like to continue dialoguing with you after the show, if that's possible.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 I am dealing with lupus myself, and I have a grand mal seizure once a month in association with my menstrual cycle.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 For a while there, it was typically the night before my period started.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 I have a grand mal seizure, and it seems to me because of my response to B vitamins that it's associated with a drop in my progesterone.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 I've been listening to you guys just now, like talking about protein levels and aldosterone.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 I've also registered as having low sodium for an extended period of time, but my doctors debated about the source of that,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 because I also have SIDH, syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 I was just retaining too much fluid, but I also just incurred a brain injury, so cerebral salt wasting was another diagnosis.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 It seems like these things all go together, though, from what you're saying, sodium and progesterone.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 Behind the balance of aldosterone, estrogen, and progesterone is the thyroid function.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Thyroiditis is something that goes along with lupus, too.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 Low thyroid is the main cause of that inappropriate loss of sodium.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:25.000
 Hospitals don't seem to realize how important that sodium loss problem is,

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 especially in older people, but under the influence of estrogen, it happens, too.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 I know from my research that seizures that go along with lupus,

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 and catamenial epilepsy, go along with low progesterone or low estrogen.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 It's my own assessment that it's low progesterone, but I just had my blood drawn a couple days ago.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 I'm finishing my menstrual cycle right now, but I had a regular sodium level.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 It seems like maybe cerebral salt wasting was what was going on.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 I'm just saying, I'm sorry for coming into the middle of your show.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 I'm going to try and get a copy of it myself, but I really would like to dialogue with you.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 Okay, no problem.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 At the end of the show, if you either call in, or it's probably the best thing, you can call in and make a--

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 What we can do is give our contact details at the end of the show, and we work with Dr. Peat.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Also, you can listen to the whole show on the audio archives on kmud.org.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 If you want to listen from the beginning, you might find that interesting.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 What's the name of this whole show? How do I find it?

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 You go onto kmud.org, and you go to audio archives, and then you do Friday Night Talk,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 and you look for today's date, which is March 15th.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 It doesn't say the title of our show on there, it just says Friday Night Talk Show.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 Then you scroll down until you find the date, March 15th, 2013.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 You can either listen to it or download it.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 We'll give our contact details and Dr. Raymond Peat's contact details at the end of the show.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 Are you guys not around here?

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 No, we're in Garboville, and Dr. Peat lives in Eugene, Oregon.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 Oh, well, dang. Okay. Well, cool. Thank you, sir, for introducing.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 We'll look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your call.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 Okay, next caller.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 Yes, interesting program. I hear mostly women calling in.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 I have a case of-- I think they call them rope veins in one leg.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 And pretty much my veins have always kind of stood out.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 I'm interested if any of these dietary thinners, some of these treatments you were talking about,

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 like what would happen if I rubbed progesterone on my skin as a male?

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 I heard earlier, I think you mentioned, that it caused some heart problems.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Is there some treatment for that that isn't quite so drastic of what I've read online?

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Although some men do use progesterone very successfully often for varicose veins,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 I think the best thing is to start with pregnenolone, using it orally, because that will normalize.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 It can produce testosterone, DHEA, as well as progesterone.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 And so it will tend to keep your hormones more in balance than applying big doses of progesterone.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 Okay. What was the name of that again?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 Pregnenolone.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 And you can find it at-- where are you calling from, caller?

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 Just outside of Redway, a little bit.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 Okay, yeah, so at Chautauqua they'll have pregnenolone.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 Pregnenolone.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 Pregnenolone. And it's a precursor for all of our steroid hormones.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 Oh, okay. Okay. All right, great.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 Okay, just to make sure that you heard the name, it's Preg, as in pregnant, Pregnenolone.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 Preg, oh, okay.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Yeah, P-R-E-G-N-E-N-O-L-O-N-E.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 Okay.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 But it's a-- it's found in men and women. It's made from cholesterol from our liver,

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 so it's a very common hormone in everybody.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 All right, Michael says he's got a quick question here he can squeeze in before the top of the hour.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 About how much sodium should a 155-pound, 42-year-old male intake?

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Your taste and craving would be the best way to judge because everything affects it.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 Your thyroid hormone, if your thyroid is a little bit low, you need lots more sodium in your food.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 If your thyroid function is good, you can get along with a very low sodium intake and not have any problem.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 The reason women tend to have salt cravings around the ovulation or premenstrually or in pregnancy is because

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 the excess of estrogen and low thyroid or low progesterone causes them to lose sodium.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 But if your thyroid and hormones are good, you don't have to worry at all about adding salt to your food.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 Okay, Michael says it's all about your tastes.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 And also, too, if you're having a comprehensive metabolic panel done, you'll see a sodium level on there,

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 and sometimes if people are not sure how much they should be eating and they're not really craving it,

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 sometimes it can be low even in that sort of situation.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 And on that same test, the albumin works with the sodium and thyroid to regulate the volume of your blood

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 and therefore all of these functional energy electrical systems.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 Okay, well, thank you so much, Dr. Peat. I think we're going to have to call this the top of the hour.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Thanks so much for your help, and we'll just give out your details.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 Okay, thanks.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Okay, all right, so Dr. Raymond Peat, physiologist and endocrine specialist,

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 can be reached online, has a wealth of information, lots of articles,

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 some of which were already mentioned by the people this evening,

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 lots of articles that are fully referenced, scientifically referenced journal articles.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 His address is www.raypeat.com, and so the articles can be looked at,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 and he can also be contacted from that page, so lots of information,

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 most of which you won't find anywhere else, folks.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 I'll tell you this, most of what he's producing, it's there in research.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 It just doesn't come to the mainstream attention.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 Like you said, it can take 20 or 30 years for supposed new ideas to actually come to light.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 Well, not just new ideas, proven ideas.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 Proven ideas.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 I mean, proven, not ideas, proven science.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 Proven facts.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 Okay, so anyway, a wealth of information there, and don't be surprised if what you read

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 doesn't sound like the things that you hear on TV because you're not likely to,

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 so what you're going to get from him is where the actual facts are.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 So go and take a good look, and yeah, email him if you want.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 Okay, so for those people that have called in tonight, thanks so much for your calls.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 Our details are?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:32.000

 or that's the toll-free number, or locally, 707-986-9506.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 Okay, we have a website, but it's not worth looking at, folks,

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 because it's far too outdated, so don't even bother.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 But we have email addresses, and that's another good way,

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 so Andrew or Sarah@westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 Thanks so much for people calling in.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
 I really appreciate your input, and Dr. Peat, once again, thanks so much.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 We look forward to joining you next month on the third Friday of the month.
