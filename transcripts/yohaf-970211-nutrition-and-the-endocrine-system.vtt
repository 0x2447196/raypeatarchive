00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 [music]

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Good afternoon and welcome to your own health and fitness talk show.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 I'm health integration specialist Lena Berman.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 I'm here live with you every Tuesday at noon, talking to you about health care and fitness trends,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 and I usually take your phone calls.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Now, this week's show is the final of two special Pledge Drive shows.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Today I'll be interviewing biologist and medical activist Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 He's a pioneer in the use of natural progesterone therapy, among other things, and the author of several books.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Now, today we'll be talking until 1230. We'll take our usual short musical break.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 During that break, what I'm going to hope is that you will use that time,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 instead of calling in to ask questions today, to call in and become a part of KPFA

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 by joining at several different levels. Any level will work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 However, if you join at a level of $60, you get a choice of three different books written by Ray Peat.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 You can have your choice of one for $60.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 The books are Women in Nutrition, Generative Energy, and Mind and Tissue,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 which is about the Russian research perspective on the human brain.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 So each one of these books is yours with a pledge of $60 to KPFA.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 In other words, as a thank you gift, we will send along one of these wonderful books,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 these wonderfully thought-provoking books.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Now, if you want two of these books, and you can choose any two that you want,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 you can have that as a thank you gift for a pledge of $100.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Three books with a pledge of $150, you can get all three of Ray Peat's books.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 So today, instead of opening up the phone lines for you to ask questions,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 I'm going to ask you to support the show with your pledges.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 I want to remind people before we get into the show that if you want information about cassette copies

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 of your own health and fitness, or if you need to reach me,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 you just call my office during normal business hours, and my office number is 707-769-1458.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 And I'll give that number out again at the end of the show.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Now, if you want to pledge during this hour, our pledge drive numbers are 510-848-5732.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Or, if you're out of our area code here, you can dial us at 1-800-439-5732.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Now, I understand that you may want to listen to this interview, and I won't blame you if you do,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 but at 12.30, I will open up the lines and let you call in to do some pledging,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 and then we'll get back to our interview and finish up at about quarter to one.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Let me not editorialize today.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Let me get right to my guest, because we have an awful lot to talk about,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 and it's very, very, very provocative, wonderful stuff.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 So, Ray, I believe you're there with us, yes?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 I am.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Okay.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Introduced to many people for the first time as the researcher from whom Dr. John Lee,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 author of "What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Metapause,"

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 first learned about the benefits of natural progesterone supplementation,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat received his Ph.D. in biology from the University of Oregon,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 specializing in physiology.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 He has written "Mind and Tissue," "Progesterone in Orthomolecular Medicine,"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 and "Nutrition for Women," including a new book,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 which I believe we may be privy to at some point soon.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 He's also written several articles in journals.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 He has taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Universidad Veracruzana, and the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 and he also founded Blake College International University.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 He does independent research and private endocrinological and nutritional counseling.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 So welcome to you.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 I'm so pleased that you took the time out to come and be with us.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Let me start with--I want to talk about more than just progesterone today.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 I want to talk about everything, but I would like, for those people who are not--

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 who don't know your work very well,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 I'd like to ask you how you came to the conclusion that women need supplementation

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 with natural progesterone and not with estrogen.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 In the '50s, I saw people getting estrogen therapy and dying or going crazy

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 or getting rheumatoid arthritis, and it was so obvious that, like,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 one woman went into a mental breakdown an hour after she had an injection of estrogen,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 and her daughter died at the age of about 27 after taking early birth control pills

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 that were high in estrogen.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 And I began just keeping my ears open to the nature of the research that was supporting it

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 and realized that it really was all advertising,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 and the research went completely in the other direction,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 and so I decided to go back to graduate school.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 I had been in linguistics and literature, and I intended to study nerve biology,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 and I thought that that was dominated by some very foolish dogmas

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 that the least dogmatic work was being done in reproductive physiology,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 and there I saw that estrogen explained infertility and reproductive aging.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 It accelerated or imitated all of the known age-related changes.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 And this is true for men as well.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Yeah, and these changes are so fundamental and general

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 that you can't really distinguish between the free radical damage done by unopposed estrogen

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 or by heavy metals or by x-rays or by anything that interferes with oxidative metabolism.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 As you just said, what you discovered is that aging and estrogen dominance share symptoms.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 A lot of people don't realize that when men age, it isn't that they are losing testosterone in particular.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Mostly what's happening is that they're gaining estrogen.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Yeah, for example, prostate enlargement and then cancer occurs in aging men,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 and it is precisely the men who are deficient in testosterone

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 and have an excess of estrogen who get the enlarged and cancerous prostate.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 And so what we're saying is that aging and estrogen dominance share symptoms

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 which include diminished cellular respiratory capacity, which causes energy loss,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 and it increases your risk of cancer.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And it's a vicious circle too because estrogen not only causes the respiratory defect,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 but once you get stressed and sick, even an acute stress drastically raises your body's estrogen

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 so that hospitalized people, men or women, typically have very high estrogen levels.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 A heart attack, for example, is associated with very high estrogen levels in men.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 I might mention here also that I think we've, at least those of us who listen to alternative radio,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 KPFA as an example, know about the fact that our environment is full of estrogenic,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 xenoestrogen-mimicking chemicals, lots of pesticides and whatnot.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Yeah, this is very old information.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 In the '60s when I was starting my research, I saw that for decades people had known

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 that soot is full of a vast number of estrogenic compounds,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 the same things which are carcinogenic in smoke have a very neat estrogenic function.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 That's why estrogen was such an easy thing to commercialize by the drug companies

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 because you could find it everywhere.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 I want to talk about progesterone, but before we talk about progesterone,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 I'd like you to describe what role the thyroid plays in restoring balance when estrogen is dominant.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 The liver, this was work done by the Biscons in the early 1940s.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 The liver is the main thing that regulates and holds your estrogen in check.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 And the liver, to do its work, requires adequate protein, nutrition, essentially,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 and a basic amount of B vitamins.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 But these don't work unless you have adequate thyroid to make the liver able to metabolize the protein.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 You know, this would also explain why more women have trouble with thyroid function.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 I think the other things you mention is that we already have estrogen and have, as you put it in the book, less active livers.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Although I'm really noticing that with increased alcohol consumption, use of pharmaceuticals,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 and then what we just talked about, the estrogenic environmental pollutants,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 and the sorts of infectious diseases that men are getting, that men as well are quite estrogen dominant.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 But it does seem that women tend to be the ones that are red flagged the fastest for low thyroid symptoms.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Why is it hard to evaluate the adequacy of thyroid function with a blood test?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 It wouldn't necessarily be so hard, but the scientific work that was being done in the '30s and early '40s

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 showed that respiration goes down as your thyroid goes down.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 But the basic technique simply involved measuring how much oxygen you would breathe in a period of a few minutes.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 And the drug companies didn't have any way to market air to be breathed in the lab,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 and they came up with a blood test called the protein-bound iodine measurement

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 and sold everyone on the idea that this was scientific.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 And it turned out that instead of 40% of the population being low respirers,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 only 5% were low in the protein-bound iodine test.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 And when I was in school, everyone who was overweight had been told by their doctors

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 that they had behavioral or personality defects, not a hormone problem,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 because the drug companies convinced everyone that really needed thyroid,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 since the test didn't show low thyroid that 95% of the people have some other problem.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 But in the '60s, the protein-bound iodine was found to have essentially nothing to do with thyroid function.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 And what remained in everyone's mind was that 95% of the population do not need thyroid.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 So now, no matter how perfect the test might measure your thyroid response,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 the fixed idea is that you are not likely to need thyroid.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Yeah. In fact, actually, when a lot of people who present with some of the symptoms that you describe in the book

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 that would indicate a possible problem with thyroid, like having an extremely low resting pulse,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 and in many cases this is not someone who's athletic, their temperature is below normal, very much below normal,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 pulses, as I mentioned, slow, reflexes are not quite right, they're cold all the time,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 all of these things that we normally associate with low thyroid function.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 And then when the doctor does a panel, they're not seeing a low thyroid in the blood.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 And either over or underweight can be caused by low thyroid, so it isn't just a matter of fat people needing thyroid.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Very often, people who can't gain a normal amount of weight need thyroid.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 And dry skin and falling hair are two of the very important indicators,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 and those tend to increase with aging and to some extent they can be reversed by restoring the hormones.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Just a few months ago, someone found that an anti-estrogen chemical restores hair growth in animals,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 and this is one of the things that thyroid researchers have suspected,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 low thyroid people have high estrogen, and estrogen interferes with the development of the cell follicle, the hair follicle.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And estrogen also makes it difficult for the body to utilize thyroid, and for the thyroid to produce it,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 but I mean even if you're taking supplemental thyroid, if your estrogen levels are high, it will also interfere.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 So what we've got here is a situation where people are walking around with these symptoms.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 Do you have any suggestions on how people are going to get their doctors to respond to this?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 I mean if they're doing a blood test and they're seeing, I mean one of the ways that I've sort of intervened

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 is to have people have their doctors also check for antibody levels, and that sometimes gets their attention.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Well, what I usually do is go over a person's problems and have them make a list of at least five of the classical indicators of hypothyroidism.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 Cold hands and feet, gaining weight when they don't eat very much, being constipated, having dry skin and hair,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 all of--there are about 200 classical indicators, and if a person puts together a list of complaints,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 any doctor that went to medical school is likely to recognize by the time they've named five or six classical complaints

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 that there could be a thyroid problem.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 I'll throw in a couple more.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 People who are low in--the body converts thyroid into T3.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 I mean it's kind of complicated. I don't want to get into the specifics of it, but if you're too low in T3,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 if you don't have enough, you also become very depressive.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 And also, because I work with people in a variety of ways, including exercise, if people begin to do exercise,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 they begin to gain weight if the thyroid is not functioning well.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 In addition to that, what you've cautioned against is people doing what we call aerobic exercise,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 but doing it in a state where they're out of breath.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 So these people who do exhaustive hours of running and getting on the Stairmaster,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 and they're almost breathless, and they do this for a long period of time, may in fact, or certainly in fact,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 are suppressing thyroid function.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Yeah, someone put volunteers on a treadmill and had them walk for 40 minutes,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 keeping their pulse rate under 120 beats per minute, so gentle exercise just for 40 minutes.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 And then they measured the amount of the active thyroid hormone, T3, in their blood,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 and it had gone to zero in that short time.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 For people who are just tuning in, this is KPFA, and I'm health integration specialist,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Lena Berman, on Your Own Health and Fitness is the show.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 It's a special pledge drive show, and I have Dr. Raymond Peat, a researcher and medical activist, on the line,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 and we're discussing right now progesterone and thyroid, and we'll move on to some other very important hormones.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 We will open the lines at 1230, but this time it's going to be for you to pledge,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 and what you can do if you pledge is get, as a thank you gift, one of Ray Peat's fabulous books.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Now, these are self-published books. These are not on the bookshelves.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 This is a special deal from KPFA.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 You can get his books directly from him, but we have them here, and we will give you a book with a pledge of $60.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 We'll give you two books for $100, and we'll give you all three of his books for a pledge of $150 as a thank you gift.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 At 1230, we'll open up the lines at 848-5732 in this area code, or 1-800-439-5732, so stay tuned for that.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 One of the things that also can happen is we have an estrogenic environment,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 and then we have these dietary changes that have occurred in the United States over the last few years.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Suddenly, the food industry has been pushing polyunsaturated vegetable oils.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 They've been pushing a high-carbohydrate diet, stressing the use of soy and legumes in the diet,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 and in fact, it looks to me as though the cancer rates have gone through the ceiling,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 and in addition to that, I think there's just an endemic problem with thyroid right now.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Would you like to comment on that?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 In the '30s, one of the indicators of--it was a very reliable sign that the thyroid was low

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 when the blood cholesterol level was very high, and people demonstrated that if you removed the thyroid gland,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 immediately their blood cholesterol started up, and if you gave them a thyroid supplement,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 immediately the blood cholesterol would return to normal,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 and it happens that if you poison the liver, it can't make cholesterol,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 and someone discovered that if you feed the animals a very large amount of unsaturated feed oils,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 it will suppress the cholesterol while also suppressing their metabolism,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 and the pig farmers, for example, found it useful to add large amounts of corn or soybeans to the animals' diets

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 to make them hypometabolic so they got fat on very little food,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 but this same procedure is so toxic to the liver that it doesn't normally in itself cause direct elevation of cholesterol

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 the way simple hypothyroidism does,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 and even though it was established that low thyroid individuals were susceptible to heart disease

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 because of the thyroid deficiency,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 the fact that low thyroid people have high cholesterol became attached with the thought that cholesterol could be blamed instead of low thyroid,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 and the promotion of the feed oils was largely based on the idea that it would lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 but in fact it lowers cholesterol while causing hypothyroidism,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 and just in the last few years, the research is accumulating showing that it is not really connected directly at all with cholesterol,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 but heart disease is the result of plaque that develops in blood vessels,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 and that this plaque is like age pigment, the product of free radical breakdown of unsaturated fats,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 and that the blood vessels are most intimately exposed to both oxygen, abundant iron from the hemoglobin,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 and the unsaturated fats that are either being digested or drawn out of storage,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 and so you have the perfect conditions for creating free radicals during stress when the unsaturated fats are circulating in the bloodstream.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 So what we're saying, Ray, is that this sort of move, in addition, not only did they introduce unsaturated fats as a panacea for saving everybody's lives,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 but these were also very badly processed, they were heated, they were highly processed, which makes the free radical production even worse,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 but in addition to that, there's a whole sort of mythology about diet,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 I mean there are people telling us that the Asian people don't get cancer, and that soy is wonderful, and all of this,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 and I know you have very strong opinions about this, and I'd like to hear you talk about them.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Well, the soy monopoly is really extremely powerful in the United States,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 it subsidizes research and propaganda, medical society meetings, and books,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 and it's doing just a very powerful job of diverting people's attention from this research,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 which is coming out showing that unsaturated fats are intimately involved in heart disease and strokes,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 and what they're doing is over and over repeating certain associations,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 that breast cancer is lower in Japan, for example, than in the United States,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 and when Japanese live in this country, they have the same rate of breast cancer as Americans,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 but they neglect everything else that was traditional in Japan,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 women didn't smoke, for example,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 and green tea also,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 they tended to stay at home, and they ate lots of strange shellfish,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 and all kinds of foods that are simply not available in the United States.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Well, you know, what people say about soy, and what's confusing to people, the consumers,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 is that on the one hand, there's supposed to be these sort of estrogenic phytoestrogens in soy,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 and there's also this concept of there being isoflavones in better,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 well, let me just finish what it is so people know what I'm talking about,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 which is not estrogen, but they're estrogen analogs that take up the receptor sites,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 and they're supposed to protect against estrogen,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 so this is confusing for people, because they think, oh, we're supposed to eat soy,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 because it protects against that, and then other, so what do you say?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Well, that same ideology is being used to promote estriol as the weak natural estrogen,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 but estriol has essentially the same kind of toxicity that any estrogen does,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 and we should remember that DES, which caused even generations later abnormalities in cancer in the babies,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 that DES is a classical weak estrogen that doesn't have the same strong concentration relationship to estrogen effects,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 but it has very broad capacity to disrupt cell functions while acting in many ways like an estrogen,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 and so the weakness has nothing to do with the toxicity, the weakness of binding to the estrogen receptor.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 The estrogenic substances can be just as toxic whether or not they bind to the so-called estrogen receptor,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 because there are so many ways that estrogen has its effects, not just the classical so-called receptor.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 For 40 years or so, people recognized that estrogen had a wide spectrum of instantaneous effects.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 It imitates the shock reaction and causes cells to take up water and such

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 in a time that it couldn't possibly be acting through the classical receptor.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 So there is sort of either a signal action or a chemical action of any estrogenic substance,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 which has nothing to do with the estrogen receptors,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 and when you compare estriol and DES and the phytoestrogens,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 what they have in common is that they are toxic to the reproductive system, will cause miscarriages and abortions.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 There are strains of sheep which are known to be resistant to phytoestrogens,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 and they happen to be the ones that are adapted to live elevations,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 because the phytoestrogens cause abortions by interfering with the oxidative metabolism.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 So if they have a special resistant hemoglobin and physiology, they can stand the phytoestrogens,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 but when you test them on a range of lab animals,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 these bioflavonoids or isoflavones and so on have the same drastic toxic effects that DES, for example, has.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 They cause deformities in the genitals of the baby animals when the mothers are exposed to them.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 So basically, just because we have listeners who are not at all scientific in their mindset,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 before we go to a quick break, what you're saying is that whether you want to say that they--

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 whatever you want to say, what you're saying is that soy still has estrogenic effects,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 which means that it's going to oppose and interfere with thyroid function,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 and that people who are eating-- and we'll come back to this after we take a break--

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 people who are eating diets who are high in soy and also other legumes

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 may in fact be creating a hypo- or low-thyroid condition.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Yeah. At the time some of these claims were coming out several months ago,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 I noticed a report from China that there were 100 million hypothyroid people there,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 and goitrism, cretinism, and so on are extremely common in bean-eating, soybean or any kind of bean.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 The Andes and all the way from the mountains of central Mexico to the tip of South America,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 the bean-eating cultures have an extremely high incidence of goitr and cretinism.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Okay. Well, listen, we're going to take a very, very brief musical break,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 so hold that thought, and we'll come back to it.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 This is your own health and fitness talk show on KPFM,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 health integration specialist doing a special pledge drive show with Raymond Peet,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 researcher and medical activist.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 We are going to open up your phone lines here and let you call in to do some pledging for about 45 seconds.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 It's 510-848-5732 in our area code, 848-5732, or 1-800-439-5732.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 If you're out of the area code, 1-800-HEY-KPFA.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 For a $60 pledge you can choose women in nutrition, genitive energy, or mind and tissue, one book.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 You can have two books for $100 as a thank-you gift,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 or all three of them for a pledge of $150 to support this programming.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 These books are not available on the bookshelf.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 We are going to give them to you with a pledge.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 We're going to take a brief musical break.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 We'll be right back with more of Raymond Peet.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Your molecular structure is really something fine.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 At first, your cellular organization is really something choice.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Your magnetism's about to make me lose my voice.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Got all my circuits open, my system's reading gold.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Your cellular organization, baby, is top of the show.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 [Music]

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Welcome back.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 This is Lena Berman, health integration specialist.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Your own health and fitness on KPFA during a special Pledge Drive show.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 You can keep calling those of you who are on the line right now,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 and those who wish to get copies of Dr. Raymond Peet's books.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 We have some as a thank-you gift for pledging during this hour.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 The number again is 510-848-5732, or 1-800-HEY-KPFA, or 1-800-439-5732.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 We are going to give you, with a pledge today, one of Raymond Peet's books.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 They are women in nutrition, generative energy, and mind and tissue,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 which is the Russian research perspective on the human brain.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 One of these books with a $60 pledge we'll give you as a thank-you gift.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Two books for $100, or all three of his books, which are only available--

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 they're self-published, they're only either available from Dr. Peet himself,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 or by pledging today at KPFA, we will give you these books as a thank-you gift

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 in show of our appreciation.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Now, you won't hear Ray Peet on any other radio show.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 He is not someone who is commonly heard in the media.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 He's a very special person, and he's very discriminating about where he will appear.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 I have a long relationship with him, and he is brilliant.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 This is the man who turned everybody's minds around about the use of estrogen,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 or we're still working on changing their minds anyway.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 What we're talking about right now is the fact that not only because of

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 the environmental situation in our environment with the chemicals and whatnot,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 but also by the way that people have been eating over the last few decades,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 there is an increase in the number of people who are suffering from thyroid disease,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 and particularly low thyroid.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 A lot of it's undiagnosed, and we've been talking about the role of diet.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 And what we were just saying is all these people who say that the Asian diet is healthier--

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 Ray just shared with us a statistic, which is a hard word to say--

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 that there are 100 million Cretans, people with thyroid disease, in China.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 That's significant.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 So the other thing is the use of high-quality animal protein to increase energy.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Part of what we're talking about when we talk about thyroid is increasing oxidation and energy,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 respiration and energy in the cells. Yes?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 And I'm not sure of all of the ways in which protein supports thyroid,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 but in effect the liver seems to think we're starving to death

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 if we don't get adequate high-quality protein.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 It has the function of making albumin and other proteins to maintain blood physiology.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And if it's deficient in the right amino acids that you get from high-quality proteins,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 such as milk and eggs, it acts as if it's starving,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 and it sends out signals to draw on the body's own protein tissues,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 but to prevent the rapid breakdown of the body's own tissues

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 when you're not eating enough protein.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 The body senses the changed chemistry and very quickly suppresses the thyroid.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So there is this known connection between a protein deficiency or imbalance

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 and an adaptive suppression of the thyroid.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 So that's one of the important outcomes, is that people on a low-protein diet,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 their thyroid turns down so that they don't eat up their own tissues.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 It's the same as going on a fast.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 You lose weight for the first day, but then your thyroid is suppressed,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 and after day one you lose only about an ounce a day or something.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Yeah, I don't like fasts because I think they also have a detrimental effect on metabolism,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 even if people are drinking juices and stuff.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 You like people to use, along with milk and eggs and animal protein--

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 and I should mention that these need to be clean source, as clean as you can find,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 because obviously the dairy and meat industries are fond of putting hormones in their products,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 so you do need to be aggressive about locating stores that sell free-range and ask questions.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Really watch out for your food source.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 But using some form of animal protein,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 and you like mixing this with fruit as a carbohydrate and also white potatoes.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Why don't you like the use of grain?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Because the plant defense system puts its worst toxins in the seed to prevent its next generation,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 and these toxins turn out to apparently have been evolved to make the seed undesirable to animals

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 by blocking their digestion, poisoning their metabolism.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 So it takes pretty fancy treatment to make them even digestible and useful.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 That's where the traditional leavening process comes in.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 It helps to detoxify the grains.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 So the worst grain material is one which is not traditionally processed.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 The American native cultures found that by boiling their grains with alkali,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 they would detoxify them enough that they weren't terribly poisonous,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 but still they weren't adequate nutrition in themselves.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 The particular type of calorie in grains,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 their protein value should be discounted because the protein is of such low quality,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 not just the quantity, but the quality is the lowest protein known.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 So if you count them as calories, what you see is either unsaturated fats or starches,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 and the white refined flour, for example, is essentially pure glucose.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Starch is made up of a chain of glucose molecules where fruit sugar is half fructose and half glucose,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 and glucose is a powerful stimulant to insulin and the synthesis of fat.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 So the grains are well designed to cause obesity.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 These complex carbohydrates, which are chemically pure glucose,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 stimulate fat production and increase the appetite so that they start the chain of putting on fat.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 The fructose component of fruit sugar does not have that powerful effect on insulin.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 It's very slow and indirect.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 The fruit comes with many of the minerals which work in place of insulin

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and have a slightly suppressive effect on the insulin.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 And the fruit has a strange side effect.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 It happens to promote cholesterol production,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 and that's one of the reasons I emphasize having plenty of fruit sugar because the fructose,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 while it doesn't cause obesity, it does help your liver to produce more cholesterol,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 which is then available if your thyroid is functioning,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 to turn into the protective hormones pregnenolone and progesterone.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 Now, we're running out of time.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 We've got about six minutes left, and I know that there are some other issues that we want to cover, albeit quickly,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 so I apologize for this because they're important.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 And as usual, I may need to reschedule another show with you, particularly when your new book comes out.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Coconut oil, you know, you made a dent.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 There are nutritionists talking about how great coconut oil is and how it's a metabolic stimulant,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 so much for the idea that saturated fat is nasty.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 I think what we're talking about is that if your thyroid is not functioning well, if it's suppressed,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 either through diet or stress or environmental things,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 your body needs the cholesterol from these sources in order to create these hormones.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 If your thyroid is suppressed, you then will have problems with cholesterol.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Yeah, when I see someone with above-average cholesterol, I think they're in pretty good shape

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 because I've seen people drop their cholesterol levels 80 points a day, 60 to 80 points,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 by using quick-acting thyroid when they had to pass a health exam, for example.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 So it's no problem at all to get your high cholesterol down to normal,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 but to get low cholesterol up to normal so that you have the defensive anti-cancer,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 anti-aging, anti-stress hormones, fruit is really the only practical thing I know of

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 that will help the liver recover from the toxic unsaturated fats and estrogens

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 and other things that block cholesterol production.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Ray, what is going on when someone becomes hyperthyroid?

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 You know, Graves' disease or the other--

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 Well, there are three kinds of Graves' disease, hyperthyroid, euthyroid, and hypothyroid.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 So Graves' disease is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 And very often people are diagnosed as being hyperthyroid on the basis of having elevated thyroxin

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 in their blood in spite of very often having many signs of low thyroid.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 And so you can't go by the standard idea of what hyperthyroidism is.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 Occasionally I see someone who is really hyperthyroid, and that is generally a corrective process.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 If they just, for example, eat some exaggeratedly nutritious foods, lots of eggs,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 maybe some liver, plenty of very concentrated food,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 usually the thyroid is unloading its excess and will correct itself in anywhere from three months to a year.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 That's a very short answer for a complicated question,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 so I apologize if we're giving a short answer to something that's complicated.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 There have been publications on different ways to treat it,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 and the outcome of the good studies was that radiation and surgery are almost never right.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 The conservative treatment, either using diet or a drug just to control the symptoms,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 practically always leads to resolution without the damage of surgery or radiation.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 We only have about two or three minutes, and it's terrible to do this in the last seconds of the show,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 but I wanted to say something about pregnenolone and DHEA.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Mostly when you like using these, it's when people are over 50 when the levels of DHEA decrease.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 If someone tests -- there are tests now, you test DHEA levels -- if you test low,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 should you not try pregnenolone first since it's the beginning of the chain, the pathway of hormones?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 Yeah, pregnenolone is essentially always safe.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 It stops the stress reaction and will --

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 whether you have, for example, Cushing's syndrome with too much cortisone

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 or Addison's disease with too little, pregnenolone, like progesterone,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 will put you right down the middle and correct whatever is wrong.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 And it's protective even if it isn't correcting a disease process,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 and it will very often correct the DHEA level.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 But I interpret the blood tests or saliva tests of DHEA really as indicating more about liver function

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 than about your need or actual tissue levels of the DHEA.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 Without doing a tissue biopsy, I don't think there's any clear way to evaluate your DHEA status,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 and it's better just to correct everything else.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 So who should try pregnenolone?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Anyone who's over 48 or 50 and feeling like they've suddenly run into an energy wall.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 If things are just -- like their skin is deteriorating and looking old

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 and they have no energy and are depressed and so on,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 it very often is just because their glands have sort of hit the barrier of accumulated iron

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 and unsaturated fatty acids that make stress poison your adaptive system rather than stimulating it.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Okay.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 You know, I have to let you go, and I'm really sorry,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 because we really didn't get a chance to talk about the use of progesterone in fertility issues

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 and to prevent ADD-type children and stuff.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 So what we'll have to do, if it's okay with you, Ray,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 is get you back on to talk about the new book,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 because I think all of that will be in the new book.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 Is that not true?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Yeah, that book will be called "Female Hormones in Context."

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 And we're still looking for someone to print it properly.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 So I'll be in touch with you, and we'll reschedule as soon as that book is out.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 In the meantime, I really want to thank you for your generosity.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 I want to thank you for donating the books today,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 and most of all donating your time and being so patient with us as you explain these very complex issues.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 Raymond Peat, thank you so much.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 Thank you.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Okay. Talk to you soon.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 Bye.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 Well, now it's your turn.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 Ray has been generous with us.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 Now we need you.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 And as usual, what I'm coming to you and asking you to do is creating a context for this show,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 because this show means everything to me.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 It's the most important thing I do in my life.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 It's a realization of a dream.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 And for me to have the opportunity to interview people like researchers like this,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 who are not in the mainstream, who have avoided the mainstream so that he is not beholden or under any obligation to lie to you.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 He's not connected to any companies, which is a hard thing to find these days with researchers.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 And he has kept himself very pure.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 He's a very political person.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 The information he's giving you is not in the mainstream,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 and you won't hear it anywhere else but KPFA.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 This is the second show I've done with him.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 I'm going to get him back on to talk about his new book.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 This is absolutely groundbreaking information.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 He's a very, very important researcher.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 We're giving away three of his books today.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 You want to call us now.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 The numbers again are 510-848-5732 or 1-800-439-5732.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 And the books are "Women in Nutrition" for $60,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 "Generative Energy," which is a fascinating book.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 It's very political, and it also talks about the whole context of biology,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 also about all the stuff we were talking about today.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 "Mind and Tissue," which is also for $60.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 It is the Russian research perspective on the human brain.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 This is also about energy and self-function.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 It's talking about how important the brain is,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 how the metabolism and the behavior adaptation and stress in the brain, so brain health.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Each book is $60.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 It's a thank-you gift for pledging $60.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 You can have two of the books for $100.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 You can have all three for $150.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 I don't see any callers.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 Come on, people.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 Do you like this information?

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 You guys clamored for me to get him back on.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 After I had him on the first time, I was overwhelmed with calls.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 The station was overwhelmed with calls.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 This book is not available on bookstore shelves, easy for me to say.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 These books are only available directly from Raymond Peet.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 His information about where to reach him, how to get consultations,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 about his newsletter and his other books are all in the back of these books.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 You can get online with him and with us by now calling and pledging and getting these books.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 All three of these books are fascinating reading.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 You will not find these concepts anywhere else.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 If it weren't for him, women would still be being given estrogen without even any question.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 By goodness, he and John Lee became friends and John Lee started to promote progesterone.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 Ray Peet is not someone who goes out and toots his own horn.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 He's not easy to find.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 He has a busy practice.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 He's researching and writing books.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 He's not interested in selling an idea.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 His books are phenomenal and you have an opportunity that's rare now.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 You can support the station.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 You can support the show and enable me to continue to bring you this kind of very unusual information.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 It's based on my 15-year relationship with him that he's willing to do these shows.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 You won't hear this on another radio station.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Support us now.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 So please call us.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 It's 510-848-5732, 1-800-439-5732 or 1-800-HEY-KPFA.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 Did you like that show, Summer?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 I did.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 I was listening upstairs to it and the first time I had heard him when he was talking about the progesterone,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 I thought it was very interesting, an interesting perspective he had on the whole issue.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 But I'm sitting here looking at this book, Nutrition for Women, and on the back it says,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 what he talks about in here is chronic fatigue, premenstrual tension, breast pain, skin, nutrition and hormones,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 estrogen and anxiety, the danger of iron supplements.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 So I think that it's very, these are very useful books.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 If you would like to get a copy of one of the three that Lane is offering today, you need to give us a call at 510-848-5732.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 She's offering as a gift, as a gift for subscribing to KPFA, Women in Nutrition for a $60 pledge,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Generative Energy for a $60 pledge, Mind and Tissues for a $60 pledge.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 And if you're running into busy signs, busy on the phone right now, we're getting a really good response.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 So if you would like to get a copy of these books, we will let you know when a line is open.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 Keep calling.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Sometimes it keeps ringing and then it cuts you off, but don't give up.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 These books are well worth having.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 I think probably the best package we're offering today is to get all three of the books for $150.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 I mean, because what you're essentially doing is protecting this type of programming.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 You're also letting me know what you want.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 But by getting all three, these are, it's a phenomenal package, because Women in Nutrition is particularly about women and nutrition.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 It does cross over to men in nutrition as well, because it's the same issues of hypothyroidism.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Generative Energy is almost like a dissertation on the relationship between biology and ecology,

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 and it's a call against reductionist thinking, but it has solid information about all of the historical perspective on the research we've been talking about,

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 about thyroid and energy, and it makes it possible for you to really understand what's going on.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 It's a real call to action.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 He's very political.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 And Mind and Tissue is very provocative, because it is hearkening back to Reich and trends in Eastern Europe about energy and cell function and the brain.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 Very interesting stuff, considering what's going on with attention deficit disorder and all of these things that we're seeing.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 And you can have all three of these books for $150, and you support the station, and you support the show.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 I think it's really wonderful when folks that we bring in, especially folks that Mayna brings in on this show,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 are willing to make available to our listeners this information.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 They're giving us these books at no cost for us, because they believe in KPFA.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 They believe in our listeners.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 They believe this information is information that you could benefit from.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 You're not going to go to your regular medical doctor and get this kind of information.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 It's like, "This is what we do for this. Take this pill. This is what we do for that."

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 Well, and as a matter of fact, I think that I'm going to order some additional copies of Generative Energy to give to some of my clients,

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 because I think they need to give this to their doctors, because doctors are not getting it.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 I mean, I'm getting clients who are having their doctors call me, and they're saying, "Why do you want me to check her thyroid?"

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 I mean, it's like they're being receptive. They're listening.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 But if I could shoot over a copy of Generative Energy...

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 So go into your doctor's office armed with this research. 1-800-Hey-KPFA, or 510-848-5732.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 Write down the number. If you're not getting through, you can continue to call after the show is over.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 We will continue to give you some books for some period of time afterwards.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 Oh, yeah. You can keep calling in.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 Why don't you talk a little bit about what's coming up? What's coming up in terms of programming?

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 Well, actually, next week's show is going to be fun. I've got sexologist Dr. Lonnie Barback.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 There was a question about whether to do this for the pledge drive, because it's so close to Valentine's Day.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 So it's going to be a little late, but we're going to still talk about her new book, which is "50 Ways to Please Your Lover."

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 I'm ready to read this book.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 So you may want to pick up a copy of this book ahead of time, and then listen to the show.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 You know what I have coming up that's really exciting is I noticed that Dr. Oliver Sacks was going to be in town.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 So I called his publicist, and she said, "Well, yes, he would be glad to appear."

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 She's coming live. I'm going to be sitting here talking to him.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 I can't tell you what it means to me to have access to these people. It's dying and going to heaven.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 I really have just realized a dream by doing this.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 And you make it possible by joining the station. It's because of you.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 It's because of you that I do the show. It's a volunteer basis. I spend two days a week doing this show.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 And I do it because it's a feedback loop. You give back to me. I give back to you.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 I encounter these researchers. Their ideas get out.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 We're part of the solution. We're becoming part of the solution together.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 Well, let's give the numbers again. 1-800-439-5732.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 If you were getting busy a few moments ago, now we do in fact have a few lines open.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 Or if you're in the 510 area code, 510-848-5732, call and ask for either one of the books that Lane is offering today,

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 Women in Nutrition, Generative Energy, Mind and Tissues, for a $60 pledge each.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 Or just go ahead and go for the $150 pledge. It's less than about $10 a month on the EFT plan.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 You can also put this on your MasterCard or your Visa.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 You can do it the way it works best for you.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 You can even consider taking out a gift subscription if you are a subscriber already.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 Consider upgrading your subscription. Or if you are a new listener to this show, call in now.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 Become a new subscriber. You can also subscribe at the $45 rate if you can't afford $60.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 And you'll still get a copy of our program guide every month.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 The number again, 510-848-5732. There's a couple of lines open now.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 You have an opportunity to get in there now.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 We have only a few more moments before we need to move on to the next show.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 A couple of lines open here, folks. 510-848-5732 or 1-800-439-5732. You can call us right now.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 I want to ask you, Lana, what is the most important thing you want listeners to know about Ray Peete's work?

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 The thing that's most important is that he--

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 You remember the old days where there used to be these bumper stickers that said "Question Authority"?

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Well, that's what Ray Peete is about. He says, "Look, if you go back and you look in the research files, all the way back,

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 there is evidence of many of the things that mainstream nutrition and mainstream medicine, if there is such a thing, are toting as being healthy."

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 Maybe not. Maybe it's not healthy.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 You know, one of the things that's important about him is that--

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 And he challenges me constantly because there are things that we disagree about.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 You know, we've had arguments about whether to supplement the diet with essential fats.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 And he says, "But, you know, radiation decreases, you know, inflammation, too."

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 I mean, he's very thought-provoking in terms of what is the balance here and what is the bill at the end of using these various things.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 And he goes back and he's got the research to support his work.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 It's not that he's some kind of guy who's making this up.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 He's researched a lot of this stuff.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000
 But it's also his passion and his sense of love for people.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 And he can be--you know, in a personal conversation, he can be sort of a little, like, annoyed with people.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 But as soon as you start talking about this stuff, I can feel how desperately he wants people to protect themselves and be healthy.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 How much of a passion it is for him.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 He works very hard.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 510-848-5732.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 There is a line open now if you are getting busy.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Give us a call now.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 We--you know, I really think that this show has gotten a tremendous response from listeners.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 And part of it is because you are questioning authority.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 Like Ray Peete, you're questioning and you want to know more about how to keep yourself healthy.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 So if that's something that's important to you, call in now.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 Get a copy of these three books for a pledge of $150.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 You can have three of these books by Dr. Ray Peete.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 You know, something wonderful that Robert Crayhlen once said to me, you know, a nutritionist who's been on a lot, who's popular,

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 is that a truly intelligent mind will be able to contain conflicting ideas at the same time.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 So whatever you read or hear from Ray Peete, even if it kind of flips a switch or you go, "Huh," that process is creative.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 It will help you to dig deeper into yourself and to experiment and use your body as a laboratory,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 not in an irresponsible way, but in a way that's guided by knowledge.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 So that's the only way to find health is to find that equilibrium and homestasis in each one of you and only with knowledge.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 It's the only way you can do it.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 1-800-439-5732 or 510-848-5732.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 You can pledge at the $60 rate, the $45 rate.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 If you can only afford to pledge $25, then KPFA can use it.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 It's very helpful for us to know what kind of response we get to the different shows that we put on the air here at KPFA.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 Right now we're getting a good response and we really need, in fact, you know, I found out this morning that we haven't made,

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 we're not getting, we're not close to our overall goal.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 We've got a ways to go.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 So don't feel today if you haven't been able to call in, you know, while we're here talking on the mic, that you can't still call in and support us.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 It's very important that the station make its goal of $400,000 before Wednesday.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 So, you know, if you've been waiting and holding back, now's the time to do it.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 510-848-5732.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 We've got a line open.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 Now I'll tell you another thing that's interesting.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 I was listening to the radio the other day and I heard Andrew Weil.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 I know a lot of people like Andrew Weil, but a woman called in.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 This was on KQED, I guess I can mention that on the air.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 And a woman called in and said, "I have bleeding fibroids and I don't want to have a hysterectomy."

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Right?

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 And Andrew Weil said, "Well, yeah, it sounds like you're estrogen dominant.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 So the first thing to do is to eat more soy and get more exercise.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 And then there are surgical techniques where they don't have to remove the uterus."

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 And I'm sitting there going, "What happened to natural progesterone?"

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 Hello? Hello?

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 You know, I mean, it's like Andrew Weil talks about this stuff as if he invented it.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 And that's not all the information.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 It's not all the information.
