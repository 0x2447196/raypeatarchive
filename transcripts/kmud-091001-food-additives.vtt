00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.760
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.680
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows which run every third Friday of the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.560
 month from 7 till 8 p.m., we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.040
 graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.720
 with patients about a wide range of conditions and this month we're again very pleased to welcome

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.760
 Dr. Ray Peat to the show and we'll be finishing up last month's discussion on food additives and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.760
 the detrimental effects, detrimental health effects of food additives and ingredients that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:47.440
 may not even be listed. But after that we want to cover the topic of cancer in general and

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.600
 immunosurveillance and immunology of cancer and perhaps a lot of beliefs about cancer which are

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.480
 probably more propagated than true. So I know Dr. Raymond Peat has quite an extensive

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.160
 experience with this and certainly from his background things have changed a lot since

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.760
 he was studying and I think what he will bring out is that some of the doctrines that have been

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.440
 made very common are pretty erroneous and that some of the old research as well as some of new

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:36.080
 research needs to be taken carefully in the light of what it is showing. Okay so Dr. Raymond Peat

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 thank you for joining us again on the show. Okay so just to finish up last month's topics of the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 food additives and the kind of things that they will be harmful, they will be harmful in consuming

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 them. Most people when they buy foods off the shelf, I know in England definitely people will

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.560
 look very carefully at the labels, the ingredient panel and everything as far as I know it has to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.720
 be disclosed in England. They have got fairly strict food laws whereas in America there is a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.600
 certain percentage of food ingredients that legally don't have to be detailed. So I know some

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.160
 of those things that we mentioned last month we talked about and I know there was a couple of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.800
 things, things like dough conditioners and rennets that I'd like to just discuss with you. The dough

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.760
 conditioner, most people probably don't even know it exists in bread or if they do they haven't

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.480
 really thought too much about it. But would you say a little bit about the iodine bromate which is

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.840
 a fairly common additive to bread and what likely negative health effects it's going to have?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.680
 Well besides any changes that it makes to the proteins and starches which will make them more

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:09.600
 likely to be allergenic, any that gets into the system is going to be an anti-thyroid agent at

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.200
 least. Right, okay, yeah. So it's going to be thyroid suppressive in some respects. Okay,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.720
 and then things like the, I know cheeses, I know we've spent quite a bit of time researching

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.960
 cheeses, I know our family consumes lots of different cheeses and have leaned more towards

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.800
 the European cheeses because of their consistency and the type of manufacturing they go through is

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:46.240
 certainly less, I want to say harmful, but it's more of a traditional type of manufacturing for

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.240
 a food. I know in the states and it's not so much just the states but I know probably for the last

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:02.240
 15 years or so the genetically modified yeasts etc that have been used to culture cheese have

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.240
 been certainly very widespread and it's quite difficult these days to get a cheese that's not

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.720
 actually made using a genetically engineered yeast. What do you know about the genetically

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.040
 engineered yeasts and the trouble with them rather than using traditional rennet from...

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.080
 Well, I think the worst problem is that they are using things to carry the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:35.680
 microbial enzymes. There is always some debris from the aspergillus or whatever the microbe is

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:45.360
 they're using as a source of the enzymes and the genetic modification is going to make them

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.920
 somewhat different but they're already toxic and allergenic in themselves and so even if they're

00:04:51.920 --> 00:05:01.520
 perfectly normal naturally evolved organisms any debris from them that goes along with the enzyme

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:10.080
 is going to be very risky. But even worse than simply having microbial enzymes where there used

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:22.800
 to be animal enzymes to distribute and emulsify or mix the enzymes efficiently to make them store

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:32.080
 and package so they can be canned and then just dumped into the bat. They're using seaweed

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:42.720
 materials either carrageenan or other things that for example one of the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:52.240
 compounds that's being used to make microspheres to enclose the microbial enzymes one of these

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:02.720
 has been used to make dental mold for taking impressions of the mouth and making restorations.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:12.480
 One person died shortly after having some of that stuff put in his mouth and the students of

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.280
 dentistry a very high proportion of them had serious allergic reactions when they were practicing with

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:28.080
 them but these things are routinely being added to foods to carry other products and as a packaging

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.600
 or carrying material they don't show up on the labels at all. So I mean even on the labels for

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.240
 cheese if you go into the grocery store and look at the label for the cheese sometimes it just says

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.480
 rennet and that could mean animal rennet or it could mean vegetable rennet and the vegetable

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:50.320
 rennet never really comes from a vegetable source it's always either genetically modified or grown

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:56.880
 on a mold and that would be the microbial enzymes or it says non-animal rennet they have all these

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.360
 different types of course there's there are natural rennet available like fig juice and

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.920
 cardoon thistle but of course no companies use those anymore to manufacture so you're saying

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:13.360
 not only are these enzymes problematic but also the carriers that they that carry the enzymes so

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:23.600
 that it's easy and convenient for the cheese maker to make cheese. And they're being used as carriers

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:32.560
 for other foods I don't know how far it has gone but they're for the last 10 years it's

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.720
 increasingly common to use the seaweed materials which are potentially deadly.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:49.040
 One of the other most deadly allergens was sulfite that killed a few people eating

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:57.040
 restaurant salads or seafood that had been deodorized with it but it was even after

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:05.600
 that was recognized that it could be deadly when it was used on a salad it was still used in drugs

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:16.400
 sold for treating asthma patients for years and years. The product allupin a girl who had almost

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:23.760
 died in the hospital being treated with that once was about to be treated with it again the doctor

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:34.160
 wouldn't acknowledge that she had any validity and she grabbed the bottle and ran with her oxygen

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:43.760
 bottle and right on the bottle it said contains metabisulfite and I wrote to the FDA and the

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:50.320
 drug companies that made it and the Journal of the American Medical Association.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:57.200
 They all said yes it's a problem it can kill people but they went on selling it for years

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.400
 and didn't even publish warnings or extra labels that this might kill you.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:10.480
 Were they trying to cite the small numbers of people that might be killed as a reasonable

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:21.440
 cost? Yeah it killed mostly people who already had asthma. Right and who were already allergic

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.440
 to the sulfites right? Yeah. Now it's interesting you mentioned sulfites so thank you for mentioning

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:32.480
 that the wine and beer industry that's pretty much what keeps most wines stable or so they say

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.680
 stable I know that winemakers don't have to use sulfites I'm certainly not defending them but

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:45.920
 sulfites are prevalent as sodium metabisulfite as both as a cleaning agent and also as an agent to

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.560
 halt fermentation. I know in beer making I used to make quite a lot of beer when I was younger

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.800
 and I know that sodium metabisulfite tablets were a pretty common place in beer making.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:07.840
 And even organic fruits can be processed with the sulfur dioxide. Yeah yeah and that's another very

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:16.160
 interesting point the sulfur dioxide they use in dried fruit especially that's a fairly common

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.760
 ingredient isn't it? Yeah so what do you what do you what do you state as the kind of toxic side

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.560
 effects of sulfites apart from what you've already mentioned for the asthma patient? Oh I think that's

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:37.120
 the allergic reaction is really the only serious toxic effect. Okay. A person never knows when

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:43.680
 they're going to have an allergic reaction if if they just happen to have not eaten for

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:53.440
 an extra long time or if their thyroid happens to have fallen there can be a sudden increase in

00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:01.520
 allergic sensitivity because the blood sugar very very powerfully controls the release of histamine

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:10.400
 and other agents. In the absence in low blood sugar situations is that the case? Yeah and in

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:18.640
 experiments they found that the mildest allergen would kill animals with shock if their blood sugar

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:26.240
 was lowered to 50 percent of normal. Wow so this would be another good reason to defend the

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:33.360
 consumption of sugar it's always been such a maligned substance you know sugar free. If they

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:41.200
 doubled the blood sugar of the animals even the deadly allergen would only cause a slight

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.600
 reddening of their nose and sniffles. So that's the motto eat frequently throughout the day right?

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:57.200
 Yeah eating frequently avoids several stress reactions including fluctuations in blood sugar.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.720
 Now I know there are people listening who are going to be still stuck on the mantra or the

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.960
 doctrine if you like and that's the thing that I want to open up in a few short moments about

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.000
 cancer but that we're all led to believe that sugar is bad for you you'll get diabetes if you

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.200
 eat too much sugar. How do you defend that Dr. Peat and support sugar's role in the healthy organism?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:31.120
 A lot of people cite Otto Warburg's work in the 1920s in which he showed that cancer cells

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:40.800
 can't use oxygen efficiently and so they use sugar at an extremely high rate. Right. And so

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:48.880
 people are now saying if cancer cells can only live on sugar then you shouldn't eat sugar but

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:58.400
 that just isn't an argument because the body when you have even a small tumor the body senses

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:09.600
 danger and increases its production of cortisol. One of the very early events in cancer is a

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:17.200
 chronic elevation of cortisol and the cortisol turns your tissues to sugar and so if you don't

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.280
 eat sugar your body wastes away faster. Right that's the cachexia associated with that.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.880
 And that the wasting away of your immune system and other tissues is really what

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.760
 kills most people from the cancer. Okay. And so there have been experiments in which

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:47.760
 very high concentrations of glucose were put in for example if there was a tumor in an extremity

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:56.880
 where they could isolate that circulation and put a high concentration like a glucose syrup

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.920
 into the artery feeding the leg the sugar itself would cause the cancer to die.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:14.400
 And so it not only spares your immune system and brain and other tissues but if it can be

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:21.120
 delivered long enough at a high enough concentration it allows something to happen

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:28.640
 in the cancer that can kill the cancer. Wow okay so let's just go straight into the

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:38.960
 topic of the science and the kind of dogma surrounding current cancer theory and the

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:46.320
 fairly new or even in the in cases of older papers the kind of rediscovered papers written

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:52.160
 some time ago that are kind of largely ignored and not part of mainstream

00:14:52.160 --> 00:15:00.720
 understanding and some of those theories about cancer in the new stem cell research that's being

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:08.800
 done. How do you see the cancer cells arising because we've always been traditionally

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:16.880
 told or taught at least that cancer cells are outside of the body's general control

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:23.200
 and we all led to believe that this apoptosis or cell program death exists and it's part of a

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:31.040
 genetic code in each cell only has so many so many times that it can reproduce and then it's

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:40.080
 automatically turned off and but cancer cells don't acknowledge that they don't. Yeah everything

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:50.400
 is wrong with that belief going back to the middle of the 19th century people were seeing that cancer

00:15:50.400 --> 00:16:02.640
 arises in a field they called it the cancer field of visibly abnormal cells and after this basically

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:11.840
 inflamed area had persisted for a long time mutant cells might appear somewhere in it but

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:20.880
 that is something that is it has been developed progressively over 150 years that there is such

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:30.000
 a thing as a cancer field and anything irritating or destructive that the body can't overcome

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:40.560
 will cause a progressive stressing or inflammation of the tissue and you can develop a cancer

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:49.280
 before there is any mutation identifiable. Harry Rubin at Berkeley is really the only

00:16:49.280 --> 00:17:00.320
 official academic biologist who has worked on that topic and he has shown that there definitely is

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:10.240
 a pre-mutational definitive cancer condition and in the cancer then in the tissue as a whole is so

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:19.840
 unhealthy that mutations among other changes occur in the DNA but the DNA event really is

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.520
 down the road from what is causing the cancer. Okay so you're suggesting that there's there's

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.040
 such an injury or a chronic inflammation to a certain tissue and eventually that's what causes

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:41.360
 a cancer? Yeah and when you look at the actual functioning of a tumor which it produces cells

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:50.080
 that look funny have three-cornered cell divisions and a very bizarre behavior and

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:59.280
 genetic changes in the DNA. These cells are very very sick cells that don't have a long lifespan

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:09.120
 there when you see them in a biopsy cross-section what you're seeing as cancer cells are very

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:16.960
 mortal cells that probably will die in the next couple of divisions and the the doctrine that

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:24.800
 that cancer cells are immortal and body cells are mortal it's completely backwards.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:33.040
 The Hayflick doctrine was really invented that cells can only divide 50 times.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:43.360
 It was really invented to reinforce this DNA-centric view of biology and in fact

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:52.640
 the stem cell work has definitively shown that all cells seem to be

00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:05.440
 basically stem cells and immortal given the right circumstances and when the the cancer

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:13.760
 industry is now forced to think about the idea of stem cells but when they talk about a cancer

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:21.520
 stem cell basically they are just going back to the old concept of a mutant cell and the clone of

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:33.120
 a mutant cell they totally miss the point of of the stem cell research which is that the stem cells

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:45.680
 are normal cells which are able to regenerate any tissue that needs help and the function of the

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:54.000
 tumor is some kind of a process of healing and regeneration that can't come to completion

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:03.040
 something is missing that would allow a tumor to let the the sick cells die while the

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:14.880
 the healthy cells return to normal functioning. Studies of x-ray treated tumors found that

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:23.280
 in fact the x-ray had accelerated the death of all of the original tumor cells but it

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:31.680
 actually accelerated the ability of the tumor to call for help and recruit stem cells from the

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:39.600
 bloodstream or from adjacent tissues and so the same signals that are sent out causing

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:50.320
 a region of inflammation to progressively become more active metabolically these signals are

00:20:50.320 --> 00:21:01.040
 calling for assistance and replacement cells so when a tumor is irradiated it increases its ability

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:09.680
 to call for help and so the reason the tumor keeps growing even after everything is killed with

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:18.960
 radiation is that you have increased the injury and made it able to recruit more stem cells

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:25.120
 and then grow into more cancer yeah because something is still missing in the organism

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:32.320
 which could allow a proper completion of the healing process. How do you see metastases

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.560
 in the light of the cancer being a recruitment of stem cells to that local site? Way back in the

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:50.960
 30s 40s and 50s tests were made on prison inmates and foreigners implanting pieces of cancer in them

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:59.280
 either with or without their permission and it was over and over found that people who had the cancer

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:08.240
 would accept a transplant and people who were healthy didn't suffer any consequences from

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:16.480
 having a bit of a cancer injected into them and the bulk of the research with

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:27.760
 putting human cancers into animals are done in the nude mouse which happens to be a mutant that

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:38.560
 not only lacks hair but it lacks the sinus glands. Okay and this is a b-cell so the transplantation

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:47.600
 or the metastasis which is simply a self-induced transplantation this involves

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.400
 a defect in the whole organism that makes it susceptible to receiving a transplant.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.480
 Right because it shouldn't be receiving the transplant in the first place.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:06.480
 I didn't hear that. Basically the body should be rejecting the yeah yeah normally the cancer

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:15.040
 transplant. It's constantly rejecting uh cells that go astray and if if the cell isn't appropriate

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:21.920
 for that organ or tissue it can't live in that environment and so dies. But the animals that

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:27.680
 could accept the cancer transplants were obviously so unhealthy that their bodies didn't reject

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.920
 the tissue is that what you're trying to say? Yeah they can't even grow hair.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.160
 So they're already a deformed organism. I want to go back to what you said about radiation Dr. Peat

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:44.880
 is that why radiation is used in the cancer industry is because it does kill some tumor

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:52.640
 cells? Oh yeah it'll it'll stop the um the cells that are irradiated um it stops them right in

00:23:52.640 --> 00:24:02.320
 their tracks uh healthy or sick especially uh the uh the sick cells were going to die anyway but

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:10.640
 it'll stop the growth of healthy tissue and cause it to produce uh first it releases histamine

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:20.960
 and serotonin and uh tryptase enzymes that cause inflammation and and degeneration locally. That's

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:28.080
 within 30 minutes of getting irradiated there's a burst of these allergens uh reactive substances

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:40.160
 and then that leads to a chronic overproduction of collagen and the growth of uh repair cells

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:48.320
 fibroblasts. So first it's inflammation then fibrosis. Now the body's trying to heal the

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:57.760
 inflammation or take care of it. And if the body can't uh heal this scarred atrophied tissue then

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:07.840
 the cells can uh if they recruit cells that try to repair it and so it'll keep

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:16.640
 becoming a a risk of future cancers just as part of the attempt to repair a sick tissue.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.400
 So that's why while some people might have radiation for their cancer it's very uh often

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.080
 that the cancer returns is because it didn't take care of the underlying problem in the first place.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:36.400
 Yeah. Okay you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Galbafil 91.1 FM and from 7 30

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.840
 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions either

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:45.360
 related or unrelated to this month's topic of current cancer research and old theory.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.040
 My name is Andrew Murray. My name is Sarah Johannison Murray. And we're joined by guest

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.000
 speaker Dr. Raymond Peat endocrinologist biochemist and physiologist. The number here if you live in

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.960
 the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area the toll-free number is 1-800-568-3723.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.880
 How about the uh is the current theory in place that cancer cells have slightly different surface

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:18.160
 markers on their cell membranes? The MHCs that are normally associated with body cells

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:24.880
 being different in cancer cells is that immunology still current or? Oh um yeah they're

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:34.480
 they're degenerating and so they can go off in many directions and so they can be killed very

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:44.400
 easily because they're recognized as abnormal material. Okay. And the normal function of what's

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:55.600
 called the immune system is to maintain the proper development and form of the body and

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:07.760
 the phagocytosis of sick or injured tissue is really at the center of the immune system and

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:17.600
 germs don't necessarily trigger the immune system unless they damage something. As soon as they

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:25.440
 damage something then the immune system tries to take care of it cleaning up what damage has been

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:35.520
 done and in the process they'll clear out the bacteria or viruses. But really in the development

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:46.560
 of the organism the immune system is really part of our developmental nutritional control systems.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:55.360
 Okay um I know we mentioned at the beginning of this discussion about constant irritation and I

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.840
 know um when I was studying the this constant irritation and specifically something that most

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:09.120
 people can understand is constant irritation uh smoking and how smoking ultimately in a lot of

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.640
 people would lead to lung cancer and so that constant irritation of the tobacco smoke those

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.960
 particles in the lung tissue uh caused this change in the cell and that was the that was the beginning

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:30.720
 of lung cancer. How the higher a cell's energy capacity is the more it takes to irritate it.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:38.640
 Okay. And so keeping your cellular energy at a maximum means that you're pretty immune to

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:47.280
 irritation but if if something impairs your energy production then almost anything becomes irritating.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.440
 So that's what you see commonly in low thyroid diseases the energy production of the cell is

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.640
 very decreased very much decreased and then you can have allergic reactions or cancer come

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:08.960
 start up. And in cigarette smoke there are not only uh the uh irritants and um the

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:17.280
 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the famous carcinogens but they are also estrogens and

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:28.960
 irritants are causing pain and inflammation and estrogen-like changes and uh behind those irritants

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:36.800
 there's the carbon monoxide which blocks oxygen use and so makes the cell spontaneously

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.640
 more susceptible to over stimulation or irritation.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:54.160
 And when you add up uh different types of stimulation and uh impairment of energy production

00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:02.640
 then you have a greater risk of chronic inflammation and cancer. And besides those

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:10.400
 hydrocarbons that you say are estrogenic those suppress the thyroid as well. Yeah um the um

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:20.480
 alternative for really it used to be the main line cancer research was really at the point of

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:27.360
 understanding uh how cancer development works uh the work of the Pullman's

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:35.600
 in the 1940s and 50s was uh showing that it's the electronic behavior of these

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:44.160
 aromatic hydrocarbons that uh act as signals to the cells in the same way that estrogen

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:56.400
 substances signal the cells. And uh the um various uh drug interests and government interests uh

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:05.200
 diverted that line of research by not financing it anymore and instead they finance the um molecular

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:14.400
 biology approach which is uh explaining away those hormonal actions of the aromatic hydrocarbons

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:23.440
 as nothing but a type of mutation. They they happen to fit into the DNA very compactly

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:33.440
 and uh do mutate it but really their main uh mechanism for mutating the DNA is by acting

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:38.640
 as hormones that uh deplete the energy of the cell while over exciting it.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.920
 Okay so I think most people listening to the show this evening could understand the truth

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:54.720
 behind the statement that a energetic active organism is more able to defend itself against

00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:03.760
 external uh threats and external uh breakdown but the weak de-energized organism is more easily

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:12.240
 overcome. How does how does a human being energize itself in terms of uh improving its ATP production

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:21.040
 and being more uh yeah more energetic? First you need all of the essential vitamins and minerals

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:30.800
 and adequate amino acids and proteins of the right sorts but sugar is very essential for uh

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:37.680
 keeping your thyroid functioning up without resorting to a cortisone overproduction. Right.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:49.680
 And uh the essential nutrients if you're getting enough sugar uh will allow your your thyroid to

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:57.360
 function unless the thyroid is specifically signaled to turn off by such things as polyunsaturated

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:06.880
 fatty acids and estrogens which are very systematically involved in turning down your

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:18.560
 metabolism. Once that weakening process starts from such things as smoke and

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:29.280
 hormone imitating toxins then the bacteria in your intestines will produce toxins that you absorb

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:37.280
 when your intestine is de-energized it becomes permeable and anything in the intestine then can

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:45.840
 leak right into the bloodstream. So if you're exhausted you might get flu-like symptoms.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:55.200
 If your thyroid is being poisoned flu-like symptoms will often make you ache all over and

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:06.400
 feel exhausted and so on. So the intestine is always available as a sort of a third level

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:15.600
 of toxicity and and energy poisoning. Okay so you would avoid things like polyunsaturates you would

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:22.400
 improve your thyroid function. Um polyunsaturated let's just uh specify the polyunsaturated fatty

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:32.000
 acids are vegetable oils corn soy canola cotton seed sesame seed oil all those vegetable oils

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.600
 that are in common use in restaurants. In the 1980s the French did a great series of experiments

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:48.320
 showing that every stage of the thyroid hormone production and response and transport every stage

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:55.840
 was blocked in proportion to the number of double bonds in the unsaturated fat. So

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:04.080
 the monounsaturated were slightly inhibiting compared to the saturated fats or sugars. The

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:14.240
 two bonded uh two double bonds like linoleic acid were much more inhibiting and the triply

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:23.760
 or quadruply unsaturated fat such as the popular fish oils and omega minus three

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:31.520
 fats these are the most inhibiting to the the whole energy system. So the bottom line there is

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:40.560
 eat coconut oil and butter and avoid all other oils olive oil in moderation. Yeah and sugar is

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:48.720
 really the basic protection against the toxicity of the oils. So keep your blood sugar up with

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:55.040
 frequent meals and lots of fresh fruit. Lots of fruits yeah. Lots of fruit is the best sugar.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.720
 Perfect I think we've got a caller on the line so let's take the call. Caller you're on the air.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.640
 [Phone rings]

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:09.120
 Hello caller. Oh we had a caller anyway all right well until the caller comes back or we get another

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.200
 another caller. I think the phones I can see the lights flashing and the phones are going so until

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:20.720
 we get the oh you're on the air again. Hello. Well that's not done either. Well I know they're coming

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.400
 in because the lights are flashing but for some reason they're not uh they're not coming through.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:34.000
 Anyway so I think to get back to the the cancer issue and what's what's not being done in terms

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.200
 of what's being done wrong in terms of most people's treatment for cancer and the pretty poor

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:47.760
 success rate. Almost universally doctors want to kill cancer cells but the cancer cells

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:58.320
 just want to die. They're very weak cells and you damage the organism when you concentrate on

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:07.920
 killing the cancer cells. Right. And since the total death rate from cancer has simply steadily

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:14.720
 increased. Right. The only way they can claim they're making progress is by diagnosing cancer

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:24.800
 more often. If you look in enough tissues and organs by the time a person is 50 you can find

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:34.560
 at least one cancer and so if you diagnose really hard you can have about a an 80 or 90 percent cure

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:40.720
 rate without actually curing anyone. I think the caller that we had Dr. Peat has come back on so

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:45.840
 we'll carry on this conversation once we've had the caller. You're on the air? Hello. Hello you're

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.920
 on the air. Yeah hello. Yes. Is that me? It is. Okay um I wanted to ask some questions about sugar

00:37:51.920 --> 00:38:00.320
 to clarify. You sound like uh the impression I'm getting is like oh sugar's okay go for it

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:11.840
 you need sugar. Now um as far as I know sugar especially refined white sugar is addicting.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:18.240
 It's it's more of a drug than a food. Most people's obesity can be traced to their addiction to sugar

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:27.440
 and most diabetes can be traced to an overuse of sugar which overuses the insulin to where the

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:33.040
 insulin production the pancreas wears out and can't produce enough insulin to keep up with the

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:43.600
 sugar and then a person has to go on artificial insulin just to live. Now I assume fruit sugar

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:48.960
 and if you're just eating fruit that that's okay but can you clarify the difference between eating

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:56.960
 fruit sugar and an apple or an orange or eating you know candy and cookies with white sugar and

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:01.120
 refined white flour? I mean that can't be good for your body. Could you address that please?

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:10.400
 Um starches and proteins really are very powerful stimulants to insulin and the combination of

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:17.280
 starch and polyunsaturated fats will cause the greatest disturbance of blood sugar much more

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:28.400
 than eating white sugar candy and such. The polyunsaturated fat block the ability to use sugar

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:39.280
 and so the cells experience a sugar deficiency and turn on stress reactions and the starches

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:46.960
 are pure glucose rather than 50/50 fructose and glucose and so starches are much more powerful

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:55.600
 stimulants to insulin and the stress reactions. So um just to kind of clarify that a little bit

00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:02.000
 here for our listeners Dr. Peat you're saying that starches well I know they have a glycemic index of

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 around 140 or 138 and that includes bread, pasta, chips, cookies, cakes, all those foods that are

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.360
 starchy carbohydrates rather than actually the sugar in them well that adds to it but the starches

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.400
 themselves have a much higher glycemic index so they will cause your pancreas to have to

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:27.200
 secrete a lot more insulin. Now white sugar has a glycemic index of around 99 and whilst organic

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:36.080
 raw honey is one of the best sweeteners there is, fruit sugars, honey has a lot more fructose

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:41.200
 than sucrose so honey even has a lower glycemic index than white sugar and fruits have a glycemic

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:50.480
 index of around 75. The potassium content of fruit is really what keeps the insulin much much lower.

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:59.280
 If you eat a piece of bread you are getting very little potassium but if you eat a piece of fruit

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:07.040
 with the same amount of sugar the potassium will pretty much take care of the insulin issue it acts

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:15.360
 like insulin and so when you eat a piece of fruit you're having very little stimulation to your

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:23.840
 fat production. And the other thing too that I've found out is that white sugar actually because

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:30.240
 it's been filtered is much less allergenic to the organism than the raw brown sugar the

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:38.480
 rapadura sugar. Dr. Peat can you comment on that point? Yeah the manufacture of brown sugar

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:49.600
 when you centrifuge it the first wash is blackstrap molasses and I've noticed that

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:58.320
 there's usually a very smoky taste in the blackstrap and it has been a common practice

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:06.640
 to burn the cane fields to make it easier to harvest and so some of the brown stuff is

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:17.440
 smoke and the rest of it if you just boil sugar even white pure sugar if you boil it at a very

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:24.880
 high temperature driving off the water so the temperature rises above 100 degrees Celsius

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:35.680
 any impurities in it will start causing polymerization reactions and create allergens

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:45.040
 from the sugar itself and so the brown material containing a lot of biological materials other

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:51.760
 than sugar heating that with the sugar can make some pretty intense allergens.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.360
 So to summarize all that the best source of sugar in your opinion than Dr. Peat is fruit

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:08.240
 soft ripe fresh fruit and milk sugar and then so that's number one number two would be raw honey

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:14.480
 and then if you had to eat sugar then it would be white sugar rather than brown correct? Yeah.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:19.760
 And then the starches are the least preferable form to get your sugar in because they

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.760
 have very little minerals to balance the high spike of glucose that's released and the high

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:34.640
 glycemic index they have even in whole grains. Yeah and that stimulation of insulin always leads

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:43.840
 to a surge of cortisol which tends to destroy the protein in your tissues to keep your sugar

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:52.160
 up against the effect of insulin and so eating even too much protein at a time without fruit

00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:02.560
 will waste a lot of protein. I've seen people who are eating more than two pounds of meat a day

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:11.600
 who were having signs of protein deficiency with super amounts of cortisol being produced

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:19.360
 and tremendous amounts of amino acids in their urine. Wow waste. So not only do these starches

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:24.560
 so it's you know it's yes it's a well-known fact that cakes and cookies cause problems and

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.680
 diabetes but it's not as well as the oils that are put in the cakes and the cookies the vegetable

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:36.480
 oils but it also can be too much protein not balanced by enough sugars can lead to the same

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:45.520
 situation. Okay I think there's another caller so caller you're on the air hello. Hello yeah you're

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:52.080
 on the air. Okay I just had a quick one question and one thing I wanted to thank Dr. Peat because

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.920
 I heard him on another radio station and I cut out everything but butter and it gave me a lot

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:06.240
 more energy. I stopped using vegetable oils entirely so thank you for that and what I wanted

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:14.160
 to ask you was I was told that if I follow acid that would help depression and not sure why could

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:24.880
 you explain that or is that wrong? What kind of acid? Folic acid. Oh well fruits are very good

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:33.680
 sources of folic acid. I don't know of any special function it has in digestion but it

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:39.440
 it the right amount of it is very protective. Oh not digestion depression.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.240
 Did you say depression? Yeah. Yeah okay so that thing the lady was talking about. Oh depression

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:56.400
 yeah oh yeah it's needed to make the transmitter substances nerve transmitter and. Oh okay

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.440
 all right so eat your fruit for any depressant activity.

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:08.080
 Okay thank you. Thank you for your call. I think we're getting a little bit of disturbance on the

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:12.480
 air on the phones. It's a bit unfortunate I'm likely hearing some very strange alien type sounds

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.320
 but that's probably some of the reason for. Hopefully it's only us that's hearing it. Yeah

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:22.800
 well I'm not sure if it goes out on the air or not. Okay so yeah it's 7 48 and we are very pleased

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:30.000
 to have Dr. Raymond Peat on the show and we were talking about cancer in terms of the most current

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.760
 theories and old theories and the best ways of treating the organism so far that we've got out

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:45.520
 of this is that the organism's energy the amount of spare energy the organism has the greater the

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:52.400
 amount the better able to defend the organism against insults etc and and disease in general

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:58.160
 so what what's being done currently that you're excited about in terms of cancer treatment Dr.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:06.640
 Peat? Oh more and more people are recognizing the importance of aspirin and stopping inflammation

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:18.000
 and that is not always interpreted appropriately but as we age we accumulate more and more of the

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.960
 polyunfaturated fats in our tissues and under stress we have those circulating in the blood

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:36.560
 and that means that they are available more and more chronically to produce the inflammatory

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:47.120
 prostaglandins and so aspirin is in a way an anti-aging defense against a lifetime of

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:56.720
 of accumulating polyunsaturated fat and it's now known that it prevents essentially all kinds of

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:04.480
 cancer to some degree of use it chronically but it's now being used therapeutically

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:13.760
 backing up other more conventional or toxic treatments but it's a very safe treatment and

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:23.520
 its use is increasing. Aspirin's been around for a long time but you know originally they

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:29.600
 derived the cetosalicylic acid from or precursors to that compound from white willow bark and meadow

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:37.600
 sweet and other herbs so it's a very very ancient remedy. How many aspirins or how much aspirin would

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.560
 you suggest Dr. Peat because I know some people out there and undoubtedly will be talking about

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:49.280
 gastric ulcers and bleeding and you know how bad aspirin is for you. So yes the aspirin should be

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:59.520
 backed up with always with plenty of vitamin k and not the synthetic k but natural k1 and k2

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:11.680
 and vitamin k happens to be structurally extremely similar to a tropical botanical

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:22.240
 drug called lopacho or lopachoin and that has been used for generations with lots of success

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:31.120
 for treating cancer and it's analogous to several other drugs that have a good history of treating

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:40.320
 cancer. Imodin from aloe and cascara is structurally analogous to vitamin k and

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:53.440
 and tetracycline the microbial antibiotic is it has considerable anti-cancer action but it

00:49:53.440 --> 00:50:02.000
 doesn't kill the cancer cells necessarily it protects the organism the same way cascara

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.120
 does to protect the mitochondria from being poisoned. Okay I think we've actually got one

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.960
 or two more callers on the line so let's let's take the next caller. Hi I almost hate to call

00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.920
 in and interrupt but I have so much gratitude for these programs thank you. You're very welcome.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:26.720
 Thank you for your call. Oh it's immensely informative I'm in really great health luckily

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:35.120
 I just follow the herbs and good food and what do you have any feelings about quercetin

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:42.160
 and staying healthy or? Okay Dr. Peat would you do you have much to say about quercetin?

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:50.960
 What was the word? The quercetin. Quercetin. Yeah. Oh well you get similar things in fruits in the

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:59.360
 safest way I think. Okay. Oranges have some substances that are even safer and better than

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:07.280
 quercetin. Norenginon for example that's my favorite thing in that category. And also nettle

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.680
 leaf not only is it high in vitamin k I always like to go on about nettles it's very high in

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:19.120
 vitamin k but it also has quercetin as well as lots of minerals and anahistamine function well

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:25.040
 the quercetin is part of anahistamine function. Okay I think there's another caller caller

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.240
 and we'll take this next call of Dr. Peat and I think this might be hello hello you're on the air.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:36.640
 Yes now I have I had two things and now when you mentioned the nettles that I thought of another

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:44.560
 but I guess there's very little time so with you're using white willow bark in mediherb what

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:52.080
 would be maybe an average amount for what Dr. Peat is recommending like one tablet? Well yeah the

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.400
 mediherb tablets I think you'd probably need to be using I mean if you're talking about just an

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:01.360
 anti-inflammatory effect daily probably about one tablet daily maybe split up into a couple doses

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:06.640
 but if you're talking about an anti-cancer dose it'd probably be more like nine tablets a day.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.560
 Okay well I think people might like to know that there's something besides like a Bayer

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:16.400
 aspirin which companies don't want to use that company or corporate company that there isn't

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:24.320
 some alternative. Yes and there is white willow bark this see white willow bark itself is so

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:30.560
 you have to take so much of it so if you make a tea you have to drink a lot of tea that's why

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:35.680
 when it's standardized and concentrated it's more effective and it is a problem with the aspirins

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.840
 they have starches and other odd weird ingredients in them that the one brand that doesn't have as

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.320
 many terrible ingredients is the western family brand if you were looking for aspirin otherwise

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:51.440
 for white willow bark we have a standardized white willow bark powder that is standardized

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.600
 it contains certain amount of salicylic acid and the therapeutic dose is much easier a couple

00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:00.880
 capsules a day rather than gallons of white willow bark tea but did you have another question? Yes I

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:07.120
 wanted to ask the audience that there's somebody who has an abundance of deer ewe that I would

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:17.600
 like to trade for a plant and my number is 923-5142 this is Corinne and the alien sounds are coming

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.400
 from the radio. Yeah I thought I heard those too your number again? I'll repeat Corinne's number

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:31.040
 is 907-926-5142 and she's looking for some fever food plants if anyone has some fever extra fever

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.720
 food plant she wants to trade. Good okay. Thank you for your call Corinne. Yeah I don't know what's

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.600
 up with all the echo tonight I'm not sure it's all coming from the the calls from the phones but I

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.680
 don't know why. Well we won't say it's anything to do with any kind of government control or

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:50.880
 anything like that it's just the way it is. Okay because I know there's a plenty of controversy

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:56.800
 surrounding some of the topics that we cover I know people certainly like to hear it. I want

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.560
 to ask Dr. Peat one more question tonight and that is what do you think of the American Cancer

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:13.440
 Society and the whole cancer treatment in this day and age? Oh I haven't been following it recently

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:21.920
 but I've checked in on them over the last several decades and I see a lot of fraud.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:35.360
 One lecture tour sponsored by them was to show that they had cured lung cancer and leukemia

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:43.840
 and this famous biologist from University of California was using phony statistics to make

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:49.760
 it look like the American Cancer Society was responsible for the disappearance of both

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:59.280
 leukemia and lung cancer and the figures simply didn't show it for lung cancer if you use the

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:08.880
 right kind of statistics and the ending of atomic bomb testing accounted for the drop in childhood

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:18.720
 leukemia. But they do propagandistic things pretty habitually I think. So why there seems to be I

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:24.480
 mean a lot of the research you send me is a lot of scientists around this country and around the

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:32.320
 world doing research on anti-cancer substances but yet it seems it never reaches the hospitals

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.960
 and where people are actually getting treated for cancer so why is that Dr. Peat? Well the drug

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:45.760
 companies really went a good drug for them is something that you pay all your money for and

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:52.880
 keep taking as long as you're alive and they don't want people getting cured with something like

00:55:52.880 --> 00:56:04.560
 aspirin and fruit juice. Or powderco and cascara. Okay all right well I know it's getting pretty

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:12.080
 twitchy there in the control room and it's 7.58 so we've got two more minutes but hey we need to

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:17.040
 think about wrapping up for this evening. Well thank you very much again for joining us Dr. Peat.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.400
 Thank you. Okay so for those people who've listened to our show thank you very much for

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:29.360
 all the feedback and your comments much appreciated. Dr. Ray Peat can be contacted via his website on

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.600
 very much for listening and thank you very much for joining our show Dr. Peat. Okay and I think

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:58.240
 we'll just break the end of the show by saying the truth is out there for those people who want to

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:05.360
 hear the truth stand up look around open your ears and the truth is out there so whilst a lie

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:10.240
 and this is one of Dr. Raymond Peat's quotes on his newsletters whilst and I think I can get this

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:16.000
 kind of right whilst a lie spreads around the world truth is just putting her boots on so

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.920
 think about that folks this truth is not going to be easy to find but it's out there.
