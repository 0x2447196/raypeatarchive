00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Ab Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to late p.m.,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 my wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Ab Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of field biology.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And we can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or further information at the end of the show and Monday through Friday after business.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I think as always, for people who perhaps have never listened to you or never heard you or this is the first time,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 would you just outline your academic and professional background and then we'll start with the show.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 I was a biology teacher before I studied biology professionally, actually about 10 years before.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 And during those years before I went to graduate school in biology, I had taught English and other subjects,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 but I had done a lot of experimenting in, for example, bioelectric subjects.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And that relates to the topic of biological fields. That had been a long-time interest of mine.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Good. Okay, well, I guess I kind of want to pick out a little bit of a loose end from last month.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 And I know antioxidants were a subject that we covered.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 So with antioxidants in mind, I think it's very important that our listeners clearly understand what they've been led to believe by

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 nutraceutical companies, et cetera, as beneficial nutrients may in fact not be so and that they should be treated with caution

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 with reference to their action of blocking a certain antioxidant, reactive oxygen species in the body.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 For example, ascorbic acid functions primarily, I think, in the cell as an oxidant, maintaining cell structure

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 and regulating synthetic processes largely by its oxidative form, dehydroascorbic acid.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 And so you don't want an excess of the reduced form.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 And vitamin E had a history really starting as an anti-estrogen regulator of the sex hormones.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And after it was discovered that the unsaturated fatty acids were causing sexual derangement,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 sterility, especially in males and brain decomposition, then was when vitamin E shifted over to be described as an

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 antioxidant rather than as an anti-estrogen.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 And still it's gradually being recognized as an anti-inflammatory agent,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 but it's still stuck in that mold of being called an antioxidant.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Okay, so with reference to cancer and the kind of new understanding we'll get into a little bit later on in terms of

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 field biology and how cells are actually intelligent and they do communicate and they're not just a product of the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 organism, but they drive the organism.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 In terms of cancer and antioxidants, I think in particular in relation to suppressing reactive oxygen species as an

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 antioxidant, do you know what the rationale is behind that?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 Yeah, they're thinking that -- there are several interpretations, but one group thinks that if you intensify the

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 reactive oxygen species, you'll be able to kill the cancer cells because they are defending themselves by their excess

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 antioxidant capacity.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 But others recognize that it's the reactive oxygen species that are causing the de-differentiation and aggressive

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 destructive processes in the cancer cells.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 So reducing the formation of them metabolically is the safe biological organized way to go about preventing cancer

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 and preventing it really is part of curing the disease.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 Some people have said that you can never tell when a cancer is malignant until the patient is dead because the

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 organism always has the capacity for spontaneous recovery from any kind of tumor.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 It's very -- most often seen in melanomas because you can clip off a few bits of the tumor and see that it is

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 definitely cancerous, but there's spontaneous regression seen so often in melanomas simply because they're near

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 the surface and visible.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 I think that spontaneous regression is probably going on all the time with many kinds of cancer.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Yeah.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Am I right in thinking that you don't particularly advocate topical treatment of melanomas, for example, as a --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Definitely not because so many things will disturb your defensive reactions against them and just annoy them and

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 make them try to survive more intensely rather than more intelligently.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Interestingly, I come into contact just here and there are several people who have had and/or have skin cancers,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 various aberrant moles or darkened patches that are very regular borders and they've been told it's cancer.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 I'm only asking you the question about your view on topical treatment of these kind of tumors because blood root is

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 a very commonly touted treatment for these tumors and I've met people who have showed me patches on their arms or

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 their legs that they've used blood root with and there's a site that -- it obviously looks a little scarred,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 but there's no presence of what was previously a kind of discolored mole and how do you --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 What are the active chemicals in that?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Well, it's sanguinaria canadensis is the Latin name, so I'm sure sanguinarine and probably hydrastine or some

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 other alkaloids are the major, but it also contains tannins, so I know tannins have also traditionally been used

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 for skin tumors.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 One of the old things that derive partly from herbal knowledge going back to the turn of the -- the start of the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 20th century was thinking of the molecular structure of these things as catalysts of energy production.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 William Frederick Koch was one that first proposed this and it was developed later by Albert St.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 Georgi and particular molecules were explored by each of them and what they had in common was the activated ketone

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 structure, activated carbonyl group and opposed by, for example, activated amine groups or hydroxyl groups such

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 as estrogen is in that general irritating category and there are a lot of the tannin category of chemicals that

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 unbalance or in their most relevant part of the molecule have this oxidative catalytic function that can restore

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 the oxygen production of energy.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 Interesting, because I know that sanguinaria does have very intense red and I know in the past we've talked about

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 intense red dyes or herbs or compounds that have this kind of free radical quenching activity.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Yeah, that means they're absorbing energy particles.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Okay, but as far as you're concerned you still don't advocate any topical use?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 No, I think systemic is better because everything contains impurities and just a little bit of the wrong impurity can

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 irritate and possibly direct the cells in the wrong direction, but I haven't experimented at all with any of those

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 older traditional things, but I did experiment on my own things. A couple of doctors at different times were

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 convinced that I had things that were melanomas from their shape and behavior and probably a total of 15 or 20

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 times all together I've had things popping up that were black and blue and growing quickly and changing shape

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 and just by increasing my thyroid systemically and putting some DHEA and/or progesterone on the skin

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 adjacent to maybe an inch away from the developing spot.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 Within two or three days you would see very intense changes happening and for example the color would change from

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 blue and white to maybe an even brown color and then simply the whole thing would melt away.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 So it's kind of like giving the cells what they need to differentiate properly, otherwise they go off exploring

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 what they want to be to deal with the deficiency that they have and I think the particular areas they choose

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 seem to be areas that the body is able to provide something that sustains their growth and if you can let the body

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 provide more of that, increasing its energy, then those cells can go ahead and differentiate.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 The reducing or antioxidant direction of a cell is interfering with differentiation.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 There are several chemicals known as differentiating agents that some doctors are treating cancer with

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 and what they have in common is a shift towards the oxidative balance of the cell.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Okay, I guess lastly I just wanted to say that I think from a scientific, if that's the right word, perspective,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 irritation has always been known to be cancer causing and any cell gets chronically irritated

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 and I think that's probably where your hesitancy with topically addressing anything like that comes from.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Yeah, although I know there have been very successful things.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 I've seen people with pink spots on their skin where they previously had had a very aggressive tumor.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 I know an old woman who I saw when she was I think 91, 92, and 93 and in between my visits I saw what had been a mole

00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 on the side of her forehead evolve into a hole where the bridge of her nose was eaten away by the melanoma.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 The next visit there was nothing wrong with her nose, the nose had grown back.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Wow, wow.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Gallivoo 91.1 FM

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 and from 7.30 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions related

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 or unrelated to this month's subject of field theory.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 We're very fortunate to have Dr. Raymond Peat sharing his experience and his wisdom

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 with his latest findings on field theory and we'll get into that in a moment.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 So Dr. Peat, physiology is clearly a subject where nothing is isolated or reduced per se,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 but one where there's clearly an association with a world of interacting mechanisms,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 albeit the assumption of one molecule being the prime mover of a direction of shears can be misunderstood

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 and knowledge can move along blind pathways.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 And last month you touched on James Watson as an example of an extreme reductionist

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 who is now tending to be a little more open-minded in his understanding of biological interactions to some degree.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 How is science to be moved in the right direction and allow a paradigm shift in our understanding of disease,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 for example, to proceed along constructive and regenerative processes?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Well, those people who were insisting on a kind of straight line causality,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Gregor Mendel, for example, wanted traits to be eternal rather than occasional or accidental or changing.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And so he did these experiments to show that even though the pea plants were changing,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 they had traits which were eternal.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And that got adopted by the gene people at the beginning of this century

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 and that led to people like Watson identifying this eternal gene,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 except with the qualification that although it's like Mendel's eternal gene,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 it can be changed but only by chance, not by anything intentionally useful to the individual organism.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 And at the same time that was going on, other people were showing evidence that the whole organism is influencing

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 what happens to those traits, that the traits actually can be blended and changed

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 rather than being discrete, absolute, causal units.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 And the other kind of causality is recognizing that at every level you have a new kind of causality working.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Aristotle had a complex view of causality, the substance and the intention and so on.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 And with the development of cybernetics, this Aristotelian view of causality rather than Plato's fixed, rigid view of the nature of things,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 the cybernetics people saw that each level of organization has its own laws and causal processes.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 And there were particular ulterior motives driving each of these greater views of causality and of biology.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 It happened that there were business interests that promoted the idea of genetic-based medicine.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Each drug could identify a causal action on one of these causal genes.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 And so all through the 20th century, there were these profit motives of selling drugs for diseases,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 supporting that idea of genetic causality.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 But then the cloning and stem cell businesses started to be seen as viable.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 And those were things that the reductionists had said absolutely shouldn't exist.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 You can't have stem cells. You can't clone an animal from a body cell.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 So now that they saw that those could be good business, they changed the history.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 And Barbara McClintock, who in the '40s and '50s had been treated rudely when she would deliver a paper,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 in the '80s and '90s, she was pulled out of obscurity while she was still alive

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 and given the MacArthur Grant and Nobel Prize to create a new history that would justify cloning

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 and genetic engineering, changing the genes as something like a natural process.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 So science is really being driven not by what's plausible or really ultimately helpful,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 but by what these powerful institutions see as something in their interest.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 Profit-driven, turned into a business that can be used to generate income to further the business.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 I think that's a fairly common world game that's played in most businesses.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Okay. So I know you've mentioned people in the '20s and '30s who were prominent in their time

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 and coming forward with some pretty novel and pretty groundbreaking tenets surrounding things like field theory

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 and cell intelligence, but that was pretty quickly squashed by the evolving gene people

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 who suddenly became the dominant influence because things could be sequenced and money could be made

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 and it could be driven in a very orderly fashion, one profit-laden product after another.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 So the classic embryology is where the field thinking really had its practical influence

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 and there were great implications for health in their experiments.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 For example, someone demonstrated that knowing that you could take part of an early embryo out of the embryo

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 and the embryo would replace it, the cells weren't fixed, they could fill in for each other,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 and you could move a cell from one place to another and its fate would be changed by where you put it

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 so that it could be developing along the line to become a foot and putting it in another place it could become a face.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 And knowing that kind of field effect, one researcher took a tumor and cut off a tadpole's tail

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 and grafted the tumor on where the tail had been and the tumor was converted by the developmental field

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 of the tadpole into a new tail.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 So it's potentially a very useful way of looking at the organism that cells are shaped by their environment

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 as well as modifying the environment.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 And not strictly, so far as the scientists are concerned, governed by the genes, immutable and unchangeable.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Yeah.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Yeah.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Okay, I think that probably brings me on to something I was pointed towards earlier on this afternoon

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 was some work done by Gunther Albrecht Bühler in a paper that is called Cell Intelligence

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 and he'd been working for about 30 years now and suddenly became very interested in some of the dogma and mistakes

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 that were being touted in the genetic world and started looking at cells and was very interested to find

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 that a lot of what he had been told as kind of unchangeable cell biology was actually quite mobile, quite flexible

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 and cells was certainly in his lab displaying intelligence as it were in terms of, I think it was the infrared light

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 that they were subjected to.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 They would gravitate towards it, they would move towards it and make kind of informed choices about directional,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 you know, the direction that they would go in.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Yeah, light has been, there's quite a bit of evidence that light produced by the dividing cells and metabolizing cells

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 is a signal.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 He's arguing for infrared as a very important signal.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 The Gervaches in the 1930s provided good evidence that there's ultraviolet frequency.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 They demonstrated that it could transmit mitogenic signals through a quartz glass but not through ordinary glass

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 that would filter out ultraviolet.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 But still, that's just something that's hardly been scratched.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Eric Buehler is currently probably one of the leading people, Fritz Popp in Germany has been another more recent one.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 Okay.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Alright, so in terms of, I guess we'll get a little bit more specific now and we'll start talking about some disease processes

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 perhaps which have been consigned to the genetic bin.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 You know, your parents have it and you're genetically predisposed to it so there's not much we can do

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 especially with things like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease which have become very big news, I think,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 along with diabetes in the last 20 years.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Suddenly becoming as much of a plague as cancer has been for the last 30 or 40 years

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 and probably will have as little attention given to it in terms of successful treatment.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 So in terms of field theory then, how do you think this can be applied to the process

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 within which we kind of currently understand Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and diabetes or the science people do?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 But how can it be applied to those conditions the way you understand it?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 Well, Albert Buehler sees fields as working both inside and outside the cell.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 So the cell has to have a very organized meaning interpretation system

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 for knowing which set of genes to turn on and off in certain environments.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 And cells have to sort of reach out and manipulate the environment around them,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 conditioning their surroundings to fit their needs.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And so any change in the surroundings that they can manage will help them follow the course that is best for the organism.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 The organism as a whole running into stresses and problems can change that territory around the individual cells

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 as well as the metabolism available to that cell.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 And so you're changing the surrounding structure and the metabolism.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And those function as a single system.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 The metabolism is creating the, for example, collagen to restore and renew its environment.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 And collagen is produced under, more of it is produced under stress when lactic acid is present because there's not enough oxygen.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 And lactic acid turns on many of these reactive defensive processes that as a signal to the organism

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 will tell the organism to deliver more oxygen, more sugar, more nutrients to the cells.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 But if the cell doesn't get that what it needs from the rest of the organism,

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 or if the field disrupting it is too intense, for example, just a very intense electromagnetic field, for example,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 almost any kind of disruptive field, ultraviolet, ionizing radiation, or intense radio frequency can shift the cell or hold it,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 keep it from maturing properly.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 But if the organism can get the necessary materials to the cell, the cell can recover.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 And in this recovery condition, part of the recovery will allow it to communicate so that if it's in the wrong place,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 it might simply allow itself to collapse and be used as material for adjoining cells in the apoptosis process.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 But ordinarily, even very deranged cells can begin functioning and participating constructively if they get the right materials.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 But lactic acid is one of the basic disrupting signals if it continues too long.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And it turns out that one of the basic features of diabetes is that they can't oxidize sugar all the way to carbon dioxide.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Instead, they produce lactic acid.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 And if that continues too long, lactic acidosis is very often what diabetics used to die from.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 But any of these stresses will interfere with the ability to oxidize glucose in the brain or blood vessels.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 And the organ that's under too much stress and not getting repair materials will shift over to producing lactic acid.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 And the lactic acid is a stress signal and an immune signal for the rest of the organism.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 That kind of reminds me, and I know we've discussed this previously on shows at various parts through various shows,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 but lactic acid, now this is something that I think most people can identify with.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Well, there's two forms of it perhaps that most people will probably quite commonly associate it with.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 One, I would think, would be in yogurt, lactic acid formed during the fermentation process.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 But I think probably more commonly still during exercise, when people exercise their muscles,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 when either running or aerobically exercising, the lactic acid that builds up in the muscles is often felt as a cramp.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 And this is the same lactic acid that you're saying is completely a destabilizer of the cell and quite disruptive to the field.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Yeah, a very well-developed athlete will not produce lactic acid too easily.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 A sedentary person who is forced to exercise will be flooded with lactic acid

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 because they haven't developed the system for delivering oxygen and fuel to the tissues.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 So a really good athlete is resistant to producing lactic acid.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 And carbon dioxide produced by healthy metabolism directly participates in suppressing lactic acid

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 and in maintaining and promoting oxidative energy production.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 And a place where you can see this is people who live at high altitudes

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 where the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide leaves their bodies having a higher residual carbon dioxide level.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 They can work very intensely without producing lactic acid.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 That's called the lactate paradox sometimes because ordinarily oxygen deficiency is what turns on lactic acid.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 But once you get adapted and are able to produce a lot of carbon dioxide or hold it in your tissues,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 then that in itself prevents this toxic formation of lactic acid.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Interesting. So is this adaptation a different type of adaptation to the red blood cell increasing adaptation

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 with exposure to altitude that mountaineers train for and that kind of thing? Is this different?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Yeah, it's part of it.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 It's part of it.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 The tissues in themselves, they develop more mitochondria

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 and the enzymes that regulate carbon dioxide shift and the red blood cell itself

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 doesn't deliver all of its carbon dioxide when it gets to the lungs.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 It picks up as much oxygen as it can, but at a lower oxygen pressure,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 that means the blood is still retaining a slightly higher amount of CO2.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 Okay. I had another question for you and that was regarding lactate.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 How feasible, I know we work with people who regularly get blood work done

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 and depending on what their blood work looks like,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 there's various reasons for suggesting changes to their diet or lifestyle.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 What do you think of lactate testing as a means to ascertain whether somebody truly is under stress

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 and what would be the best way to do it?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 I mean, at what time of the day or would that have a bearing on how much lactate was present in a blood sample?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Yeah, probably the time that you're feeling the stress would be the best time to measure it.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 If you do it when you're fasting, you're going to get a different measurement.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 You just have to know what time of day and what the circumstances are.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 But it's increasingly being used, for example, to diagnose cancer and monitor the progress.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 When the cancer is being regressed, the lactic acid in the serum goes down.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 Do you have any idea what kind of state of development of a tumor that lactic acid would be increased?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 It starts showing up in the blood at a very early stage.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 At a certain point, I don't remember the exact concentration,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 but it in itself causes an inactivation of the immune system that should be helping to correct the cancer.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 Even before that, it can be seen as a product of cancer.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 I expect somebody would probably have to have not just one spot check, but several over a period of weeks,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 just to see whether or not the level of lactic acid in the body was holding fairly stable,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 it was stably high, or whether a high reading may be just an aberration due to something.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Since everyone over the age of 50 has cells that can be diagnosed as cancer,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 it's a good idea not to be panicked by any measurement that could indicate cancer.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 It's simply a sign.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 For example, if you ate something very disagreeable,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 your lactic acid would go up just from the general inflammation.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 So you want to take everything in context.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Even if it's being produced by a cancer, most cancers don't kill people.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 In adults, if you look carefully enough, you can find cancer-like cells everywhere in everyone of middle age or more.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 So it's something that's naturally being cured spontaneously.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 And this is in the same vein that cells are constantly communicating with each other.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 They're not blind or dumb.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 They're completely autonomous and are actually able to communicate with each other

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 and change the environment in which that particular area is subject to.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 I think that same thing applies to the degenerative nerve diseases and all of the age-related, stress-related diseases.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 I think there's not an all-or-nothing definition of the disease.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 If you notice a trend starting that doesn't look favorable, then it's time to change the way you live.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Okay. So if carbon dioxide is analogous to an antilactate, as you've mentioned,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 what would be the best method to raise this and how long does that effect last?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Everything that keeps your free fatty acids from being released,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 and those are released by too much adrenaline, for example, many of the hormones,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 pituitary hormones in general help to increase the toxic free fatty acids.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 And everything you can do to lower the stress hormones,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 aspirin, for example, is a good anti-inflammatory, anti-stress agent.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 Vitamin E is another protective ascorbic acid.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Ordinary foods provide abundant amounts of ascorbic acid,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 so I don't recommend that as a supplement in general.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 This is why you're so big on orange juice.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Yeah, and meat, eggs, milk, everything, vegetables of all sorts contain ascorbic acid,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 but meat contains it in the dehydroascorbate form where people measuring the reduced form overlook it.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 Okay. All right. I think we have a couple of callers who are kind of flashing up the lights in the studios here.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 So let me just get the word from the engineer here.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 Okay. So our first caller is from Northern Australia.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Okay. So let's call you on the air.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Hello. Hello.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Yeah. You're from Northern Australia, you say?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 No, no. I'm from Melbourne, Australia.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Oh, okay. Melbourne. Sorry. Southern Australia. South, South East Australia.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
 Victoria, rather.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Oh, Victoria. Okay.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 Good. Well, glad to have you on the show. What's your question?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 Hi, Dr. Tate. How are you?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 My question is in relation to electromedicine and where George Lapskoski and Royal Wright had produced certain wavelength tequila pathogens

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 and also Dr. Rob Beck and Hilda Clark had come up with a machine where they call it DAPAs,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 where you place them in your palm on your arteries, on your wrist, tequila pathogens.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 I just want to know whether or not those machines are viable, whether it's true, does it really work?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 And also, drinking ozonated water, is there any health benefits to it?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 Okay. All right. Well, Dr. Peat, I know the first question about electromedicine and Royal Wright.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 The first one was I missed.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 The caller was asking about Wright and the Wright machines that were used.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 And the viability of it.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 There definitely is something to the principle, but I've never seen evidence that it is as specific as many of the people claim it to be.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 I know people who use apparatus of that sort and I think it's acting probably as a stimulus rather than having that specific action that the Wrightians claim for it.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Okay. His other question was ozonated water. Do you have any thoughts on ozonated water?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 I think he's using it for health benefits.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 I think ozone is too toxic in itself.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 The superoxide radical, which is produced by ionized air and some ionized water, that can be beneficial as part of a detox system in the lungs, for example, from ionized air.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 But I would be very careful with either ozone or peroxide containing water.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 Okay. Thank you very much, Dr. Tate.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Thank you for your call, caller.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 Okay. So, engineer, was there another call on the air?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Okay. So let's take the next caller and see what we think here.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 Hi, you're on the air?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Hi, I had a question about an herbological protocol for Lyme disease.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat, I know you've got a fairly specific view of Lyme disease. The caller is asking about Lyme disease protocol.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 Oh, well, there's a lot on the Internet suggesting that it's a lifetime project, but there's also quite a bit of information that says that two or three weeks with the right combination of antibiotics almost always cures it.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 So I think it's good to look widely, get a second, third, and fourth opinion before you commit yourself to a very, very prolonged protocol.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 How do you feel about the pathogen itself in terms of what the scientists or the doctors identify as the organism that causes it?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Oh, that class of bacteria, the spirochetes in general, some of them can be very harmful.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 Does what really exist?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 The what?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 Okay, carry on. I'm sorry.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 Oh, I was just saying that some of the spirochetes are very toxic and harmful and long-lasting.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 So it's good to, if you have any symptoms, it's good to check it and if necessary, have the proper antibiotic treatment.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 But there's a lot of selling services. Some doctors want to make it a many-year project of treatment and recovery.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Okay. All right. Well, you're listening to Ask Your Arab Doctor on KMEDGarble for 91.1 FM.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 And from now till the end of the show, you are welcome to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of field biology and things around that nature.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 So the number if you live in the area is 93 3911.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Or if you're outside the area, like the chap from Melbourne or Victoria, there's an 800 number, 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 Okay. So I'm always getting asked questions about nutrition and this is from people also who've been quite fastidious in following your recommendations.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 Dr. Peat, I've got a question regarding newborns.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Okay. So the World Health Organization actually advocates a four-year breastfeeding for newborn babies.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 And I think that's awesome.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 I think current trends, unfortunately, not in all populations, but current trends, certainly in city dwellers who are just too busy to have children,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 are wean them as quick as possible and feed them as soon as possible just so that they are kind of independent.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 I know that you definitely don't advocate that and for very good reasons.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 What do you think would be the best possible start for a newborn in terms of nutrition?

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 Well, breastfeeding naturally, but with the mother well fed and happy and unstressed.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Because when the mother is under stress or not properly nourished, the composition of the milk shows it.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 And the milk, good milk, contains a lot of blood sugar converted into the lactose of the milk and hormones, some thyroid and progesterone and a lot of immune factors.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 So even if a baby has an endocrine problem, as long as it's getting good milk, something like hypothyroidism often doesn't show up just because the milk is so rich in these protective factors.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Okay. All right.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 We have a couple more callers, so let me just…

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Okay, well let's take this next caller. It's actually about a very similar subject, but Dr. Peat, the caller, you're on the air.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Hello?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Hi, you're on the air and where are you from?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 Yeah, I'm from San Diego, kind of local.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 I had a question, something about you said about Lyme disease. I believe you said it takes three months protocol on antibiotics and it cures it. Is that what you said?

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Yeah, sometimes it disappears in just two or three weeks.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 I know a lot of people on Lyme disease and I've never seen that work ever that quickly. Is there some special protocol you're speaking of?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 You can find several articles on PubMed that are very good and I think part of the problem that makes it seem so incurable is that it often is misdiagnosed.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 They recognize evidence of an infection, but they don't recognize any clear signs of improvement because in many cases the person just isn't eating right or has other pathogens in their environment.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:48.000
 Okay, I just know like groups of people that are diagnosed with Lyme disease and are tested positive with Lyme disease and have been seeing a doctor for usually a couple of years taking antibiotics and they don't have the improvement that you're talking about. So, I'm extremely curious.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 I think the other thing just to interject, Cora, is that more often than not when people may well test positive, I think a lot of the population would actually test positive on an ELISA test for Borrelia antibodies, etc. or whatever is now used to currently diagnose Lyme.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 They have a lot of other metabolic defects and I think that in particular is what causes people to be so sick as it were and especially with the protocols that are used for not just antibiotics but other fairly heavy drugs.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 I think these can really play into someone's downfall and like we spoke about earlier, Dr. Peat mentioned, the kind of energetics in the body that gets, once someone's exposed to so many drugs and so many chemicals to try and supposedly cure something, it's very difficult for the organism to respond appropriately and it's more of a kind of failure of the organism under the barrage of drugs and chemicals to treat that. That's the problem.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Okay, so where in PubMed would I find this protocol you speak of? Is it pretty obscure?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 No, just look for Borrelia or Lyme disease and antibiotic treatment.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Okay. I know a bunch of people that have Lyme disease and they definitely have it. They have all the symptoms and they're positive and they remember to take bite and everything and have all the, you know, and it would definitely help them to get rid of it.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 Yeah.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:46.000
 Well, I think the other thing again just to add to that question, Cora, is that in terms of metabolic energy that we as, you know, organized living beings have a need in order to survive, everything, I always say to people that every transaction that we ever make in this world with our bodies costs something and in terms of metabolic energy to fight disease or to digest your food, it all costs energy and that ATP has to be used.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 Yeah.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 It has to be derived from something and so nutrition is extremely important and I know Dr. Peat does a lot of advocating nutrition as a way to restore health rather than drugs or, you know, chemicals.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 That's why I think of controversy. It seems like everybody has their own take on nutrition. Some people are low carbs, some people are high carbs, some people are vegan, which I don't.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Yeah. There's a lot of science behind it. It's not just hearsay and Dr. Peat spent a long time researching this and so, as I said before, most people can be chronically malnourished, not maybe to skin and bones, but chronically malnourished or assaulted if you like by the kind of foods they're eating that are blocking thyroid function and if that's the case, then it's very difficult to generate enough metabolic energy to do it.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 Right, right. That does make sense. Where's the information where the right kind of diet for a person to uptake, have the right kind of metabolic energy and take the right kind of medication together? Is there any information on that?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 Well, if you want, you can email me any time Monday through Friday and I can point you to the right direction of all those kind of things at Dr. Peat.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 And your email is?

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 It's Andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 I'm sorry, at what?

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Western.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 Western?

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 Botanical.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 Medicine.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 Medicine.com, yeah.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 Okay, you're welcome.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 Okay, thank you much.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 Yeah.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
 Bye.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 I think we have another call on the air. Yep. Okay, caller, you're on the air and where are you from? Hello?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 Hello?

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 Yes, hello? Am I on?

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 Yes.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 Okay, yes, I think one of the things about Lyme disease that hasn't been addressed is that you mentioned that it's from a spirochete, which means it's similar to syphilis.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 And syphilis has a first stage, a second stage, and a third stage.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 And I've always heard that Lyme disease did also.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 And if you catch it in the first or second stages, it can be cured with antibiotics just like syphilis.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 But if it goes into the third stage before it's treated, that's when it's really difficult and takes a long time and a complicated protocol to try to deal with it.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 And I think a lot of people don't know they have it until it enters the third stage.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 But you haven't mentioned anything about the first, second, and third stage.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, what have you got to say about primary, secondary, and tertiary syphilis in relation to Borrelia?

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 I think it's probably analogous.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 And the right antibiotic is needed to treat tertiary syphilis.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 Something that gets into the brain and nervous system will do it.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 Right.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 I know you're a very strong advocate of antibiotics, and I understand the rationale behind it completely.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 So, again, it's unfortunate a lot of people associate antibiotics with something that's bad and they shouldn't take.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 But it's actually a very valid part of medicine.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 Okay.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 So, I don't know, were there any other callers?

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 No.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 Okay.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 Well, I know we've got a few more minutes, Dr. Peat.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 And I just wanted to just talk about a few of the many, many names and the many authors that you've mentioned in the past.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Just so that people are listening to the show or would download this show later on in their own time and re-listen to it,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 they'll have a chance to look up some of the people that you commonly mention.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 So, I know you talked about, we've mentioned him in the past too, Mikhail Polanyi.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 So, he's been pretty dominant in field theory.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 And then I know you mentioned earlier on a Hungarian astrophysicist, Attila Grandpieri, was it?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 Grandpieri, yes.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 Yeah, Grandpieri.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Okay.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 And his ideas, there's a video by Michael Persinger called "No More Secrets" that talks about some of the field interactions that Grandpieri is writing about.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 They're very interesting.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 But the details are in so many fields, I'm not sure how practical either of them are.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Okay.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 I know you've mentioned also in the past P.K. Anakin as somebody who was studying CO2 and looking at the acceptor of action, as it were,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 conditioning reflexes and their responses.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 Yeah, that was an antecedent for cybernetics.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 He was a colleague and student of Pavlov, and he devised this cybernetic interpretation of reflexes,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 which sees the model of the world that we have in our consciousness as determining how the reflex works.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 And it's our purpose reflex, actually.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 So it's a very interesting concept, but it makes a very simple way of interpreting other fields, such as Hans Selye's stress process.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 If you see it in terms of P.K. Anakin's acceptor of action and how the meaning of a particular stress and how the body is responding governs the field all the way down to the cell

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 and the chemistry of the cell is responsive to the meaning of the stress.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 Okay, and then there was Noam Chomsky.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 I know you have quite an affection towards William Blake as well as part of your earlier exploits.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Yeah, Blake saw things in a very holistic, cosmic way as well as very biological, soundly based in the organism.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 And then there was Dostoevsky's Diary of a Strange Fellow, wasn't it?

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 Yeah, various translations of that.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 Some of them are easier to understand than others about the essential meaningfulness of experience and reality.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 Okay, well I guess we're getting to the top of the hour and I just wanted to mention a few of those authors just so people could recapitulate and perhaps look them up, Google them, search out what they did

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 and find out that a lot of brilliant scientists have done lots of pioneering work in the past and unfortunately with the advent of science and the money that was being produced by the science and the patenting of and etc.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 that these people have been pushed into the background but had some very interesting direction that they were going in and fortunately with the internet and people being disillusioned with the way medicine is going

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 these things are becoming more common again as post-docs etc. take up these previously relegated concepts and are bringing them back to life again by their own work.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 So I really appreciate all those people that you mentioned on the show and just want to make sure that we've put them out on the air again so people can find out that these are not just quacks, they're actually very brilliant people who had most of them Nobel Prize winners too.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 So thank you so much for joining us again Dr. Peat, we really appreciate your time.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 Okay, thanks.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Okay so for people who have joined in, Dr. Peat's website full of articles, fully referenced, everything that he says can be traced back, you know can trace his citations on the web and all of his newsletters are fully referenced.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 So www.raypeat.com, an excellent resource, he's a very altruistic man, very humble, I'm sure you probably pick that up when you hear him.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 Brilliant that he shares his knowledge the way he does, I so appreciate his time.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 For those of you who've listened to the show, the third Friday of every month, we can be reached at www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com and/or email me andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com Monday through Friday or the weekend, doesn't really matter, 9 to 5.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
 And thanks so much for your time.
