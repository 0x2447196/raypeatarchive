00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.120
 Welcome to your own health and fitness. I'm health integrationist Laina Berman with Jeff

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.440
 Hossett, Ph.D. We come to you weekly with a critical, independent voice on the politics

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.920
 and practice of health. If you are a woman or man benefiting from the use of bioidentical

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.240
 progesterone, you have today's guest to thank. I'm grateful to him for starting me on my

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.080
 path after hearing him lecture at UCSF about early animal research on helplessness. That's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.440
 when I understood the importance of learning enough to be at the center of my own health

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.200
 care and not at the mercy of a long-term treatment plan. That was about 30 years ago, and it's

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.600
 formed my work this many years later. This radio program is designed to introduce you

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.580
 to critical thinking about science and what promotes the capacity to live fully, embracing

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.040
 a complexity of ideas that will challenge the current ecclesiastic convention in health

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.320
 care. Challenging ideas is what you'll hear in this next hour with Dr. Raymond Peat. Stay

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.000
 tuned as we discuss heart, brain, cancer, and hormones. First, a commentary about this

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.160
 week's health news by Dr. Jeffrey Hossett.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.560
 Thank you, Lena. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has created

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.640
 something called the Social and Behavioral Science Team. The team is intended to draw

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.080
 upon these fields in order to make government policies more effective and efficient. The

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.200
 approach is discussed in a New York Times article by a professor at the University of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.600
 Chicago who has advised the Obama administration and who also advised the villainous David

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.700
 Cameron administration in Great Britain. Fox and other right-wing media were sent into

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.680
 a fit with fears of Obama brainwashing. It's nothing of the kind, which doesn't mean that

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.560
 the team's work is benign. I'll tell you why. The Times article mentions three issues that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.380
 are receiving the team's attention. At three years of age, poor children have a significantly

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.480
 smaller vocabulary than well-off children. Much of this is attributed to how caregivers

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 and parents speak to and read to their children. Coaching and new technologies are cited that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.600
 could improve the performance of parents and caregivers. A second category concerns domestic

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.680
 violence and the effectiveness of domestic violence hotlines. Women who call are too

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.080
 often left on hold. The call is dropped and help is not received. Improved call handling

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.460
 methods and technologies are cited, for example, communicating wait times so that callers are

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.680
 kept on the line until they can get the help they need. The final category concerns the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.440
 failure of patients to follow a course of treatment, such as taking medications at the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.840
 prescribed times during the day or getting to appointments, changing medication design,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.480
 for example, from three times daily to once, and information technologies for mental crutches

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.840
 are cited as ways to make compliance easier. Although only the last is called a health

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.180
 issue, I believe that all three are health issues and serious ones. It's disappointing

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.160
 that the solutions offered ignore the obvious political economy of each of these problems.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.960
 Yes, enabling parents to improve children's language skills is desirable, but that's not

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.600
 the problem. The problem is they're poor. Providing those families with economic security

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.240
 will do far more than coaching parents to read to their children. Yes, having better

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.640
 communication techniques for victims of domestic violence is a good thing, but eliminating

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.960
 the economic insecurity that is the soup from which domestic violence bubbles up is going

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.380
 to be far more effective than telling a caller how long she has to wait before she can talk

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.440
 to someone. And for that matter, why not spend money making sure that no one ever needs to

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.040
 be put on hold? Yes, some people have trouble following a doctor's orders. How often is

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.640
 the problem not three pills versus one, but choosing between the pill and the meal with

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.000
 which you're supposed to take it? Oddly, the article opens this section by citing a study

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.720
 that showed better compliance when the copayment for a treatment was eliminated. After concluding,

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.520
 "For some highly effective treatments, there should be no copayment at all." The article

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.120
 pats the idea on the head and moves on to redesigning pills. Why not eliminate all copayments

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.920
 altogether? Characteristic of the Obama administration's disappointing performance in general, the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:03.040
 work of the social and behavioral science team will nibble at the edges of serious problems.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.120
 The ideas are not necessarily bad ones for what they are. They come from an academic

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.260
 literature on what's called nudging, which means making small environmental changes that

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.280
 have a significant effect on our health and well-being. An example that sticks in my head

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.960
 concerns organ donorship. Both the US and France manage organ donation through their

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.200
 driver's license system. Your driver's license designates you as a donor or not. You choose

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.080
 when you get your license and can have it changed at any time. But there's a big difference

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.120
 between the US and France. The percent of people who are donors in the US is very low,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.040
 while in France it's very high. The difference has nothing to do with altruism, but with

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.240
 how the question is asked. In the US, you are asked to opt in, that is, you have to

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:01.360
 check the box to be a donor. In France, you are asked to opt out, that is, you're a donor

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.120
 unless you check the box. You might think it's too bad that the US has such a bad system,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.280
 one that prevents a noble life-saving act. However, the organ donation system is less

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.320
 than a noble undertaking, and there is some evidence that many donations are made before

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.800
 the donor has joined the choir invisible, both from the haste of the extraction team

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.640
 and the questionable parameters used to decide when someone is dead. What I'm saying is that

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.080
 making a policy work better using nudges is a smart thing, but we should make sure we're

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.200
 signed up for the policy and understand the de facto effect of the policy. It seems to

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.080
 be a de facto policy that children should live in poverty. It seems to be a de facto

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.280
 policy that women should live in fear of domestic violence. It seems to be a de facto policy

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.080
 that medical care should require financial sacrifice. It's those de facto policies that

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.660
 the social and behavioral science team is nibbling at in the name of efficiency, producing

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:13.120
 band-aids at best. The transcript of this comment is available at YourOwnHealthAndFitness.org.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.120
 I'm Jeffrey Fawcett. Take care of yourself.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.360
 Jeff Fawcett is a political economist, writer, health educator who produces the show with

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.040
 me and is the primary author of our book together, Too Much Medicine, Not Enough Health. Now

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.320
 to our topic, which is heart, brain, cancer and hormones, although I'm sure we'll move

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.280
 into all sorts of other places as well, time permitting. Our guest, I'm very pleased to

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.880
 introduce you to Dr. Raymond Peat, P-E-A-T. He has a PhD in biology from the University

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.200
 of Oregon with a specialization in philosophy. He has taught at the University of Oregon

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:03.200
 Universidad Veracruzana, the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de MÃ©xico and Blake College. He

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.840
 also conducts private nutritional counseling. Dr. Peat first started his work with progesterone

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.840
 and related hormones in 1968. In papers in Physiology, Physiological, sorry, Chemistry

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:29.240
 and Physics 1971-1972, in his dissertation at the University of Oregon in 1972, he outlined

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:36.280
 his ideas regarding progesterone and the hormones closely related to it as protection of the

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.240
 body's structure and energy against the harmful effects of estrogen, yes, I said estrogen,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 radiation, stress and lack of oxygen. The key idea that underlies Dr. Peat's work is

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.600
 that energy and structure are independent and interdependent, I'm sorry, interdependent,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.600
 not independent at every level. Boy, I made a hash of that. Welcome to you, Raymond.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.600
 Hello. Hi. His commentary got me thinking about how I happen to gravitate in the direction

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:15.920
 of those hormones. I was in the 50s, you know, the political situation was totally desperate

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:26.760
 but the beginning of democratic movements around 1960 coincided with changes in the

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:34.760
 science and I hadn't considered going into science during the 50s because science was

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:45.120
 so politicized and basically oriented towards militarism and psychiatrists were working

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:55.680
 on things such as lobotomies and electroshock and torturing animals to see what happened

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:03.120
 and in 1960 the opposite interest developed in which rats were put into an enriched environment

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:15.240
 and they discovered that they became more intelligent and their brains even enlarged

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.920
 and that enlargement was passed on to the next generations growing with each generation

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:29.960
 and that got me interested in science and I thought science had some real possibilities

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:37.960
 if it could be integrated with social stimulation, nutrition and so on. So I went to university

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:47.360
 to thinking to study brain biology but I found that the brain biologists were totally doctrinaire

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:58.960
 looking to the government grants for their approval basically of whether they should

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:06.840
 go in a certain direction, a mechanical kind of thinking so I went over to the other end

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:13.840
 reproduction and saw that stress and aging and radiation injury which had been an interest

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:23.360
 of mine in the 1950s because of the bomb tests, I saw that all of these kinds of stress and

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.480
 injury created the same situation which essentially was a brain shrinking process. The follow-up

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:40.080
 of the 1960s studies at Berkeley in which freedom and enrichment enlarged the brain,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:49.200
 they tested different hormones during pregnancy and found that stress shrank the brain and

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:57.560
 that overlapped with some of the torture experiments that had begun in the 50s but by the 1970s

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:07.720
 when I had finished my dissertation and research on the aging effects of progesterone and estrogen,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:16.560
 body culture had shifted away from that and basically medicine and biology couldn't see

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:23.680
 the connection between enriched growth of the brain and suffering causing shrinkage

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:30.680
 of the brain and inability to help oneself, learned helplessness goes with shrinking of

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.160
 the brain.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.760
 Can I say something? I was going to lead you into helplessness because you sent me those

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.360
 three abstracts last night which bring up some interesting questions about serotonin

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:52.840
 and things like that but to backtrack a little, the New York Times just published an article

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.840
 about a new study about urban animals, rats, mice, bats, who are, their brains are growing,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:05.880
 they're getting smarter because they're living in urban environments. The explanation is,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.400
 you know, their conclusion is that it's because they're being forced to think harder about

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.880
 where to find food and all this stuff. That can't quite be right because in fact...

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.600
 It's more like being a wild animal. Wild animals have bigger brains than...

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:26.160
 Well, what I was going to say is that they're reporting that these urban animals are suddenly

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.320
 becoming smarter because they have to work so hard to get food and I'm thinking, you

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.960
 know, in the 1700s in London they had to get food too. And, you know, they don't mention

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.840
 the fact that urban environments will also give them shorter lives. So it was a very

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:48.000
 selective piece of reporting that seemed to indicate that they believe that just putting

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.040
 people in urban environments, which is the trend these days...

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:58.040
 Well, I imagine the rats in New York are eating better than they have at other times when...

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.240
 Could be.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.840
 ...living was harder.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:05.480
 Yeah, could be. Anyway, let me just say again because we're going to get into a break thing

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.320
 here that this is your own health and fitness and I'm on the phone today with Ray Peat,

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.720
 P-E-A-T, PhD. And you will find as you listen to the show that he is a very provocative

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.720
 and very interesting biology professor and researcher. So, you know, conventional medicine

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:32.720
 as you just said is only interested in prevention as early intervention and doing invasive things

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:39.560
 of various sorts to prevent people from dying of heart disease and cancer. But the rates

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.160
 of these diseases, as you point out in your papers and your newsletters, are climbing

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.920
 and they tend to be somewhat lower in people in the third world who are not getting treated

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.840
 as much, which is ironic. You have a different way of thinking about what makes people vulnerable

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.320
 and the helplessness stuff, which really caught my attention, really got my attention and

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.520
 got me thinking 30 something years ago when I heard you speak. You just sent some abstracts

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.520
 about helplessness. It's very interesting. Everybody's heard me talk about the research,

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:15.200
 which is that they threw rats into vats of water to see whether they would keep swimming

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.400
 if they were held long enough for them to give up. If they were held for a while and

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.400
 put back in, they'd swim to save their lives for any length of time. If they were held

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.640
 beyond that point, they would give up.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:32.640
 Yeah, but the naive rats typically would swim for three or four days before giving up. But

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:40.400
 if they had been held in someone's fist until they gave up or were shocked and couldn't

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:46.120
 get away from the shock, they would usually drown after six or seven minutes.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.440
 More animal cruelty.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:55.440
 Yeah. Several of the experimenters observed that when they died, their hearts were in

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:03.280
 a relaxed state. They were actively turned off. That's where this relates very directly

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:12.600
 to what was seen in the very first 1960s experiments with enriched rats. The insight that increased

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:23.880
 along with intelligence was cholinesterase, which destroys acetylcholine, which is thought

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:33.000
 of as the agent of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is the relaxed and sleep and

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.760
 regeneration associated nerves, where the adrenaline side is associated with fight or

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:47.760
 flight. So the acetylcholine along with the parasympathetic nervous system are given this

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:57.600
 ideology sort of like serotonin. It's all sweet and positive. But the stress can go

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:07.400
 in either direction of excess. Too much adrenaline and cortisol, which tend to break down your

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:14.400
 tissues or too much of the turning off mobilization, too much acetylcholine. And that turns on

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:28.600
 all kinds of inflammatory, cancerous, degenerative processes.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.960
 So that's a shock response?

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.200
 That's what...

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.560
 Is it sort of a shock response?

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:41.560
 Yeah. When you give up, going into shock and giving up is biologically involves things

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:51.160
 such as too much nitric oxide, too much serotonin, and too much acetylcholine. So it's too much

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:58.640
 of the relax and be serene. It goes over the edge into quick death.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.040
 Okay. So let me just stop you there because that's really interesting. I mean, that's

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:10.040
 what I thought I read here. So that the way that too much serotonin works is it literally

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:16.160
 kind of puts you out in a certain way. I mean, it's because I thought acetylcholine was excitatory.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:23.160
 Yeah. It's excitatory to muscles and it has some inhibiting functions, but it is one of

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:33.320
 the three basic excitatory toxins that is known to kill brain cells. Cysteine, the amino

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:41.680
 acid works with glutamic acid and aspartic acid that got famous with MSG.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.960
 Right. And aspartame.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:50.960
 Yeah. And acetylcholine has just been given the assumption that it's all a pleasant and

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:58.960
 relaxing, but in fact, it's one of the excitotoxins. It excites nerves and if they don't have enough

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:10.520
 sugar basically and oxygen to support that excitation or if they have too much cortisol

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:18.800
 interfering with their ability to use both glucose and oxygen, then the acetylcholine

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:24.720
 stimulation kills them just as much as the glutamic acid would.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:31.720
 This has really interesting implications for not only long-term treatment in general, which

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:37.820
 increases helplessness and that's what you were talking about at UCSF and that was really

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:43.680
 interesting because I was in treatment for chemical sensitivity. I was being treated

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:50.680
 for what was called back then environmental allergies and stuff. If people are given serotonin

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:57.680
 reuptake medications and their serotonin gets too high, they become manic and they feel

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:04.680
 like they're on speed. So not only are we treating, not us personally, not only is the

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.680
 medical institution treating people by overdosing them with serotonin when they're depressed,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.680
 but you're, you know, so in every way, this is dangerous is what I'm trying to say.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:21.680
 Yeah, and because of this ignoring the dark side of stress, the cholinergic side of stress

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:31.800
 or the giving up side, the medical business has used it the same way they've used the

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:41.760
 serotonin drugs building on a myth to sell drugs that in fact are doing exactly what

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:51.520
 they should be undoing. Progesterone happens to activate the cholinesterase enzyme the

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:59.760
 same way that enriched environment activates it. So it protects the brain against this

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:06.800
 excitotoxic so the brain can become excited and active without killing itself. But if

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:13.800
 you're deficient in progesterone, you run the risk of over exciting the brain and any

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:23.840
 injury and it doesn't have to be a behavioral stress, but just a physical knock on the head

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.080
 that excites the nerves and if you get enough progesterone soon enough, the brain recovers

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:39.080
 with great ability. Just being low in progesterone, any little stress becomes a dangerous injury.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:48.560
 And the Steins group in the last 10 years has made great progress in treating traffic

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:55.760
 accident victims of concussion and brain injury with progesterone.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:03.760
 But it's stuff that was already being demonstrated in the 1960s with the brain expanding effects.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:12.520
 Marian Diamond, for example, wrote a book showing that stress changes the shape of the

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:20.200
 face and thins the cortex making rats look mean and stupid and actually being stupid

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.760
 and prenatal stress. But giving them extra sugar and progesterone to nourish the brain

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:36.000
 prenatally gave them a sort of baby face look like a puppy with a big head and a good disposition

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.040
 and higher intelligence.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:46.040
 Let's roll this back for some perspective for people. John Lee is now long dead, Dr.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.160
 John Lee. For people who have been listening to my show for the length of time it's been

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.280
 on which is getting close to 20 years, they will have heard many shows with John Lee when

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:06.000
 he was alive. And John Lee learned about progesterone from you. And I knew about progesterone from

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.760
 you because I started using it after hearing you speak and getting to know you. So I started

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.960
 using progesterone in my 30s and it was very helpful to me. John Lee, who was a physician

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:22.960
 in Mill Valley for 30 years, used it in his practice and never had any case of breast

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:30.120
 cancer or any kind of cancer in his practice. And he also was able to cure infertility problems

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:37.120
 in women by giving them progesterone. And I, in my own practice, have made those suggestions

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:45.320
 to people and have also observed that as women move into menopause, their progesterone drops

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.160
 off precipitously and the estrogen is still present, but they can't use the estrogen because

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.240
 there's no progesterone. Plus, estrogen being excitatory, they're basically jumping out

00:23:55.240 --> 00:24:01.460
 of their skin during that period. So the progesterone is remarkable. But progesterone is also remarkable

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:08.460
 in very, very small doses for men. Right? Right. It works for arthritis and epilepsy

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:18.080
 in men just as well as in women. And it hasn't been used as much for treating cancer. Alexander

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:26.880
 Lipschutz in the 1940s showed that progesterone would stop the cancerization of basically

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:34.480
 every tissue, starting with the uterus, breast, then lungs, kidney, brain.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.600
 And prostate.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:43.120
 Yeah. But that was picked up by a few medical doctors to treat uterine cancer, breast cancer,

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:54.280
 and kidney cancer. But all of his implications weren't followed up and it just dropped out

00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:02.200
 of consciousness about 1955 when more chemicals were coming on the market for treating cancer.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.640
 Yeah, which makes more money. You can't patent a natural substance. So then we have, obviously,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:15.320
 Provera, which is synthetic progesterone, which really causes cancer fast and doesn't

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:21.560
 do anything protective. The one thing to be mindful of with progesterone in my own experience

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:28.280
 and my experience with at least my clients and in men is that hormones like to be in

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.120
 a milieu that's balanced. And the balance should always favor progesterone, but an overdose

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.440
 of progesterone is sedative. So it will basically put you out. It will make you sleepy and you

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:45.240
 feel kind of loggy and blue. So one problem, I think, is that sometimes women hear that

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:52.240
 it's good and they slather this stuff on and then they feel awful. So it's good to remember

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:59.280
 that. Well, what do you think a good replacement dose of progesterone is in the two genders?

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:06.720
 Well, for my own experience, I've taken as much as 1,000 milligrams of progesterone.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:15.800
 And stayed awake? No, I couldn't tell where my hands and feet were.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.960
 You and Oliver Sacks like to do stuff like that. Yeah.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:27.960
 Taking about 10 milligrams had a very soothing effect, but if I kept it up, I'd be in a

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:34.040
 coma. But if I kept it up for about a week, it was like I was constantly getting out of

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:39.040
 a cold shower. It had a definite antagonistic effect to testosterone.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:46.040
 Yes, it reduces your test. I think a good dose for men is 5 to 8 milligrams, which is

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.200
 a really small dose. And in women, what do you like to see? It's going to vary, obviously.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:58.200
 It's variable. Some women can take 400 milligrams. I know some women who couldn't feel it at

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:05.680
 all because their estrogen was so high. It has to reach a ratio of 5 or 10 times at least

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:13.520
 higher than estrogen. And if your bloodstream is full of estrogen, you just can't get there.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.040
 You've got to get the estrogen under control. Then 30 to 100 milligrams is fine.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:26.040
 I rarely see women who can tolerate 100, but I have had clients who are quite obese and

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:34.400
 can't use a transdermal method because progesterone likes to soak into the fat cells and hang

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:40.040
 out slowly, releasing itself. So with those cases, I gave it to them under the tongue,

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.560
 which is still transdermal, but it absorbs faster.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:50.560
 You can just add it to food and swallow it. It absorbs all the way down.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:57.560
 I would probably depend on the method. I like to put it on my skin.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:05.080
 Several men have used it transdermally, but putting some olive oil on their skin first

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:13.400
 and then rubbing in hundreds of milligrams. A friend of mine, for example, had a rheumatic

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:20.760
 arthritic knee that looked like a football. It had been going on for many weeks. One application

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:28.680
 that way, 500 milligrams, but oiling from his thigh to his ankle, it cleared up in about

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.280
 two hours.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.040
 That's remarkable.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:37.720
 Thirty years later, he hadn't had a recurrence after that one application. That's an extreme

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.960
 case, but several others have done the same thing.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.360
 I remember that, again, we're talking about a single application, because keep in mind

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.700
 that a very, very large dose of progesterone in either gender has the potential to knock

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:56.400
 you out, literally to put you out, to put you to sleep, because it is very sedative.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.840
 If you prolonged the application of lots of it, you will feel low-key, and some people

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.240
 feel depressed as a result.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.980
 You have to monitor. Also, another thing that can happen in women, I discovered this the

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:12.440
 hard way, literally, is that if you use too much progesterone, your breasts will think

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.280
 that you're lactating. So you'll end up with these very attractive, very large, buoyant

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.960
 breasts that no one can touch because they're so painful. That's one way to tell that you've

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.760
 overdone it.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:30.760
 Your breasts are really... But it's not dangerous. Again, the synthetic, the patented, altered,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.620
 particularly altered versions of this are very, very toxic, birth control pills and

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.500
 Provera and things like that, but the natural forms are extremely benign. And like I said,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.980
 the worst thing that will happen is you'll feel blue or tired or you'll go to sleep.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.140
 I need to take a very brief musical break. When we come back, we'll continue this discussion

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:58.180
 about hormones and progesterone and hopefully talk about heart and brain and cancer. Raymond

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:03.820

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.820
 all sorts of stuff?

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.820
 Yes, raypeat.com.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:25.820
 I love that. Let me just... Okay. So, the music choice today was because both Dr. Peata

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:35.820
 and I have a fondness for Dvorak's, the pieces that he did that were folkloric. So, did I

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.820
 get it right?

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.820
 I don't know.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.820
 Was it folkloric enough for you?

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.820
 It was fine, yeah.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:55.820
 Okay. All right. Now, since we're talking about progesterone, it really does beg to

00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:01.820
 go ahead and talk about both heart disease and cancer, because in both cases, you know,

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:08.820
 there's been press about how... There are studies that show estrogen to be heart protective.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:14.820
 So, I'm not going to... Estrogen is mostly excitatory. If there's an imbalance in the

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.820
 body, which most women have, and men too, because men pick up estrogen as they age,

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:24.820
 particularly if they get heavy, it's going to contest and lower testosterone in both

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:30.820
 genders, which is heart protective and cancer protective, I think. So, I'm going to just

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.820
 let you kind of go.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:40.820
 Albert St. Georgi was who got me interested in the effect of estrogen and progesterone

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:50.820
 on the heart. And he showed in rabbit hearts that progesterone basically strengthens the

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:58.820
 heartbeat as the heart has more demand put on it. Progesterone lets it respond to the

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:08.820
 demand, where too much estrogen keeps it in the basically small stroke, but having to

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:15.820
 speed up faster and faster because it can't make a bigger stroke. And in some ways, that's

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:23.820
 analogous to what happens in other tissues. Progesterone facilitates the ability to gather

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:34.820
 resources by relaxing. Its basic effect is to prevent excess stimulation and response

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:44.820
 until it has the resources to respond fully and correctly. So, in the heart, it quiets

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:54.820
 the heart while increasing the amount of blood it can pump in each stroke. And in the brain,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:04.820
 it does the same thing where too much stimulation fatigues cells and can kill them. Progesterone

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:15.820
 activates a whole system that will tend to calm the brain. The uterus is another dimension

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:23.820
 like the heart. It has to function according to whether it can relax or contract. To give

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:30.820
 birth, it has to contract strongly, but during pregnancy, it definitely doesn't want to contract.

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:37.820
 Progesterone has to be dominant all through right up until the time of birth. And one

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:43.820
 of the ways that progesterone is doing that is the same way it does in the brain to keep

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:58.820
 the brain able to be stimulated but grow. It allows the uterus to destroy acetylcholine

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:08.820
 even when it's receiving irritation and stimulation. It activates enzymes that prevent inappropriate

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:16.820
 stimulation. So, it lets the uterus keep growing and resisting that unnecessary stimulation.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:25.820
 And in an overdose in the brain, that's what you see as the sedation and basically anesthesia.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:34.820
 You can create a complete anesthesia with adequate progesterone, but with the injected

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:40.820
 kind, for example, the type that Katharina Dalton had such great results with all through

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:51.820
 the 40s and 50s, she was using an oil-alcohol injectable form in which the alcohol counteracted

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:57.820
 the effects of progesterone to a great extent, but still she was getting terrific results.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:06.820
 But when that form has been injected, for example, for treating uterine cancer, they

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:12.820
 could inject around a thousand milligrams into a person and they weren't sedated at

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:22.820
 all, showing that the infected form was very poorly assimilated into the whole body. So,

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:33.820
 the body has to deliver progesterone in the appropriate way to keep things relaxed.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:41.820
 So in terms of what sorts of mechanisms are occurring when cells lose individuation and

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:47.820
 start to be recruited as cancer cells, how does progesterone help? Well, I think all

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.820
 hormones, to some extent, protect the cells from losing. In other words, if you look at

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.820
 a cancer cell from the breast, you can't tell where it came from, it's just a cancer cell,

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.820
 it doesn't look like a breast cell anymore.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:09.820
 Yeah, cells react to stress either by growing too fast or by dying the same way as the whole

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:20.820
 organism, either goes into a fight or flight state or gives up. And the cancer is basically

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:26.820
 the fight or flight state that cells try to get out of the bad situation, multiplying

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:37.820
 faster and moving, getting away from whatever is causing the stress. And progesterone keeps

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:45.820
 cells from experiencing that kind of stress in the first place. But it's one of the factors

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:55.820
 that can, if a cell has started down a stem cell pathway, basically, progesterone helps

00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:01.820
 to guide it in the right direction.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:12.820
 One pathway, when a stem cell invades the heart, for example, if it finds a slightly

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:23.820
 injured heart, it can mature into a functioning muscle cell. But once the heart is under great

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:30.820
 stress, not enough progesterone to keep it quiet periodically, the stem cells moving

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:37.820
 into the heart are either killed or, in the case of the heart, they become a fiber-producing

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:45.820
 cell, produce collagen and make the heart progressively harder. And that's one of the

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:55.820
 things that happens in just about every cancer. The cells which don't die, a few of them become

00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:06.820
 multiplying cancer cells, others become fiber-producing cells in an attempt to wall off whatever the

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:17.820
 irritant is. For example, the polycyclic hydrocarbons, the famous carcinogens from smoke, when these

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:27.820
 are painted on an animal's skin, it usually produces cancer. But in the process, if the

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:34.820
 animal is able to resist the cancerization, it will produce a walled-off, collagenous

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:43.820
 lump that protects the cells and the animal by closing in the irritant.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:55.820
 So, the defensive process of a hardening heart or a thickening, stiffening tumor, it's the

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.820
 same defense reaction, just in a different context.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:04.820
 Let me try saying that in another way to see, tell me if I'm saying it right, just to sort

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:11.820
 of unpack it for listeners. I think what you're saying is that when the heart, either from

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.820
 stress or from the stress of something in the environment, because radiation of all

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:25.820
 forms, including microwave, wireless radiation, which is non-ionizing, ionizing radiation,

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:31.820
 pollution, toxins, all of this is stress, in really horrible food and toxins that are

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:38.820
 ingested, and your social, psychological, it's all environmental. So, environmental

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:47.820
 irritants can cause the body to create, to encapsulate damaged tissue, to go to an area

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.820
 of inflammation, of chronic inflammation, and encapsulate it, and that's a tumor. And

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:59.820
 this can happen, this fibrolytic action can happen both in terms of just tissues in the

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:05.820
 body trying to encapsulate an irritant and forming a cancer, or in the heart as it becomes

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:12.820
 more fibrolytic and more stiff and almost scarred from a number of other kinds of assaults.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:20.820
 Yeah, and every stressed or irritated tissue is constantly open to receiving cells coming

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:30.820
 in from the bone marrow or nearby tissues. These fairly undifferentiated stem-like cells

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:38.820
 are constantly available. Anytime a cell or a tissue needs help, these cells tend to come

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:46.820
 in and fill in whatever is needed. But as a person, usually it starts over the age of

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:57.820
 50, as the whole system starts getting congested with all kinds of stresses and poisons and

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:07.820
 failure to eliminate toxins. Many of these areas accumulate half walled off, half controlled.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:15.820
 And a person who has had cancer removed, for example, there have been studies following

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:21.820
 up on populations of these people who had no signs of cancer, but a large proportion

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:29.820
 of them had constantly circulating cells identifiable as cancer cells going around in their blood

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:36.820
 but not causing any harm because their body was just able to use them as repair cells

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:44.820
 maybe or just close them up in little collagen package and forget about them.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:52.820
 Now, the next part of this, which is very important, is that I've always felt that if

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:59.820
 possible, you don't have surgery with a cancer if you can avoid it. I mean, unless you've

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.820
 got this huge thing hanging, you know, unless it's really interfering, it's certainly better

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:13.820
 not to do things like the stereostatic, you know, needle, so-called needle biopsy. This

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.820
 is really a gun with a thing that they shoot into. But these disturb the cells and I've

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.820
 never understood what the mechanism was and I read it in your newsletter. Why is it bad

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.820
 to cut into cancers?

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:37.820
 It's just one more stress. It calls on the body to mobilize the healing process and if

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:47.820
 the body has a lot of it, if it's young and healthy, it can stand being cut up and recover

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:55.820
 perfectly. But the sicker the individual is, the more likely the stress is to either reactivate

00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:01.820
 the cancer in the same place or activate a completely new cancer somewhere else. And

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:12.820
 it doesn't have to be just surgery, but chemical poisoning and radiation all activate the carcinogenic

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:21.820
 process either in the place that's being treated or elsewhere. So it's just a matter of the

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.820
 total stress and the body's ability to respond to it.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.820
 Yeah, what you say in your newsletter is it is now clear that normal cells are attracted

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:38.820
 to an irradiated area and you're quoting Klopp et al. in 2007 and Kidd et al. in 2009 that

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:46.820
 it's a recognition of a "bystander effect" in which radiation for other... Anyway, the

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:52.820
 point is that it causes injury and the cell injuries cause nearby cells with signals to

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.820
 go to the injured... Anyway, just what you said. So, I mean, my mouth kind of hung open

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.820
 when I read this because it seemed so obvious to me and yet you said it very succinctly.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:06.820
 Yeah, the people like... I think her name is Carmen Mothersill.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.820
 Yeah, you quote her here.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:20.820
 They've demonstrated that cells send out SOS signals, including serotonin, to recruit their

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:29.820
 neighbors to come and help repair the damage. And at a certain point, instead of repairing

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:36.820
 the damage, the local situation is so bad that they pervert the recruits and let them

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.820
 cause more damage.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:43.820
 Well, you know, again, I should mention this is your own Health and Fitness. I'm Melina

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:52.820
 Berman on the phone with Dr. Ray or Raymond Peat, P-E-A-T. He's a biologist. He's a researcher.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:57.820
 He has been a professor for many years. He has a newsletter and articles that you...

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.820
 Well, the newsletter is a prescription, I think, a subscription, should be a prescription,

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:07.820
 subscription. Is that through your website? It's raypeat.net?

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.820
 No, dot com.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:16.820
 It is dot com, raypeat.com. That's too easy. Raypeat.com, but articles are there and whatnot.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.820
 And those are, I believe, paintings that you did?

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.820
 Yeah.

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:22.820
 Remarkable, really. Lovely.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:29.820
 I was going to be a painter until I thought I saw a possibility to work in biology.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:38.820
 Yeah, kind of me too. Although I haven't painted in years. So people are terrified of cancer

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.820
 and heart disease, terrified. And when they have, they find something or there's a diagnosis,

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:49.820
 there's this train that starts coming at them. And it's very hard for people to resist. I

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:53.820
 have had some very interesting clients who did resist. I had a woman come to see me who

00:47:53.820 --> 00:48:00.820
 had a remarkably large breast tumor that she was just living with and doing all these alternative

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:06.820
 things with. And it was just there and she's still around. So, you know, I don't want to

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:11.820
 advocate on the air that people should not treat things because I would get sued for

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:16.820
 doing that. So I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that people should be very considerate

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:22.820
 about when they go and get screened for things, because if they find even something tiny that

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:28.820
 your body might mop up on its own, the doctors are going to push you toward having surgery,

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.820
 which may make the situation worse, or they may give you radiation, which they're still

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.820
 doing, which definitely causes more cancer. John Goff's five-year research that shows

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:43.820
 all medical interventions with radiation cause other cancers over time, especially if you're

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.820
 young. Anyway, go ahead.

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:53.820
 About 40 years ago, three different doctors diagnosed, told me that I should have a biopsy

00:48:53.820 --> 00:49:00.820
 on three different things. And since I had already been studying what doctors do and

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:11.820
 know about cancer, I ignored them and increased my thyroid and used a little nutritional addition

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.820
 like extra vitamin A and folic acid.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:15.820
 Methylation.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.820
 Methylation.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.820
 I put some progesterone and DHEA on the area.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.820
 Vitamin D.

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:28.820
 And so far, that's 40 years ago, and none of them have persisted.

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:34.820
 Okay, but I have known very smart people who did all kinds of really good things and held

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.820
 things off, and then things metastasized and weird stuff happened, which might come under

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:43.820
 the category of you've got to die of something. But we also do know about things like young

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:50.820
 people getting a melanoma and ignoring it, letting it go, and then it metastasizes.

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:57.820
 I don't think you should ignore things. You should try to figure out what signals are

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:06.820
 occurring in your body. The things that produce learned helplessness, I think, are sometimes

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:16.820
 after a certain age at least, there are signals from inside the body telling your nervous

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:25.820
 system to do something. And if your resources don't tell you what to do, then you can get

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:36.820
 pushed by symptoms into a more helpless state in which the medical signals to control you

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:43.820
 and make you more helpless, they just add to the internal stresses. So it's important

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:49.820
 to try to do something, but to figure out what the best thing to do is.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.820
 I would be remiss if I didn't get you to talk a little bit. You've talked a lot in all of

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:59.820
 your literature about radiation. And I think when we talked, you confessed to also being

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:06.820
 very concerned about the proliferation of microwave wireless radiation everywhere. I

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:12.820
 have interviewed lots of people all over the globe about this stuff and read a lot of research.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:16.820
 And part of the mechanisms here is that it causes, as you have always been concerned

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.820
 about, a shock and stress reaction in the body. It causes heat shock proteins to go

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:27.820
 up. It causes granulation in the mast cells. This is Olli Johansson in Sweden. So people

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:34.820
 get eczema, they get skin cancers in places where the sun doesn't shine. And people are

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:40.820
 getting a lot of heart symptoms, lots and lots of heart symptoms because of the hyperarousal

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:45.820
 this causes. So if you can spend a little time talking about, because I am getting,

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:49.820
 I'd like to hear you talk a little more about the heart and heart symptoms and stomach,

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.820
 your intestinal symptoms are big.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:58.820
 Yeah, the intestine really is where people should be paying more attention because any

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:05.820
 kind of stress or shock reduces circulation to your intestine. And that makes it more

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:13.820
 permeable or leaky. And aspirin, incidentally, is now being studied as possibly the best

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:20.820
 defense against a leaky intestine, even though there's a tremendous amount of Tylenol type

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:26.820
 propaganda saying don't use aspirin, it makes your intestine leak. But in fact, it prevents

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:32.820
 endotoxin and bacterial movement from your intestine into your bloodstream.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:40.820
 I'm sorry to interrupt you. You must be saying that if people use aspirin, to use real, honest

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:44.820
 to God, just aspirin, and to take it with food.

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:50.820
 Yeah, to dissolve it, preferably in water and take it with a good amount of food so

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.820
 it doesn't form a pocket of concentrated acid.

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:59.820
 Right, exactly. Yeah, it's a cool, bitter, basically.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:10.820
 Yeah, and what happens in following up the initial phase of shock where you have released

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:20.820
 too much histamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin are the main chemical factors, but the leaky

00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:30.820
 intestine allows endotoxin from the bacteria to be absorbed systemically, and that activates

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.820
 things like nitric oxide.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.820
 Yes, and do you know about Marty Paul's work? He wrote a book called The No-Oh-No Cycle.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.820
 Oh, no.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:43.820
 Yeah, we should get him to send you a copy. Anyway, what he's saying is that the cycle

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.820
 gets, it just goes crazy and it starts overproducing.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:55.820
 Yeah, the nitric oxide in some organs like the brain makes iron more toxic. The endotoxin

00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:06.820
 makes you absorb too much iron if it's present in your food, and the series endotoxin, iron,

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:14.820
 nitric oxide has one further step. Nitric oxide activates heme oxygenase, which produces

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:25.820
 carbon monoxide and releases free iron from the heme complex, which is kept as under control.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:33.820
 So iron participates, once it gets loose, participates in a series of activation that

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:43.820
 increases the local production of free iron, and that has been traced to dementia, Parkinson's

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:55.820
 disease, heart disease, diabetes, organ failure of a great variety. And, for example, just

00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:04.820
 studying the stressed brain, the traumatized brain, for example, blocking nitric oxide

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:10.820
 can, nitric oxide synthase can have tremendously protective effects.

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.820
 Yes, and we neglected, but you did mention it, that one of the things on the list here

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.820
 was to talk about iron and its toxic effects in the brain and its contribution to Alzheimer's.

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.820
 So, yeah.

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:26.820
 The ratio of copper to iron is one of the characteristics. It decreases in relation

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:33.820
 to the iron content of the brain in Alzheimer's, and copper is used in the superoxide dismutase

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:40.820
 that is an antioxidant, and in the respiratory enzyme that produces the energy which is lacking

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.820
 in all of the stress conditions.

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:48.820
 And one of the important issues here is that I learned long ago that when women were really

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:55.820
 high, or men, in estrogen, estradiol, they tended to bioaccumulate copper and be low

00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:02.820
 in zinc. So I found myself suggesting people avoid copper. Now I understand that most people

00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:07.820
 are bioaccumulating iron as well because of the diets, unless they're strict vegetarians.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:16.820
 In a comparison of female animals to male animals, especially the pregnant female, nine

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:21.820
 times as much iron from a given dose was absorbed by the female under the influence of high

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.820
 estrogen.

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:27.820
 That's right, and even though it increases your cerula protein, anyway, but the point

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.820
 is that iron status is very important. It's something that should be checked, and it's

00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:38.820
 very important to take copper because of its relationship to iron, and if your iron is

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:43.820
 high, there are lots of tricks. We actually did a show on iron overload with Richard Cunyon

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:48.820
 in our library, but we're running down on time. It's clear that we're going to have

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:53.820
 to have you on again and again and again.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:57:03.820
 So, if people want to read your articles, if they want to subscribe to your newsletter,

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:13.820
 they can go to raypeat.com. Do you want to say any last thing about wireless?

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:23.820
 Oh, well, one of my recent newsletters mentioned that working at a sewing machine in the factory

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:31.820
 for years had enough electromagnetic field just from the sewing machine in order to increase

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.820
 the risk of dementia.

00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:38.820
 So, just imagine if you're using a wireless router in your house and a cell phone and

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:45.820
 all the rest of it, because that's radio frequency versus, but they're all part of the spectrum.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:53.820
 Okay. What can I tell you? You're a wonderful interview, Raymond. I really appreciate you

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:59.820
 taking the time to go over this stuff with us. I hope that if people have questions,

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:04.820
 they will go to your website, raypeat.com, and read some of your articles, and we will

00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:06.820
 plan on having you back soon.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:08.820
 Okay. Any time.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.820
 Thank you so much, Ray Peat. Thank you again.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.820
