00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.080
 Know the source.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.880
 One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 Okay, here we are, hour number two of our little show.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.000
 It is, you know what, I need to, let me do this music for just a second.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.360
 I've got to make sure I don't have some water on.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.360
 I don't know if I turned it off, hold on, it's alright, hold on.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:51.840
 Okay, here we go.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:06.280
 So I just ran downstairs.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.320
 Now, I had it turned off, but I don't remember turning it off.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.880
 I've melted one of those pots before I was going to make some tea and decided not to.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.040
 Well, anyway, it's time for Mr. Ray Peat.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.320
 It's always fun to talk to this gentleman.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 It is the third Tuesday on One Radio Network where he so graciously agreed to come and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.160
 visit and take some of your questions and just kick around so much of his research and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.040
 we dig into all kinds of things.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.760
 He started long ago with a PhD from the University of Oregon.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.000
 He specialized in physiology.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.800
 He started working on hormones in '68, wow, 50 years ago, and wrote his dissertation in

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 '72 in which he outlined his ideas on progesterone and hormones closely related to it.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 The main thesis is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.920
 If you'd like to ask Dr. Peat a question, it is Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 Ray Peat, good morning.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 Good morning.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 How are you?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.920
 How are things up there?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.920
 Oh, very good.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
 It was sunny yesterday.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.920
 It could be again today.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 Are you getting some painting done or are you becoming like your own little Picasso guy?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480
 Not lately.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360
 I haven't done that for several days.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.800
 Do you do, Dr. Peat, do ongoing research all the time?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.600
 You always looking around?

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.480
 Yep, always reading and trying to figure things out.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.360
 Have you figured anything out recently where you had an "aha" moment?

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:57.400
 Yeah, a couple of things about how serotonin works.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:07.120
 For example, people have known for several decades, starting in the 1930s actually, people

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:19.360
 were realizing that hospital oxygen isn't good for people and a physiologist, based

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:28.760
 on how people react to altitude, the physiologist tried adding from 5% to 7% carbon dioxide

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.560
 to the oxygen.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.640
 They started using it in fire departments for resuscitating people and it worked very

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.800
 well so they tried it on newborn babies and found that it was good for babies to stimulate

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.960
 breathing.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:54.400
 It was used all around the country in fire departments for maybe five or ten years and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:05.360
 gradually went out of use but hospitals almost always keep oxygen, plain 100% oxygen on hand

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360
 for patients.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.680
 But several people in the last 20 or 30 years have started looking at the outcome when they

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:29.440
 oxygenize a person and when the blood saturation is approaching 100% saturation, when it's

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:45.160
 above 90% actually, the mortality starts increasing rather than decreasing and the hyper-oxygenated

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.800
 patients, actually about twice as many of them don't come out of the hospital.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:00.480
 What I realized was that that's been known as an effect of strenuous exercising where

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.840
 you breathe very intensely.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:13.080
 Your blood can become very over-oxygenated and they know that that increases prolactin

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.960
 as sort of a stress reaction hormone.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:25.720
 And so they tried just having a person breathe 60% oxygen or 100% oxygen and found that that

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.760
 drives their prolactin very high.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:41.320
 And I realized that what's happening is the lack of carbon dioxide in the blood when you're

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:51.840
 being treated with oxygen or just hyperventilating, that raises the pH of your blood, causes the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:02.840
 platelets to release their serotonin and serotonin drives up prolactin.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.480
 People have rejected that idea because they believed that there was a barrier, blood-brain

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.440
 barrier that would keep the platelet serotonin out of the brain.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:24.640
 But in fact, I had just been going over the evidence that in fact there is no blood-brain

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.200
 barrier.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:39.360
 When you have too much estrogen, for example, the enzymes in the capillaries of the brain

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.600
 lose their ability to detoxify serotonin and so it goes right from your blood into your

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600
 brain.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.200
 So let's unpack this a little bit.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:56.920
 So if folks over-exercise, we get too oxygenated and we lose too much carbon dioxide.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.920
 Is that right?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920
 By breathing fast?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.920
 If we breathe fast?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.920
 Yes.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.360
 And that's not a good thing.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.240
 Could that have been a problem for some of these people that would run 25 or 50 miles

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.360
 or something and fall over with heart attacks?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.360
 Yes, exactly.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:20.440
 And there are more than 300,000 people every year just in the United States who die with

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.880
 cardiac arrest.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:33.320
 And it's known that serotonin increases the delay between contraction and readiness for

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.640
 a new contraction.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:48.640
 And the SSRI, serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, increase that delay by raising

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.280
 your serotonin.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:08:01.680
 And so they are actually known to be able to increase the cardiac arrest frequency.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:09.080
 So that's what the SSRIs, Dr. Peter, are falsely doing, helping people to "feel better"

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.480
 by juicing up their serotonin levels.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.040
 That's the theory.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.720
 That's a theory, right.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.720
 That's a theory.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.720
 Not good.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.240
 Well, let's go back on the prolactin and the pH.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:28.000
 So is this prolactin substance something we don't, you said it increases the prolactin

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 when we over-oxygenate or over-exercise?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Yeah.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.320
 And starting in about 1965 when the birth control pills came on the market, there was

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.560
 suddenly an increase, I think it was about a hundred-fold increase in the incidence of

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.200
 pituitary tumors that secrete prolactin.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:09:00.120
 And that was an effect of the birth control pill creating prolactinoma tumors.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:09.360
 And that, I think, is because estrogen causes you to hyperventilate, interferes with your

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:19.160
 thyroid gland, which makes you produce carbon dioxide, which is an antiserotonin agent.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:28.920
 And so if you're high in estrogen or low in thyroid function, you're going to have effectively

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:36.200
 a shortage of carbon dioxide and an excess of prolactin and serotonin.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:44.520
 So when we do exercise, we want to work towards not breathing so much and retaining the carbon

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.800
 dioxide, getting stronger, getting the heart muscles stronger and the blood vessels and

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.080
 the muscles so we don't over-breathe.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080
 Is that right?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.200
 That can make the exercise much more effective.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200
 Much more effective.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.200
 Why?

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.200
 What's the carbon dioxide, Dr. B.?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.840
 What's it doing in the body when you're retaining it?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.840
 It's a good thing.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.560
 Yeah, it, for one thing, delivers the right amount of oxygen to the tissue.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:23.520
 The tissue, your muscle, produces carbon dioxide and the blood arriving in the capillaries

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:30.120
 release oxygen in proportion to how much carbon dioxide you're producing.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.680
 So that's how we get the oxygen to where we want it by having enough carbon dioxide in

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.680
 there.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:43.280
 Yeah, and the carbon dioxide, meanwhile, is keeping the pH of the blood in the proper

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:51.440
 range where the serotonin can be stuck in the platelets.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:59.220
 The platelets lose their affinity for serotonin if you don't have enough carbon dioxide.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:05.720
 So the fewer breaths we take every day as we're working or walking or on the computer,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.480
 the more carbon dioxide we're retaining?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:17.680
 Not really, only metaphorically, because if your thyroid function is low, you just don't

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.720
 need much oxygen in your tissues.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.360
 And then you can be hyperventilating even when you're only taking 10 or 15 breaths per

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.320
 minute because your tissue needs so little oxygen.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.680
 If you breathe at a normal rate, you're hyperventilating.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:48.400
 And the typical diabetic or hypothyroid person is going around just at rest with an excess

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:56.040
 of lactic acid in the blood because they're losing carbon dioxide and producing lactic

00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:02.200
 acid because they can't use the oxygen that is in the blood.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.200
 Because the thyroid function is low?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200
 Yeah.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200
 Wow.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.480
 Man, you're such a thyroid geek.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.640
 It's incredible all the little moving parts with this thyroid.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.680
 Man, very interesting.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.600
 So we had a fellow on the show the other day that suggested you could get one of these

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.280
 little laser temperature things.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.080
 You ever see these, Doc, where you have a little gun and you just put the laser and

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.840
 you can put it on water or I guess an engine or your skin and tell.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:38.480
 And he said if you put it on the bottom of your big toe, it should be around 90 degrees

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.680
 for proper thyroid function.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.280
 You think that could be valid, that idea?

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:54.640
 I've used the little infrared things that measure oxygenation of the tissues.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:01.960
 And hospitals even say you shouldn't get below 90% saturation.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:11.400
 And if you go down to 80%, they put you on super oxygen treatment.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:18.920
 And lots of people like to keep their saturation around 98%.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:28.800
 But using it in different conditions, I saw that in cold weather, I could be exercising

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:39.840
 or whatever, but in cold weather, my fingers always showed 98 or 99% saturation.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:47.360
 But when I was warm and my fingers were actually using oxygen, I could get my fingers down

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.520
 to 90% or 89% saturation.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:14:02.760
 So if your tissue isn't using oxygen, you can be dead and still have saturated hemoglobin.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.400
 So what's the message there?

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:15.240
 If you quick froze a person's hand, it would stay saturated with oxygen.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:22.680
 So those little gadgets that are sold so commonly and used in hospitals just don't say very

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.000
 much about your physiology.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.400
 Oh, you're talking about the little finger things that they put on people, right, right.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.040
 And they can show, I put mine on, it's generally like 96, 7, 8.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.200
 And I thought that's a good spot where you want to be, right?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.200
 When you put those on?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:45.600
 In general, that would be good, but on your finger, since temperature regulates the metabolic

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.240
 rate, you can't really tell very much.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.440
 But they put everybody on these things in the hospital, right?

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.200
 That's the first thing they do, stick one of these things on.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:02.400
 When they were first designed for hospital use, they were actually very sensitive and

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:08.200
 measured the up and down concentration of oxygen with each heartbeat.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:15.000
 But now they're just using these cheap things that show an average oxygenation and it all

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.240
 depends on temperature.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.360
 But what about the laser where they're taking the temperature of the toe and the toe is

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.320
 90 degrees, theoretically?

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320
 What do you think?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.840
 Do you think there's some validity to that?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.320
 Sure, if it's temperature.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:41.720
 If your feet are below, I think it's down around 80 degrees, they start producing inflammatory

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.760
 signals.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:52.360
 And it can cause your whole system to become stressed and responding to inflammation.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.560
 So warm feet, for example, will make you sleep better by reducing inflammation.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.920
 So that's the whole classic cold hands, cold feet with the low thyroid people.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.400
 That's what's going on.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:12.680
 Can you walk us through what's happening when the thyroid is not producing the way it should

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.800
 and how that translates into cold feet?

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.980
 I'm kind of curious about that, how that works.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:28.980
 The oxygen is making you burn fat and sugar, turning it into energy to use.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:37.900
 And in the process of producing ATP and using the ATP, you're producing heat in proportion

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.180
 to the amount of oxygen you're using.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:48.900
 And the thyroid is what makes you use oxygen to burn, preferably sugar, but also fat or

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.180
 protein.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:17:00.980
 And so in proportion to the health of your thyroid, you'll be consuming oxygen and producing

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.980
 heat.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:10.080
 So you can measure the heat a person is producing, but that would increase under the influence

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:18.060
 of stress and cortisol, which could be breaking down your tissues, not using oxygen.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.140
 So temperature alone isn't enough.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:27.020
 You have to know the actual amount of oxygen being consumed.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.700
 That's almost all under the influence of thyroid function.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:42.780
 And so in the 1930s and '40s, lots of doctors had their little apparatus, a can inverted

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:51.620
 in water with a hose to put over your nose, and then you would breathe for two minutes

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.260
 and measure the amount of oxygen consumed.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:01.660
 And using that test, 30% of Americans were hypothyroid.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:08.260
 But when the drug companies came on the market with a supposed way to measure the amount

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:16.620
 of thyroid in your blood, they convinced the whole world that only 5% of the population

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.260
 is hypothyroid.

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:30.420
 So immediately in the mid-1940s, people went from being 30% hypothyroid to only 5% hypothyroid.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.180
 So it was a great medical disaster.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:39.300
 Yeah, but you would think that their motive would have been to have more people being

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.020
 hypo so they could sell them more stuff, right?

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:51.180
 Yeah, except they made a simple physiological mistake.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.220
 They just got it wrong.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:19:00.060
 They thought that a blood test probably was more profitable to sell, a phony blood test

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.980
 than their chemical.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.420
 So I guess, if I hear you right, then taking the temperature of the toe with one of these

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:15.460
 laser temperature things would not be a good marker to use for the amount of thyroid you

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460
 need?

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.460
 Could it be closer?

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.460
 No, it's just one of the signs.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.460
 Just one thing, yeah.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:27.580
 Like when you shake hands with someone, if they have ice-cold hands in the summer, they're

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.300
 almost always hypothyroid unless they're just very nervous.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.420
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.420
 Very interesting.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.540
 Ray Peet is with us, Patrick Cimpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:41.540
 Stay right there, Dr. Peet.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.300
 We have a little sale going on here.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.860
 If you have a question for Dr. Ray Peet, we'll get them all in.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.500
 Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.900
 Sale going on in elk velvet?

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.780
 Have you ever wondered why elk velvet antler could be good for you?

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.180
 So every year they shed it, and then in the spring they begin growing a new rack in these

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.180
 set of antlers.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.020
 For three months, they grow it in three months.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.020
 Three months.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.380
 Think about the biggest moose rack you've ever seen, the biggest elk rack or deer rack

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.380
 you've ever seen.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.380
 That's three months of growth.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.380
 That's amazing.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.900
 So what you have is this organ that starts off as nothing and grows within three months

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.900
 to be an organ that's covered in skin, hair, veins, arteries, nerves.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.220
 It's totally innervated.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.180
 It's got bone and osteous tissue and bone marrow.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.940
 It's essentially a limb.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.580
 It requires special molecules like growth factors to accelerate the growth of it.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.260
 And so there's growth factors in there that grow all the types of tissue that are found

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.260
 on it.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.340
 Bone, bone marrow, nerves, skin, blood.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.140
 All of that is being grown by these growth factors.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.900
 And you can put that into your own blood and help yourself regenerate tissue.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.980
 Well that's why we use it around here.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.180
 You can click and order elk velvet antler from Daniel by Talis Surthrival.

 Oh, I see.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.900

 Wow.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.300
 That's a good deal, man, because that's pretty pricey stuff.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.300
 This is a real deal.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.260
 Stamina, balance, and strength.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:41.700
 So buy one elk antler gold or get yourself 50% off on pure potency.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:42.700
 Pretty cool.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.580
 It's right there if you click on the front page of One Radio Network.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.900
 And they'll hook you right up there and have some fun.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.260
 And also on Daniel's site, here's a little primer on colostrum.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.700
 Colostrum's this amazing food, and of course we have it in a powdered form, so it comes

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:01.020
 kind of like a dried milk, although technically colostrum's not really a dairy product.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.540
 It is the sort of first food for mammals.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.260
 It's made where dairy products are made in the body, or it comes from that same place,

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.220
 but not really a milk, even though it comes from udders.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:14.180
 And of course, all mammals produce colostrum, and they produce that colostrum to feed their

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.020
 young mammals.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:21.140
 Really love the idea that if we're going to have cows and we're going to milk them, that

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.100
 colostrum becomes the most medicinal part of that whole system.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.700
 So colostrum in human bodies does a lot of different things, but its primary stuff is

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.500
 it keeps the immune system in shape.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.420
 So when we're using colostrum, it keeps our immune system kind of like going to the gym

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.380
 almost, like keeps it fit so that we can fight off infections.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.860
 One of the things it does really helps us do really well.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.880
 That's a natural normal thing for us, but we're living in a world that really breaks

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.020
 our immune system down, so we need immuno-allies.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:56.860
 Probably nothing in the world supports our ability to stay antiviral the way colostrum

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.860
 does.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.860
 That's a lovely product.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.860
 We've been taking it for years.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.900
 Not that that means anything to you, but we have and love it.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:08.940
 You can click and order colostrum, and you can order the one or two kilo containers.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.220
 Get on the auto ship for the best price.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:15.300

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.300
 Yes, sirree.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.220
 Know the source, oneradionetwork.com.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:27.220
 It's the third Tuesday of the month, and Dr. Ray Peet is kind enough to visit with

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.460
 us on the third Tuesday.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.700
 He's a rock star around here.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.060
 He gets probably more hits than anybody around.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.140
 Just a lot of hits on the podcast, so keep your questions.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:42.700
 Dr. Peet, I have an interesting little tale about milk that I wanted to ask you about

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:43.700
 and get your opinion.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.300
 In Ayurvedic medicine, they suggest that if you get raw milk that you should boil it.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.740
 You know what I mean, boil it?

00:23:51.740 --> 00:24:02.140
 They say that it helps to absorb the fat more easily and helps if you have any bacteria

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.220
 or stuff that's not good from the cow, it's going to kill that.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.580
 So I've been getting some raw milk and doing that.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.780
 I got a new batch the other day, and in the first bottle I pulled out a half gallon and

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.380
 I boiled it just like I was and put a little cardamom and cinnamon.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:24.780
 I had what I would say probably one of the worst cases of food poisonings.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.380
 I thought I was going to die.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.460
 I thought I was going to die.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460
 But I made it through.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.460
 I didn't die.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.220
 A couple hours later, I was fine.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.380
 Two or three hours, I worked through it, but it was pretty terrible.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.940
 I threw that bottle out and I talked to a friend of mine who knows a lot about the raw

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.740
 milk thing.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:49.180
 They told me that, well, some people conjecture that if you boil raw milk that you could actually,

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:54.580
 if they have a lot of bacteria in there, you could actually make that more toxic and you'd

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:58.020
 be better off just warming it.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:01.260
 Can you comment on that comment at all?

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.860
 I wonder about the cardamom.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:08.100
 Are you used to using that?

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.100
 No.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.100
 No.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.180
 I would wonder if that might not have been an allergic reaction to that.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:18.420
 Well, it could, though, but I've been using the cardamom for a couple months, though.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.420
 No.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.420
 It wasn't that.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.180
 But how could you boil milk and get poisoned by it?

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.260
 I don't think it would make it worse.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:33.580
 I've for years used either raw milk or boiled milk.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:40.220
 In Mexico, we often used boiled milk because we didn't know the cows.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:46.660
 But when you have your own cow or know the cow, then raw milk is fine.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.860
 So if you're using raw milk from a source and you don't know exactly everything about

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:56.540
 the farm because you're not there, you think it's a reasonable practice to boil it?

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.180
 Yeah, or at least heat it.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:07.420
 You can inactivate the germs satisfactorily just by holding it at 160 degrees.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.460
 Maybe 160 or 170.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:17.100
 I wonder what the difference is between 170 and boiling it at like 212.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.620
 Is there anything that goes on in that range that we care about?

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.620
 Yeah.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:28.540
 It inactivates more proteins when you boil it.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:38.220
 There are theories that it improves or damages the digestibility, but it probably hasn't

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.620
 been researched enough.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.620
 I see.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.100
 So that's the argument or claim where it helps you digest it more if you boil it.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.740
 That's where they're coming from.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:54.540
 Yeah, in Mexico, lots of people feel that they just wouldn't be comfortable with raw

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.540
 milk.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.780
 It was the strangest experience.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.820
 That's all I had for dinner was the milk, so it wasn't anything else.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.540
 But what do you do with a situation like that?

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.700
 I guess you just go onward through the fog because you don't really know what happened,

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:07.700
 do you?

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.700
 Yeah.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:16.860
 I a couple of times got fairly sick from using organic raw milk.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:24.420
 I think it was because the cows were eating weeds that I was allergic to.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.420
 That's possible, huh?

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.420
 Possible.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.420
 Wow.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.340
 Now, right now, you're just doing, you're still doing milk, but you just do the store-bought

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.820
 organic milk, huh?

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.820
 Yeah.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.820
 Yeah.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.740
 So do you heat that at all or just warm it up a little?

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:44.740
 Yeah, often I'll warm it to have with coffee, but most of it I drink cool.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:50.620
 Well, here's an email from Nick and right on the milk question, I know that Dr. Pete

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:53.260
 is a big fan of milk, including low-fat milk.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.220
 Does Dr. Pete drink milk with added vitamins?

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:02.220
 And if so, does he have any concern with the vitamins and/or emulsifiers used?

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.620
 Is there a specific brand or manufacturer that he trusts?

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:15.980
 Well, I don't really trust them, but I drink it because it's available.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:25.140
 But yeah, I'm very concerned about the possible emulsifiers they use to get the vitamins in

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:27.180
 the solution.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:36.260
 But still, I have been using the commercial vitamin-added milk for many years and apparently

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.620
 haven't had serious problems with it.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.540
 Yeah, lots of them add that vitamin D, right?

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.540
 Is that what they say?

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.140
 They add vitamin D?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.140
 And A.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.180
 And O and A, too.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:52.940
 And they have to use, often use emulsifiers to make that happen?

00:28:52.940 --> 00:29:01.580
 I'm not sure, dairies haven't been willing to give me the details of how they do it.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.580
 I see.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.620
 The follow-up question was, does Dr. Pete drink homogenized milk or some type that is

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.980
 non-homogenized and perhaps low-temperature pasteurized?

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.860
 Yeah, I like the low-temperature pasteurized.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:26.540
 And usually I drink the homogenized just because it's convenient not to have to shake it up.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:33.580
 Does homogenization make it more difficult in general for humans to take milk?

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.780
 I don't think so.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:41.820
 I've seen the research that says there is a difference, but I don't notice any difference.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.660
 So that's just a myth that's been going on for the last 50 years, I guess.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:52.540
 Yeah, because our digestion effectively homogenizes it.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.900
 The bile acids are an emulsifier that break up the particles very thoroughly.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.900
 Cool.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.980
 So I wanted to ask a little bit about sugar.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:12.380
 We were taught over 20, 30, or 30 years that white sugar and white flour are just terrible.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.020
 It just kills you.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.700
 Don't eat white sugar and white flour and then you're going to be fine.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:23.980
 But you don't seem to be that much against white sugars per se, are you?

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.500
 No, not at all.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:34.660
 But the evidence was very clear that they were using a bleach to make flour white.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:45.500
 And the bleach was nerve toxic and they demonstrated dogs would have convulsions and other fits.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.500
 I remember that.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.500
 Yeah, I remember that.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.540
 That's where that whole white flour thing came from.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:56.260
 Yeah, but they changed to a less toxic way of bleaching the flour.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:59.380
 So it isn't a problem now.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:09.860
 And the white sugar, I don't know of any bleaching process other than using carbon activated

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:15.400
 charcoal to remove some of the color material.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:20.700
 But that isn't actually bleaching it, it's filtering it out.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.380
 So say a good white sugar, like a beet sugar, organic, is it really doing something good

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.580
 for the body or is it just adding a little sweet that's kind of fun, nice?

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:37.900
 It's sugar which is very, very highly purified.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:46.980
 It's more pure than many of the reagent chemicals they use in research labs.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:52.860
 It's washed to a crystalline purity.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:32:02.340
 And so it's almost perfectly free of allergenic material, which brown sugar can cause really

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:06.580
 intense inflammatory reactions for sensitive people.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.860
 And molasses even worse.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:20.100
 Molasses gets essentially the dirt, the smoke residue and such from burning the chain fields.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.140
 But the white sugar is very safe.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:36.140
 And since it has none of the problems of fats, it doesn't break down into inflammation promoting

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:46.820
 material like all fats do if you are under stress and have eaten too many fats.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.580
 So it's safe for diabetics, for example.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:33:02.620
 150 years ago in France and England, there were doctors who cured terminal diabetic patients,

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:09.860
 far advanced people wasting away by giving them as much sugar as they wanted, which was

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:19.460
 about 11 or 12 ounces of white sugar added to their regular meals of potatoes, beef,

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.580
 vegetables and such.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.700
 And they were curing diabetes like that?

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:26.700
 Yeah.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:34.460
 Two articles on my website describe their experiences.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:41.140
 How it works is that it suppresses the breakdown of fat in your body.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:47.820
 And the free fatty acids are constantly, when you're under stress, they are constantly killing

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.940
 the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:34:02.820
 And so you have a stressful event, produce free fatty acids, they kill off your insulin

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:12.380
 producing cells and so you're unable to oxidize the fat and it keeps you under stress.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:19.820
 And you can break the cycle as those doctors showed by letting them have as much sugar

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.380
 as they crave.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:29.300
 That in itself provides energy.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:34.860
 Your blood sugar might go up to 400 milligrams per cent or so, four or five times higher

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.060
 than normal.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:43.700
 But in doing that, it's providing the cells the energy they need to stop the stress reaction

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:51.060
 and that stops breaking down the fat, which is killing the pancreatic cells.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:35:01.860
 And glucose happens to stimulate the creation of stem cells, beta cells in the pancreas.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:10.420
 So sugar causes the cells to be renewed, free fatty acids kill them.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:15.240
 And so if you can break the cycle, keep your free fatty acids down, the glucose is going

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.500
 to renew your pancreas.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:24.340
 I guess you're not often asked to speak at the American Diabetic Association dinners?

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:32.660
 Wow, I mean that is so contrary, Dr. Pete, with what's going on in the world of diabetes.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:40.540
 About 50, 40, 50 years ago in Israel, some physiologist figured out, realized that it's

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:44.800
 free fatty acids that cause diabetes, not sugar.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.180
 Free fatty acids.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:53.340
 You produce free fatty acids when you're under stress.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:36:00.180
 Diabetics can't get the glucose into their cells and so they are having the equivalent

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:07.420
 of hypoglycemia, except it's neuroglucopenia.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:17.220
 Their brain can't get glucose and so it sends out signals to increase the food supply and

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:22.900
 that leads to the breakdown of fat and production of toxins.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:31.780
 So that is why some people could put on fat by taking too much sugar, that process, right?

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:44.220
 Oh yeah, if you eat more than you need, you will put on fat for sure.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:50.580
 I found some organic beet sugar after you kind of recommended possibly that might be

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.340
 a good choice, put it on milk and I really like it.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:58.940
 I mean it just kind of tastes great and I'm not dying or anything eating sugar so I think

00:36:58.940 --> 00:36:59.940
 I'm okay.

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:05.900
 Yeah, and the beet sugars are mostly, some of them are grown in California but a lot

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.940
 of it is grown in Idaho and up into the Dakotas.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:23.940
 And in the mountain areas especially, inland, the rainfall is depleted in deuterium and

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:32.420
 deuterium research in the last, ever since 1950 actually, but in the last five years

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:43.340
 there's been new research showing that heavy water, deuterium is age-promoting and when

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:54.060
 the rainfall has rained out some of the heavy water, the inland, the last rain to fall is

00:37:54.060 --> 00:38:02.620
 lighter water and so beet sugar has less deuterium than tropical cane sugar.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.620
 That's pretty cool.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.820
 Man, I like that because a lot of the beets are up there in that part of the world, is

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.020
 that where the big beet producers are?

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:19.380
 A lot of them in Idaho and up in the more inland areas.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:28.820
 I wonder, do we know how to get deuterium out of the water that we're currently drinking?

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:41.500
 Yeah, it's been done for the nuclear bomb industry, for example, but people have been

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:47.740
 trying to figure out ways to do it on a more practical scale.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:56.420
 But for many years I've figured that taking as much water as possible in the form of milk

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:04.300
 and orange juice, the cow and the orange tree are acting as filters.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:12.060
 As they age, they accumulate deuterium and the water that passes through them is somewhat

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.860
 deuterium depleted.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:19.620
 So the cows and the oranges could be our deuterium filter?

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.620
 That's how I've been doing it.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:21.620
 That's how you've been doing it?

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:22.620
 Yeah.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.620
 That's very interesting.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:28.020
 I don't quite understand how nature, you know I always like to kind of go back to God or

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:33.620
 nature Dr. Peake, would come up with water that would have something in there that wouldn't

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.620
 be good for us.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.260
 I mean, I don't understand that.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.260
 You know what I'm saying?

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.300
 Deuterium, we need water to live.

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:46.540
 Why would there be water that's heavier than what we need?

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:51.940
 I'm not sure.

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.340
 Nature does tend to filter it out.

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.820
 Oh, it does?

00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:05.540
 The rain process, you evaporate selectively the water with less deuterium and then you

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:15.300
 rain it out selectively so that the last rainfall, the interior of Antarctica has the least deuterium

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.740
 in the snowfall.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.540
 The interior?

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:32.380
 But up in the upper interior states of the U.S. around the Dakotas for example, they're

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.860
 the most depleted.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.060
 Very interesting.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.060
 Here's an email for you.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:43.940
 "From the 30s through to the peak of maybe in the 70s, many bodybuilders have taken large

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:49.620
 amounts of desiccated liver tablets to reportedly boost their ability to exercise and build

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.620
 muscle.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:58.340
 Does Mr. Pete think there's a possibility of the large amounts of hemi-iron, H-E-M-E,

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:04.220
 iron found in liver becoming a problem of iron toxicity for athletes using high doses

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:10.660
 of these supplements or is that form of iron less likely to cause inflammatory issues and

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:12.740
 relatively safe to use?"

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:22.060
 Yeah, the heme group is how we use it in the blood and the iron atom is isolated by the

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:36.940
 carbon framework and so when you eat meat, liver for example, the iron is isolated until

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:45.100
 it gets right into your bloodstream and cells, but if you take an iron supplement, the free

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:52.100
 iron ions react in your stomach for example.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:42:00.860
 People have analyzed multiple vitamin mineral capsules or tablets and found that they were

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:12.100
 adding iron in a tablet or capsule along with vitamin A and B12 and so on and the vitamins

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:19.580
 were destroyed right in the tablet before it was taken, but if that same thing happens

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:27.260
 in your stomach, if you take an ionized iron form, it will destroy the nutrients in your

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:32.340
 stomach or intestine before they're even ingested or digested.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:36.700
 Speaking of bodybuilders, have you ever seen, Dr. Pete, anything over the years that people

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.740
 that want to just build muscles and are working at it, you know, kind of focused on it for

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:52.780
 whatever reason, to take supplementally that would help them and not cause them any harm?

00:42:52.780 --> 00:43:03.980
 Doing the exercise in a proper way so you don't lower your androgens will make the exercise

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:17.140
 more efficient at restoring tissue, but the anti-stress program, everything that keeps

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:29.460
 your cortisol low leaves the androgens such as testosterone and DHEA active.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:36.300
 Keeping the cortisol low is something that the Germans discovered in the 1960s and they

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:45.260
 were accused of doping because their androgen level seemed impossibly high for an athlete,

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:53.020
 but it turns out that if you just don't exercise so hard, your androgens are much higher.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:44:01.980
 So they figured out a way how to kind of strengthen the muscle, put pressure on it, resistance

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:09.140
 on it, but not too much so the cortisol level didn't get too high, which turned it around

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.140
 the other way.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:18.780
 Yeah, the muscle, when it's properly stimulated, is actually producing testosterone or androgens,

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:22.860
 but if it's stressed, the muscle turns around and produces cortisol.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:23.860
 Wow.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.460
 How do we learn how to produce, do the muscle the right way?

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.740
 Is there a way to do that?

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:35.740
 The concentric contraction is one thing that protects the muscle.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:48.300
 If you lift a weight and then drop it without letting it down gradually, it's the lengthening

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.580
 of the muscle under stress that damages the muscle.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:45:04.020
 And so if you walk or run uphill, the dominant action is concentric.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:11.460
 But if you walk downhill, that injures the muscle because you're stretching the muscle

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.140
 under pressure.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:21.340
 So concentric contraction actually strengthens the muscle, makes it bigger, and that would

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:25.900
 be when you pull the weight up, say you have a 25-pound weight down at the bottom and you're

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.300
 pulling it up and you're doing a curl, would that be concentric?

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.900
 Yeah.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:34.980
 And then if you just drop it down slow, you're saying that just makes it...

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:43.540
 That's stretching the muscle while it resists, and that's doing microscopic damage.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.020
 Cortisol.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.500
 It damages the mitochondria, so it produces less energy.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:56.980
 And they've shown that in old people doing concentric contractions only, they can create

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.060
 new mitochondria and restore the energy system.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.060
 That's pretty cool.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.980
 Is there any way to do that without just dropping the weight?

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:04.980
 I guess I don't know.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.980
 How else would you do it?

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.780
 How else would you do it?

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:13.580
 They make machines that will do it, or you can ride a bicycle uphill and coast downhill.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.900
 Oh, that's cool.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.920
 But if you were doing like a chin-up, I like to do pull-ups, right?

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.780
 So if I pull up, that's my concentric.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:29.580
 So how would I get out of there without going the other way?

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.420
 Yeah, the gravity is stretching the resisting muscle.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:36.940
 I have to think about that.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:38.180
 Maybe I could just drop, right?

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.180
 Just drop.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:42.180
 Yeah, but you don't want to...

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:46.180
 No, but I wouldn't do it.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:50.860
 The stress on your legs of dropping is probably counterproductive.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.780
 Yeah, I'll think about that one.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:53.780
 Here's one for you.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.780
 This is a good one.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:59.860
 "If you can provide a lifestyle that actively reduces serotonin levels, are there any foods

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:06.300
 and supplements that people experiencing a sharp deficiency of dopamine can use to safely

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.340
 restore the body's healthy levels?"

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.940
 To restore dopamine?

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.940
 That's right.

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.940
 Let's see supplements.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.940
 Yeah.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:16.940
 Reducing...

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:17.940
 Yeah.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:28.940
 I think the important thing is to limit your tryptophan intake as far as you can without

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.940
 becoming protein deficient.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:37.780
 That's why I advocate gelatin because gelatin contains no tryptophan, which is the source

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:38.780
 for serotonin.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:45.700
 Ah, so that gelatin has the protein without the tryptophan.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:49.460
 Yeah, and it has the precursor for dopamine.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.860
 I thought we need a tryptophan to go to sleep.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:55.380
 No, not really.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:48:00.100
 It can, like histamine, too much serotonin keeps you awake.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:07.580
 What's the, generally the missing hormones that folks who have insomnia, sleep problems,

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:12.420
 which is epidemic in our culture, what are those hormones that are missing?

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:17.460
 Can those just be taken supplementally to help?

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.260
 Thyroid actually is the main thing.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.380
 Thyroid, wow.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:29.780
 Many years ago, sleep researchers found that some people never got below the second level

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.180
 of the four stages of sleep.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:40.940
 Thyroid deficient people went through the night without ever reaching the deep sleep

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.940
 stages.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:55.460
 I found myself on a trip when I would have trouble going to sleep from driving all day,

00:48:55.460 --> 00:49:04.140
 if I took five or ten micrograms of T3 thyroid, I would go to sleep perfectly in about five

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.140
 minutes.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.820
 Oh, just a little hit of that T3, five to ten grams?

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:09.820
 Micrograms.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.820
 Micrograms, wow.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:15.820
 A microgram is what, a thousandths of a gram?

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.820
 Yeah.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.820
 Wow.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.820
 No, a millionths of a gram.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:20.820
 Wow.

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:27.660
 How much would five to ten, I mean, that would be just like a very small, small, small amount,

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:28.660
 wouldn't it?

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:34.740
 Yeah, they make little tablets that are five or ten micrograms.

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.740
 Of T3?

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.740
 Yeah.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:44.820
 And I've seen it worked several times in other people.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:52.700
 I always feel free to give thyroid to doctors because they are supposed to know how to handle

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.700
 it.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:50:05.820
 But doctors with pain, pains that they couldn't control or insomnia have remarks that they've

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:12.900
 never seen such quick relief, better than morphine, one doctor said.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:16.100
 When he supplemented with the T3?

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.100
 Wow.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:19.220
 Here's a question for Dr. Ray Peet.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:24.860
 What does increasing thyroid have on testosterone and vice versa?

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:32.180
 The effect of increasing testosterone on thyroid levels, also the relative amount of increase

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.980
 someone might expect to see and any difference in men and women.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:42.300
 So let's see, increasing thyroid have on testosterone and vice versa?

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:57.900
 Yeah, too much thyroid can create stress and make your testosterone become wasted or not

00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.980
 produced.

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:08.980
 Not enough thyroid will cause the testosterone to be converted into estrogen.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:21.180
 Estrogen blocks the secretion of thyroid from the gland and testosterone overlaps with progesterone.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:29.220
 Progesterone has a powerfully releasing function on the thyroid gland so that when it has been

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:35.540
 blocked by estrogen, a dose of progesterone can reactivate the gland.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:44.060
 Testosterone has some of that supporting function for the thyroid but not as effective as progesterone.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.620
 Well done.

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:52.060
 What does Dr. Peet recommend for corns and calluses?

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.500
 Do you know anything about corns and calluses?

00:51:54.500 --> 00:52:02.260
 Oh, putting something on to soften the callus I think is the main thing.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:10.860
 Protect the cause, bad shoes cause the callus to form.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:18.980
 So if you get the right kind of shoe and then put something on to soften the material.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:24.700
 Salicylic acid and urea are things that have commonly been used.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.260
 Thanks for having Dr. Peet on once a month.

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.260
 Well, you're welcome.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.260
 It's our pleasure.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.260
 Thank Dr. Peet.

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:36.460
 How do we take the edge off of learned helplessness?

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:44.740
 In one of my newsletters, I went over several of the things that they've tested in animals.

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:55.700
 Food hormone is one, progesterone is another, an improved diet that shifts you away slightly

00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:07.500
 from the serotonin side of things because serotonin is at the heart of learned helplessness.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:16.860
 Harm avoidance is how one psychologist described the serotonin dominant condition, but learned

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:20.980
 helplessness is the extreme of harm avoidance.

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.620
 What is learned helplessness?

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:32.580
 With animals, they would torture them and not let them escape whatever the awful situation

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:43.260
 was, such as being thrown into a tank of water and forced to swim or drown.

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:56.400
 If they never had the experience before being put in a hopeless situation, animals would

00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:01.060
 sometimes let themselves drown in just a few minutes.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:09.580
 But if they had ever been in a situation like that, that they managed to escape after being

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:19.980
 threatened with a deadly condition, one escape experience would change their perspective,

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:25.240
 which would change their physiology so that they would then be able to sometimes swim

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:31.980
 for a whole day, many hours, instead of just a few minutes.

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:41.420
 So that is one of the interesting aspects of physiology that is usually almost never

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:49.900
 considered in medicine, but it can make the difference between resisting for maybe five

00:54:49.900 --> 00:55:00.060
 minutes or for 10 or 15 hours, a total difference in ability to survive just by changing your

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:04.140
 mental picture of how things work.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.140
 Hi Dr. Pete and Patrick.

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:15.180
 Can Dr. Pete comment on how hydrogen might work with the oxygen and possibly CO2?

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:19.100
 Does hydrogen affect the thyroid?

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.380
 It seems to work.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:29.340
 The body has dehydrogenase enzymes that are in the habit of receiving their electrons

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:38.500
 from a fat or sugar metabolism, but some people believe that they can receive electrons directly

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:48.300
 from molecular hydrogen and that seems to fit with the experience of using hydrogen

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:55.940
 gas as an anti-inflammatory agent during surgery, for example.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.900
 It seems to reduce the inflammation and stress.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:04.780
 Yes, they're using it in some places for stroke victims.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.540
 You know, after stroke they feed them the hydrogen along with the oxygen and it helps

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.620
 them to recover faster.

00:56:11.620 --> 00:56:19.180
 Yes, in my interpretation of what's happening, it's working the way sugar does.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:25.340
 Sugar provides a very generous amount of electron energy.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:29.940
 Hydrogen does that directly bypassing some of the enzymes.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.100
 Very interesting.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:36.260
 So on the CO2, she had mentioned that.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:37.820
 So people don't do that anymore.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:44.460
 You said the fire department did the CO2 for people years ago, but nobody does that anymore?

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.020
 CO2 with oxygen?

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:53.420
 I have heard of two or three hospitals in the United States and several in Europe.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:57:05.380
 In Germany, about 30 years ago, someone said that her father had a stroke while traveling.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:13.420
 He was 90 years old or so and went into a hospital in Germany and they put him on carbon

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.340
 dioxide therapy.

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:23.180
 He recovered and went back to finish his world tour.

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:29.900
 It's still pretty widely used in Germany and Eastern Europe.

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:34.140
 Dr. Ray Peet is with us, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:36.780
 He's here on the third Tuesday.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.780
 Good for us.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.300
 Here's a good one for you.

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:46.460
 Some sources advise that wearing a hat to keep the head warm slows the aging process.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.780
 Could there be anything to this?

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.180
 Yeah.

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:56.260
 Also putting on a soft wool cap for sleeping.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:03.100
 The head is the most intensely metabolizing organ.

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:09.340
 The kidneys and the heart and the brain have a very high metabolic rate.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:15.340
 Your head loses a lot of energy.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:23.420
 Big animals, one of the reasons they live longer is that their geometry has less surface

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.620
 area for losing heat.

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:35.220
 A mouse has very little mass to surface and so they radiate and lose by conduction to

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:39.300
 the air a tremendous fraction of their biological energy.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:46.460
 So in effect, they're living beyond their means.

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:52.420
 They spend energy faster than they can use it.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:59:03.340
 And putting a nice woolly hat on either in the daytime or at night is reducing the stress,

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:08.460
 basically making you keep more of your heat.

00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:19.300
 At the average temperature, 70 degrees, a person is losing more than half of their body

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:25.620
 energy according to some experiments by radiation, not just by skin contact.

00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:26.620
 At the top of their head?

00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:36.300
 No, all of their body is losing it, but the head is the hottest and so is the worst leak

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.740
 of energy.

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:44.860
 Perhaps that's where some of the old time, way back where people would wear these caps

00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.460
 to sleep or something.

00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:47.460
 Maybe that's what that was about.

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:52.500
 Oh yeah, I've been recommending a sleeping cap for a long time.

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.020
 Oh, see you're all into this stuff.

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.020
 I had no idea.

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:56.020
 A sleeping cap.

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.460
 I didn't even know you could buy a sleeping cap.

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:03.500
 They should be soft wool.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:09.060
 I bought some nice soft wool, beautiful organic socks to prepare for last winter because I

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.380
 don't have any heat in my home, Doc.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.740
 There's only one problem with that.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:18.900
 If you wash them and dry them, they're big enough to fit on your dog.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.900
 You don't want to do that.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:26.400
 I wasted like 30 bucks for these socks and I washed them and dried them and they reduced

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.380
 about 20% of the original size.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:31.180
 Oh my goodness.

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.620
 If you rinse them in cold water.

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.620
 That's the way to do it, right?

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:35.620
 Yeah.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.660
 Yeah, do the woolite thing or use the cold water and just hang them up.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.300
 Well, I'm going to do that if I buy another pair.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.700
 But wool's kind of good for those kind of things.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.700
 Why is that?

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:51.060
 The shape of the fiber.

01:00:51.060 --> 01:01:00.260
 Cotton is good but some wool has been treated too that isn't really as good as the crude

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.740
 natural wool.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:08.740
 There's something about the organic wool in pillows that they advertise about, let's see,

01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:13.780
 wicking the perspiration a little bit and doesn't absorb in there.

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:14.780
 Something like that.

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:15.780
 Is there something to that?

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.780
 Supposedly, yeah.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.540
 The wool fiber has a catalytic function.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:29.380
 I think it's not quite as good as activated charcoal but it can have a bacteria suppressing

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:30.900
 effect.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:40.620
 Wood fiber, butcher block made out of natural wood has a self-sanitizing effect because the

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:50.140
 structure of the wood cellulose units is toxic to bacteria.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.260
 Interesting.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:57.220
 I think the wool microscopic structure has that same bacteria suppressing effect.

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.660
 And the butcher block, does that still work if you put some kind of a surface on it like

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:05.100
 they like to do or do you have to just leave it just wood?

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.840
 Yeah, it has to be a natural structured wood.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:13.420
 Anything that seals the fine cellulose structure.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:22.180
 That'll stain up pretty well though, won't it probably?

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:26.580
 The traditional blocks I've seen looked clean after many years.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:35.620
 What does the doctor think is a good way to improve libido in men and women after age

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:36.620
 40?

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:43.900
 Is taking DHA, progesterone, pregnenolone a good approach?

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.740
 If they're in the right quantity.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:55.580
 I've known a couple of aging men who took 25 milligram tablets of DHA and their estrogen

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:03.660
 became as high as a young cycling woman and their liver's enlarged.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:09.660
 So you don't want to take more of the androgen than is optimal.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:20.460
 Like a young man produces about 12 milligrams per day of DHA and about four or five milligrams

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.100
 of testosterone.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:33.140
 And so if a person takes more than that amount, it's going to raise their estrogen and have

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:36.900
 a counterproductive effect.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.580
 Pregnenolone is the safest one to use.

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:46.420
 I experimented for a year taking about an average of three or four thousand milligrams

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.100
 of pregnenolone per day.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.740
 Had no side effects at all.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.340
 Three or four thousand milligrams?

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:58.900
 Yeah, where 30 milligrams is full replacement dose.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:01.020
 I was just for fun taking it.

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:02.020
 Just for fun.

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.020
 And what did you experience?

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:08.220
 I mean, were there good benefits from taking that much pregnenolone?

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:11.020
 Very high stress resistance.

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:12.020
 Felt very good.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020
 Ah, pregnenolone.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:14.020
 Pretty safe.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:20.660
 You did three to four thousand milligrams a day for years?

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.660
 For one year.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.020
 I ate a kilogram.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:30.860
 I had brought back a kilogram from Mexico and I ate it during one year.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:36.900
 And it helps your body to deal with stressful situations better?

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.260
 Yeah, that was my experiment.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:46.620
 My skin was sort of rejuvenated looking during that year.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:52.460
 I had got saggy skin around my eyes and that snapped back into shape.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.460
 With the pregnenolone?

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.460
 Yeah.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.460
 Interesting.

01:04:55.460 --> 01:05:02.660
 Is Dr. Pete familiar with centrophenoxene?

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:08.660
 Centrophenoxene, a way to remove lipofusion from the brain.

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:13.820
 There is a study with rats that damas is working.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:16.780
 If not, I don't know.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.940
 Could his research for the next show or give his opinion?

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.020
 Or that claims it's working.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.020
 Sorry, I misread that.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.380
 That claims it's working.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:36.700
 I've seen the experiments described, but I studied the production and metabolism of

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.420
 lipofuscon as part of my thesis.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:44.700
 And so I've been interested in it for a long time.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:52.900
 One group found that vitamin E was removing it from nerve cells, which is much safer than

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.300
 centrophenoxene.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:06:04.420
 But after they demonstrated that their vitamin E treatment was doing it, they did a control

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.140
 test.

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:14.020
 They had been administering vitamin E dissolved in ethanol and their ethanol control removed

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:21.740
 the lipofuscon almost as well as the vitamin E in ethanol.

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:30.180
 So a very tiny amount of alcohol seems to do the job very safely like vitamin E.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:31.180
 Excellent.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.180
 Excellent.

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.180
 Here's a good one.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:39.420
 He wants to know, "Many people are proponents of taking black cumin seed oil fairly regular

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:43.660
 for overgrowth of candida and other fungus and bacterial.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.620
 Does Dr. Pete have any experience with black cumin seed oil?"

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.140
 No experience at all.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.540
 Nothing at all.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:57.340
 But I've had a lot of experience with flowers of sulfur and candida and other fungus.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.340
 You mentioned that before, flowers of sulfur.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.460
 What is that exactly?

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:12.820
 It's precipitated or anything that produces a microscopically fine powder.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.620
 Ground crystalline sulfur does not work.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.940
 It has to be the non-crystalline fumed or precipitated sulfur.

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:26.140
 They call it flowers of sulfur.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.900
 That's like an antibiotic, isn't it?

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:28.900
 Did you say?

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:41.220
 Well, the fungus has exoenzymes that it secretes as part of its nutritional program.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:51.100
 These enzymes convert the sulfane form in the flowers of sulfur into sulfuric acid or

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.580
 hydrogen sulfide first.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:59.300
 The hydrogen sulfide acts locally on the fungus to poison it.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:05.940
 But the trace amount of hydrogen sulfide that it produces in your intestine, for example,

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.260
 has simply an antioxidant function.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:19.220
 Hydrogen sulfide is one of our intrinsic substances like nitric oxide.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.740
 It's produced by our own enzymes.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.740
 So we tolerate it and it has an antioxidant function.

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:32.620
 But locally for the fungus cell, it's very poisonous.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:38.940
 So the fungus kills itself by the way it metabolizes sulfur.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:39.940
 Excellent.

01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:44.900
 Dr. Ray P. Patrick Cimpone, we're going to wrap it up and do a quick little break and

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.020
 then we're going to get all the rest of the emails.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.900
 So stay right there at OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:56.860
 Did you know the AquaCure Browns Gas Machine reduces oxidative stress?

01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:02.120
 Hydrogen is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:08.220
 First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.820
 vitamin C, things like that.

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.700
 So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.940
 body and go right into the very DNA and repair it.

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:23.620
 First of all, you're repairing oxidative damage, but you're also reducing or eliminating free

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.620
 radicals.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.860
 Now, only the bad free radicals, which is another reason why hydrogen is good because

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.500
 you actually have free radicals in your body that you want to keep.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.700
 Example nitrous oxide.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:40.780
 The oxidative stress, is that the main thing that damages the DNA and causes the regeneration

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:45.100
 to stop, you know, euthane or getting older, immune organs?

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:50.020
 Is that at the base, George Weissman, of most of the issues?

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.020
 It's one of the issues.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.020
 Just one of them.

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:55.740
 But this comes back to that regeneration thing that I was talking about.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.100
 The cells won't regenerate.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:01.340
 You won't have stem cells and that sort of thing if you haven't got enough hydrogen.

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:06.660
 And if our body is not generating enough hydrogen, we get dehydrated.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.660
 Dehydrated.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.100
 Lack of hydrogen.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:14.180

 Wayne Blakely, you have a wide variety of different products that we promote.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.140
 I think there's 14 different ones, if that's correct.

01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.140
 Why so many?

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.060
 I mean, isn't a probiotic just a probiotic?

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:37.540
 No, there is well known, there's 28 probiotics out there that all help the body.

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:38.540
 That really help the body.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.620
 They're supposed to be in a healthy human being, including the bacilluses, which are

01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:44.500
 the lactic acid producers.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.540
 They produce food nutrients.

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:49.940
 And then there's bifidobacterium that helps form the molecules correctly.

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:54.700
 So there's different aspects of what you need, like for instance, alfalfa.

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.460
 Alfalfa is a great product.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:02.500
 It's got high in vitamin K, high in vitamin A, and it's totally safe to consume alfalfa.

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.940
 The problem with alfalfa is it's hard to digest.

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:10.380
 So we take alfalfa, pre-digest it into amino acids, enzymes and amino acids, so our body

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.700
 can simulate it much quicker.

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:16.060
 It's great for vascular system, bone production, things like this.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.060
 Oh, that's great.

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:20.540
 Alfalfa, that's just one of the many products you'll see in this store.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:24.460
 The Living Streams products on oneradionetwork.com.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:32.900
 Also, they have a moringa, and that comes in the, I think it's a half quart, maybe a

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.380
 quart, I think it's a quart.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:39.460
 And moringa, well, there's a lot of cool things going on with moringa.

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:44.540
 And again, Wayne was able to put it into a form with the probiotics where it's digestible

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:49.540
 and it's all broken down and you can actually, I mean, they sell moringa powder, moringa

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:50.940
 tinctures, all kinds of stuff.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.580
 But we think this is a really cool way to get moringa.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.900
 And you can read about all the benefits, and it's a food, and like the alfalfa, I think

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:02.660
 you do pretty fun and play around with it.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.180
 Sometimes I just take big swigs of it.

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.180
 I kind of like doing it.

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.380
 I don't know, it'd be fun to do an experiment and really like doing a lot of moringa.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:14.140
 You know, over a year or so, like Dr. Pete does sometimes, but I haven't done that yet.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.700
 Anyway, there's some cool things there in our store, Living Streams.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:27.620
 Two of the foods are the moringa and the alfalfa in our store, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:32.380
 We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being on OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:38.260
 The third Tuesday of the month, Dr. Ray Pete has allotted some time for us, and we're very

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.460
 grateful, Dr. Pete, that you do this.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.460
 Thank you so much.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:50.180
 Oh, here's somebody who wants to know if you get mucus drinking all that milk.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:58.380
 Mucus is our first defense barrier against alien substances.

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:10.140
 So our mouth, nose, respiratory tract, intestine, everything is coated with a protective layer

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.580
 of mucus.

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:19.140
 And if you get bad milk or if you're allergic to something in the milk, you will produce

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:23.380
 a copious amount.

01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:34.380
 When I eat lettuce, for example, I get a very congested cough, a tremendous amount of mucus,

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:39.300
 and anything that irritates your digestive system.

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:43.460
 Raw vegetables are one of the worst things for irritation.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:50.740
 But if a person is allergic to something in the milk, it will produce more mucus than

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:51.740
 normal.

01:13:51.740 --> 01:14:01.220
 So I think a lot of people just don't like the concept of consuming an animal secretion.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:04.220
 Yes, I understand.

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:08.140
 But doesn't mucus coat all the stomach and everything?

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.220
 Isn't that one of the protective things?

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.220
 Yeah.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:17.740
 For example, our stomach digestive acid would digest our stomach.

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:19.940
 Mucus protects against it.

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:26.940
 And mucus catches histamine, for example, and should protect against it.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:35.340
 Well, in my little milk thing, Doc, I had a big, big tablespoon of charcoal.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:38.660
 It felt like that really settled things down pretty quickly.

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.660
 It was miraculous.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.780
 Boy, it's good to have that around.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.540
 Isn't activated charcoal?

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.540
 Yeah.

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:50.340
 And it not only binds toxins, but it can chemically break them down.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:51.340
 Really?

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.340
 Wow.

01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:54.220
 Or especially if you're traveling, right?

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:59.580
 Have some of that charcoal, you never know what you come up with.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.860
 Here's one for you.

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:07.500
 Doesn't sugar rip arterial walls, which cholesterol then patches up?

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500
 No.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.500
 No?

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500
 Sugar, you say?

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500
 Sugar.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.500
 That's what the email was saying.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.500
 Sugar.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.500
 No, no.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.500
 No?

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:16.500
 Doesn't do that.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:23.180
 But so the whole metabolic syndrome of too many carbs producing sugar that inflames the

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:30.980
 arteries and the cholesterol comes in, that's just not a valid meme, paradigm?

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:32.580
 Yeah.

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:39.020
 Thousands of years ago, doctors noticed that people with what they called diabetes had

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.900
 sweet urine.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.060
 And so they called it the sugar disease.

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:56.740
 And in the 19th century, the sugar disease, since sugar was on the market by 1800, doctors

01:15:56.740 --> 01:16:05.660
 said, "Oh, you mustn't let the patient with sugar disease have any sugar at all."

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:12.860
 And so they would lock the sugar and carbohydrate away from them, which was the thing they most

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.580
 craved.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:24.100
 And this doctor in Paris, just not to be cruel, he thought it was cruel to let a person die

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.300
 without a taste of what they most craved.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:34.300
 And so he, just to be humane to his patients, let them have their sugar since he knew they

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.860
 were going to die of their diabetes.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:42.260
 But when they got all the sugar they wanted, they didn't die.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:47.260
 That was what they call now type one diabetes.

01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:48.260
 Type one.

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:49.260
 Yeah.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:57.540
 Diabetes, as originally defined, was a wasting disease in which you couldn't build tissue

01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:01.740
 because of the absence of insulin.

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:10.300
 And so you turned your muscles to sugar and the sugar was lost in the urine.

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:18.020
 And so it was a rapidly fatal disease, which they interrupted by giving them all the sugar

01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:19.020
 they wanted.

01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.020
 Fascinating.

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:24.660
 So the fasting blood sugar with the blood prick, you know, that thing, and then the

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:30.500
 A1C on a blood test, you're suggesting that these numbers are, use your term, are they

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.420
 meaningless?

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.140
 Somewhat meaningless.

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:41.380
 If you interpret them properly, you would then say what's happening to the sugar.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:45.340
 Why is the person making the sugar?

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:54.060
 And you would then look for the fatty acids in the blood and the amount of lactic acid

01:17:54.060 --> 01:18:02.420
 to see if they were wasting any sugar that they were using and how much oxygen they were

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.220
 using and carbon dioxide in the blood.

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:12.220
 All of the relevant things should be tested as well as the insulin.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:17.780
 Would be good to know how much insulin there is.

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:26.900
 People are often put on insulin treatment or other diabetic drug without measuring those

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:27.900
 things.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:32.380
 So they don't actually know what they're suffering from.

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:37.100
 So you're suggesting an A1C may be a viable thing to look at in the blood test, but you

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:41.900
 have to look at other things like the lactic and the fatty and really make a determination

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:48.460
 of what that is saying rather than just saying high A1C is bad and cut back on sugar.

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:57.260
 Because that actually is more an indicator of unsaturated fatty acid breakdown.

01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:05.940
 The glycation of proteins is not really glycation in most cases.

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:13.420
 It's really a chemical reaction produced by the small fragments of polyunsaturated fats

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:20.540
 that are breaking down, producing things like acrolein, which reacts and attaches to proteins

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:25.300
 and is interpreted as glycation.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:31.860
 And from fat is what most of it is.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:32.860
 Here's a comment for you.

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:35.540
 I bought 50 pounds of white sugar a couple days ago.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:41.340
 I get the benefits of the sugar and get my exercise by lifting the 10 pound bags as well.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:49.700
 Yeah, I buy 20 pound bags when people in the supermarket glare at me.

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:51.420
 They say, "What are you doing eating that sugar?

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.900
 You know you're going to kill yourself, fellow."

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.980
 That's hilarious.

01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:05.940
 So what's the difference, like honey, maple syrup, what's the difference with these foods?

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:10.100
 Are these guys generally good guys?

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:18.580
 They contain lots of nutrients, but the trouble is that they're produced by high temperature

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:25.020
 dehydration to make them concentrated in syrupy from the thin sap.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.260
 Oh, the maple syrup, yeah.

01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:34.580
 Yeah, and the heating process, since the natural sap contains some amino acids and proteins,

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:44.420
 when you heat sugar in the presence of amino acids, you get brown toxic material.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:50.400
 And it's the brown stuff which is allergenic and slightly toxic.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.260
 So if you're going to do honey, you want to make sure you're going to do honey that's

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.460
 never been, no heat whatsoever, just honey.

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.580
 Well, pasteurization temperature is fine.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:03.140
 Oh, you can actually pasteurize honey?

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:09.140
 Yeah, but when it reaches close to the boiling temperature.

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:11.780
 That's not good, yeah.

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:15.860
 I often get optic migraines, writes Robert.

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:22.820
 I think that is what they are called, where the vision gets like a wavy underwater or

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:25.860
 wavy mirror-like, the ones like in a circus.

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.380
 I've been trying to figure out what causes them.

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.260
 They often go away in about three to ten minutes.

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:35.660
 Stress, mold, toxins, any ideas I can look for?

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:45.340
 Yeah, the intestine is usually a trigger, but it's when you're not getting circulation

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:53.380
 to a part of your optic part of your brain, right close to where your optic nerve enters

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.020
 your brain.

01:21:56.020 --> 01:22:03.140
 You're having blood vessel spasms and serotonin is involved.

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:13.580
 Serotonin and sugar are first aid for that, getting your serotonin under control.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:20.660
 Thyroid is long-range preventive by keeping your carbon dioxide up.

01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.700
 It keeps the serotonin under control.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:30.420
 There's a really cool little product where you can get organic coconut milk with organic

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.980
 sugar and kind of a treat.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:34.500
 No wonder my body likes that stuff.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.980
 I mean, that's pretty good food, right?

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.500
 A little sugar, a little coconuts.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.500
 Holy cow.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:39.500
 Yeah.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:40.500
 Yeah.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:49.460
 I've known quite a few people who have taken sugar to sick relatives who were in the hospital

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:54.540
 being deprived of anything tasty.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:23:02.380
 One person who was in very bad condition had a couple of tablespoons of honey, got up and

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.380
 left the hospital.

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.380
 She felt so good.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.380
 That is so fun.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.740
 You know, isn't that hilarious?

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:13.060
 We've commonly come across the idea that moms don't give sugar before bedtime and the kids

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.060
 will get all...

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.060
 You know what I'm saying.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.060
 You've heard that, right?

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.060
 Oh, no, don't do it.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.060
 Yeah.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:22.940
 But I can eat one of these, like Natamu, this coconut and sugar in the middle of the night

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:24.140
 and go right back to sleep.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:27.660
 I mean, it's like I ate nectar from the gods or something.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:32.340
 Yeah, the blood sugar goes down at night, creating stress.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:37.580
 All of the stress hormones rise during the night and you can minimize that with, for

01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:40.020
 example, a glass of milk with honey.

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:41.020
 With sugar.

01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.020
 With sugar, yeah.

01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:43.020
 You told me that.

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.020
 You mentioned that before.

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.940
 That's what I do at night, is I put a little sugar in there.

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:48.060
 Wow, man, it's so great to have...

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.300
 Not it being the devil that we all thought it was.

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:59.260
 Question for Dr. Pete, according to longevity researcher Aubrey de Grey in his 2007 book,

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:07.900
 ending aging ketosis can be up to 40,000 times more chemically reactive on blood sugar than

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:12.620
 glucose due to methylglycol.

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.620
 Any comments?

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:14.620
 What's he saying here?

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:15.620
 Do you understand this?

01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:20.180
 No, I don't know what he said about ketones.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:26.140
 So enriching aging ketosis can be up to 40,000 times more chemically reactive on the blood

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:28.260
 sugar than glucose?

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:32.980
 Well, ketones can substitute for glucose.

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:41.860
 The brain can use them, but ketosis often refers to the condition that the body produces

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:42.860
 itself.

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:53.260
 If you find ketones in fruits and vegetables, they are very good for the brain and nerves.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:25:01.300
 But if you produce the so-called ketosis, it includes some things that are not at all

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.300
 ketones.

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:09.660
 They're called ketone bodies, but one of them is a reactive alcohol rather than a ketone.

01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:15.500
 And so the ketones you produce yourself have side effects.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:21.180
 If you get your ketones in your diet from food, they're fine.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:22.460
 Here's an email from Thomas.

01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:23.460
 He's in Sweden.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:24.460
 Good for Thomas.

01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:26.020
 Hi, Patrick and Dr. Pete.

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:32.220
 I was wondering if Dr. Pete has any opinions about this product being sold called Carbon

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:39.460
 60 and its claim to be an antioxidant extraordinaire.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:42.180
 They are tiny particles, buckyballs.

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:45.300
 Yeah, buckyballs, I think they are, yeah.

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:56.260
 And those are, I think, risky because the inflammatory triggers, a tiny particle in

01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:00.980
 a certain range can activate the inflammatory process.

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:08.100
 So the research is extremely interesting, but I wouldn't touch the stuff myself.

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:12.220
 Oh, because they're nano, you mean they're made, they're nano particles?

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:13.220
 Yeah.

01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:15.180
 Ah, it's the nano thing.

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:16.180
 Yeah.

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.180
 Yeah.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.180
 Okay.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:20.180
 Further, here's a second part.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:26.420
 What does Dr. Pete think about the general theory about antioxidants being molecules

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:33.260
 that give an electron to a free radical without becoming destabilized themselves, thus preventing

01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:37.900
 free radicals from taking electrons and causing damage?

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:43.060
 We need all these antioxidants to protect us against oxidative stress or are they a

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:48.180
 little overhyped in these antioxidant supplements?

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:59.940
 Yeah, anything that stresses us increases our antioxidant system.

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:09.100
 I think the worst damage to the body is an absence of oxidative processes or reductive

01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:15.780
 stress where for 50 years they've been talking about oxidative stress.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:27.660
 I think we have to avoid an excess of electrons and simply keep our oxidative system working

01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:35.900
 to consume the electrons, not to try to block them with antioxidants because the antioxidants

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:41.540
 in themselves can interfere with oxidative metabolism.

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:50.020
 Cancer cells are extremely well provided with antioxidant systems and that makes them dangerous

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.140
 and harmful.

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:56.260
 So don't go overboard on antioxidants.

01:27:56.260 --> 01:28:00.820
 So that's why you've never been a proponent of taking vitamin C, right?

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:13.020
 No, partly because our diet provides 3,000 milligrams a day if you don't eat grains.

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:20.740
 Just vegetables, meat, milk, eggs will provide thousands of milligrams of vitamin C daily

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:27.980
 in the form of dehydroascorbate, much of it which is not in the reference books because

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.140
 they don't measure it.

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:35.580
 And if we do eat grains, what does that do to the dehydroascorbates?

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:42.300
 Grains are the only major food that don't contain vitamin C.

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.300
 Oh, I see.

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.940
 But it doesn't hurt the good stuff that we brought in.

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:46.940
 No.

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:47.940
 Okay, good.

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.220
 So in regards to aspirin, here's an email for you.

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:59.500
 Dr. Peter had recommended it and I once heard him speak about the form he prefers.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.160
 Is it crystals or powder?

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:05.560
 He said the type he gets can be stored for a long time in the freezer.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.420
 Also can he share where he gets this from?

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:13.100
 How much would he recommend on a daily basis for an adult?

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.100
 Which vitamin?

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.100
 Aspirin.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.100
 Oh, aspirin.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.340
 Okay, good.

01:29:18.340 --> 01:29:20.140
 What form do you like?

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:29.540
 I use just USP aspirin, but salicylic acid is all right if you mix it with baking soda.

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:38.620
 But any aspirin that is in a form that doesn't choke you, it shouldn't be in a fine powder.

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:45.260
 But I use crystalline aspirin USP and I try to average about 300 milligrams a day.

01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:48.180
 And why do you take that?

01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:56.660
 Just because it protects against anything inflammatory pretty much.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:01.060
 Crystalline USP aspirin, 300 milligrams a day.

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:06.540
 So the aspirin that the docs are giving the guys for the heart and the blood thing, the

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:10.900
 baby aspirin, is there anything to that?

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:15.180
 I think the amount is too small for most people.

01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:21.580
 And if you take vitamin K, you don't have to worry about the bleeding thing from chronic

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.260
 aspirin use.

01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:26.220
 And vitamin K is in cheese, some cheeses?

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:28.980
 Yeah, aged cheese is a good source.

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:29.980
 Aged cheese, yeah.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:30.980
 Especially the blue stuff.

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:32.980
 Doesn't that have vitamin K, the blue stuff?

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.980
 Yeah.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:34.980
 Yeah.

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:37.380
 The blue stinky stuff, right?

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:44.100
 And Dr. Peet explained why the veins in the back of the hands are an indication of estrogen

01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:45.100
 status.

01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:55.940
 Well, stress where you, for example, might have low blood sugar, anything that weakens

01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:58.260
 smooth muscle contraction can do it.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:06.620
 But estrogen is a very common cause of that weakening of the smooth muscles.

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:13.700
 Varicose veins are an extreme example where chronic estrogen weakens the muscle.

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:20.460
 Absence of progesterone will let the veins bulge.

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:27.100
 So if the veins are bulging in the back of the hands, you would want to take, how would

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:30.140
 you balance that estrogen out?

01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:35.900
 Sometimes just a glass of milk or orange juice or some soup or something to get your salt

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.860
 and sugar up.

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.060
 That's often enough to do it.

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:47.260
 But if it's chronic, then correcting your whole diet and making sure your thyroid function

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.260
 is good.

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:51.180
 The old thyroid again, there we go.

01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:55.820
 La Palma is, "What are Dr. Peet's thoughts on the cause and function?

01:31:55.820 --> 01:32:01.100
 I have one and would like to remove it, but I would first like to know why my body made

01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:05.860
 it, and will it just make another if I remove the one I have?

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:09.060
 There's also many dogs get these little lipomas.

01:32:09.060 --> 01:32:11.380
 The vets say they just don't worry about them.

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.380
 They're just little.

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.380
 What are your thoughts?

01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:15.980
 Do you think they're the same for dogs too?

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:22.220
 Yeah, I don't really know.

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:29.420
 Hypothyroid people sometimes, if they have very high fats in their blood, that supposedly

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:33.460
 increases the risk of forming them.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:37.460
 But I don't think there's any harm in removing them.

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:38.460
 You don't think so?

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.460
 Yeah.

01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:40.460
 Here's one for you.

01:32:40.460 --> 01:32:47.300
 I have been in extreme estrogen dominance all my life and had many surgeries for stage

01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:48.300
 four endometriosis.

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:56.300
 I've had a complete hysterectomy five years ago and been taking two grams of transgenital

01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:01.500
 estradiol daily since the surgery as well as vaginal estradiol.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.940
 I stopped these.

01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:11.980
 Let's see, what's the question here?

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:20.820
 All of the women I've known who had endometriosis over the last 50 years have stopped having

01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:25.100
 all of their symptoms when they corrected their thyroid problem.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.780
 Thyroid, yeah.

01:33:27.780 --> 01:33:29.580
 They go on to talk about the progesterone.

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:33.380
 Do I need higher doses to combat the high estrogen?

01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:35.900
 So they're wondering about how much progesterone.

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:41.300
 But you're saying you would just definitely go right to the thyroid and look at that?

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:45.180
 Yeah, and check your estrogen levels.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:52.420
 The thyroid should bring the estrogen down under control.

01:33:52.420 --> 01:34:11.340
 Could Dr. Pete explain how someone could detox DDT or other pesticides out of the body?

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:18.460
 Keeping your liver function good is the basic detox method.

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:23.060
 Having a balanced diet, keeping your thyroid function up will make your liver handle things

01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:27.060
 optimally.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:37.300
 Dr. Pete's explanation of how concentric exercise helps build muscle and produce testosterone

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:43.380
 but using the muscle in the downward lengthening stroke produces cortisol and damages mitochondria

01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:49.100
 is interesting and suggests careful attention to our workout routine is important.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:54.260
 One way you could biohack your chin-ups would be to simply do them while standing on your

01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:58.980
 rebounder and avoid the chin downs by just dropping on the rebounder.

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:02.100
 So he's already thinking, it's interesting.

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:05.660
 Biohack it, you just biohack it, right?

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.980
 Well Dr. Pete, what's on your schedule today?

01:35:07.980 --> 01:35:10.220
 Anything really fun and interesting?

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:14.020
 No, I haven't thought about what I would be doing.

01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:15.180
 Yeah, me neither.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.780
 We'll figure it out when the time comes.

01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:21.620
 Well thanks again for being here on the third Tuesday.

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:27.900
 So tell folks on your website, you have a, it's every other month newsletter, right?

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:31.740
 And we always put the link there and folks can get that if they want, right?

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.740
 Yes.

01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:33.740
 GreatPete.com.

01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:36.420
 Drink your orange juice, drink your milk, have some fun.

01:35:36.420 --> 01:35:38.220
 Thanks Dr. Pete, we'll see you next month.

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.220
 Take care of yourself.

01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.220
 Okay, thanks.

01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.220
 It's been an honor.

01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:42.220
 Thank you sir.

01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:43.220
 Thanks for being here.

01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:44.220
 Bye.

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.220
 Dr. Ray Pete.

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:51.060
 See, orange juice and sugar and milk, who'd have thought it, right?

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.700
 All the fun stuff in life.

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:55.260
 I just love the whole sugar thing.

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.260
 I just think it's great.

01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:01.020
 Oh man.

01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:10.020
 I remember there was a, what was the book that, was it Gloria Swanson wrote about sugar?

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:14.620
 I read that and boy I'd been a sugar monster ever since.

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:18.660
 What was the name of that book?

01:36:18.660 --> 01:36:22.580
 Well I never should have read it I guess.

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.580
 Oh well, live and learn.

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.300
 Hope you enjoyed the show as much as we did presenting it.

01:36:27.300 --> 01:36:28.300
 We will see you tomorrow.

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.300
 We're going to have a good show.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:34.820
 I'm going to dig into more of my research on It Takes a Long Time to Get Young, the

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:36.820
 name of my book.

01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.380
 And in the second hour we're going to talk to Richard Mayberry.

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:45.980
 Richard Mayberry is a very interesting man.

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:51.460
 He's the one that coined the phrase, the two laws.

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:57.100
 And I challenge you to come up with something, maybe you can between now and tomorrow, of

01:36:57.100 --> 01:37:10.100
 what a potential illegal action would be that wouldn't be covered by these two laws.

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:21.180
 And they are, carefully chosen words, "Do all you have agreed to do and do not encroach

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:24.700
 on other persons or their property."

01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:31.060
 Richard Mayberry suggests if you follow these two laws, "Do all you have agreed to do

01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:37.220
 and do not encroach on other persons or their property," that would cover everything and

01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:38.220
 you're good to go.

01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.220
 What do you think about that?

01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:44.700
 Can you think of something that would end up in the courts where those two laws wouldn't

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:47.700
 cover?

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:50.380
 Email tomorrow and we'll talk about it.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:51.540
 But we're going to talk about a lot of things.

01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:56.940
 He's into investing, geopolitics, gold, silver, central banking.

01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:58.420
 He's a cool guy.

01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:05.920
 The early warning report he's written for years, it is Richard Mayberry, author of many

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.740
 books for Blue Stocking Press.

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:17.300
 He's a big fan with the homeschooling people that they do Blue Stocking Press.

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:22.620
 He wrote "Whatever Happened to Justice," "World War II," the rest of the story, "World War

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:25.180
 I," the rest of the story.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:27.140
 Some great books for kids.

01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:30.740
 "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy" about inflation.

01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.660
 Blue Stocking Press, some great books for kids.

01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:38.700
 If you want to give your kids some really cool things to read, check out Blue Stocking

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:41.580
 Press and Richard Mayberry's books.

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.580
 So he's going to be here tomorrow.

01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:43.580
 So we have a fun day.

01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:44.580
 I love you all very much.

01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.580
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:50.100
 Is there anything at all that I can do to help support you to reach your goals?

01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:51.820
 I'm just an email away.

 I love you all.

01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:00.820
 Thank you.

01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:02.220
 Oh, Doodle says bye.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:05.540
 May the blessings be.
