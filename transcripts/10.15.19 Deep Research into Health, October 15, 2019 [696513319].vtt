00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.960
 Know the source.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.960
 OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 Okay, here we are, hour number two of our little show.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 It is, you know what, I need to, let me do this music for just a second.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.680
 I've got to make sure I don't have some water on, hmm, I don't know if I turned it off.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.160
 Hold on, say that, hold on.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160
 I just ran downstairs.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.040
 No, I had it turned off, but I don't remember turning it off.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.560
 I've melted one of those pots before I was going to make some tea and decided not to.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.720
 Well, anyway, it's time for Mr. Ray Peat.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.000
 It's always fun to talk to this gentleman.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.560
 It is the third Tuesday on One Radio Network where he so graciously agreed to come and

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.680
 visit and take some of your questions and just kick around so much of his research and

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.880
 we dig into all kinds of things.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.560
 He started long ago with a PhD from the University of Oregon.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.280
 He specialized in physiology.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.640
 He started working on hormones in '68.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.920
 Wow, 50 years ago.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.720
 He wrote his dissertation in '72 in which he outlined his ideas on progesterone and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.800
 hormones closely related to it.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.720
 The main thesis is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.600
 If you'd like to ask Dr. Peat a question, it is Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240
 Ray Peat, good morning.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 Good morning.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 How are you?

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 How are things up there?

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 Oh, very good.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.240
 It was sunny yesterday.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.240
 It could be again today.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.960
 Are you getting some painting done?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.760
 Are you becoming like your own little Picasso guy?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 Not lately.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.560
 I haven't done that for several days.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 Do you do, Dr. Peat, do ongoing research all the time?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800
 Are you always looking around?

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.680
 Yep, always reading and trying to figure things out.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.200
 Have you figured anything out recently where you had an "aha" moment?

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.960
 Yeah, a couple of things about how serotonin works.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.280
 For example, people have known for several decades, starting in the 1930s actually, people

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.840
 were realizing that hospital oxygen isn't good for people.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.240
 A physiologist, based on how people react to altitude, a physiologist tried adding from

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.320
 five to seven percent carbon dioxide to the oxygen.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.960
 They started using it in fire departments for resuscitating people, and it worked very

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.960
 well.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.400
 So they tried it on newborn babies and found that it was good for babies to stimulate breathing.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.320
 It was used all around the country in fire departments for maybe five or ten years, then

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.600
 gradually went out of use.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.400
 But hospitals almost always keep oxygen, plain 100% oxygen on hand for patients.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.920
 But several people in the last 20 or 30 years have started looking at the outcome when they

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:21.760
 oxygenize a person, and when the blood saturation is approaching 100% saturation, when it's

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:31.520
 above 90% actually, the mortality starts increasing rather than decreasing.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.240
 The hyperoxygenated patients, actually about twice as many of them don't come out of the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.240
 hospital.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:48.800
 And what I realized was that that's been known as an effect of strenuous exercising, where

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.840
 you breathe very intensely.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.600
 Your blood can become very over-oxygenated, and they know that that increases prolactin

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.960
 as sort of a stress reaction hormone.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.720
 And so they tried just having a person breathe 60% oxygen or 100% oxygen, and found that

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.600
 that drives their prolactin very high.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.320
 And I realized that what's happening is the lack of carbon dioxide in the blood when you're

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:31.720
 being treated with oxygen or just hyperventilating, that raises the pH of your blood, causes the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:40.160
 platelets to release their serotonin, and serotonin drives up prolactin.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.240
 People have rejected that idea because they believed that there was a barrier, blood-brain

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.200
 barrier that would keep the platelet serotonin out of the brain.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:01.000
 In fact, I had just been going over the evidence that, in fact, there is no blood-brain barrier.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.120
 When you have too much estrogen, for example, the enzymes in the capillaries of the brain

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.320
 lose their ability to detoxify serotonin, and so it goes right from your blood into

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320
 your brain.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.920
 So let's unpack this a little bit.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.160
 So if folks over-exercise, we get too oxygenated, and we lose too much carbon dioxide, is that

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.240
 right, by breathing fast?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240
 If we breathe fast?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240
 Yeah.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.240
 That's not a good thing.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.320
 Could that have been a problem for some of these people that would run 25 or 50 miles

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.440
 or something and fall over with heart attacks?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.880
 There are more than 300,000 people every year just in the United States who die with cardiac

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.640
 arrest.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:02.120
 It's known that serotonin increases the delay between contraction and readiness for a new

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:15.400
 contraction, and the SSRI, serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, increase that delay

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.800
 by raising your serotonin.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:29.160
 So they are actually known to be able to increase the cardiac arrest frequency.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:37.040
 So that's what the SSRIs, Dr. Peter, are falsely doing, helping people to "feel better" by

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.760
 juicing up their serotonin levels.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760
 That's the theory.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760
 That's a theory, right.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760
 That's a theory.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760
 Yeah.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760
 Not good.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.480
 So let's go back on the prolactin and the pH.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.080
 So is this prolactin substance something we don't...

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.800
 You said it increases the prolactin when we over-oxygenate or over-exercise?

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.960
 Yeah.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:08.160
 And starting in about 1965, when the birth control pills came on the market, there was

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.080
 suddenly an increase, I think it was about a hundred-fold increase, in the incidence

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.720
 of pituitary tumors that secrete prolactin.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:26.160
 And that was an effect of the birth control pill creating prolactinoma tumors.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:35.240
 And that, I think, is because estrogen causes you to hyperventilate, interferes with your

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:44.200
 thyroid gland, which makes you produce carbon dioxide, which is an antiserotonin agent.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:53.400
 And so if you're high in estrogen or low in thyroid function, you're going to have effectively

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.680
 a shortage of carbon dioxide and an excess of prolactin and serotonin.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.080
 So when we do exercise, we want to work towards not breathing so much and retaining the carbon

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.000
 dioxide, getting stronger, getting the heart muscles stronger and the blood vessels and

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.240
 the muscles so we don't over-breathe.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.240
 Is that right?

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.840
 That can make the exercise much more effective.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.840
 Much more effective.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840
 Why?

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.960
 What's the carbon dioxide, Dr. Peat?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.460
 What's it doing in the body when you're retaining it?

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.960
 It's a good thing.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.220
 Yeah.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.200
 For one thing, it delivers the right amount of oxygen to the tissue.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:45.160
 The tissue, your muscle, produces carbon dioxide and the blood arriving in the capillaries

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.840
 release oxygen in proportion to how much carbon dioxide you're producing.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.440
 So that's how we get the oxygen to where we want it, by having enough carbon dioxide in

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440
 there.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440
 Yeah.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:05.740
 And the carbon dioxide, meanwhile, is keeping the pH of the blood in the proper range where

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:12.020
 the serotonin can be stuck in the platelets.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:19.220
 The platelets lose their affinity for serotonin if you don't have enough carbon dioxide.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.700
 So the fewer breaths we take every day as we're working or walking or on the computer,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.180
 the more carbon dioxide we're retaining?

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.180
 Not really.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180
 Only metaphorically.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180
 Oh.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:40.420
 Because if your thyroid function is low, you just don't need much oxygen in your tissues.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:47.060
 And then you can be hyperventilating even when you're only taking 10 or 15 breaths per

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.460
 minute because your tissue needs so little oxygen.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.780
 If you breathe at a normal rate, you're hyperventilating.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:07.380
 And the typical diabetic or hypothyroid person is going around just at rest with an excess

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:14.940
 of lactic acid in the blood because they're losing carbon dioxide and producing lactic

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:20.260
 acid because they can't use the oxygen that is in the blood.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.220
 Because the thyroid function is low?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.220
 Yeah.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.220
 Wow.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.220
 Man, you're such a thyroid geek.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.780
 It's incredible all the little moving parts with this thyroid.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.260
 Man, very interesting.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.260
 So we had a fellow on the show the other day that suggested you could get one of these

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.980
 little laser temperature things.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:39.980
 You ever see these, Doc?

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.420
 Where you have a little gun and you just put the laser and you can put it on water or I

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.500
 guess an engine or your skin and tell.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:54.020
 And he said if you put it on the bottom of your big toe, it should be around 90 degrees

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.660
 for proper thyroid function.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.620
 Do you think that could be valid, that idea?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:09.620
 I've used the little infrared things that measure oxygenation of the tissue.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:16.980
 And hospitals even say you shouldn't get below 90% saturation.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:26.420
 And if you go down to 80%, they put you on super oxygen treatment.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:33.660
 And lots of people like to keep their saturation around 98%.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:43.300
 But using it in different conditions, I saw that in cold weather, I could be exercising

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:54.100
 or whatever, but in cold weather, my fingers always showed 98 or 99% saturation.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:12:01.260
 But when I was warm and my fingers were actually using oxygen, I could get my fingers down

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.420
 to 90% or 89% saturation.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:14.900
 So if your tissue isn't using oxygen, you can be dead and still have saturated hemoglobin.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.820
 So what's the message there?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:26.340
 If you quick froze a person's hand, it would stay saturated with oxygen.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:33.580
 So those little gadgets that are sold so commonly and used in hospitals just don't say very

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.820
 much about your physiology.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.300
 Oh, you're talking about the little finger things that they put on people.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.920
 And they can show, I put mine on, it's generally like 96, 7, 8.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.420
 And I thought that's a good spot where you want to be, right?

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.780
 You put those on?

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.780
 Or not?

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.260
 Does it matter?

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:56.460
 In general, that would be good, but on your finger, since temperature regulates the metabolic

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.500
 rate, you can't really tell very much.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.100
 You can't really tell very much.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.380
 But they put everybody on these things in the hospital, right?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.060
 That's the first thing they do, stick one of these things on.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:13.140
 When they were first designed for hospital use, they were actually very sensitive and

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:18.820
 measured the up and down concentration of oxygen with each heartbeat.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:24.740
 And now they're just using these cheap things that show an average oxygenation.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.900
 And it all depends on temperature.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:33.100
 But what about the laser where they're taking the temperature of the toe, and the toe is

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.100
 90 degrees, theoretically?

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.100
 Oh, sure.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.100
 What do you think?

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.460
 Do you think there's some validity to that?

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.460
 Sure, if it's temperature.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.940
 Oh, yeah, temperature.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:52.020
 If your feet are below, I think it's down around 80 degrees, they start producing inflammatory

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.060
 signals.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:02.700
 And it can cause your whole system to become stressed and responding to inflammation.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:08.860
 So warm feet, for example, will make you sleep better by reducing inflammation.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:14.220
 So that's the whole classic cold hands, cold feet with the low thyroid people.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.700
 That's what's going on.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:23.020
 Can you walk us through what's happening when the thyroid is not producing the way it should

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.100
 and how that translates into cold feet?

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.900
 I'm kind of curious about that, how that works.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:37.100
 The oxygen is making you burn fat and sugar, turning it into energy to use.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:44.780
 And in the process of producing ATP and using the ATP, you're producing heat in proportion

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.660
 to the amount of oxygen you're using.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:53.300
 And the thyroid is what makes you use oxygen to burn, preferably sugar, but also fat or

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.300
 protein.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:02.300
 And so in proportion to the health of your thyroid, you'll be consuming oxygen and producing

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.300
 heat.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.540
 You can't measure the heat a person is producing, but that would increase under the influence

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:16.060
 of stress and cortisol, which could be breaking down your tissues, not using oxygen.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.500
 So temperature alone isn't enough.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.140
 You have to know the actual amount of oxygen being consumed.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.660
 That's almost all under the influence of thyroid function.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:36.220
 And so in the 1930s and '40s, lots of doctors had their little apparatus, a can inverted

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.660
 in water with a hose to put over your nose.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.680
 Then you would breathe for two minutes and measure the amount of oxygen consumed.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:51.460
 And using that test, 30% of Americans were hypothyroid.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:57.300
 But when the drug companies came on the market with a supposed way to measure the amount

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:03.780
 of thyroid in your blood, they convinced the whole world that only 5% of the population

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.780
 is hypothyroid.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:14.660
 So immediately in the mid 1940s, people went from being 30% hypothyroid to only 5% hypothyroid.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.700
 So it was a great medical disaster.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.900
 Yeah, but you would think that their motive would have been to have more people being

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.700
 hypo so they could sell them more stuff.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:32.580
 Yeah, except they made a simple physiological mistake.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.100
 They thought that a blood test probably was more profitable to sell, a phony blood test

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.860
 than their chemical.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.460
 So I guess if I hear you right, then taking the temperature of the toe with one of these

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:50.580
 laser temperature things would not be a good marker to use for the amount of thyroid you

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:51.580
 need?

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.580
 Could it be closer?

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.580
 Just one thing.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.580
 Yeah.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:01.780
 Like when you shake hands with someone, if they have ice cold hands in the summer, they're

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.260
 almost always hypothyroid unless they're just very nervous.

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.260
 Right.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.260
 Very interesting.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.260
 Ray Peat is with us.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.460
 Patrick Cimpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.460
 Stay right there, Dr. Peat.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.220
 We have a little sale going on here.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.780
 If you have a question for Dr. Ray Peat, we'll get them all in.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.420
 Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.820
 Sale going on in elk velvet?

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.740
 Have you ever wondered why elk velvet antler could be good for you?

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.100
 So every year they shed it, and then in the spring they begin growing a new rack in these

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.100
 set of antlers.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.740
 For three months, they grow it in three months.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.300
 Think about the biggest moose rack you've ever seen, the biggest elk rack or deer rack

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.300
 you've ever seen.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.300
 That's three months of growth.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.300
 That's amazing.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.820
 So what you have is this organ that starts off as nothing and grows within three months

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:49.300
 to be an organ that's covered in skin, hair, veins, arteries, nerves.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.020
 It's totally innervated.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.980
 It's got bone and osteous tissue and bone marrow.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.740
 It's essentially a limb.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.380
 It requires special molecules like growth factors to accelerate the growth of it.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.060
 And so there's growth factors in there that grow all the types of tissue that are found

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.060
 on it.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:12.820
 Bone, bone marrow, nerves, skin, blood, all of that is being grown by these growth factors.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.180
 And you can put that into your own blood and help yourself regenerate tissue.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.620
 Well, that's why we use it around here.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.820
 You can click and order Elk Velvet Antler from Daniel by Thales Surthrival.

 Wow.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.700
 That's a good deal, man, because that's pretty pricey stuff.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.860
 This is a real deal.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.700
 Stamina, balance, and strength.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.940
 So buy one Elk Antler Gold or you should sell 50% off on Pure Potency.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.940
 Pretty cool.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.780
 It's right there if you click on the front page of One Radio Network.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.100
 And they'll hook you right up there and have some fun.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.500
 And also on Daniel's site, here's a little primer on colostrum.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.500
 Colostrum is this amazing food.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.500
 And of course, we have it in a powdered form.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.740
 So it comes kind of like a dried milk, although technically colostrum's not really a dairy

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.740
 product.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.740
 It is the sort of first food for mammals.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.340
 It's made where dairy products are made in the body, or it comes from that same place,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.860
 but it's not really a milk, even though it comes from udders.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.860
 And of course, all mammals produce colostrum, and they produce that colostrum to feed their

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.860
 young mammals.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:41.100
 And I really love the idea that if we're going to have cows and we're going to milk them,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.260
 that colostrum becomes the most medicinal part of that whole system.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:48.580
 So colostrum in human bodies does a lot of different things, but its primary stuff is

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.920
 it keeps the immune system in shape.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:54.860
 So when we're using colostrum, it keeps our immune system kind of like going to the gym

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.260
 almost, like keeps it fit so that we can fight off infections.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.860
 One of the things it does really helps us do really well.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.200
 That's a natural, normal thing for us, but we're living in a world that really breaks

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.300
 our immune system down.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.300
 So we need immuno-allies.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:12.420
 Probably nothing in the world supports our ability to stay antiviral the way colostrum

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.420
 does.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.420
 That's a lovely product.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.420
 We've been taking it for years.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.140
 Not that that means anything to you, but we have and love it.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.580
 You can click and order colostrum, and you can order the one or two kilo containers.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.860
 Get on the auto ship for the best price.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.900

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.060
 Yes, sirree.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.060
 Know the source.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.060
 The source.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.060
 Oneradionetwork.com.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:41.380
 It's the third Tuesday of the month, and Dr. Ray Peat is kind enough to visit with

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.700
 us on the third Tuesday.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.700
 He's a rock star around here.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.060
 He gets probably more hits than anybody around.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.260
 Just a lot of hits on the podcast, so keep your questions.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:56.860
 Dr. Peat, I have an interesting little tale about milk that I wanted to ask you about

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.860
 and get your opinion.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:03.020
 In Ayurvedic medicine, they suggest that if you get raw milk, that you should boil it.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.140
 You know what I mean, boil it.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.540
 They say that it helps to, let's see, what is it?

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:15.940
 It helps to absorb the fat more easily and helps to, if you have any bacteria or stuff

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.620
 that's not good from the cow, it's going to kill that.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.860
 So I've been getting some raw milk and doing that.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.060
 I got a new batch the other day, and in the first bottle I pulled out a half gallon, and

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.620
 I boiled it, just like I was, and put a little cardamom and cinnamon.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.860
 And I had what I would say probably one of the worst cases of food poisonings I've ever,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.660
 I mean, just, it was, I thought I was going to die.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.020
 I thought I was going to die.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.020
 But I made it through.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.020
 I didn't die.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.020
 And a couple hours later, and I was fine.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.980
 And two or three hours, I worked through it.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:47.980
 But it was pretty terrible.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.500
 I threw that bottle out, and I talked to a friend of mine who knows a lot about the raw

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.500
 milk thing.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:22:00.720
 And they told me that, well, some people conjecture that if you boil raw milk, that you could

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.220
 actually, if they have a lot of bacteria in there, you could actually make that more toxic,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.340
 and you'd be better off just warming it.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.580
 Does that, can you comment on that comment at all?

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.180
 I wonder about the cardamom.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.780
 Are you used to using that?

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.780
 No.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.780
 No.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.260
 I would wonder if that might not have been an allergic reaction to that.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.600
 Well, it could, though.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.260
 But I've been using the cardamom for a couple months, though.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.260
 No.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.260
 It's not.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.620
 How could you boil milk and have a poison by it?

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.580
 I don't think it would make it worse.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:42.740
 I've, for years, used either raw milk or boiled milk.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:49.220
 In Mexico, we often used boiled milk because we didn't know the cows.

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:55.680
 But when you have your own cow or know the cow, then raw milk is fine.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.420
 So if you're using raw milk from a source and you don't know exactly where, you know,

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:04.220
 everything about the farm because you're not there, you think it's a reasonable practice

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.220
 to boil it.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.880
 Yeah, or at least heat it.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:16.140
 You can inactivate the germs satisfactorily just by holding it at 160 degrees.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.140
 Maybe 160 or 170.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:25.820
 I wonder what the difference is between like 170 and boiling it like 212.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.340
 Is there anything that goes on in that range that we care about?

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.500
 Yeah, it inactivates more proteins when you boil it.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:46.420
 And there are theories that it improves or damages the digestibility, but it probably

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.220
 hasn't been researched enough.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.220
 I see.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.660
 So that's the Ayurvedic claim where it helps you digest it more if you boil it.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.100
 That's where they're coming from.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:03.140
 Yeah, in Mexico, lots of people feel that they just wouldn't be comfortable with raw

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.140
 milk.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.260
 It was the strangest experience, you know, and that's all I had for dinner was the milk.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.420
 So it wasn't anything else.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.980
 But you know, what do you do with a situation like that?

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.140
 I guess you just go onward through the fog because you don't really know what happened,

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.140
 do you?

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:25.100
 Yeah, I have a couple of times got fairly sick from using organic raw milk.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:32.540
 And I think it was because the cows were eating weeds that I was allergic to.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.540
 That's possible, huh?

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.540
 Possible.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.540
 Wow.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.500
 Now right now you're just doing, you're still doing milk, but you just do the store-bought

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.020
 organic milk, huh?

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.020
 Yeah.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.020
 Yeah.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.860
 So do you heat that at all or just warm it up a little?

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:51.420
 Yeah, often I'll warm it to have with coffee, but most of it I drink cool.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.620
 Well here's an email from Nick and right on the milk question, I know that Dr. Peat is

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.220
 a big fan of milk, including low-fat milk.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.140
 Does Dr. Peat drink milk with added vitamins?

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:07.180
 And if so, does he have any concern with the vitamins and/or emulsifiers used?

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:13.060
 Is there a specific brand or manufacturer that he trusts?

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:19.740
 Well I don't really trust them, but I drink it because it's available.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:28.860
 But yeah, I'm very concerned about the possible emulsifiers they use to get the vitamins in

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.620
 the solution.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:39.660
 But still, I've been using the commercial vitamin added milk for many years and apparently

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.300
 haven't had serious problems with it.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.820
 Yeah, lots of them add that vitamin D, right?

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.820
 Is that what they say?

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:47.420
 They add vitamin D?

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.420
 And A.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.420
 And A too?

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:54.380
 And they have to often use emulsifiers to make that happen?

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.660
 I'm not sure.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:02.940
 Dairies haven't been willing to give me the details of how they do it.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.940
 I see.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:10.300
 A follow-up question was, does Dr. Peat drink homogenized milk or some type that is non-homogenized

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.140
 and perhaps low temperature pasteurized?

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.580
 Yeah, I like the low temperature pasteurized.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:26.020
 And usually I drink the homogenized just because it's convenient not to have to shake it up.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:33.140
 Does homogenization make it more difficult in general for humans to take milk?

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.260
 I don't think so.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:41.300
 I've seen the research that says there is a difference, but I don't notice any difference.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.300
 So that's just a myth that's been going on for the last 50 years, I guess?

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:52.020
 Yeah, because our digestion effectively homogenizes it.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:57.140
 The bile acids are an emulsifier that break up the particles very thoroughly.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.140
 Cool.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.740
 So I wanted to ask a little bit about sugar.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:10.100
 We were taught over 20, 30, or 30 years that white sugar and white flour are just terrible.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.780
 They'll just kill you.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.460
 Just don't eat white sugar and white flour and then you're going to be fine.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:21.740
 But you don't seem to be that much against white sugars per se, are you?

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.220
 No, not at all.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:31.300
 But the evidence was very clear that they were using a bleach to make flour white.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:42.180
 And the bleach was nerve toxic and they demonstrated dogs would have convulsions and other fits.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.180
 I remember that.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.180
 Yeah, I remember that.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.940
 That's where that whole white flour thing came from.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:52.700
 Yeah, but they changed to a less toxic way of bleaching the flour.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.860
 So it isn't a problem now.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:06.340
 And the white sugar, I don't know of any bleaching process other than using carbon-activated

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.860
 charcoal to remove some of the color material.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:14.060
 But that isn't actually bleaching it.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.800
 It's filtering it out.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.460
 So say a good white sugar, like a beet sugar, organic, is it really doing something good

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.860
 for the body or is it just adding a little sweet that's kind of fun?

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.860
 Nice.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:33.980
 It's sugar which is very, very highly purified.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:41.620
 It's more pure than many of the reagent chemicals they use in research labs.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:46.540
 It's washed to a crystalline purity.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:55.300
 And so it's almost perfectly free of allergenic material, which brown sugar can cause really

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.380
 intense inflammatory reactions for sensitive people.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.540
 And molasses even worse.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:11.100
 Molasses gets essentially the dirt, smoke residue and such from burning the chain fields.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.180
 But the white sugar is very safe.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:26.420
 And since it has none of the problems of fats, it doesn't break down into inflammation-promoting

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:35.660
 material like all fats do if you are under stress and have eaten too many fats.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.100
 So it's safe for diabetics, for example.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:49.540
 150 years ago in France and England, there were doctors who cured terminal diabetic patients,

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:55.980
 far advanced people wasting away, but by giving them as much sugar as they wanted, which was

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:04.340
 about 11 or 12 ounces of white sugar added to their regular meals of potatoes, beef,

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.900
 vegetables and such.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.700
 And they were curing diabetes like that?

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.700
 Yeah.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:17.540
 Two articles on my website describe their experiences.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:23.980
 How it works is that it suppresses the breakdown of fat in your body.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:30.300
 And the free fatty acids are constantly, when you're under stress, they are constantly killing

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:34.740
 the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:44.900
 And so you have a stressful event, produce free fatty acids, they kill off your insulin-producing

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:52.780
 cells and so you're unable to oxidize the fat and it keeps you under stress.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:59.780
 And you can break the cycle as those doctors showed by letting them have as much sugar

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:02.140
 as they crave.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:07.700
 That in itself provides energy.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:13.020
 Their blood sugar might go up to 400 milligrams per cent, so four or five times higher than

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.020
 normal.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.900
 But in doing that, it's providing the cells the energy they need to stop the stress reaction

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:26.220
 and that stops breaking down the fat, which is killing the pancreatic cells.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:35.540
 And glucose happens to stimulate the creation of stem cells, beta cells in the pancreas.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:41.860
 So sugar causes the cells to be renewed, free fatty acids kill them.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:46.400
 And so if you can break the cycle, keep your free fatty acids down, the glucose is going

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.980
 to renew your pancreas.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.900
 I guess you're not often asked to speak at the American Diabetic Association dinners?

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.660
 No, yeah. Wow, I mean that is so contrary, Dr. Peat, with what's going on in the world

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.660
 of diabetes.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:09.660
 Yeah, about 50, 40, 50 years ago in Israel, some physiologists figured out, realized that

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.060
 it's free fatty acids that cause diabetes, not sugar.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.180
 Free fatty acids.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:20.380
 And you produce free fatty acids when you're under stress.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:26.940
 Patients can't get the glucose into their cells and so they are having the equivalent

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:33.780
 of hypoglycemia, except it's neuroglucopenia.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:43.140
 Their brain can't get glucose and so it sends out signals to increase the food supply and

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:47.500
 that leads to the breakdown of fat and production of toxins.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:54.500
 My goodness, so that is why some people could put on fat by taking too much sugar, that

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.500
 process, right?

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:04.620
 Oh yeah, if you eat more than you need, you will put on fat for sure.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:10.860
 I found some organic beet sugar after you kind of recommended possibly that might be

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.580
 a good choice, put it in my milk and I really like it.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:19.140
 I mean it just kind of tastes great and I'm not dying or anything eating sugar so I think

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.140
 I'm okay.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:26.100
 Yeah, and the beet sugars are mostly, some of them are grown in California but a lot

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:36.780
 of it is grown in Idaho and up into the Dakotas and in the mountain areas especially, inland,

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:48.700
 the rainfall is depleted in deuterium and deuterium research in the last, ever since

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:55.100
 1950 actually, but in the last five years there's been new research showing that heavy

00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:08.660
 water deuterium is age promoting and when the rainfall has rained out some of the heavy

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:19.140
 water, the inland, the last rain to fall is lighter water and so beet sugar has less deuterium

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.220
 than tropical cane sugar.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:25.820
 That's pretty cool, man I like that because a lot of the beets are up there in that part

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.580
 of the world, is that where the big beet producers are?

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:37.300
 A lot of them in Idaho and up in the more inland areas.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:45.500
 I wonder, do we know how to get deuterium out of the water that we're currently drinking?

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:57.260
 Yeah, it's been done for the nuclear bomb industry for example, but people have been

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:06.700
 trying to figure out ways to do it on a more practical scale, but for many years I've figured

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:16.140
 that taking as much water as possible in the form of milk and orange juice, the cow and

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.580
 the orange tree are acting as filters.

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:27.220
 As they age, they accumulate deuterium and the water that passes through them is somewhat

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.020
 deuterium depleted.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:34.780
 So the cows and the oranges could be our deuterium filter?

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.780
 That's how I've been doing it.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.700
 That's how you've been doing it?

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:45.020
 I don't quite understand how nature, I always like to go back to God or nature, Dr. Peat, would

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.580
 come up with water that would have something in there that wouldn't be good for us.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.540
 I mean I don't understand that.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.540
 You know what I'm saying?

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:59.340
 Deuterium, we need water to live, why would there be water that's heavier than what we

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.340
 need?

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.340
 I'm not sure.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.940
 Nature does tend to filter it out.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.940
 Oh it does?

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:17.820
 The rain process, you evaporate selectively the water with less deuterium and then you

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:27.460
 rain it out selectively so that the last rainfall, the interior of Antarctica has the least deuterium

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:29.620
 in the snowfall.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.340
 The interior.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:44.180
 But up in the upper interior states of the U.S. around the Dakotas for example, they're

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.180
 the most depleted.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.180
 Very interesting.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.140
 Here's an email for you.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.780
 From the 30s through to the peak of maybe in the 70s, many bodybuilders have taken large

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:59.460
 amounts of desiccated liver tablets to reportedly boost their ability to exercise and build

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.460
 muscle.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:08.060
 Does Mr. Peat think there's a possibility of the large amounts of hemi-iron, H-E-M-E,

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:13.940
 iron found in liver becoming a problem of iron toxicity for athletes using high doses

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:20.380
 of these supplements or is that form of iron less likely to cause inflammatory issues and

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.380
 relatively safe to use?

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:31.740
 Yeah, the heme group is how we use it in the blood and the iron atom is isolated by the

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:46.260
 carbon framework and so when you eat meat, liver for example, the iron is isolated until

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.900
 it gets right into your bloodstream and cells.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:38:00.980
 But if you take an iron supplement, the free iron ions react in your stomach for example.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:09.660
 People have analyzed multiple vitamin mineral capsules or tablets and found that they were

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:20.140
 adding iron in a tablet or capsule along with vitamin A and B12 and so on and the vitamins

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.620
 were destroyed right in the tablet before it was taken.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:33.020
 But if that same thing happens in your stomach, if you take an ionized iron form, it will

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:39.780
 destroy the nutrients in your stomach or intestine before they're even ingested.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.020
 Speaking of bodybuilders, have you ever seen, Dr. Peat, anything over the years that people

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.100
 that want to just build muscles and are working at it, you know, kind of focused on it for

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:55.260
 whatever reason, to take supplementally that would help them and not cause them any harm?

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:56.260
 Anything?

00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:08.860
 Well, doing the exercise in a proper way so you don't lower your androgens will make the

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:14.340
 exercise more efficient at restoring tissue.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:27.340
 But the anti-stress program, everything that keeps your cortisol low, leaves the androgens

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.900
 such as testosterone and DHEA active.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:39.500
 Keeping the cortisol low is something that the Germans discovered in the 1960s and they

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:48.340
 were accused of doping because their androgen level seemed impossibly high for an athlete.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:55.380
 But it turns out that if you just don't exercise so hard, your androgens are much higher.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:04.180
 So they figured out a way how to kind of strengthen the muscle, put pressure on it, resistance

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:11.340
 on it, but not too much so the cortisol level didn't get too high, which turned it around

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:12.340
 the other way.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:21.020
 Yeah, the muscle, when it's properly stimulated, is actually producing testosterone or androgens.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.100
 But if it's stressed, the muscle turns around and produces cortisol.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.100
 Wow.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.660
 How do we learn how to produce, do the muscle the right way?

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.940
 Is there a way to do that?

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:37.940
 The concentric contraction is one thing that protects the muscle.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:50.180
 If you lift a weight and then drop it without letting it down gradually, it's the lengthening

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:55.260
 of the muscle under stress that damages the muscle.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:05.700
 And so if you walk or run uphill, the dominant action is concentric.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:13.160
 But if you walk downhill, that injures the muscle because you're stretching the muscle

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.820
 under pressure.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:22.760
 So concentric contraction actually strengthens the muscle, makes it bigger.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.060
 And that would be when you pull the weight up, say you have a 25-pound weight down at

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:31.940
 the bottom and you're pulling it up and you're doing a curl, would that be concentric?

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.940
 Yeah.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.420
 And then if you just drop it down slow, you're saying that just makes it...

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:47.380
 That's stretching the muscle while it resists, and that's doing microscopic damage.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.860
 It damages the mitochondria, so it produces less energy.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:58.340
 And they've shown that in old people doing concentric contractions only, they can create

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.420
 new mitochondria and restore the energy system.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.420
 That's pretty cool.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.380
 Is there any way to do that without just dropping the weight?

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.380
 I guess I don't know.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.380
 How else would you do it?

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.180
 How else would you do it?

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:14.820
 They make machines that will do it, or you can ride a bicycle uphill and coast downhill.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.300
 Oh, that's cool.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.320
 But if you were doing like a chin-up, I like to do pull-ups, right?

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.180
 So if I pull up, that's my concentric.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:30.220
 So how would I get out of there without going the other way?

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.020
 Yeah, the gravity is stretching the resisting muscle.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.820
 I have to think about that.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:39.060
 Maybe I could just drop, right?

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.060
 Just drop.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:43.060
 Yeah, but you don't want to...

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.700
 No, but I wouldn't do that.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.560
 The stress on your legs of dropping is probably counterproductive.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.280
 I'll think about that one.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280
 Here's one for you.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280
 This is a good one.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:00.400
 Along with diet and lifestyle that actively reduces serotonin levels, are there any foods

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:06.840
 and supplements that people experiencing a sharp deficiency of dopamine can use to safely

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.640
 restore the body's healthy levels?

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.480
 To restore dopamine?

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480
 That's right.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.480
 Let's see supplements.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.480
 Yeah.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.480
 Reducing...

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.480
 Yeah.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:26.880
 I think the important thing is to limit your tryptophan intake as far as you can without

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.920
 becoming protein deficient.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:35.760
 That's why I advocate gelatin because gelatin contains no tryptophan, which is the source

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.760
 for serotonin.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:43.680
 Ah, so that gelatin has the protein without the tryptophan.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:47.360
 Yeah, and it has the precursor for dopamine.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.800
 I thought we'd need a tryptophan to go to sleep.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.840
 No, not really.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:56.560
 It can, like histamine, too much serotonin keeps you awake.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:04.040
 What's the, generally the missing hormones that folks who have insomnia, sleep problems,

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.880
 which is epidemic in our culture, what are those hormones that are missing?

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.880
 Can those just be taken supplementally to help?

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.480
 Thyroid actually is the main thing.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.640
 Thyroid, wow.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:25.840
 Many years ago, sleep researchers found that some people never got below the second level

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:33.600
 of the four stages of sleep, and thyroid deficient people went through the night without ever

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.920
 reaching the deep sleep stages.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:47.880
 And I found myself on a trip when I would have trouble going to sleep from driving all

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:57.480
 day, that if I took five or ten micrograms of T3 thyroid, I would go to sleep perfectly

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.320
 in about five minutes.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.680
 Oh, just a little hit of that T3, five to ten grams?

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:04.680
 Micrograms.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.240
 Micrograms, wow.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240
 Yeah.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.920
 A microgram is what, a thousandths of a gram?

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920
 Yeah.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.920
 Wow, that's...

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.040
 No, a millionths of a gram.

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:15.040
 Wow.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:21.800
 How much would five to ten, I mean, that would be just like a very small, small, small amount,

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.800
 wouldn't it?

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:29.000
 Yeah, they make little tablets that are five or ten micrograms.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 Of T3?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Yeah.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.400
 And I've seen it work several times in other people.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:46.280
 I always feel free to give thyroid to doctors because they are supposed to know how to handle

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.280
 it.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:58.920
 But doctors with pain, pains that they couldn't control, or insomnia, have remarks that they've

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:05.360
 never seen such quick relief, better than morphine, one doctor said.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.240
 When he supplemented with the T3?

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.240
 Wow.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.880
 Here's a question for Dr. Ray Peat.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:15.520
 What does increasing thyroid have on testosterone and vice versa?

00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:22.320
 The effect of increasing testosterone on thyroid levels, also the relative amount of increase

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.080
 someone might expect to see, and any difference in men and women.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:32.240
 So let's see, increasing thyroid have on testosterone and vice versa?

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:45.560
 Yeah, too much thyroid can create stress and make your testosterone become wasted or not

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.520
 produced.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:55.880
 Not enough thyroid will cause the testosterone to be converted into estrogen.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:07.200
 Estrogen blocks the secretion of thyroid from the gland and testosterone overlaps with progesterone.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:15.240
 Progesterone has a powerfully releasing function on the thyroid gland so that when it has been

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:21.440
 blocked by estrogen, a dose of progesterone can reactivate the gland.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:29.000
 Estrogen has some of that supporting function for the thyroid, but not as effective as progesterone.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 Well done.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.120
 What does Dr. Peat recommend for corns and calluses?

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.440
 Do you know anything about corns and calluses?

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:44.400
 Oh, putting something on to soften the callus, I think, is the main thing.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:52.000
 That's the cause, bad shoes cause the callus to form.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.680
 So if you get the right kind of shoe and then put something on to soften the material.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.840
 Salicylic acid and urea are things that have commonly been used.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.360
 Thanks for having Dr. Peat on once a month.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.360
 Well, you're welcome.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.360
 It's our pleasure.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360
 Thank Dr. Peat.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:14.960
 How do we take the edge off of learned helplessness?

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:22.720
 In one of my newsletters, I went over several of the things that they've tested in animals.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:31.520
 Thyroid hormone is one, progesterone is another, an improved diet that shifts you away slightly

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:40.160
 from the serotonin side of things because serotonin is at the heart of learned helplessness.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:48.240
 Harm avoidance is how one psychologist described the serotonin dominant condition, but learned

00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:51.280
 helplessness is the extreme of harm avoidance.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.760
 What is learned helplessness?

00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:01.400
 With animals, they would torture them and not let them escape whatever the awful situation

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:09.560
 was such as being thrown into a tank of water and forced to swim or drown.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:19.000
 If they had never had the experience before being put in a hopeless situation, animals

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.120
 would sometimes let themselves drown in just a few minutes.

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:31.120
 But if they had ever been in a situation like that, they managed to escape after being threatened

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:34.320
 with a deadly condition.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:42.360
 One escape experience would change their perspective, which would change their physiology so that

00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:49.280
 they would then be able to sometimes swim for a whole day, many hours instead of just

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.280
 a few minutes.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:59.280
 So that is one of the interesting aspects of physiology that is usually, well, almost

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:06.800
 never considered in medicine, but it can make a difference between resisting for maybe five

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.840
 minutes or for 10 or 15 hours.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:17.680
 A total difference in ability to survive just by changing your mental picture of how things

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.680
 work.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.680
 How things work.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.680
 Wow.

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680
 Man, oh man, oh man.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.680
 Hi, Dr. Peat and Patrick.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:29.400
 Can Dr. Peat comment on how hydrogen might work with the oxygen and possibly CO2?

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.280
 Does hydrogen affect the thyroid?

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.560
 It seems to work.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:40.440
 The body has dehydrogenase enzymes that are in the habit of receiving their electrons

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.920
 from fat or sugar metabolism.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:50.000
 But some people believe that they can receive electrons directly from molecular hydrogen

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.120
 and that seems to fit with the experience of using hydrogen gas as an anti-inflammatory

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.840
 agent during surgery, for example.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.040
 It seems to reduce the inflammation and stress.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.760
 Yes, they're using it in some places for stroke victims.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:12.160
 You know, after stroke, they feed them the hydrogen along with the oxygen and it helps

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.280
 them to recover faster.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:20.680
 Yes, in my interpretation of what's happening, it's working the way sugar does.

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:26.240
 Sugar provides a very generous amount of electron energy.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.880
 Hydrogen does that directly bypassing some of the enzymes.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.880
 Very interesting.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.600
 So, you know, on the CO2, she had mentioned that.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.160
 So people don't do that anymore.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:42.280
 You said the fire department did the CO2 for people years ago, but nobody does that anymore?

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.880
 CO2 with oxygen?

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:51.440
 I have heard of two or three hospitals in the United States and several in Europe.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:52:03.120
 Germany, about 30 years ago, someone said that her father had a stroke while traveling.

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:10.920
 He was 90 years old or so and went into a hospital in Germany and they put him on carbon

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.320
 dioxide therapy.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:19.000
 He recovered and went back to finish his world tour.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.680
 But it's still pretty widely used in Germany and Eastern Europe.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:30.400
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.960
 He's here on the third Tuesday.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.960
 Good for us.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.960
 Good for us.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.520
 Here's a good one for you.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:42.720
 Some sources advise that wearing a hat to keep the head warm slows the aging process.

00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:44.960
 Would there be anything to this?

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.960
 Yeah.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:52.000
 Also, putting on a soft wool cap for sleeping.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.480
 The head is the most intensely metabolizing organ.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:03.000
 The kidneys and the heart and the brain have a very high metabolic rate.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.920
 And so your head loses a lot of energy.

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:18.160
 And big animals, one of the reasons they live longer is that their geometry has less surface

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.360
 area for losing heat.

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:29.640
 A mouse has very little mass to surface and so they radiate a tremendous and lose by conduction

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:35.000
 to the air a tremendous fraction of their biological energy.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.360
 So in effect, they're living beyond their means.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:46.120
 They spend energy faster than they can use it, in fact.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:56.000
 And putting a nice woolly hat on either in the daytime or at night is reducing the stress,

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.120
 basically making you keep more of your heat.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:10.620
 At the average temperature, 70 degrees, a person is losing more than half of their body

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:16.640
 energy according to some experiments by radiation, not just by skin contact.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:17.640
 At the top of their head?

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:23.160
 No, all of their body is losing it, but the head is the hottest.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.680
 And so it's the worst leak of energy.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:33.080
 Perhaps that's where some of the old, you see some of the old time way back where people

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.920
 would wear these caps to sleep or something.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.920
 Maybe that's what that was about.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:42.080
 Oh yeah, I've been recommending a sleeping cap for a long time.

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.480
 Oh, so you're all into this stuff.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.480
 I had no idea.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.480
 A sleeping cap.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.880
 I didn't even know you could buy a sleeping cap.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.880
 They should be soft wool.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.720
 Soft wool, yeah.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:58.280
 I bought some nice soft wool, beautiful organic socks to prepare for last winter because I

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.440
 don't have any heat in my home, Doc.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:02.960
 And there's only one problem with that.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:08.120
 If you wash them and dry them, they're big enough to fit on your dog.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.720
 You don't want to do that.

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:15.640
 I wasted like 30 bucks for these socks and I washed them and dried them and they reduced

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.640
 about 20% of the original size.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.400
 Oh my goodness.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.880
 If you rinse them in cold water.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.240
 That's the way to do it, right?

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240
 Yeah.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.840
 You can't just take a white thing or use a cold water and just hang them up.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.480
 Well, I'm going to do that if I buy another pair.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.880
 But wool's kind of good for those kind of things.

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.880
 Why is that?

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.680
 The shape of the fiber.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:47.120
 Cotton is good but some wool has been treated too that isn't really as good as the crude

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.960
 natural wool.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:54.800
 There's something about the organic wool and pillows that they advertise about, let's see,

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:59.520
 wicking the perspiration a little bit and doesn't absorb in there.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.520
 Something like that.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.520
 Is there something to that?

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.520
 Supposedly, yeah.

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.160
 The wool fiber has a catalytic function.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:12.400
 I think it's not quite as good as activated charcoal.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.480
 It can have a bacteria suppressing effect.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:24.680
 Wood fiber, butcher block made out of natural wood has a self-sanitizing effect because

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:36.600
 the structure of the wood cellulose units is toxic to bacteria.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:42.580
 I think the wool microscopic structure has that same bacteria suppressing effect.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:47.040
 On the butcher block, does that still work if you put some kind of a surface on it like

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.680
 they like to do or do you have to just leave it a la just wood?

00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:59.800
 Yeah, it has to be a natural structured wood, anything that seals the fine cellulose structure.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:07.280
 That'll stain up pretty well though, won't it probably?

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.760
 The traditional blocks I've seen looked clean after many years.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:19.840
 What does the doctor think is a good way to improve libido in men and women after age

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:27.800
 40 is taking DHA, progesterone, pregnenolone, a good approach?

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.680
 If they're in the right quantity.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:38.000
 I've known a couple of aging men who took 25 milligram tablets of DHEA and their estrogen

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:46.080
 became as high as a young cycling woman and their liver's enlarged.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.120
 So you don't want to take more of the androgen than is optimal.

00:57:52.120 --> 00:58:02.920
 Like a young man produces about 12 milligrams per day of DHEA and about four or five milligrams

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.240
 of testosterone.

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:12.120
 So if a person takes more than that amount, it's going to raise their estrogen and have

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:15.240
 a counterproductive effect.

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.240
 Estrogen is the safest one to use.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:23.720
 I experimented for a year taking about an average of three or four thousand milligrams

00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.480
 of pregnenolone per day.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.600
 I had no side effects at all.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.240
 Three or four thousand milligrams?

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:34.080
 Yeah, where 30 milligrams is a full replacement dose.

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.200
 I was just for fun taking it.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.200
 Just for fun.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:38.200
 And what did you experience?

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:42.480
 I mean, were there good benefits from taking that much pregnenolone?

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.840
 Very high stress resistance, felt very good.

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.840
 Pregnenolone.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:49.840
 Pretty safe.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.280
 You did three to four thousand milligrams a day for years?

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.280
 For one year.

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.200
 I ate a kilogram.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:02.320
 I had brought back a kilogram from Mexico and I ate it during one year.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:08.400
 And it helps your body to deal with stressful situations better?

00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:11.760
 Yeah, that was my experiment.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:18.120
 My skin was sort of rejuvenated looking during that year.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:23.960
 I had got saggy skin around my eyes and that snapped back into shape.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.960
 With the pregnenolone?

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.960
 Yeah.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.960
 Interesting.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:33.160
 Is Dr. Peat familiar with centrophenoxene?

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:39.160
 Centrophenoxene, a way to remove lipofusion from the brain.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:43.960
 There's a study with rats that Damas is working.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.080
 If not, I don't know.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.280
 Could his research for the next show or give his opinion?

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:51.280
 Or that claims it's working.

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.280
 Sorry, I misread that.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.680
 That claims it's working.

00:59:53.680 --> 01:00:03.160
 I've seen the experiments described, but I studied the production and metabolism of

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.000
 lipofuscon as part of my thesis.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.960
 And so I've been interested in it for a long time.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:17.000
 One group found that vitamin E was removing it from nerve cells, which is much safer than

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.760
 centrophenoxene.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:27.720
 But after they demonstrated that their vitamin E treatment was doing it, they did a control

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.720
 test.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:36.880
 They had been administering vitamin E dissolved in ethanol and their ethanol control removed

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:44.000
 the lipofuscon almost as well as the vitamin E in ethanol.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.560
 So a very tiny amount of alcohol seems to do the job very safely like vitamin E.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.560
 Excellent.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.560
 Excellent.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560
 Here's a good one.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:01.760
 You know, many people are proponents of taking black cumin seed oil fairly regular for overgrowth

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.680
 of candida and other fungus and bacterial.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:09.480
 Does Dr. Peat have any experience with black cumin seed oil?

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.960
 No experience at all.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.380
 Nothing at all.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:18.160
 But I've had a lot of experience with flowers of sulfur and candida and other fungus.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.200
 You mentioned that before, flowers of sulfur.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:23.320
 What is that exactly?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:33.520
 It's precipitated or anything that produces a microscopically fine powder.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.320
 Ground crystalline sulfur does not work.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.640
 It has to be the non-crystalline fumed or precipitated sulfur.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.840
 They call it flowers of sulfur.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.600
 That's like an antibiotic, isn't it?

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
 Did you say?

01:01:49.600 --> 01:02:01.360
 Well, the fungus has exoenzymes that it secretes as part of its nutritional program.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:10.720
 These enzymes convert the sulfane form in the flowers of sulfur into sulfuric acid or

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.200
 hydrogen sulfide first.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:18.260
 The hydrogen sulfide acts locally on the fungus to poison it.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:24.280
 The trace amount of hydrogen sulfide that it produces in your intestine, for example,

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.360
 has simply an antioxidant function.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:36.480
 Hydrogen sulfide is one of our intrinsic substances like nitric oxide.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.840
 It's produced by our own enzymes.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.560
 So we tolerate it and it has an antioxidant function.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:48.780
 But locally for the fungus cell, it's very poisonous.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:54.860
 So the fungus kills itself by the way it metabolizes sulfur.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:55.860
 Excellent.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:00.260
 Dr. Ray P. Patrick Cimpone, we're going to wrap it up and do a quick little break

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.620
 and then we're going to get all the rest of the emails.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.500
 So stay right there on OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:12.100
 Did you know the AquaCure Browns Gas Machine reduces oxidative stress?

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:17.380
 Oxidation is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot.

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:23.480
 First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.060
 vitamin C, things like that.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:29.820
 So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.060
 body and go right into the very DNA and repair it.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:38.740
 First of all, you're repairing oxidative damage, but you're also reducing or eliminating free

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:39.740
 radicals.

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:43.700
 And there are only the bad free radicals, which is another reason why hydrogen is good

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.220
 because you actually have free radicals in your body that you want to keep.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:48.420
 Example nitrous oxide.

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:55.080
 The oxidative stress, is that the main thing that damages the DNA and causes the regeneration

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.420
 to stop, you know, euthane or getting older, immune organs?

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:04.080
 Is that at the base, George Weissman, of most of the issues?

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080
 It's one of the bases.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080
 Just one of them.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.800
 It comes back to that regeneration thing that I was talking about.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.160
 The cells won't regenerate.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.080
 You won't have stem cells and that sort of thing if you haven't got enough hydrogen.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.360
 And if our body is not generating enough hydrogen, we get dehydrated.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.960
 The hydrated lack of hydrogen.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.000

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:37.760
 Wayne Blakely, you have a wide variety of different products that we promote.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.520
 I think there's 14 different ones, if that's correct.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.520
 Why so many?

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.440
 I mean, isn't a probiotic just a probiotic?

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.920
 No, there is well known, there's 28 probiotics out there that all help the body.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.920
 That really help the body.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.840
 They're supposed to be in a healthy human being, including the bacilluses, which are

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.680
 the lactic acid producers.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.160
 They produce food nutrients.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.560
 And then there's bifidobacterium that helps form the molecules correctly.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.640
 So there's different aspects of what you need, like for instance, alfalfa.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640
 Alfalfa is a great product.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:11.200
 It's got high in vitamin K, high in vitamin A, and it's totally safe to consume alfalfa.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.360
 The problem with alfalfa, it's hard to digest.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.640
 So we take alfalfa, pre-digest it into amino acids, enzymes, amino acids, so our body can

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.440
 simulate it much quicker.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.760
 It's great for vascular system, bone production, things like that.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:24.760
 Oh, that's great.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.280
 Alfalfa, that's just one of the many products you'll see in this store.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.440
 The Living Streams products on oneradionetwork.com.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:39.400
 Also they have a moringa, and that comes in the, I think it's a half quart, maybe a quart.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.640
 I think it's a quart.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:45.720
 And moringa, well, there's a lot of cool things going on with moringa.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.600
 And again, Wayne was able to put it into a form with the probiotics where it's digestible

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.080
 and it's all broken down.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:57.520
 And you can actually, I mean, they sell moringa powder, moringa tinctures, all kinds of stuff.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.840
 We think this is a really cool way to get moringa.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.160
 And you can read about all the benefits, and it's a food, and like the alfalfa, I think

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.920
 you do pretty fun and play around with it.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.440
 Sometimes I just take big swigs of it.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:11.440
 I kind of like doing it.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.640
 I don't know, it'd be fun to do an experiment and really like doing a lot of moringa, you

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.360
 know, over a year or so, like Dr. Peat does sometimes, but I haven't done that yet.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.440
 Anyway, there's some cool things there in our store.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:31.600
 Mainstreams, two of the foods are the moringa and the alfalfa in our store, oneradionetwork.com.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:37.400
 We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being on oneradionetwork.com.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:41.920
 The third Tuesday of the month, Dr. Ray Peat has allotted some time for us, and we're very

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.120
 grateful, Dr. Peat, that you do this.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.920
 Thank you so much.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.440
 Oh, here's somebody who wants to know if you get mucus drinking all that milk.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:07:05.320
 Mucus is our first defense barrier against alien substances, so our mouth, nose, respiratory

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:12.280
 tract, intestine, everything is coated with a protective layer of mucus.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:21.240
 And if you get bad milk or if you're allergic to something in the milk, you will produce

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:24.080
 a copious amount.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:34.080
 When I eat lettuce, for example, I get a very congested cough, a tremendous amount of mucus.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.080
 Interesting.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:41.600
 And anything that irritates your digestive system, raw vegetables are one of the worst

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.160
 things for irritation.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:51.520
 But if a person is allergic to something in the milk, it will produce more mucus than

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.520
 normal.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:08:01.960
 But I think a lot of people just don't like the concept of consuming an animal secretion.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.880
 Yes, I understand.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.840
 But doesn't mucus coat all the stomach and everything?

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.800
 Isn't that one of the protective things?

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800
 Yeah.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:18.360
 For example, our stomach digestive acid would digest our stomach.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.520
 Mucus protects against it.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:27.240
 And mucus catches histamine, for example, and should protect against it.

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:34.320
 Well, in my little milk thing, Doc, I had a big, big tablespoon of charcoal.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:37.640
 It felt like that really settled things down pretty quickly.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.640
 It was miraculous.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.760
 Boy, it's good to have that around.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.640
 Is it an activated charcoal?

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:43.640
 Yeah.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:49.080
 It not only binds toxins, but it can chemically break them down.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.080
 Really?

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.080
 Wow.

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.080
 Or especially if you're traveling, right?

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.200
 Have some of that charcoal, you never know.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.200
 Yeah.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.440
 Why don't you come up?

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.720
 Here's one for you.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:03.960
 Doesn't sugar rip arterial walls, which cholesterol then patches up?

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960
 No.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960
 No?

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.960
 Sugar, sugar, you say?

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:07.960
 Sugar.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.960
 That's what the email was saying.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.960
 Sugar.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960
 Sugar.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:11.960
 No.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.960
 No?

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.960
 Doesn't do that.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:19.120
 So the whole metabolic syndrome of too many carbs producing sugar that inflames the arteries,

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:26.440
 then the cholesterol comes in, that's just not a valid meme, paradigm?

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:28.000
 Yeah.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.600
 Thousands of years ago, doctors noticed that people with what they called diabetes had

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:39.040
 sweet urine, and so they called it the sugar disease.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:50.800
 In the 19th century, the sugar disease, since sugar was on the market by 1800, doctors said,

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:58.640
 "Oh, you mustn't let the patient with sugar disease have any sugar at all."

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:06.000
 And so they would lock the sugar and carbohydrate away from them, which was the thing they most

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
 craved.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:16.600
 And this doctor in Paris, just not to be cruel, he thought it was cruel to let a person die

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:19.640
 without a taste of what they most craved.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:26.480
 And so he, just to be humane to his patients, let them have their sugar, since he knew they

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.680
 were going to die of their diabetes.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:35.000
 But when they got all the sugar they wanted, they didn't die.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.840
 That was what they call now type 1 diabetes.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:47.920
 Diabetes, as originally defined, was a wasting disease in which you couldn't build tissue

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.000
 because of the absence of insulin.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.440
 And so you turned your muscles to sugar, and the sugar was lost in the urine, and so it

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:07.760
 was a rapidly fatal disease, which they interrupted by giving them all the sugar they wanted.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.760
 Absolutely.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.320
 So the fasting blood sugar with the blood prick, you know, that thing, and then the

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:18.880
 A1C on a blood test, you're suggesting that these numbers are, use your term, are they

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.840
 meaningless?

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.520
 Somewhat meaningless.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:30.920
 If you interpret them properly, you would then say what's happening to the sugar.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.600
 Why is the person making this sugar?

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:42.320
 And you would then look for the fatty acids in the blood and the amount of lactic acid

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:50.560
 to see if they were wasting any sugar that they were using, and how much oxygen they

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:54.040
 were using, and carbon dioxide in the blood.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.960
 All of the relevant things should be tested, as well as the insulin.

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.880
 Would be good to know how much insulin there is.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:13.320
 But people are often put on insulin treatment or other diabetic drug without measuring those

01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.580
 things, so they don't actually know what they're suffering from.

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:22.220
 So you're suggesting an A1C may be a viable thing to look at in the blood test, but you

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:27.000
 have to look at other things like the lactic and the fatty and really make a determination

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.580
 of what that is saying, rather than just saying high A1C is bad and cut back on sugar.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:42.360
 Because that actually is more an indicator of fatty acid, unsaturated fatty acid breakdown.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:51.060
 The glycation of proteins is not really glycation in most cases.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:58.540
 It's really a chemical reaction produced by the small fragments of polyunsaturated fats

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:05.420
 that are breaking down, producing things like acrolein, which reacts and attaches to proteins

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:09.820
 and is interpreted as glycation.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:13.260
 And from fat is what most of it is.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.260
 Here's a comment for you.

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.940
 I bought 50 pounds of white sugar a couple days ago.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:24.500
 I get the benefits of the sugar and get my exercise by lifting the 10 pound bags as well.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:30.420
 I buy 20 pound bags when people in the supermarket glare at me.

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.160
 They say, "What are you doing eating that sugar?

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.620
 You know you're going to kill yourself, fellow."

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:39.500
 That's hilarious.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:45.860
 So what's the difference, like honey, maple syrup, what's the difference with these foods?

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.660
 Are these guys generally good guys?

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:58.100
 They contain lots of nutrients, but the trouble is that they're produced by high temperature

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:04.340
 dehydration to make them concentrated in syrupy from the thin sap.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.740
 Oh, the maple syrup, yeah.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:07.740
 Yeah.

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:13.980
 And the heating process, since the natural sap contains some amino acids and proteins,

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:23.740
 when you heat sugar in the presence of amino acids, you get brown toxic material.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.700
 And it's the brown stuff which is allergenic and slightly toxic.

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.540
 So if you're going to do honey, you want to make sure you're going to do honey that's

01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.740
 never been, no heat whatsoever, just honey.

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:38.860
 Well, pasteurization temperature is fine, doesn't cause that.

01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:41.300
 Oh, you can actually pasteurize honey?

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:46.940
 Yeah, but when it reaches close to the boiling temperature.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.940
 That's not good.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.980
 I often get optic migraines, writes Robert.

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:58.740
 I think that is what they are called, where the vision gets like a wavy underwater or

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.780
 wavy mirror-like, the ones like in a circus.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.620
 I've been trying to figure out what causes them.

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.420
 They often go away in about three to 10 minutes.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.500
 Stress, mold, toxins, any ideas I can look for?

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:19.860
 Yeah, the intestine is usually a trigger, but it's when you're not getting circulation

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:26.220
 to a part of your optic part of your brain, right close to where your optic nerve enters

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.260
 your brain.

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.860
 You're having blood vessel spasms.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.300
 And serotonin is involved.

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:41.460
 Serotonin and sugar are first aid for that, getting your serotonin under control.

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:47.500
 Thyroid is long-range preventive by keeping your carbon dioxide up.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.220
 It keeps the serotonin under control.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:54.740
 There's a really cool little product where you can get coconut, organic coconut milk

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:57.740
 with organic sugar and kind of a treat.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.460
 And no wonder my body likes that stuff.

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.980
 I mean, that's pretty good food, right?

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.700
 Little sugar, little coconuts, holy cow.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.700
 Yeah.

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:05.700
 Yeah.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:14.340
 I've known quite a few people who have taken sugar to sick relatives who were in the hospital

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:18.740
 being deprived of anything tasty.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:26.940
 And one person who was in very bad condition had a couple tablespoons of honey, got up

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:27.940
 and left the hospital.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:28.940
 She felt so good.

01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:29.940
 That is so fun.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.460
 Isn't that hilarious?

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:37.780
 We've commonly come across the idea that moms don't give sugar before bedtime and the kids

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780
 will get all...

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.780
 You know what I'm saying.

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780
 You've heard that, right?

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.780
 Oh, no, don't do it.

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:47.780
 But I can eat one of these, like Natamu, this coconut and sugar in the middle of the night

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:48.780
 and go right back to sleep.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.420
 I mean, it's like I ate nectar from the gods or something.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:57.100
 Yeah, the blood sugar goes down at night, creating stress.

01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:01.980
 All of the stress hormones rise during the night and you can minimize that with, for

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:04.500
 example, a glass of milk with honey.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.500
 With sugar.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.500
 With sugar, yeah.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:07.500
 You told me that.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.500
 You mentioned that before.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.500
 That's what I do at night, is I put a little sugar in there.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.500
 Wow, man, it's so great to have.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:16.700
 Not it being the devil that we all thought it was.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.700
 Question for Dr. Peat.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:26.260
 According to longevity researcher Aubrey de Grey in his 2007 book, ending aging ketosis

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:34.140
 can be up to 40,000 times more chemically reactive on blood sugar than glucose due to

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.140
 methylglycol.

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.140
 Any comments?

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:37.140
 What's he saying here?

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.140
 Do you understand this?

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:44.540
 No, I don't know what he said about ketones.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:50.540
 So enriching aging ketosis can be up to 40,000 times more chemically reactive on the blood

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:52.540
 sugar than glucose?

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:56.900
 Well, ketones can substitute for glucose.

01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:03.460
 The brain can use them, but ketosis often refers to the condition that the body produces

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:04.460
 itself.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:11.420
 If you find ketones in fruits and vegetables, they are very good for the brain and nerves.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:17.620
 But if you produce the so-called ketosis, it includes some things that are not at all

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.620
 ketones.

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:24.900
 They're called ketone bodies, but one of them is a reactive alcohol rather than a ketone.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:28.780
 And so the ketones you produce yourself have side effects.

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:33.380
 If you get your ketones in your diet from food, they're fine.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.660
 Here's an email from Thomas.

01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:35.660
 He's in Sweden.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:36.660
 Good for Thomas.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.860
 Hi, Patrick and Dr. Peat.

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:44.060
 I was wondering if Dr. Peat has any opinions about this product being sold called Carbon

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:50.180
 60 and its claim to be an antioxidant extraordinaire.

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:52.660
 They are tiny particles, buckyballs.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.980
 Yeah, buckyballs, I think they are, yeah.

01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:06.180
 And those are, I think, risky because the inflammatory triggers, a tiny particle in

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:10.660
 a certain range can activate the inflammatory process.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:17.740
 So the research is extremely interesting, but I wouldn't touch the stuff myself.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:22.020
 Oh, because they're nano, you mean they're made, they're nano particles?

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.020
 Yeah.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.900
 Ah, it's the nano thing.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:25.900
 Yeah.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.900
 Yeah.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.900
 Okay.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:28.900
 Further, here's a second part.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:35.500
 What does Dr. Peat think about the general theory about antioxidants being molecules

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:42.340
 that give an electron to a free radical without becoming destabilized themselves, thus preventing

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:46.820
 free radicals from taking electrons and causing damage?

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:52.100
 Do we need all these antioxidants to protect us against oxidative stress or are they a

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:57.340
 little overhyped in these antioxidant supplements?

01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:05.380
 Yeah, anything that stresses us increases our antioxidant system.

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:13.260
 I think the worst damage to the body is an absence of oxidative processes or reductive

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.260
 stress.

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:18.580
 For 50 years, they've been talking about oxidative stress.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:27.780
 I think we have to avoid an excess of electrons and simply keep our oxidative system working

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:34.760
 to consume the electrons, not to try to block them with antioxidants because the antioxidants

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:39.420
 in themselves can interfere with oxidative metabolism.

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:46.420
 Cancer cells are extremely well provided with antioxidant systems and that makes them dangerous

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:48.060
 and harmful.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.940
 So don't go overboard on antioxidants.

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:56.220
 So that's why you've never been a proponent of taking vitamin C, right?

01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:06.300
 No, partly because our diet provides 3,000 milligrams a day if you don't eat grains.

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:13.580
 Just vegetables, meat, milk, eggs will provide thousands of milligrams of vitamin C daily

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:20.780
 in the form of dehydroascorbate, much of it which is not in the reference books because

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.060
 they don't measure it.

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:27.500
 And if we do eat grains, what does that do to the dehydrate ascorbates?

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.700
 Grains are the only major food that don't contain vitamin C.

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:33.700
 Oh, I see.

01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:36.420
 But it doesn't hurt the good stuff that we brought in.

01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:37.420
 Okay.

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.420
 No.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:42.180
 In regards to aspirin, here's an email for you.

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:49.180
 Dr. Peter had recommended it and I once heard him speak about the form he prefers.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.840
 Is it crystals or powder?

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.240
 He said the type he gets can be stored for a long time in the freezer.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:58.100
 Also can he share where he gets this from?

01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:01.980
 How much would he recommend on a daily basis for an adult?

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:02.980
 Which vitamin?

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:03.980
 Aspirin.

01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:04.980
 Oh, aspirin.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.100
 What form do you like?

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:17.500
 I use just USP aspirin, but salicylic acid is all right if you mix it with baking soda.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:26.320
 But any aspirin that is in a form that doesn't choke you, it shouldn't be in a fine powder.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:32.900
 But I use crystalline aspirin USP and I try to average about 300 milligrams a day.

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.340
 And why do you take that?

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:43.340
 Just because it protects against anything inflammatory pretty much.

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:47.580
 Crystalline USP aspirin, 300 milligrams a day.

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:53.060
 So the aspirin that the docs are giving the guys for the heart and the blood thing, the

01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:56.980
 baby aspirin, is there anything to that?

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:01.020
 I think the amount is too small for most people.

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:07.420
 And if you take vitamin K, you don't have to worry about the bleeding thing from chronic

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:08.980
 aspirin use.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:12.060
 And vitamin K is in cheese, some cheeses?

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.700
 Yeah, aged cheese is a good source.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.700
 Aged cheese, yeah.

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:16.700
 Especially the blue stuff.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.700
 Doesn't that have vitamin K, the blue stuff?

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:19.700
 Yeah.

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:20.700
 Yeah.

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.060
 The blue stinky stuff, right?

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:29.460
 Can Dr. Peat explain why the veins in the back of the hands are an indication of estrogen

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.460
 status?

01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:41.180
 Well, stress where you, for example, might have low blood sugar, anything that weakens

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:43.540
 smooth muscle contraction can do it.

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:51.660
 But estrogen is a very common cause of that weakening of the smooth muscles.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:58.660
 Varicose veins are an extreme example where chronic estrogen weakens the muscle.

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:03.820
 Absence of progesterone will let the veins bulge.

01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:05.140
 Absence of...

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.420
 So the cure...

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:11.100
 So if the veins are bulging in the back of the hands, you would want to take...

01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.300
 How would you balance that estrogen out?

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:20.060
 Sometimes just a glass of milk or orange juice or some soup or something to get your salt

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.740
 and sugar up.

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:23.660
 That's often enough to do it.

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:30.860
 But if it's chronic, then correcting your whole diet and making sure your thyroid function

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:31.860
 is good.

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:32.860
 The old thyroid again.

01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:33.860
 There you go.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:39.420
 Lipomas, what are Dr. Peat's thoughts on the cause and function?

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:44.660
 I have one I would like to remove it, but I would first like to know why my body made

01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:49.500
 it, and will it just make another if I remove the one I have?

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.660
 There's also many dogs get these little lipomas.

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:55.220
 The vets say they just don't worry about them.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.220
 They're just little...

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:57.220
 Well, what are your thoughts?

01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:59.820
 Do you think they're the same for dogs too?

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:05.380
 Yeah, I don't really know.

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:12.580
 Hypothyroid people sometimes, if they have very high fats in their blood, that supposedly

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.620
 increases the risk of forming them.

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:20.500
 But I don't think there's any harm in removing them.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:21.500
 You don't think so?

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:22.500
 Yeah.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.500
 I have a question for you.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:30.100
 I have been in extreme estrogen dominance all my life, had many surgeries for stage

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:31.100
 4 endometriosis.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:38.740
 I've had a complete hysterectomy five years ago and been taking two grams of transgenital

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:43.940
 estradiol daily since the surgery, as well as vaginal estradiol.

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:45.460
 I stopped these.

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:50.260
 Let's see, what's the question here?

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:58.460
 All of the women I've known who had endometriosis over the last 50 years have stopped having

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:02.340
 all of their symptoms when they corrected their thyroid problem.

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:03.340
 Thyroid, yeah.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:08.100
 They go on to talk about the progesterone, "Do I need higher doses to combat the high

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.620
 estrogen?"

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.140
 So they're wondering about how much progesterone.

01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:17.540
 But you're saying you would just definitely go right to the thyroid and look at that.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.540
 Yeah.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:24.380
 If you want to check your estrogen levels, the thyroid should bring the estrogen down

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.780
 under control.

01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:35.980
 Could Dr. Peat explain how someone could detox DDT or other pesticides out of the body?

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:43.020
 Keeping your liver function good is the basic detox method.

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:47.580
 Eating a balanced diet, keeping your thyroid function up will make your liver handle things

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.580
 optimally.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:56.500
 Dr. Peat's explanation of how concentric exercise helps build muscle and produce testosterone,

01:26:56.500 --> 01:27:02.540
 but using the muscle in the downward lengthening stroke produces cortisol and damages mitochondria

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:07.820
 is interesting and suggests careful attention to our workout routine is important.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:12.980
 He said one way you could biohack your chin-ups would be to simply do them while standing

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:17.540
 on your rebounder and avoid the chin downs by just dropping onto the rebounder.

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:21.380
 So, he's already thinking, "Hmm, it's interesting."

01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:22.380
 Biohack it.

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:23.380
 You just biohack it, right?

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.860
 Well, Dr. Peat, what's on your schedule today?

01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.980
 Anything really fun and interesting?

01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:31.620
 No, I haven't thought about what I would be doing.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.820
 Yeah, me neither.

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.420
 We'll figure it out when the time comes.

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.260
 Well, thanks again for being here on the third Tuesday.

01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:45.820
 So tell folks on your website, you have a "It's Every Other Month" newsletter, right?

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:49.500
 We always put the link there and folks can get that if they want, right?

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:50.500
 Yes.

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:51.500
 raypeat.com.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.060
 Drink your orange juice, drink your milk, have some fun.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.060
 Thanks Dr. Peat.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:56.060
 We'll see you next month.

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.060
 Take care of yourself.

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.060
 Okay, thanks.

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060
 It's been an honor.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.060
 Thank you, sir.

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.060
 Thanks for being here.

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.060
 Dr. Ray Peat.

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.940
 See, orange juice and sugar and milk, who'd have thought it, right?

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.220
 All the fun stuff in life.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.780
 I just love the whole sugar thing.

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.340
 I just think it's great.

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.340
 Oh, man.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:18.300
 I remember there was a book that Gloria Swanson wrote about sugar.

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.740
 I read that and boy, I've been a sugar monster ever since.

01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:23.500
 What was the name of that book?

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.580
 Well, I never should have read it, I guess.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:26.580
 Oh, well.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:27.580
 Live and learn.

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.900
 Hope you enjoyed the show as much as we did presenting it.

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:30.900
 We will see you tomorrow.

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:31.900
 We're going to have a good show.

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:37.460
 We're going to dig into more of my research on "It Takes a Long Time to Get Young," the

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:39.460
 name of my book.

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:44.940
 And then the second hour, we're going to talk to Richard Mayberry.

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:48.380
 Richard Mayberry is a very interesting man.

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:52.660
 He's the one that coined the phrase, "The Two Laws."

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:58.300
 And I challenge you to come up with something, maybe you can between now and tomorrow, of

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:06.500
 what a potential illegal action would be that wouldn't be covered by these two laws.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:12.380
 And they are, carefully chosen words, "Do all you have agreed to do and do not encroach

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.880
 on other persons or their property."

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:20.300
 Richard Mayberry suggests if you follow these two laws, "Do all you have agreed to do and

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:26.080
 do not encroach on other persons or their property," that would cover everything and

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.080
 you're good to go.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.260
 What do you think about that?

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:32.860
 Can you think of something that would end up in the courts where those two laws wouldn't

01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:33.860
 cover?

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:36.020
 Email tomorrow and we'll talk about it.

01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:37.140
 But we're going to talk about a lot of things.

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:42.540
 He's into investing, geopolitics, gold, silver, central banking.

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:44.020
 He's a cool guy.

01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:50.500
 The early warning report he's written for years, it is Richard Mayberry, author of many

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.060
 books for Blue Stocking Press.

01:29:53.060 --> 01:30:00.460
 He's a big fan with the homeschooling people that they do Blue Stocking Press.

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:05.620
 He wrote "Whatever Happened to Justice," "World War II," the rest of the story, "World War

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:10.860
 I," the rest of the story, some great books for kids, "Whatever Happened to Penny Candy"

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:15.060
 about inflation, Blue Stocking Press, some great books for kids.

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:19.780
 If you want to give your kids some really cool things to read, check out Blue Stocking

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:22.660
 Press and Richard Mayberry's books.

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:23.660
 So he's going to be here tomorrow.

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:24.660
 So we have a fun day.

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:25.660
 I love you all very much.

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:27.620
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:31.340

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.300
 Doodle says bye.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.300
 May the blessings be.
