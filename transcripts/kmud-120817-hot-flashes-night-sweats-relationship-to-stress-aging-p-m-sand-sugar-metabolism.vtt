00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Thank you for that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 or which we source from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD, Garberville, 91.1 FM.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 And as usual, from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 amongst other things of hot flashes, night sweats,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 and the relationship to stress, aging, PMS, and sugar metabolism.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000

 We can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 for further questions during normal business hours, Monday through Friday.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 So as it's becoming very, very popular,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 and we're very pleased also for it to be the way it is,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 we're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 and he does have a new topic of research that he's been working on here for the last month or so.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 So we're going to be very lucky to have his take on what is,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 by many people held, a very common misconception about the neurotransmitters, etc.,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 that he'll be talking about in a moment.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 So once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat on the show.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Good night-- oh, good night, excuse me. Good evening.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 Hi.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 Okay, as usual, perhaps there are people who have just tuned in tonight

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 who've never heard you before.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 That's always possible, and I want to make sure that people that are listening

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 get the opportunity to hear of your technical background and your expertise,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 so if you wouldn't mind.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Between 1968 and '72, I studied biology at the University of Oregon,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 specializing in physiology, especially reproductive aging, and related biochemistry.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Okay, so your main background is physiology and reproductive physiology.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Okay, so I know that the topic that you've been working on recently,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 and I know from one of your most recent newsletters on serotonin, that is also tied in with it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 The subject that I was going to ask you about this evening,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 especially for those female listeners who would be very interested to hear what you have to say about it,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 is the subject of hot flashes in menopause

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 and also related night sweats that are not related to menopause,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 but the system of body temperature control and the set point that you mentioned of body temperature

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 and how that can be aberrantly set, and sweating can be a subsequent result of that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 So perhaps would you start by describing a little bit this set point?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 It's not something I've ever really heard about before for body temperature

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 and how it relates to sweating and how, you know,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 we'll later on bring out how the hormone side of it is largely treatable.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 In mammals, the temperature is regulated by hormones and nerves,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 partly by causing vasoconstriction or vasodilation in the skin and sweating.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 When you want to lower your temperature, you sweat and turn pink so that your skin radiates,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 gets blood to the surface by conduction and radiation, release heat into the environment.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Cold-blooded animals like lizards, when they need to increase their temperature,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 move into the sun or exercise, running raises their temperature.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 But, for example, to treat a fever, treat an infection,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 a reptile will sit in the sun and let its temperature produce the fever that's needed to activate the immune system.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Humans do that by tightening up the blood vessels in the skin and reducing sweating.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And when we're producing a fever, we experience a chill.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 And that, in the case of reptiles, they probably feel chilly when they have an infection,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 and so they have to move into the sunlight so they feel warm

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 and they don't feel comfortable until they have a temperature, have a fever.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 And when a person is experiencing chills, that means their temperature is rising

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 because they're producing goose bumps, making the hairs on their skin stand up,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 as the skin gets pale, cutting off circulation.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And inside the body, the same adrenaline system is activating energy metabolism,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 burning sugar faster, or fat in some cases,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 producing heat faster and losing heat more slowly to raise the heat.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 And the opposite of that, to lower your temperature, you experience a heat surge.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 People very often confuse the sensation with the actual temperature,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 so lots of people think they're really getting hotter when they experience a hot flush.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 But if you measure the temperature, the core temperature typically drops by close to 1 degree Fahrenheit

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 just in the minutes surrounding a hot flush.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 So does that mean when somebody is experiencing an infection

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 and their body is alternating chills with sweating,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 their body is trying to raise the body temperature in order to fight the infection

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 and then it gets too hot and then the body is trying to lower it,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 so they actually are getting warmer when they feel cold and colder when they feel hot?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Yes.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 The sensation that you experience is closely related to the thermostat set point.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 No one knows exactly how that thermostat works in an animal,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 but the physical basis for it seems to be the protein, water, fat system in the cell.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 As the temperature rises, it needs to change its chemistry to maintain a steadiness.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 To increase the set point, you stabilize this cytoplasmic system

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 so that it becomes liquid basically at a higher temperature.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 If you liquefy the structure, it has to decrease the temperature to achieve the normal amount of order.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 But the details of it just aren't known, but it's equivalent to a mechanical thermostat.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 How quickly do you think this is possible to achieve this set point regulation throughout the organism?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 When you administer estrogen to a person or an animal,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 their temperature is within probably minutes, but usually it's measured on an hour scale.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 It's a very quick reaction when the estrogen gets into the cells

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 so that they're being excited by it to offset that excitation.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 The temperature has to decrease.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Apparently, the sensation of being exposed to estrogen is one of warmth,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 and that very sensation is what lowers our set point so that we drop the temperature.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 In the menopause, when women are experiencing hot flashes,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 it's really down to an increased estrogen and a deficiency of progesterone

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 that's causing them to feel hot, but their actual body temperature is dropping.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Their set point is at a lower temperature, therefore they sweat more easily at a lower temperature.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Yes, and all the symptoms of menopause, including the hot sweats,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 set in when progesterone fails to be produced.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 But the estrogen levels in the serum even are pretty much the same in women with and without hot flashes.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 It's the absence of the anti-estrogen, progesterone, and androgens that cause the symptoms of hot flashes.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 So why are we told by the medical community that it's really a deficiency of estrogen

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 and you need to take estrogen to replace this deficient hormone

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 when in fact it's a deficiency of progesterone?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 There are more and more people realizing that.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Just in the last few months, two different people have published on that subject.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 The evidence really is clearly on the side of the progesterone deficiency.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 It started back in the '30s when the drug companies wanted to sell, at first, a synthetic estrogen product.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Is that DES?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Yes, that was the first one.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 They did have a synthetic estradiol that became one of the staples.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 The ethinyl estradiol was, I think they say, 17 times more powerful than natural estrogen,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 and that was an early product.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 To sell those products successfully, they had to create an ideology.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Progesterone was known to be the main ovarian hormone,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 and already in the 1930s they saw that estrogen was an anti-fertility, abortion-producing hormone,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 where progesterone was the real female hormone that made pregnancy possible.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Just to market the product, they created this whole ideology calling estrogen the female hormone

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 and saying that the ovaries fail.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 They simply run out of eggs at a certain age,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 and when they run out of eggs, they don't produce estrogen,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 and the failure of estrogen is the loss of femaleness.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 So they said if you replace estrogen, you can maintain pregnancy, prevent miscarriage,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 and prevent the loss of femininity with aging.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 All of that was just an advertising campaign, but lots of doctors fell for it.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Lots of poor women suffered with deformed babies.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Millions, yeah.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 You mentioned it on your newsletter saying that the history behind DES,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 or Diet Ethyl Acetyl-Bestrol, I think it is,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 when they marketed it, they marketed it for the prevention of abortions,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 and then it came out as a morning-after contraception, or the abortion pill.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Yeah.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 The drug companies got a husband-and-wife team connected with Harvard,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 and they lobbied the FDA to approve it for treating menopause,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 so they created the legal and public relations environment

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 based on that completely false idea that estrogen was the fertility hormone.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And it takes such a long time for this kind of thing to come around

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 when research is coming out all the time,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 to a point where people finally get it that actually it's completely wrong.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Well, they stopped that trial they were doing on hormone replacement therapy

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 because women were having strokes and heart attacks,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 and their bones were not becoming healthier.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 And now back again, doctors are prescribing HRT to menopausal women.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 And all of those events, the heart attacks, strokes, dementia, breast cancer,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 and so on, all of that stuff was known on the basis not only of animal studies

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 going back 50 years, but even in human studies,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 they saw all of those things in very good studies.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 It was just that the government did such a big study that no one could easily deny it.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 But now they're running campaigns these last 10 years

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 to reverse the effects of that Women's Health Initiative study.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Well, pharmaceutical reps are some of the best-paid salesmen and women,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 and they are convincing doctors of a very unsafe practice, unfortunately,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 because they're such good salespeople.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Okay. You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU DeGarboville 91.1 FM.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 From 7.30 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 to this month's subject of night sweats, hot flashes, PMS, and aging.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 And in relation to such things as serotonin and melatonin and 5-HT, it also ties in.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So, Dr. Peat, the relationship then between the serotonin and temperature regulation

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 or aberrations in temperature and the misconception again about serotonin being good for you

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 or 5-HT or melatonin being good for you, which is completely bogus,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 and would you just bring out the relationship then between the night sweats and estrogen and serotonin,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 and then we will--well, when you talk about it, you can obviously bring out those erroneous statements

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 about melatonin and 5-HT being good for you and just let people know why they're not good for you.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Fifty years ago, a similar thing with the drug industry and government happened in relation to serotonin.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 The disease carcinoid, an intestinal tumor that produces serotonin,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 was being studied just when serotonin was discovered to be both a brain hormone

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 but mostly an intestinal hormone.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 The drug industry with psychoactive chemicals wanted to, for various reasons that my newsletters talk about,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 wanted to create the idea that serotonin was the hormone of bliss, they've called it,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 that it was something to be raised to create well-being,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 but still the carcinoid study was identifying it as a stress-related hormone that caused flushing.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 One of the basic signs of having that intestinal disease was frequent flushing

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 as well as psychiatric symptoms.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 One of the effects of serotonin is to activate the stress hormones, the cortisol system,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 and to activate aromatase, the enzyme that makes estrogen.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Estrogen also releases and activates the production of serotonin,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 so it can become a vicious circle of stress, flushing,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 tissue breakdown under the influence of cortisol and so on.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 And cortisol is a backup mechanism for survival when normal healthy metabolism fails to work.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Cortisol is the stress hormone that keeps you alive but under an unhealthy metabolism.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Yeah, that's where the sugar metabolism comes in.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 Estrogen's basic effect is to shift metabolism away from sugar to burning fat as a basic defense mechanism.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 If you're starving, and starvation turns on flushing, among other things,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 if you're starving, you don't want to eat up your body tissues, converting protein to glucose.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 And so under stress, you have to turn your metabolism towards oxidizing fat,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 but at the same time, you turn off your thyroid, which is responsible for oxidizing sugar efficiently.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 So this keeps you alive through times of famine.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Yeah, it slows your metabolism down and makes you burn fat and spare your tissues by not turning protein to sugar.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Now some listeners might think, "Oh great, it makes me burn fat. That must be a good thing."

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 Except that it slows your metabolism so much.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 That a little bit of fat burning doesn't account for much weight loss at all.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 It actually counts for probably weight gain.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 And that metabolism tends to, in most species, it puts the animal into torpor or hibernation.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 And when an animal is getting ready to hibernate, it tends to stock up its tissues with lots of polyunsaturated fats.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 And they found that they can bring on torpor or hibernation by either feeding them or injecting them with polyunsaturated fats.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 And if you give them sugar rather than unsaturated fats, you can keep them from going into torpor.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 And so this is a survival mechanism for animals in cold climates,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 that they eat a lot of the polyunsaturated fat-rich foods so that they can slow their metabolism and survive a cold winter where there's not as much food supply.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 But you were telling us about the flamingos in Africa.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Yeah, Leslie Brown, a specialist in flamingos, wrote a book in the 1950s.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 And he said that no one really has any idea how long they live, but he suspected that 130 would be a good estimate.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 But they've seen that the annual mortality doesn't change with age.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 A 50-year-old animal is no more likely to die than a 3-year-old animal.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 So what's so different in this hot climate in Africa?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Well, they wade around in hot, salty water eating algae that is living at this very, very warm water temperature.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 And the flamingos live basically on the blue-green algae, which at that high temperature, the algae itself couldn't live if it made polyunsaturated fats,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 because they would oxidize immediately.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 So they make saturated fats.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 And most of the blue-green algae that are available here are grown in cold climates, and so therefore the fats in the blue-green algae are very unsaturated and unstable.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 You mentioned also that that part of Africa has a high CO2 concentration.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 Yeah, some of their lakes that the flamingos wade in, the water feels viscous, they say, because of the high sodium carbonate concentration.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 The carbon dioxide bubbles out of the volcanic rifts and makes the water both salty, alkaline, and very rich in carbon dioxide.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Would you have any idea what percentage of CO2 might be present there?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 No. I've heard that the air in some regions has a very high concentration just seeping out of the volcanic rifts.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 It's just an aside here, but I wonder, do you know what makes the flamingos pink?

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 I'm sure that's some kind of algae.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 So we know that cold water fish have to have a polyunsaturated, unsaturated essential fat in order to have their fat stay liquid at cold, cold temperatures.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 But you were telling us about fish in the Amazon.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Yeah, they've analyzed the fat in Amazon fish where probably the average temperature is something like 75 or 80, maybe 85 degrees,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 varying with season and rainfall and so on, but very warm water.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 Their fat is similar to butter for saturation, about 97% saturated.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 Wow. Wow. Wow. Okay. Well, let's just actually we've got a couple of callers here.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Galbraith 91.1 FM and from 730,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 which is just about now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with questions either related or unrelated to hot flashes, night sweats.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Once again, we've got Dr. Raymond Peat on the line and take the first caller.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Hello. You're on the air.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 Hey, is this live right now?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 There you go. Yeah, you're on the air.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 Yeah, that was really strange. I can't hear anybody on my telephone.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Wow. Can you hear anybody now?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 And I'm getting this weird delay.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 If you're up in Eureka, then there is an eight second delay.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 No, I'm in Albion, Mediterranean County.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 I don't know. And I do apologize when callers call.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 The me talking to you on the phone is very, very quiet.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 So I'm actually shouting when I talk to you on the phone.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 And I can't hear the person that's trying to talk with me.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Okay.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 But I have a question for -- you were talking about something about night sweats and estrogen and whatnot.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Is that correct?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 Yes.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Okay. Now, I have a friend. He's a male kind of guy.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 And he has -- he gets like anxiety attacks and he gets night sweats.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Mostly right in the morning, just before he wakes up.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 And I was just kind of curious about what would be that

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 or how could that relate to, say, estrogen or testosterone or whatever.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 I kind of just tuned in.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 But I'm getting this weird delay, so it's like it's delay, delay, delay.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 And it's like, hello.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 Well, I'm sorry --

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 I can't hear anybody who's trying to talk with me,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 so I'm just going to hang up and maybe get your answer if you have one.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 And I'll listen.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Okay.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Thank you much.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Thank you.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Dr. Peate, did you hear that?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 When a man is under severe stress, which can be infection or trauma or starvation,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 his estrogen multiplies and becomes equivalent to a woman's estrogen.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 And any time you're under stress and you're likely to waste your stored glucose

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 and have fluctuating episodes of hypoglycemia,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 and that triggers several things, but especially the release of cortisol,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 which breaks down your tissue and turns it to sugar.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And so when your stress is very high, usually at the end of the night,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 your cortisol is at its highest for the day.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 And when you're stressed by anything metabolic or an infection, for example,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 your cortisol can go extremely high as well as the estrogen.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 And that brings your blood sugar up, and bringing the blood sugar up lowers the

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 adrenaline system, letting your skin produce sweat and become pink and hot.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 So the actual sweating and sense of heat goes with very high cortisol,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 which normally is the highest around dawn.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 So really this gentleman is experiencing a stress during the night due to

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 dropping blood sugar levels, and perhaps if he woke himself up maybe around 2

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 or 3 and had a glass of orange juice, maybe with a little salt dissolved in it,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 that might help to lower his stress and keep his blood sugar up?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Yeah, lots of people do that.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 I've known fat people who had a nightmare every 30 to 60 minutes during the night.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 And if they would wake themselves up after less time than was enough to cause

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 the nightmare and had a glass of orange juice or milk, they could lengthen the

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 time between their nightmares in just 3 or 4 nights by catching it in time using

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 an alarm clock.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 And in just a week or so of preventing those surges of night sweats or

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 nightmares, you can get your liver stocked up with enough glucose that you can

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 sleep usually through the whole night.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 So it's really just a failure of glucose storage, and people don't get enough

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 sugars, and we've spoken at length and we'll keep on about the need for fructose,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 fruit sugars specifically.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 If people consume enough fruit sugars each day, the glycogen stores can get

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 replenished in the liver, and during the night when typically we're fasting,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 there's enough stored sugar to enable the person to get through the night without

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 getting into that anxiety state using adrenaline as a next worst thing to keep

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 things going.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 And another thing is that when somebody is stressed, under physical or mental

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 stress, they'll use up their sugar stores much quicker, and a lot of times when

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 people are under stress, they don't tend to eat properly, and they actually can

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 tend to eat less, and then that just creates a very, very vicious cycle of

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 stress hormones, raising blood sugar by breaking down fat, and that whole backup

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 metabolism that can lead to cancer, all sorts of destructive problems.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 It lowers thyroid and progesterone, which are the basic energy-producing

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 protective hormones, and in the absence of those, then you have to increase the

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 acute emergency hormones, serotonin, estrogen, and the various inflammatory

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 things.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 And in just the last five or six years, there have been several studies showing

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 that hot flashes, menopausal hot flashes, can be prevented just with sugar.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 A big dose of carbohydrate at bedtime will work better than estrogen.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 And that's just because it's replenishing the liver's store so the liver doesn't

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 have to rely on those stress hormones to get some sugar.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Yes, and the mechanism by which estrogen does have some effect in reducing hot

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 flashes, it's a very unphysiological effect.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 When morphine withdrawal is being used as a model of hot flashes, they find that

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 old animals can have such a low metabolism that they don't experience the hot

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 flash.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 They can simply be already in the hibernating state and don't have the

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 surges that cause the hot flashes.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 Estrogen lowers the metabolism, and apparently it can put a person into so

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 close to the hibernation state that they don't have the surges raising their

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 metabolism enough to produce heat to cause the flush.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 But another effect is that these high doses of estrogen block the sweating

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 mechanisms.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 In animal studies, if you look at the actual details, they were stopping the

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 hot flushes but using a dose of estrogen 2,000 times the physiological amount.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 And in some of the studies of humans showing that estrogen can stop the

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 sweating and flushing, they were using 30 times the physiological amount of

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 estrogen for a young woman but giving it to menopausal women.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 And that's why so many women who take HRT tend to put on a lot of weight

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 because they're lowering their metabolism so much with all that high dose of

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 estrogen.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 But we do have a couple of callers on the line.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 Okay, you're on the air.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Next caller, you're on the air.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 Next caller was on the air.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 She was waiting a while.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Caller, here's your chance.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 If you're up in Eureka, there's an eight-second time delay, so you better

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 hurry.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 Well, here's our next caller.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Hey, next caller, you there?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 Hello?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Can you hear me?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Yeah.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Okay, there we go.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 All right, and I'm listening on my radio so I can hear all folks through that.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 And, by the way, just for technical purposes, I'm near Fort Bragg, just

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 right on the Mendocino Coast, and it's a very slight delay, almost about the

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 level of an echo from the difference between the radio and the phone.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 So I can hear you quite well here, just for tech purposes.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Now, my question is, I believe, related to this.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 However, it's probably a whole other show.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 But if you could just address this, and I'll put it under the headline of

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 "Be Careful What Kind of Juicing You Do," and it's not a milkshake, it's a

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 milky shake.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Now, this goes to the San Francisco Giants' Milky Cabrera, and the aspect of

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 what steroids or juicing that they do, that's what they call it, even though

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 it's not the juice you were talking about earlier, that these are often

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 related to female hormones, and they actually will take female hormones to

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 basically mask the fact that they have been taking these steroids.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 So the question goes kind of to the entirety of the spectrum.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 What does that do to their corticosteroids?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 What does it do to the cortisone and the cortisol?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 And really, when they get better as they get older, which doesn't make sense,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 as in the case of the Milky Shake Man here, the question goes to how much does

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 this stress their older body and shorten their life?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 And I'd appreciate if you don't get into a whole lot of detail on that and

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 maybe address that entire subject in another program, but if you could touch

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 on it, it'd certainly be appreciated, especially with the idea that they use

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 female hormones to mask those steroids and maybe why they do that.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Thanks, as always, for this great program.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Dr. Peat, could you hear that caller's question?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 I don't know what Milky Shakes are.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 I'm not sure what they are either, but perhaps --

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Oh, Milky Shakes would be related to the man's name, Milky Cabrera.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 Okay.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 M-E-L-K-Y, and they play on the Milk Man, and I was trying to be funny,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 but it didn't work for us.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 So what you're saying is that they take female hormones to mask the fact that

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 they're taking corticosteroids.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Yes, in fact, it was on record that the way they found out that Manny Ramirez,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 formerly of the L.A. Dodgers and currently of the Oakland Athletics, at least

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 last time I checked, maybe, he was using that and got suspended for 50 games

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 when he was with the Dodgers a couple years ago, as Milky Cabrera just got

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 taken down for 50 games from the Giants.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 And if you don't have the answer, Dr. Peat, I don't know if you follow sports

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 at all, but I know this is kind of a medical question that a lot of people are

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 interested in.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 If you can't answer it tonight, I'd look forward to a future program on it, maybe.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Dr. Peat, do you understand the question now?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 Yeah, but I don't know anything about that shake.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Okay, but I think what he's saying is that these athletes are taking female

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 hormones in order to mask the fact that they're taking corticosteroids to cope

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 with the athletic performance.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Well, progesterone will cover up and protect against many of the toxic steroids.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Pregnenolone and progesterone protect against several toxic steroids.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 But, I mean, why would athletes take the steroids then to begin with if they

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 take progesterone just to mask it?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 I'm not sure what the hormone was they were taking.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 I think just corticosteroids, cortisone.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 I don't know why an athlete would take the cortico--

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 Maybe after a game as an anti-inflammatory.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 I'm not sure.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 I'm sorry.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 Our knowledge is not too great in this area of sport.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 I think they're taking other performance enhancers.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Well, then they may be taking more like testosterone or other.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Okay, I guess until we get clarification, let's just take the next caller.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Hi, you're on the air?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Hello.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 Hi, do we have an eight-second delay or are you hearing everything on time?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 I don't know.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 I'm hearing you right now.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Good.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Okay, what's your question?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 What do I tell my doctor when they want to put me on statins for having high cholesterol?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 Tell them not to.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 I could send you a lot of research reports on that, but basically, you have to remember

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 that they don't just inhibit cholesterol, they inhibit a whole system of related chemicals

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 in the body and impair energy production and have not only the risk of muscle damage, but

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 also toxic effects on the brain and liver.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Tell them you'd like to try a supplement of thyroid first to get your cholesterol down

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 that way.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 Okay, well, yeah, I like animal fats, too.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Good.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Well, good.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 That does not raise -- good animal fats, saturated animal fats do not raise cholesterol.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 I've been listening to you guys talk about that for a long time.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Great.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 Avoid pork and chicken and turkey and duck fat.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 Okay, so grass-fed beef is probably the best, huh?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 And lamb.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 And lamb.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Okay, great.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Thank you.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 And make sure your thyroid's working.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 Yeah, get your doctor to do a test and take your temperature, and if it's below 98.6,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 you could have a thyroid problem and ask your doctor for a supplement.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 Okay.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 So we had a caller who called to say that the sports players are taking testosterone and

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 someone else calling to say that they're andestrogens.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Androgens.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 Androgens.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Yes.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 So we have two more callers.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Okay, let's take the next caller.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 I'm actually standing in for the next caller.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Could you please comment on bisphenol A and its use in plastics and its estrogen-mimicking

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 characteristics and how that might affect the whole estrogen milieu?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 Yeah, it's disastrous early in life, prenatal or infancy exposure.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 It shapes the whole development of the organism.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 And an adult is less sensitive to it, but it still is very toxic as a strong estrogen

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 leading to all of these degenerative inflammatory effects.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 So what do you think is the biggest causative factor that's increasing bisphenol A in our

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 dietary?

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 Oh, I currently don't know.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 They've used it in a lot of food packaging things, but now it's getting into water supply

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 even.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 So you mean like water bottles and plastics and things that food is put in?

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 Yeah, and even into some municipal water supplies, recycling.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 Recycling the water?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 No, getting into groundwater and being pumped into water supply systems.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 Okay.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 And does bisphenol A cross the placental barrier to the fetus?

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Okay, we have another caller.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 So let's take this next caller.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Actually, they dropped.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 I'm sorry.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Okay, no problem.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 Or maybe I dropped them by accident.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 So call back if you want to.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Colleagues, lines are open.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 Yeah, call back in.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Okay, so Dr. Raymond Peat's joining us tonight on the show, and he's explaining the mechanisms

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 for hot flashes and night sweats.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 His number here, if you live in the area, is 923-3911.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Or if you live outside the area, the 800 number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 So you're listening to this month's Ask Your Hub, Doctor.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 Okay, Dr. Peat, let's just get back to what you mentioned about the temperatures for fish.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Just mentioning that the fish were consuming microorganisms in the water that was too warm,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 normally, and that their fat was saturated a lot more than you'd normally find in fish,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 and that this was actually a beneficial thing for the fish in terms of not having them to have a polyunsaturated oil in their bodies

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 because they didn't need that cold protection.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Yes.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 There were even studies in salmon, who normally are cold-water fish with very highly unsaturated fats,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 but they fed them diets less polyunsaturated and found that in some of their endurance tests,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 they had better performance than the ones on the pure algae, cold-water, highly unsaturated fats.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 So even though they talk about eating cold-water fish as being good for people,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 even fish don't do so well.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 And they would do better if they ate blue-green algae that was high in saturated fats because it grew in warm waters.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 Yes, it couldn't be too saturated if they went back to the cold ocean because they would harden like a cube of butter.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 Okay, I think we've got that other caller.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 Salmon butter.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Maybe you could create a new product called salmon butter and encapsulate that and sell that to people.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Okay, I think there's another caller on the line,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 so let's see if the engineer has captured that caller or he's got out of the net.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 You're on the air.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Can you hear me?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 Yes.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 Excellent, I can hear you well.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 Oh, good.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Briefly, I went through a similar experience as the earlier caller who was talking about his physician,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 presumably a physician wanting to get him on statin drugs.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Right.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 I had that same conversation with my physician,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 and I told her that I would prefer to see if I couldn't figure out some way, anyway, to avoid taking the statin drugs.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 And she said, "Well, okay, there's no tremendous rush."

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 She said, "Your cholesterol is trending high.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 Your blood pressure is trending high, but you're not there yet.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 It's borderline."

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 So give it a go and get back to me in three months, and we'll see how you're doing.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 So I didn't have a clue what to do, but I knew that I didn't want to take statin drugs.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 So I got into a bunch of diet books and, in a nutshell, stayed away from greasy, fatty foods, salt, sugar,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 and got into load-bearing exercise.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 And in three weeks -- not three months, three weeks -- I turned it around.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 That's been about eight years ago.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 I realized that I'm not prescribing for anyone else.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 I was lucky, I think.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 But I thought you might have some comments to make on that, and I'll get off the line and listen to you.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 Thank you very much for the program.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 I know, Dr. Peat, you won't have too many good things to say about not consuming sugar.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 But I think the biggest change that was made was not eating greasy foods,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 because America eats too much greasy food that's all fried in those toxic polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 and that probably made the biggest difference.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 Wouldn't you agree, Dr. Peat?

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 Yeah, the way it works is that the polyunsaturated fat blocks your thyroid at all levels of function.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 And in the 1930s, people who knew that removing the thyroid gland caused an immediate rise in cholesterol,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 they gave these people a supplement of thyroid and found just as an immediate decrease in cholesterol.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 So it's a mirror image.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 Your thyroid function and metabolic rate going up, your cholesterol goes down.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 And I've seen two people who had cholesterol of 450 or 500 milligrams per cent get down to normal in just a week

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 by very, very intense supplementation with fast-acting thyroid.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 Excellent. Excellent.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 Okay, let's carry on about the sweats, because that is, after all, this month's topic,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
 and I know that you've done a fair bit of research on it in the very recent times.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 Let's just go on to night sweats.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 Now, I've always understood, even from university, that night sweats were indicative of disease and it wasn't good.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
 What do you think about night sweats in the way that you understand temperature regulation now?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 Because it's probably very different from what we were taught.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 I think it's the same thing. The body needs to be hot, but the night signal is to cool off the metabolism to permit sleep.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 And you have to mobilize the nervous system in a different way, shift from sympathetic to parasympathetic.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 And parasympathetic activation makes you sweat.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 And getting your blood sugar up is the other thing that shifts you away from the sympathetic dominance.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 And the various things during the night trigger those nervous changes.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 Just lying down tends to shift you towards the parasympathetic dominance, making you sweat more easily.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 But then prolonged darkness increases the production of cortisol, which raises your blood sugar

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 and shifts you again away from sympathetic to parasympathetic.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 So it's a combination of darkness, the day cycle, whatever the stress is,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 lowering your blood sugar and then the compensating cortisol raising your blood sugar.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 So what are some things that we can do to fix this?

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 We've talked about avoiding polyunsaturated fats and eating saturated fats in their place.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 So that means avoiding meat fat that's from pork, chicken, turkey, duck.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 One of the things that happens at night is that this shift of the nervous system tends to slow the digestive process

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:16.000
 and it can allow bacteria to become more toxin-producing during the night.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 And keeping your intestine clean during the night as far as possible

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 and eating a carrot in the afternoon, for example, to stimulate the intestine

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 and suppress some of the bacterial growth.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 A raw grated carrot.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 Yeah.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 Okay, there's one more caller on the air, so let's see if we can take this next caller.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
 You're on.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 Yeah, I'm calling about a couple of questions on there.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 You're talking about being low fat with the meat, or you're saying the beef is the best kind of low cholesterol.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 Is that what I heard you say?

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 Yes, I was saying to avoid the fats from the pig, chicken, turkey, duck,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 and instead if you're going to eat meat, get the fat from beef and lamb, the saturated fat,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 because it's a myth that it's the bad fat because really it's the most natural fat.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 And it's only just because those other animals are fed corn and soy, which are a bad fat.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 Is there a difference between the kind of fats in beef or is it just whatever kind of beef you eat,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 whether it's a hot dog or it's a filet mignon, it's all the same?

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 Well, grass-fed beef is, of course, ideal.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Ideal for what reason?

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 The grass has a high content of vitamin E, and vitamin E is used primarily in the beef animals to destroy the polyunsaturated fats.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
 I see.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 And so the more vitamin E in the diet, the lower the polyunsaturated fat content of the beef will be.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Well, one of the things that I've noticed when I'm shopping, I look at the grass-fed beef or the organic beef,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 and I noticed it has a higher fat content than the leanest meat that you get that's just maybe more standardized production.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 It's the ratio of saturated fat to unsaturated that is most important.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 So a grain-fed cut of beef will have more polyunsaturated oils, is that what you're suggesting, Dr. Peat, or just less vitamin E?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 Yeah, less vitamin E and more of the unsaturated fats,

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 but it's mostly the low vitamin E that lets the oil survive the rumen and get into the tissues.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 So it's the high percentage of polyunsaturated fat that is the danger, not the quantity of it,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 because if you have lots and lots of perfectly saturated fat, that makes it relatively safe.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Like normal beef is 98% saturated and about 2% polyunsaturated.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 So I, too, am having a little trouble hearing you, but I guess the bottom line is which one would I want to eat for my health?

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 Would it be the lower-fat one that's commercial or the grass-fed?

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 The grass-fed.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 The grass-fed, okay.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 And the other question is kind of different.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Do you know any kind of relationship between any of these health matters?

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 There's Epstein-Barr and Lyme disease found a lot around these parts.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 Do you know anything about how that relates to the metabolism system or something like that?

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 Well, you know what?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 We're running out of time.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 We only have four minutes left, and we need to wrap up,

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 but maybe you can call in with next Friday, that third Friday of September.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 Third Friday of September.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 Well, I'll put that on my calendar.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 Okay, thank you for your call.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 Thank you for listening.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 Okay, so I want to make sure to cover some things that we can recommend for people to help decrease hot flashes,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 whether you're a male or a female.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 And, Dr. Peat, you were mentioning?

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Sugar, carbohydrates in general, but especially fruit.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 Gelatin is the protein that's best because it doesn't make any serotonin.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 And salty foods help to stabilize your blood sugar and lower the stress systems.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 And there's also some herbs that can help to work on these different systems.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 Nettle root blocks the romatase enzyme that increases estrogen.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 Vitex blocks prolactin, which increases estrogen.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 Yeah, aspirin blocks --

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Aspirin and caffeine.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 Aspirin and caffeine.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Aspirin blocks the romatase and caffeine.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Stimulates progesterone production.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 Progesterone production, there you go.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 Okay, and then Lobelia, I think, was one of the other ones.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 That was the Indian tobacco.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 That also has an effect.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.000
 Because you were describing the nicotinic receptors as having an effect on blocking the sweat.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 Yeah, you mentioned nicotine patches, too.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 That's been the latest FDA -- is it FDA approved?

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 Well, a study is being done right now.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 I don't know who funded it, but it's plausible that it would --

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 since it lowers aromatase and lowers estrogen,

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 it might protect against some of the symptoms of hot flashes and such.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 And Lobelia occupies the nicotinic receptor, and it's not nicotine.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 It's Lobelene.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Lobelene, isolobelene.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 And it's also effective for helping people stop smoking.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 Okay, well, let's give out Dr. Peat's information so that people that have listened to him

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 can take some more action and get on the Internet

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 and maybe e-mail him or read his articles, find out more about him.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 So, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for taking your time out to share your knowledge with people this evening.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 Thanks so much.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 Okay, so for people that have heard the show, Dr. Raymond Peat's website is www.rayPeat.com,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 and he has lots of scholarly articles, probably 50 or so, fully referenced articles on many different subjects.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 Mostly his interests are around polyunsaturated versus saturated fats, aging, how to prevent early aging,

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 and hormones, so progesterone, estrogen, et cetera.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 So you're -- I'm not going to go through that again, no.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 What did you want to say, Sarah?

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 That all of Dr. Peat's articles are free for those who can get on the Web.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 Okay, so until the third Friday of next month, have a great night.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 Enjoy the rest of the summer.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 Thank you for listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 Thank you.
