00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi everyone, I'm Gary Null. Nice to have you with us today talking about health

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 and nutrition issues. We're going to continue with our series on alternative

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.120
 healing. We're going to look at your thyroid gland to begin with. Now you're

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.720
 going to learn more about that thyroid gland and the process of the thyroid

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.240
 when it's not functioning properly and how that may be contributing to a whole

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.160
 series of illnesses. Illnesses that the normal process of medical examination

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.240
 would miss altogether. We're also going to show you the thyroid gland and aging.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:43.440
 So that coming up right after the opening new segments. Recently people

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 have been looking, more people than ever have been looking actually, for how to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 regain a sense of health and using alternative therapies. Well one of the

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.680
 therapies is the whole area of phytochemicals or using plants. Now in

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.520
 the plant family there are a lot of conditions that are very specific for

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.200
 different conditions. For example, plants for irritable bowel syndrome. Now

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.720
 irritable bowel is, well it's not a very pleasant condition to have and people

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.080
 end up with abdominal cramps and they can end up with constipation or diarrhea.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 And so you look around and say what works that's non-toxic? Well one of the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 things that they've been using in Europe for a long time is peppermint oil from

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.600
 Mintha Pipertea and it's used on a regular basis to aid in digestion and as

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.680
 a carminative. And we don't know all about its beneficial effects but we do

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.240
 know that it's shown to act as an antispasmodic to intestinal muscle. Also

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:57.880
 we found that it also has some strong anti-antimutagenic activity. Also when

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.120
 looking at some of the things that make a difference, intermittent claudication.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.760
 Now intermittent claudication is painful calves and sometimes it's so painful

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.000
 that just sitting is uncomfortable, walking for any distance is

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.320
 uncomfortable. So what do you do? Well with intermittent claudication some

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.960
 people have tried chelation therapy and they have claimed that chelation therapy

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.240
 has really made a difference. It's helped them. However in a recent study that was

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:36.520
 published in a prestigious journal and reported and I believe it was the, what

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.960
 was it? I saw it originally in Clinical Pearls and it was circulation, September

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.000
 1994 and it was by Dr. AndrÃ© Van Riech and associate. And what they showed is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.920
 they took two groups of people. Both groups had pretty similar intermittent

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.000
 claudication and they were over the age of 45. And they were able to determine

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.040
 the intermittent claudication by peripheral atherosclerotic vascular

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.720
 disease arteriography. Meaning they measured it and what they gave them was

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:21.160
 500 ml infusion of 3,000 milligrams of EDTA plus some magnesium chloride. And

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.800
 the other group got 500 milligrams infusion of saline and inert solution.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.400
 And then they watched them and then after a period of time, about three

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.360
 months, they remeasured and they found that the chelation group had a 60%

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.840
 improvement in walking distance. But the control group, the placebo group, had a

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.800
 59% improvement. Therefore they said that there was no difference between

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.520
 chelation group and the placebo group. Well there's a problem. I got the actual

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.800
 study and here's what it says. That the usual response is 30%. Well to go from

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.960
 the usual 30% response with drugs and other therapies to 60% is a 100%

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.280
 improvement. So right off the bat there's a big improvement. But I could see

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.440
 having a 60% improvement in the chelation group. But how could you also

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.920
 have a 60% improvement in the placebo group? That makes no sense.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.080
 But then ah, they tell us. They tell us right in the heart of the article that

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.720
 both groups received oral supplements daily. Now the oral supplements they

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.940
 received on a daily basis and a fairly good amount actually have oral vitamin

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:47.040
 chelating properties. Now what this tells me is that it was not so much the EDTA

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.120
 that made the improvement but rather the oral chelators like vitamin C and zinc

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.440
 and selenium. These are oral chelators. So if you want to know why you've had

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.880
 clearer arteries and better circulation and less intermittent claudication, it's

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.000
 because of the proper supplementation. Now of course they didn't mention this

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.720
 in the article. They didn't mention that the average response is 30% and hence

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.840
 the placebo and the control group or the active group got 100% improvement. And

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.720
 they didn't tell people in the conclusions that gee whiz it was

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.600
 probably the vitamin supplements that made a difference in the placebo group. A

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.680
 faulty study, misinterpreted, and one that slants a bias against chelation

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.520
 therapy. Unfortunately we still haven't seen the really ideal study to validate

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 chelation in the Orthodox mind. I'm Gary Naul and I'd like to welcome you to our

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.080
 program. As you may know if you listen with any frequency we talk about health

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.840
 issues. In this segment we're going to talk about something that affects

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.480
 everyone from children to senior citizens, then to the overweight and that

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.400
 is the thyroid gland. To share insights on the thyroid gland I've invited Dr. Ray

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.560
 Pete. Dr. Pete has a background in biology from the University of Oregon

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.440
 and he is specialized in hormone related oxidative changes. He's taught

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.560
 biochemistry, endocrinology, and nutrition at several universities. And he's

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.400
 authored several very good books including Nutrition for Women,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.960
 Progesterone in Orthomolecular Medicine, and Generative Energy in Mind and Tissue.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.960
 So let's go to our conference call and welcome him on board. Nice to have you

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.320
 with us Dr. Pete. Thanks. Could I comment on intermittent

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.640
 claudication and how it relates to thyroid? Sure. It's very common for

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:54.760
 pre-puberty people to have leg pains that they call groin pains and those people

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.760
 are typically a little bit low thyroid and the textbooks used to show little

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.020
 kids with horribly swollen calf muscles. They looked like they were muscle

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:15.120
 bound but it was the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides swelling the muscle

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.480
 up causing great pain cramping and so on. And in old people who are hypothyroid

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.320
 something very similar happens but it includes degeneration of the blood

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:36.160
 vessels to some extent. And you mentioned the chelation plus magnesium. When you

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:44.280
 take thyroid it energizes your cells to make ATP and it happens that ATP binds

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:51.040
 magnesium so you don't really take up magnesium into the cell very efficiently

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:57.640
 unless you have adequate thyroid. And when you are low in

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:04.800
 thyroid you tend to lose magnesium during stress and chronically that leads

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:11.280
 to a crampy inefficient condition where you waste oxygen producing your energy

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.560
 but you can't retain it because of the lack of magnesium. So in many situations

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:23.000
 magnesium imitates thyroid function but the two together really are simply

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.240
 energizing the tissue and you can go from crampy legs or many old people get

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.760
 jumpy legs a funny sensation that makes their legs kick when they try to go to

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:43.560
 sleep. You can go from that hyper activity of the legs to many other

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:50.920
 conditions including heart rhythm problems, insomnia, muscle pains in

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:57.440
 general, many states that are considered degenerative diseases but they are

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:04.440
 simply low thyroid low magnesium states that prevent efficient energy production.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:12.880
 Good. Dr. Peete why don't we begin by you telling us about how we have a

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.000
 correlation between an underactive or low thyroid function in the aging

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.440
 process and then maybe include information in lay language about

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.240
 insomnia and arthritis and cholesterol all these things that we don't

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.800
 assume are associated with the thyroid gland but indeed are. Okay when a person

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:41.040
 is under stress the thyroid adaptively goes down it's like a hibernation

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:49.600
 process. That's one adaptation that works if an animal is starving for

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.720
 example in the winter if its metabolism slows down its heart rate slows and its

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.480
 body temperature drops it can last through the winter without eating up its

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:08.680
 fat too fast or if it's in a famine situation or a migration if the thyroid

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:15.920
 slows down during starvation or prolonged activity as in migrating you

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:23.400
 can go farther on a given amount of stored energy. When people go on extreme

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:31.880
 diets trying to lose weight they lose maybe a pound or so the first day but

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.760
 then they stop losing weight if they're eating much less than a thousand

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:43.920
 calories or on a total fast they will lose nothing but muscle after the first

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.960
 day and that's because after about 12 to 24 hours your liver has depleted its

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.520
 sugar stores and at that point it starts turning your muscles and other tissues

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:05.160
 to sugar and that would destroy your body very quickly so the thyroid adapts

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:11.960
 down under stress and so the worse the stress is or the more prolonged the

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:19.160
 lower your thyroid gets and that means that with aging you tend to have

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:26.000
 accumulated so many stresses that your thyroid gets chronically depressed and

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.160
 unless you give it the right signals to bring it back it just stays there and

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:40.600
 gets lower and lower. When your thyroid is low you don't store sugar efficiently

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:47.800
 and so you are very efficient about burning up your body slowly but you

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:55.400
 aren't efficient at repairing it and all you're doing is decaying at a slower

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:02.200
 rate when your thyroid is down so what you want to do is stop the decay process

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:11.840
 and begin the repair process. People have looked at patients in hospitals and they

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.560
 have found that the ones with the same diseases but with a low body temperature

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.920
 are the ones who are less likely to survive and go home and it's because the

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:31.040
 low thyroid which is an adaptation to many stresses and sicknesses at a

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.360
 certain point the low thyroid stops being protective and starts interfering

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.520
 with the healing process and when you have been in that low thyroid state too

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:50.240
 long you are living on adrenaline and cortisone which are destroying all of

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:57.440
 your essential tissues. I've seen many low thyroid people who in a day produced

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:05.160
 30 or 40 times more adrenaline than normal and adrenaline tends to lead

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.200
 immediately to cortisone production depending on how efficient your adrenals

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:16.760
 are and this high adrenaline state creates a terrible amount of confusion

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:24.080
 among doctors and patients both because as an adaptation it makes people feel

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.680
 like they're on speed sometimes to have this adaptive extreme overproduction of

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:37.600
 adrenaline and at night it's normal for adrenaline and cortisone to rise even in

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:44.560
 young people because it's a sort of a fasting state and they're not eating and

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:52.720
 so they maintain these sugar producing hormones during the night but in old age

00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:02.120
 these are higher in general because of the low thyroid so that if your thyroid

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:08.920
 is low or you're old and have low thyroid as a more or less natural thing

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:14.400
 nighttime with the rising adrenaline and cortisone becomes more and more

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:23.440
 stressful and insomnia becomes more and more common it's very usual for people

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.760
 in their 70s and 80s to wake up after five or six hours of sleep and just get

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.120
 up early because they know they aren't going to be able to get back to sleep

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:40.840
 but this also happens in very young people who have low thyroid and when it

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:47.000
 gets to an extreme it can lead to a hyperactive state with loss of attention

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.920
 or extreme irritability and depression and a lot of strange symptoms that if

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:59.720
 you can get your cortisone and adrenaline under control by normalizing

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:08.120
 your thyroid and blood sugar these strange symptoms of high tension just

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:14.480
 disappear one of the common stereotypes about low thyroid people is that they

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.600
 are just lethargic and sluggish but a very large group of low thyroid people

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.680
 become hyperactive because of this very high adrenaline compensating for the low

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:35.080
 blood sugar Broda Barnes who was one of the best thyroid researchers in the 30s

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:41.560
 and 40s wrote a book called hypoglycemia it's your liver not your mind because he

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:50.080
 found that almost all hypoglycemics were low thyroid and that the liver simply

00:15:50.080 --> 00:16:01.680
 wasn't able to store enough glycogen to keep their blood sugar steady the high

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:10.160
 cholesterol that develops in most people as they age is another thing that in the

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:17.160
 30s and 40s many researchers recognized that high thyroid high cholesterol was

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:23.400
 nothing but an indicator of low thyroid the same way low blood sugar was mostly

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:31.560
 an indicator of low thyroid there were published studies in the middle 1930s

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:36.840
 which showed that when you took out someone's thyroid gland immediately the

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.480
 cholesterol went up and when you gave them a thyroid supplement immediately

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:50.000
 the cholesterol goes down that's because thyroid is needed to produce products

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.880
 that the cholesterol turns into such as bile acids progesterone and pregnenolone

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:06.480
 which are youth associated hormones vitamin A and cholesterol are used up by

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:16.560
 thyroid in producing these essential hormones and bile materials I've seen

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.880
 people just like the published studies 60 years ago I've seen people

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:28.880
 consistently in one case the cholesterol went down almost a hundred points a day

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:35.960
 with very frequent big doses of quick-acting thyroid but usually you can

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:44.880
 see it go down 50 points a week with very careful thyroid supplementation the

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.520
 things that are happening to the national diet are mostly created creating

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:58.120
 worse problems for cholesterol metabolism and thyroid function a couple

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:05.560
 weeks ago in the news there was a story about hypothyroidism in China at least a

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:15.600
 hundred million Chinese are hypothyroid and 25 million are retarded and actually

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:23.160
 have cretinism from congenital low thyroid it's been known most of this

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:29.840
 century that in areas where they eat beans as a staple of the diet such as in

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:37.080
 China many types of beans including soybeans but in the Andes region just

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:45.360
 ordinary beans are the major cause of hypothyroidism because of various

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:54.160
 antithyroid factors in beans lentils and certain nuts peanuts for example in

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:05.240
 Eastern Europe the cabbage and turnip staple diets were major causes of

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:15.400
 cretinism and chronic goiter and myxedema myxedema is the name for one

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:23.280
 type of hypothyroidism that develops in adults in which mucusy material forms in

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:33.120
 the tissues makes the tongue thicken the skin gets coarse and inelastic but

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:39.760
 variations of myxedema can cause a lot of strange diseases that are put down to

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:45.000
 genetic causes more often than hypothyroidism but you can cure them in

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.040
 sometimes a week or two with the right dose of thyroid for example certain

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:59.160
 types of mitral valve prolapses are just from a an accumulation of a mucus like

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:06.720
 material in the valve making it thick and inefficient glaucoma in low thyroid

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:14.000
 involves a swelling and overproduction and increased thickness of the fluids in

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.200
 the eyeball some types of Graves disease which most doctors think of as

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.760
 hyperthyroidism but hypothyroidism which causes the pituitary to become

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:36.840
 overactive hypothyroidism very predictably tends to cause bulging eyes

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:45.920
 because the thyroid stimulating hormone from the pituitary causes a mucusy

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:53.040
 material to form in the area behind the eyeball causing a protrusion of the

00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:04.680
 eyeball the mucusy materials that are overproduced also can cause blood vessel

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:11.400
 inefficiency and rigidity and contributes to things like varicose

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:20.880
 veins and when this material gets in the joints it causes cartilage deformities

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:29.120
 the old textbooks used to show teenagers with deformed joints that caused the

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:35.480
 same deviation of the bones at the elbow joint especially and the knee joint

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:41.560
 especially with knock knees for example but in old people you see the fingers

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:49.360
 deviating to one side because the cartilage is getting deformed the right

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.400
 balance of thyroid and the youth associated hormones progesterone and

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:02.080
 pregnenolone and to some extent DHEA will rebalance the production of these

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:08.520
 mucus like molecules the glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides they're called

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:16.280
 and in just a week or two you can often correct the deformity in a permanent way

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:26.640
 so that the joint functions without pain or distortion all of the chronic

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:33.040
 diseases to the extent that they involve this false adaptation in which the

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:39.740
 thyroid tries to put you into a sort of hibernation state all of the chronic

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:46.600
 diseases tend to benefit from the right supplement of these youth associated

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:59.080
 hormones and the history of medical thyroid treatment is necessary before a

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:07.960
 person can understand what the doctor is doing with the tests typically a doctor

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:17.120
 will diagnose normal thyroid function on the basis of a test of the thyroxine in

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.440
 the blood and sometimes backs that up with the normal range TSH or thyroid

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:37.200
 stimulating hormone the TSH usually is somewhere in the range between 0.5 and

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:44.840
 6 units and a person will be called normal when it's anywhere in that range

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:51.400
 but when it's above one unit in other words when it's just anywhere above the

00:23:51.400 --> 00:24:00.480
 lowest normal range the TSH is already causing excess production of the

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:10.480
 mucopolysaccharides that tend to load up the various tissues but still a person

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:20.040
 will be considered normal in terms of the blood thyroid tests because the

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:28.720
 thyroxine is defined as the thyroid hormone itself on the basis of some

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:35.200
 studies that were done 50 years ago the thyroxine is said to be normal in a

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:43.080
 range of for example from 4 to 12 units if you took any other biological

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:49.280
 indicator and and gave it such a wide range 4 to 12 in the case of thyroxine

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:59.320
 or 0.5 to 6.0 in the case of TSH you would have for example blood sugar

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:06.560
 ranging from the level at which it causes convulsions and death up into the

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.240
 low diabetic range and you would call all of those normal or cholesterol

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:19.320
 ranging from the range of the low cholesterol that is associated with

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:28.600
 cancer and strokes up into the very high like three or four hundred milligrams of

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:36.320
 cholesterol so it's a very strange thing that thyroid is given such a definition

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:44.560
 that makes almost everything get called normal what happened was in the 1940s

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:50.600
 forty percent of the American population was known to benefit from thyroid

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:59.920
 supplement and they had a low oxygen consumption but a drug company came out

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:07.000
 with a blood test that was called the protein bound iodine test and it seemed

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.080
 like a rational scientific thing to say that if a person had plenty of protein

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.640
 bound iodine in their blood their thyroid would be okay because people

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:26.720
 knew that an iodine deficiency caused hypothyroidism at that time so the blood

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:34.120
 test found that 95% of Americans had plenty of protein bound iodine and when

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:41.560
 I was in school all of my fat friends with the traditional symptoms of low

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:48.200
 thyroid had been taught to say no I don't have a glandular problem I'm just

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:55.960
 lazy and gluttonous that was passed through the whole culture in the late

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:03.280
 1940s and early 50s then in the 60s it turned out that the protein bound iodine

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:10.240
 test had essentially no relationship to thyroid function and now it's a standard

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:17.960
 textbook point that high doses of iodine can be used to suppress a highly active

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:26.680
 thyroid when it turned out that the protein bound iodine test was proven

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:32.240
 invalid it goes up when your estrogen is high for example knocking out your

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:38.960
 thyroid function new tests were brought to the market actually measuring

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:46.920
 thyroxine and what happened was they kept the standard idea that only 5% of

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:52.760
 the population was hypothyroid even though the test used to establish that

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:59.960
 concept was proven completely meaningless so what we have kept is this

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.160
 doctrine that 95% of the population don't need thyroid and no matter what

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:11.840
 kind of test we use we have to stretch the test to fit the doctrine that only

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:18.120
 5% can get thyroid. Dr. Pete we're coming up to our halfway mark in this segment

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.320
 of our program we're going to take a 60 second station identification break and

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.560
 when we return let's get into some of the other conditions that a low thyroid

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.000
 can affect our cholesterol level arthritis like symptoms has melatonin

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.960
 being found to inhibit progesterone and stimulate estradiol secretion and how do

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:46.080
 we help the thyroid I'm Gary Noll back in 60 seconds. I'm Gary Noll and I'd like

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.720
 to welcome you to our program. In this segment of our program we're going to be

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.520
 continuing with a discussion in part about our thyroid and I've invited a

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.960
 very articulate he's soft-spoken but he is you can see the professor in him and

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.100
 the educator because he's being very methodical he's giving us the larger

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:14.120
 context he's giving us the cause and effect and so we're learning an enormous

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.880
 amount about conditions that we didn't know were related to the thyroid gland

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.840
 in all ages and all body types. So let's continue with Dr. Ray Pete P-E-A-T and

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:30.120
 Dr. Pete let's continue with our discussion. Okay you mentioned the

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:41.160
 hormones estrogen and how it relates to melatonin with increasing age people

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:49.200
 have made the big thing of the fact that melatonin which peaks about 3 a.m. in

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:58.040
 everyone that this peak is a little bit smaller in old age but it happens that

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:08.280
 thyroid is being increased with aging as the thyroid decreases the melatonin

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:17.080
 decreases because when thyroid is active your melatonin comes up as an

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:22.180
 antioxidant defense against the high metabolic rate that thyroid can

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.440
 stimulate so when your thyroid is low your melatonin is low when your thyroid

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:34.800
 is high the melatonin is high in an illogical adaptation because it is an

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:43.640
 antioxidant but the function of melatonin all by itself when it isn't

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:52.760
 surrounded by the appropriate other conditions melatonin in studies done in

00:30:52.760 --> 00:31:01.760
 pig tissue by a man named siratkin pigs are relatively close to humans in having

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.120
 daytime habits nighttime sleep and so on which is very important for melatonin

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:15.920
 because it's a nighttime dominant hormone in pigs he found that melatonin

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:27.000
 suppresses progesterone and raises estrogen and this happens to be the same

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.360
 thing that low thyroid does so if the melatonin rises in proportion to your

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:40.080
 thyroid it doesn't matter that it is having these pro-estrogen anti

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:45.920
 progesterone effects because the thyroid is doing exactly the opposite to those

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.280
 hormones and is taking care of the situation because thyroid gets rid of

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:58.360
 the excess estrogen while producing being totally responsible for producing

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:05.680
 progesterone but if you take melatonin out of context as he did in the pig

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:13.680
 study you're going to get exactly an anti thyroid effect deranging those

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:22.720
 hormones in the direction of stress and aging some of the current publicity that

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:28.600
 is used to promote the fact that melatonin makes you go to sleep it

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:37.560
 happens to be also and a thing that goes up during hibernation and its function

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:43.800
 is to lower the body temperature and remember the hospitalized patients who

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:49.800
 the ones who had the lowest temperatures were the least likely to survive because

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:58.480
 as the the thyroid goes down and your body temperature falls you lose a

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.080
 lot of your immune functions and tissue repair capacity so lowering your body

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:11.400
 temperature does make you hibernate and it does make you sleep but you don't

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:19.040
 want to use something out of context to force that the studies that have been

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:27.720
 used to advocate melatonin possibly anti-aging effect were done on mice and

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:36.080
 rats and that it turns out that they are very opposite to human beings and pigs

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:42.400
 because they work at night in general and sleep in the daytime and so

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.120
 melatonin for them has exactly the opposite meaning that it does for people

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:59.440
 and pigs and for example in in humans and rats melatonin raises prolactin but

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.200
 in humans prolactin knocks out progesterone production and causes

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:12.560
 infertility and stress and osteoporosis for example but in rats it happens and

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:21.080
 mice it happens that melatonin raising prolactin for them prolactin raises

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:27.400
 their progesterone and progesterone has the pro-life anti-aging effect so

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:35.640
 melatonin has been confused by a lot of this rodent based research which is

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:46.080
 opposite in many ways to what it does in people and pigs the effect of thyroid on

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:54.600
 the liver is to not only make it store energy to keep up the blood sugar and

00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:00.760
 prevent the stress cortisol and adrenaline reactions but it is to

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.880
 activate the liver so that it can destroy a hundred percent of the

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:13.160
 estrogen arriving at the liver the liver when it has adequate protein and thyroid

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:21.000
 is just absolutely efficient at getting rid of the estrogen so when you lower

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.920
 the thyroid function you raise the estrogen that is allowed to circulate in

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:37.680
 the organism that happens not only from low thyroid or high melatonin but from

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:45.280
 malnutrition especially protein deficiency doesn't let the liver have

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:54.000
 this detoxifying function so low protein amounts to low thyroid in many ways and

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:01.080
 leads to excess estrogen abnormal risk of blood clotting stroke and heart

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:09.200
 disease and so on if you look at the ovaries when in a dog or a cow for

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:17.040
 example they have removed the animal's thyroid the ovaries develop a polycystic

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:26.320
 condition instead of just one dominant egg follicle preparing for ovulation the

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:34.200
 ovaries fill up with a lot of these fluid filled chambers and ovulation is

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:42.240
 abnormal and they develop the tendency to produce an excess of estrogen so at

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:49.720
 many levels low thyroid leads to an excess influence persistence and

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:57.640
 overproduction of estrogen and it's interesting that the accumulation of

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:04.840
 fluid it's one of these mucopolysaccharides again that swells up

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:12.600
 fills up these many cystic follicles in the ovaries it's the same sort of

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:19.640
 material that fills up the eyeball in glaucoma which is also promoted by low

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:29.680
 thyroid and high pituitary hormones the there are these integrating factors that

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:36.320
 in some ways the it's like an all-or-nothing function for the body the

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.080
 direction of estrogen dominance or the direction of thyroid and progesterone

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:50.080
 dominance and low protein used to be just sort of a laboratory experiment but

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:56.960
 in the last three or four years books have come out advocating almost a

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:04.400
 protein-free diet and so I've had the chance to see many people who have

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:11.840
 absolutely low thyroid symptoms with high estrogen simply because they're not

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.280
 eating adequate protein it it probably should be something like at least 50

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:24.000
 grams of the highest quality protein available and one thing that happens in

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:34.160
 the vegetable diet heavily based on cabbage family or beans lentils and nuts

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:43.200
 these proteins in quality rank about 15 times lower than the highest quality

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.960
 proteins and so even though a person might think they're eating nothing but

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:56.800
 protein-rich foods beans and nuts the quality is so low that their their liver

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:04.440
 simply can't respond to the thyroid besides that the beans and nuts have

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:14.040
 many anti thyroid factors the some of these are being promoted in for

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:22.240
 different effects that they achieve the bio flavonoids the essential so-called

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:30.080
 essential fatty acids or the unsaturated fats these are among other things

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:39.680
 pro-estrogen and anti thyroid so it's a combination of low protein and a whole

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:46.680
 lot of thyroid inhibiting chemicals that the population is being exposed to that

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:58.360
 is increasing the incidence of a lot of these degenerative diseases the

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:06.320
 unsaturated fats show up first in animals after weaning in in some

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:14.560
 experiments when the pregnant animal is given a certain amount of these bean

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:23.520
 oils soybean oil for example or corn oil the mother's body protects the fetus

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:29.560
 from absorbing these and the little bit that gets into the fetus tends to be

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:36.480
 expelled into the fetuses intestine showing that the developing embryo and

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:46.000
 fetus act as if they don't want to absorb unsaturated fats the nursing baby

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:55.200
 also is highly protected so that if you look at the respiratory enzymes in their

00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:02.120
 mitochondria in all of their organs especially the brain during embryonic

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:09.680
 and fetal development and even during nursing these are extremely deficient in

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:16.800
 unsaturated fatty acids that are called essential fatty acids and in some

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:23.160
 experiments they found that the brain didn't develop properly if the baby if

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:29.520
 the developing fetus didn't have saturated fats in sufficient quantity

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:40.120
 and if an extreme amount of unsaturated fats were fed to the pregnant animals

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:48.480
 the baby's brain was inhibited and this is being reviewed in the last few months

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:56.560
 people are pointing out again that an excess or even a high normal amount of

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:04.320
 the unsaturated fats causes retarded brain growth in late fetal development

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:15.200
 or during the nursing stage even though the the fetus in the mother's body or

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:21.200
 receiving only maternal milk even though it is protected against the unsaturated

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:30.280
 fats at some point the young animal begins eating food from the environment

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:38.400
 and when you analyze the mitochondrial oxygen using enzymes you see that at

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.680
 this point they start absorbing the unsaturated so-called essential fatty

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:52.440
 acids and as they absorb the unsaturated fats such as linoleic acid their

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:58.280
 activity declines the respiratory enzymes themselves begin to act more

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:07.120
 slowly and when you look at the whole chain involved in oxygen consumption

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:14.080
 which is essential for the high metabolic activity of young animals the

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:20.000
 whole chain from the respiratory oxygen using enzyme all the way back to the

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.240
 production of thyroid hormone and the transport of the thyroid hormone at

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:34.160
 every stage conceivable the unsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linoleic and

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:40.160
 it's worse in proportion to the number of double bonds so that linoleic is

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:47.560
 about half again as inhibiting as linoleic acid to the thyroid and to the

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:56.280
 respiratory enzymes so the newborn or newly weaned animal has an extremely

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:03.680
 high respiratory rate and its brain is growing at a very fast rate but as it

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:10.960
 absorbs these environmental vegetable synthesized fats its metabolic rate

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:19.000
 slows down its thyroid function slows down and you get a curve of slowing

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.520
 activity from weaning bending sharply at puberty and leveling off in the 20s and

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:36.600
 then going downhill this curve is very closely similar to the curve of loading

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:44.080
 up of the tissues with the unsaturated fatty acids and you can restore the

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:50.960
 activity of the respiratory enzymes simply by changing the dietary fats but

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:58.520
 a complete change since since the fat layers the adipose tissue since it

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:05.480
 stores what the animal has been eating it takes typically four years for a

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.960
 complete exchange of fat even after you've made a complete change in your

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:18.960
 diet but momentarily if you for example take half an ounce of coconut oil you

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:27.280
 get a burst of thyroid like activity and your cells respire more intensely for

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:34.520
 about an hour until that fat is burned up but after about two years of a

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:40.520
 changed diet you've burned up roughly half of your stored inhibiting

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:48.480
 unsaturated fats and your metabolism stabilizes at a much higher level so it

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:57.200
 to to correct the age-associated decline of thyroid function and of respiratory

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:05.920
 energy production you could take a thyroid supplement or you could simply

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:12.000
 change your diet away from the inhibitors the fatty acids are one type

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.240
 of metabolic inhibitor there are a few others for example the age pigment is

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:27.680
 something that is constructed inside our cells every time we're under stress and

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:36.480
 don't get enough oxygen in effect iron is released from storage put into an

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:43.200
 activated state in which it can attack the unsaturated fats that happen to be

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:48.080
 in the cell at the time and the combination of the unsaturated fat and

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:55.000
 the iron and the stress turns these unsaturated fats into age pigment or

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.800
 lipofuscin which accumulates in all of the tissues it's found as the main

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:10.080
 material in cataracts in the lens of the eye in the atheroma in the wall of blood

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:16.960
 vessels that are deteriorating from age and stress in the heart that is aging

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:22.440
 and susceptible to all kinds of malfunction in the Alzheimer's brain and

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:31.680
 so on the age pigment accumulates and it in itself gets an enzyme function which

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:41.680
 bypasses the good energy producing system so after a certain point even

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:51.680
 changing your diet away from the the toxic inhibiting fats won't do the job

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:58.320
 of restoring your thyroid function if you have accumulated so much of this age

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:07.800
 pigment because it is going to waste any oxygen that your cells can receive the

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:17.000
 at this point a whole system of degenerative conditions sets in in which

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:24.560
 the mucoproteins increase because of the stress conditions which are basically

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:29.320
 the same as the low thyroid conditions all of these lead to accumulating

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:36.240
 mucoid materials accumulating the blood vessels are lined with this material the

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:41.560
 white the red blood cells can't pick up oxygen as efficiently because of this

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:49.360
 mucopolysaccharide layer the lung sacs get expanded and thickened so that the

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:55.240
 air doesn't diffuse through them efficiently and that increases the

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:04.000
 susceptibility of the aging animal to stress a smaller stress makes them more

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:11.960
 acutely oxygen deficient and that produces the age pigment at an even

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:24.280
 higher rate the several people are working on ways to remove the age

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:31.480
 pigment you can take brain cells in culture which have age pigment in them

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:39.120
 and one experimenter added vitamin e to the cultured brain cells and found that

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:45.960
 in just two weeks the age pigment had been consumed or eliminated from the

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:52.640
 cells but in that experiment they administered the vitamin e dissolved in

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:58.920
 ethyl alcohol and they had to do a control experiment giving just that

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:05.320
 amount of ethyl alcohol it turned out to be almost as effective as the vitamin e

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:15.120
 so it's been known to be in a free radical quencher it breaks the chain of

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:22.920
 lipid peroxide production and so that suggests that there are probably many

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:30.160
 antioxidants that would help to eliminate age pigment but the first

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:37.360
 problem is simply to slow or stop the production of it by avoiding overloading

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:44.560
 on the things which are known to produce it such as soy oil corn oil excess iron

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:53.600
 and so on even chronic heavy meat eating tends to make American men overload their

00:50:53.600 --> 00:51:03.240
 tissues with iron and it happens that the immune system works better in people

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:09.320
 who by national standards are deficient in iron in other words our standards

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:19.920
 seem to be too high on what they recommend for adequate iron it would be

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:28.280
 a little bit better to eat less iron so Dr. Pete we only have about six minutes

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.760
 to go in our program yeah I think it'd be good if you took that six minutes to

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:35.240
 explain how to build up a healthy thyroid gland to help overcome these

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:41.680
 conditions okay the first thing is to make sure you're eating adequate

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:50.920
 protein such as milk cheese eggs I'm naming them in order of declining iron

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:59.440
 content milk is designed to allow the newborn baby to escape or grow into the

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:06.960
 overcharge of iron it's it's born with so milk is a way of helping to unload

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:13.920
 the body from iron milk milk and cheese are actually deficient in iron and then

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:22.280
 eggs and shellfish ocean grown fish and particularly shellfish are beneficial

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:29.440
 because shellfish use copper as their blood instead of iron or ordinary fish

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:38.480
 use iron and so you can avoid iron by occasionally substituting oysters

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:51.160
 lobster shrimp or crab for fish chicken or meat vegetables are in general

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:57.920
 moderate to high sources of iron but bread and pasta products have iron

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:06.080
 supplemented in this country and that in itself I think is reason to totally give

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:15.520
 up bread and pasta because you are actually seeing a serious increase in

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:24.440
 iron overload diseases in this country after assuring that you have a good high

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:32.520
 protein intake then getting your calories in a safe and non-toxic way is

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:40.760
 the next thing and since the unsaturated fats are produced according to the

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:48.680
 coldness at which the organism grows because our bodies live at 98 or 99

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:56.040
 degrees Fahrenheit their fats any organism that lives at that temperature

00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:01.000
 such as palm trees in the tropics these fats have to be stable at high

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:08.360
 temperatures but at refrigerator temperature they harden and so organisms

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:14.720
 like fish that live in cold water or soybeans or or grains that live in cold

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:20.920
 climates have to have unsaturated oils in proportion to the coldness of the

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:29.000
 environment otherwise the cells couldn't metabolize the oils would harden and in

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:36.280
 those cold temperatures the unsaturated oils don't get rancid very quickly as

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:45.240
 soon as you eat an oil from a cold living organism it starts turning to

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:51.160
 peroxide varnish structure. Okay now remember don't get don't get too

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:57.040
 technical we only have two minutes to go and you got to summarize. Okay the ideal

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:03.880
 calorie source I think is tropical fruits and tropical oils especially

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:13.320
 coconut oil and any tropical fruit that lives at a high temperature papayas the

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:23.920
 custard apple family pineapples anything that that is full of carbohydrates is

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:32.960
 likely to be reasonably low in iron and high in all of the other vitamins and

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:39.960
 reasonable for minerals and they are important as a source of magnesium meat

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:46.160
 and shellfish and fish and so on give you quite a bit of magnesium but the

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:53.680
 fruits are a major source of magnesium without overloading us on iron and the

00:55:53.680 --> 00:56:01.460
 toxic substances because fruits in general from the tropics have small

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:10.200
 amounts of the thyroid inhibiting substances. Seeds in general have the

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:17.760
 thyroid inhibiting substances for a variety of reasons namely the worst of

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:24.320
 them is that plants evolve poisons to prevent their seeds being eaten because

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:30.320
 they wouldn't have a next generation if animals found the seeds palatable and

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:36.280
 safe to eat so the worst poisons plants have are put in the seeds and they turn

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:42.360
 out to be metabolic inhibitors enzyme inhibitors but the fruit generally is

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:47.960
 evolved to serve to distribute the seeds so it's evolved to be safe to the

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:58.160
 animals. Potatoes are the only vegetable protein which is of quality equal to egg

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:05.200
 yolk it's actually a little higher in quality because it contains precursors

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.600
 to the essential amino acids it has more protein in effect than it actually has

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:19.640
 in substance and people misjudge potatoes because they're given as two to

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:25.320
 four percent because wet potatoes are measured where beans are measured in the

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:31.600
 dry state and have 40% protein but that you have to divide the bean protein by

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:37.000
 10 to make it equivalent to potatoes. So you're saying potatoes are

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.320
 good. Dr. Pete we're out of time I want to thank you very much for being with us
