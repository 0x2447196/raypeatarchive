00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, broadcasting worldwide, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Well, a very, very pleasant good morning to you. It's about 11.30 Central Time, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Hope you enjoyed a little visit we had with you this morning.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 And now one of our favorite guys, very intelligent and wonderful man, his name is Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 He's here on the third Monday of each month.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 And as you know, our telephones are out, but we were able to figure out a way how to get him plugged in with a little headset.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 So he may sound different, but who cares?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 We're going to be able to hear him and he can hear me and that pretty much is really what counts.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 If you go to his website, RayPeat.com, he has a great section of articles you can get on his newsletter.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 His approach as he writes here gives a priority to environmental influences on development,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 regenerative processes, and the evolutionary perspective.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 He has done a great deal of work with hormones over the years.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 PhD in biology from the University of Oregon, specialized in physiology, and he taught in a lot of different schools.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 He knows a great deal about the thyroid. He gets so many thyroid questions and hormones.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 So he's a really fun guy to talk to.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Dr. Peat, thank you for being on the show. Good morning.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Good morning.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 How is your life? What are you doing up there in the Northwest? Are you behaving yourself?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Yeah, staying indoors because of the bad weather, reading a lot.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Yeah? What are you reading?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 I've just got RFK Jr.'s book on Fauci.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Oh.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 It's a very, very big book full of, I guess, about a couple thousand references.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Most of the stuff that I have ran across over the last 40 years, it's a tremendously detailed review of the government's position on public health, and especially Fauci's role in it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 I've read that he really has an incredible amount of references, right? I mean, he really went to a lot of work with this thing, didn't he?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Yeah, I think he had about 20 researchers organizing the references.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 So people are denouncing it because they don't like what he concludes, but no one has apparently found any fly in it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 In 400 pages of detailed description of events in the government and science, you would think that the critics could find some little fact to say what's wrong, but they don't.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 I wonder, I don't know if he's getting any kind of exposure on the whole mainstream press. Do you know? I don't know if he is.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Oh, yeah, there have been several, like Associated Press and all of the leading publications have employed banks of reporters to try to find something wrong with it.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And the mainstream media are full of denunciations, but without any factual basis.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Really, so they're just trying to find something wrong with it. What are some of the ideas that you feel are probably most kind of poking people in the eye that they don't like?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Oh, the actual history of the government being involved with the profit-making motive behind the so-called vaccines.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 David Martin going through the history of patents regarding vaccines shows that going back more than 15 years, you can find that they were planning to do this sort of thing.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 More than 15 years ago, the spike protein and the antibodies that are formed in response to the spike protein, both of these were shown to destroy lung tissue.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Way back 15 years ago, so the craziest thing in the world would be to ignore that, that even the antibodies to the spike protein kill lung tissue.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 So the whole concept of an RNA-based vaccine against the spike protein, there's everything wrong with it and nothing right with it, except that you can create a vaccine so-called in a few weeks.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 We're ordinary to actually biologically show that you've got an immune reaction.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 It takes years, on average about 10 years to make a vaccine that works at least against the virus you're starting with, but this one was never shown to work against any virus.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 No virus. It just really was meant to, can you prove that it was just meant to do something other than what's good for the body?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Yeah, if you look at the actual research around 2005, you see that they had explained why the spike protein is harmful and why the antibodies to it are harmful.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 When we form an antibody to something outside the body, that gives us a mirror image protein that locks like a lock and key into the antigen.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 But having formed these antibodies, our body recognizes the novelty of this newly formed antibody and forms antibodies against that antibody.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 The second generation antibody is an exact copy as close as biologically possible to the original toxic antigen.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 So every time we react to any harmful antigen, next two steps away from that, we are creating a copy of the harmful antigen.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And these waves of antibodies against antibodies are expensive. They occupy our immune apparatus.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 And so repeated exposure to different things, good, even so-called good vaccines, if you give 50 different antigens to a person during development,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 you are occupying a huge amount of their immune system, but you're only doing it for the superficial level of antibodies.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Every time you specialize in a new kind of antibody, you're spending your potential, but only you're investing in the possibility that you will confront that particular threat again.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 So you're investing in the past in a way. And that has to do with the accumulated damage of aging.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And in Africa, because of poor diet and exposure to lots of parasites and infections, a warm, humid climate, lots of fungal infections,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 these things are occupying their immune system over and over again.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And that is a burden on the immune system, explaining why the incidence of acquired immune deficiency is so high when the environment is rich in diseases.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 So that is why this whole AIDS thing got so prevalent in the early 80s in Africa, because of the environment.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 But there wasn't really ever, was there, Dr. Peata, an AIDS virus that was isolated and shown and really existed as advertised?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 In a sense, but in Africa, they didn't find that and so they redefined the existence of AIDS as having the infections that typify people with AIDS.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 So tuberculosis is very common in AIDS-infected people, and you see lots of TB in Africa.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Every time you identify a new tuberculosis patient, by definition, that has become an AIDS victim.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Wow.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 It's just a matter of definition.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 So they actually changed the definition or categorization of people dying from AIDS, but not really because they couldn't find this virus? It never really...

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 Yeah, Peter Duesberg has been writing about this. He was the world's leading virologist in the 1960s.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 But as soon as he questioned this idea that there is an AIDS-causing virus, as soon as he questioned that, he was exiled scientifically, not invited to science meetings, not given any grants, ruined, just ended his career totally.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Wow.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 And one of the stories that I hadn't heard before, I think it was in Kennedy's book, is that a well-known medical researcher contacted him by phone and said he wanted to talk to him, flew across the country to have dinner with him.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 And after having supper with him, pulled out a document, a research article supposedly, under Duesberg's name.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Duesberg had nothing to do with writing it, but said, "If you take responsibility and say this is your work, you're back in the science establishment," simply by saying, "I hereby acknowledge the existence of an AIDS virus."

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Oh, wow.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 And he turned it down and just stayed in exile.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 Does Kennedy go into it and do you know how many, so many people did die during this whole thing of who knows what?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Were the drugs the problem, similar to what the injections are today, Dr. Peate?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 The drugs that they gave these kids?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 From the diagnosis as AIDS?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Yes, sir.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Peter Duesberg makes a good case that it was at first recreational drugs that were very popular in the homosexual community.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Yes, sir.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 And then after Fauci became involved, the non-researched or fraudulently researched chemicals to supposedly treat the infection turned out to be deadly.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And Duesberg goes through that history that when the death rate from the recreational drugs was tapering off, the pharmaceutical antiretroviral agents coming on the market took over killing the patients.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Wow. So the AZT, what they gave all the patients when they were diagnosed with having this AIDS virus, right?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Do we know what the tests were like? Was it similar to this PCR test back then? Do we know?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 To diagnose people with this alleged virus?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Yes, the PCR didn't come into use until just about a year after the HIV was supposed to be identified.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 Yes, but this was the work too that Kerry Mullis, who did invent the PCR, he was looking in this, right? And I've seen videos where he says, "I couldn't find any virus."

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 That's right. The existence of the virus was thoroughly established according to Fauci and the government before the PCR test existed.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 And when it did exist, Kerry Mullis said there's no basis for claiming that.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 Wow. We're talking with Dr. Ray Peat. RayPeat.com if you have a question. Dr. Peat.com. Sorry. Let me get the right… sometimes I mess it up. RayPeat.com is what it is. RayPeat.com. If you care to join us, trip… I'm sorry, just Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 So, before we get off this subject, so what do you… so in general, are there similar issues going on with all of these 50-some vaccines they give the kids and the money and the pharmaceutical companies and the government? Are there some real problems with these as well from birth?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Oh, they vary. Each one has its own toxicity and there's a tremendous variation in those.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 But when you add up all of the reported deaths from the pre-existing vaccines, the deaths reported from the new so-called vaccines, something like a hundred times more than from all of the existing vaccines added together for the last 10 years.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 There were several of the standard so-called vaccines that were very toxic, like for the papillomavirus, fairly toxic, the antitetanus shot.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Others were almost harmless, but still, they were all a burden to the immune system.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 And adding up even these things which were only about 1% as harmful as the present RNA virus vaccines, when you add up these relatively harmless things, then you see a tremendous increase in allergies.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Not a massive wave of deaths in middle-aged and younger people, but allergies developing in childhood.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 So, it's about 50 times as many allergic kids and young people as before the 1970s, 80s when vaccines were really pushed.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Yeah, we talked with a gentleman, Dr. Peat, who did a whole huge study about this and the health of kids who were not vaccinated and the health of kids who were vaccinated, like you're saying.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 It was an incredible study and boy, they just threw him out of the medical association and closed his practice and boy, they didn't want to hear it.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 They didn't want to hear any of it. Amazing.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 The hepatitis B vaccine was shown to cause lingering brain damage in animal studies.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Wow.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 And they gave it to little kids as if everyone was going to be exposed to sexually transmitted hepatitis or to contaminated intravenous drugs.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 So, even the theoretically harmless measles, mumps, rubella, you know, they just give the kids.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Cowan and others argue that they really do mess up the innate immune system.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And what you're saying is, if that's been proven, then the kids will get whatever, ear infections and all kinds of stuff.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Yeah. For example, there is evidence that the kids who had normal measles are relatively resistant to developing cancer later in life.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Who just go ahead and had the measles.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Yeah.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 After they have less cancer. Wow.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 My goodness.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 What a thing.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 How did we get into this whole vaccine paradigm anyway?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 I mean, when I was a kid, what, 60 years ago or 70, for goodness sake, they weren't giving us a whole load, were they?

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 I don't remember getting a bunch of vaccines.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 No, in the late 1930s and through the 1940s, my parents just got their information from newspapers and radios and magazines and so on.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 And still, there was enough evidence already to indicate that vaccines were very questionable as a preventive or as a harmless measure.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Starting fairly early, at the beginning of the 20th century, there was evidence that injecting anything intramuscularly, anything irritating especially,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 predisposed kids to getting paralysis of the area that receives the injection.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 So, if it went in their right hip, that leg was more likely to develop polio paralysis or the left shoulder, that left arm was much more likely to become paralyzed.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 That has been reported now for over a hundred years.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 My goodness.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And there were very, very well publicized studies in the 1950s that pretty well turned everyone who was at all informed against the vaccines.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 And that effect of the area affected by polio is still seen in Africa today.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 The frequency of paralysis of a particular part of the body corresponds closely to the site of vaccination.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 My goodness.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Do they still give polio vaccines today?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Yeah.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Currently, I think most of it is called the vaccine-derived polio.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Paralysis very specifically relating to the virus given in the vaccines.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Yes, sir.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Wow.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Okay, we're going to take a little break here.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Dr. Peat, stay right there.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Thanks for, he's got a headset on.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 Our phones are out, as you know, and we worked that over the weekend.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 And thanks for doing that, sir.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 This is Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Many people have said, and we concur, that the number one investment we should make is in our health.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 Here's George Wiseman.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Last caller, I'm sorry I didn't remember his name, said an investment.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 And this is really the investment kind of thing that you need to do.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Not my machine specifically.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 I think I sell the world's best machine, and I do my best to maintain it and support the customers and everything.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 But regardless of who you get it from, you really should invest in your health.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 How are you going to enjoy life if you haven't got health?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 How are you going to fulfill that bucket list?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 So number one on the bucket list should be your health, and then you get some extra years.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 I say this thing not only adds years to your life because the science is showing a 30% to 50% life extension.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 So I'm expecting to go to the 120, 150 years old, and I'd help a lot of people between now and then.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 But it also adds life to your years.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 There's no sense living your last decade of life if you're in a hospital bed attached to machines.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 You know what I mean?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Throwing a frisbee and having fun.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 It's so true, isn't it?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Boy, if we don't feel good and have the energy to do what we need to do, I mean, what's the point?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 And here's an investment with a lifetime warranty and also a one-year, no questions asked, money back guarantee if you don't want it.

 The Aquacure Browns Gas Machine on Radionetwork.com.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 One of the very first things I do in the morning is come sit at my meditation chair,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 and that's when I take my dual-extracted mushrooms from Sir Thrivall, the chaga and the reishi.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 Both of these mushrooms are immunomodulators.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 If you had too strong of an immune system, like autoimmunity, it'll help to downregulate and calm the immune system.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 If you have too weak of an immune system, like an immunodeficiency, they help to upregulate or strengthen your immune system.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 So whatever you're dealing with, they help to bring your immune system to balance.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 In addition to being immunomodulators and adaptogens, chaga is probably best known for its extremely high aurac value or antioxidant content.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 It scavenges the body of free radicals.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 And reishi has a long history being used in conjunction with meditation and for reaching higher states of consciousness.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And that's why I like to take these right before my meditation.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 There's a lot of medicinal mushroom supplements on the market to choose from,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 but most are made with cheaply produced mushrooms grown on grain and either ground up and put in capsules or extracted in non-organic alcohol.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Sir Thrivall does it differently.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 We use wild harvested chaga and organic certified wood-grown reishi fruit bodies, not the mycelial extract.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 And then we use an organic alcohol and a hot water extraction method,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 and then recombine so you get the full benefits of these extremely high quality mushrooms.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 It's a great company and we love Daniel and his work.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And it's just been such an honor over the years to work with him and sell his products.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 One of our faves is the pine pollen here.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 And it'll keep your testosterone levels up, as my test that you have seen.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 We'll substantiate and then, oh, this is a good one here.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 We got some CBD oil from Daniel Vitalis.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 And what else do I got here?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Well, that's about it right here in front of me.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Oh, the Digestive Bitters.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 This is a nice thing for digestion.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Digestive Bitters.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Spray that puppy on there.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 So, it's a good company.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Colostrum, great company.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Let us know if we can provide you any information with it.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And I think you'll really enjoy this Thrival product.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 So, try the Colostrum.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 I put it in my smoothies and I think you'll have a great experience.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 I just wanted to mention, if I could go back about 60 seconds and talk about George Wiseman and the hydrogen machine.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 After two and a half years, my hydrogen machine just stopped, you know.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 And these things happen, you know, they're machines.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 And it was just amazing.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 I just emailed George.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 He said, "Don't worry."

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 He said, "I'll send you out a new machine and all you got to do is just take the machine that I send you, put your old machine back in there, postage paid.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 You can call UPS and have them pick it up or bring it to them and you're done."

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 And that's the way he works.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 So, there is a lifetime warranty on the hydrogen machine and a one-year, no questions asked, money-back guarantee.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 I don't know anybody.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 And George is very, very careful about doing everything that he's agreed to do with these warranties.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And he's a good guy.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 I was missing it, man, I tell you what.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 So, check it out.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 It's the hydrogen machine on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 [Music]

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 [Music]

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 If I can do that.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Okay.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, I want to ask you about this.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 We had a gentleman on our show, a doctor, an MD, written about 10 books.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 And he was talking about how he believed that the research shows, if you look at anthropologists and such, that grains are really, really not good for us.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 And he kind of presented the argument that grains and sugar are really the problems behind heart disease and such.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 So, let me ask you about that.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Are grains okay, in your opinion?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Did you say greens or grains?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Grains, grains.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Sorry.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 I know you have a hard time with this new system.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Grains, yeah, like grains, like everything.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Grains, grains.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Yes, if they're properly prepared, they're fine.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Thousands of years ago, people, I guess, cooking around an open fire, found that if they got ashes, wood ashes, into their cooking wheat or corn or whatever their cereal was,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 that it tasted better and that it was better for their health, easier to digest, more nutritious.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 And that it's now called, generally, it's called "nextimalization."

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 Yes, sir.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 And you've told us about this, right?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Nextimalization of the corn in Mexico, and we can do this.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Yeah, it tastes very good and it's very digestible.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 And highly nutritious.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 The toxins of the grain are mostly removed or destroyed by the alkali.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 At the same time, the tryptophan, which in itself leads to a promotion of serotonin and inflammation.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 The tryptophan, which is a potential toxin, is converted to niacin, niacinamide, which is one of the signs of eating corn unprocessed, is the deficiency disease of niacin.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 And people who use the nextimalized corn don't get that deficiency disease because it gives you a very abundant source of niacinamide.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 And the removal of the polyunsaturated fats is part of it. They saponify a very large proportion of them, become soap-like in the presence of lime or the calcium hydroxide, lime.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 And in the saponified form, they wash out and are thrown away or added to chicken food or whatever for extra calories.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 But simply reducing the PUFA content of the grain is a very important thing.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So the nextimalization of corn has been used in traditional, in South America and Mexico for a long time. People just kind of knew it. They figured it out, passed it along to generations.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 And in Asia, other grains, including wheat, were processed in the same way.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 And people have experimented trying out maybe a dozen different types of grain, saying that they all are improved in flavor and digestibility by the process.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 So could this doctor be accurate if you're just pulling in a white rice or a wheat or a bread or something off the shelf, that these things are not good for you?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Yeah, the storage protein, not to mention the PUFA, the unsaponified PUFA is an inhibitor of protein digestion.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 And so any protein that is in the ordinary grain is very poorly digested because the PUFA is one of the plant's protective toxins to discourage the consumption of their seeds.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Because wheat and, they're really seeds, aren't they? They're really seeds of the grass, right?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Yeah, and when a person digests the storage protein, gluten for example, gluten is somewhat worse than the other storage proteins.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 But the sense of storing, it's nitrogen which is being stored in a concentrated form.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 And if you sprout the grain, let it turn into a bit of vegetable rather than a starchy cereal, that converts a potentially toxic nitrogen-rich compound into an actual protein that has nutritional value.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 So if it's unsprouted and unprocessed by alkali, those storage proteins, especially combined with polyunsaturated fats, make it practically useless nutritionally.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 The so-called protein value just isn't there in practice. It's there analytically, but since our animal digestion is blocked by these agents themselves, they are very poor nutritionally.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Fascinating. So you're talking about, in a sense, if you were going to do rice, I don't know, oats or any steel cut,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 well you can't sprout oats, I guess, but can you sprout just white organic rice and then that would turn it into a usable, not harmful food?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 If it has been processed, making it white, you've probably removed the germ and you'll get some, if it hasn't been heated, just soaking it, you'll activate some enzymes that reduce the toxins.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 The oats, if it hasn't been heated, will sprout, but you have to check that the grain is vital because they're often sterilized chemically or heated and that prevents the enzyme activation that makes them safer.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 So in general, we have to really be creative, otherwise most of the grains that we're consuming are either worthless or could be causing inflammation of the gut and things?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 Yeah, about 50 years ago there were some good studies of comparing the protein in rice, which just from the analysis, it would look like it was a fair source,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 but when you compare it to the protein quality of cooked greens, spinach or kale for example, the quality of the protein in the leaf is much higher, similar to milk protein, than the grain,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 such that while there might be 6 or 7% chemically, analytically, in some of these feeding experiments, amounted to hardly more than zero protein.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 When you compare it to the leaf protein, that ranked similar to milk or meat in quality.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 What if you wanted to use a really ancient wheat like einkorn, which is supposed to be pretty good stuff, would you have to sprout it before making bread to make it worthwhile?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Yeah, much better when it has been soaked to make sourdough or even starting the sprouting process.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 But the smaller, the ancient grains generally seemed kind of meager, not plump with starch and that meant that the protein and mineral value is a lot higher.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 And that's good.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 I see. So, am I hearing you say the more modern grains after hybridization or whatever has been a lot of the gluten problems and not maybe the ancient ones as much, the ancient grains?

00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Yeah, they are bigger and have more starch and gluten, but those are not beneficial in general.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 So, this guest idea that the starch, I guess he's talking about the starch out of the grains, could be a contributor towards heart disease or heart problems?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 Oh, the starch? There have been a series going back about a hundred years of studies showing that if you put in especially raw starch, you can purify the starch, corn starch, potato starch,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 each has a characteristic granule size ranging from five microns in diameter to a hundred microns in diameter.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 And if you give a good feeding, maybe a stomach tube to put a lot of starch in at once and then sample the animals, bloodstream, its liver fluids, its cerebrospinal fluids, the urine, all of the body fluids,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 every 15 minutes you find it first going into the bloodstream and from there to the brain and from the blood into the urine finally.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 So, even though they are large particles approaching and even much bigger than a red blood cell, these particles unchanged as far as can be seen will go from the intestine right into the circulating body fluids.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 And that's not good?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 So, when they reach a capillary or a small arterial, they're too big to go ahead and so when they slice up the mice, for example, after they've been fed that way,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 they find that their bodies and brains are full of little areas of dead tissue, every place a grain particle clogged an arterial, the surrounding tissue died for lack of oxygen and nutrients.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 And the same procedure has been tested in medical students, giving them a glass, a slurry of corn starch or potato starch and then every 15 minutes they're drawing blood or checking their urine.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 And you can centrifuge the blood or urine and find the characteristic size and form of the starch granules that they were fed.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:39.000
 And you can decrease the effect if you take the fat in a well-cooked form and with butter or cream to slow the absorption.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 And if your peristalsis is very active, for example, if you take it with coffee, more of them go through into your bloodstream.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 So, something is always happening to some extent, but the more the starch is cooked and eaten with a balanced diet including milk or cream.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 So, that would be why, would you say then a well-cooked potato with butter is pretty good? Better than, it's okay?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Yeah.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Really well-cooked, right? Really well-cooked.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Meaning that the starch reaches about Fahrenheit 211 degrees completely cooked, takes about an hour of baking a potato.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 Yeah. So, then that turns the starch into something else?

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 Into a chemically softened starch. It's much easier to test.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 So, if we're just going out and getting, say, an organic rice, whether it be basmati or organic brown rice from California and doing nothing, could that cause these particles from the starch in the rice to be not good for our heart? Possible?

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Right. And the polyunsaturated fats.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 In the rice.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 In the, yeah, in the unprocessed rice. The reason the Chinese developed the polishing process to make white rice is that much of the oil in the bran and germ are removed.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 Are gone.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Yeah. So, there's nothing much left to get rancid. So, polished white rice is less allergenic and less cumulative toxicity.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Oh, so that's why they've been able to just eat white rice in China for whatever, for so long, because they get rid of the poopers and other things that can get oxidized?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Yeah, it's more like eating sugar.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 More like eating sugar. Wow. So, can you actually take some of this white rice that's so common, say, in China, or you can get it here, that's been, everything's been taken off, Dr. Peat. If you put that in there, would that sprout? Could you sprout that at all, overnight? Would it do anything?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 If it hasn't been heated, there will still be some vital enzymes that will break down the starch and protein.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 So, is that the process of sprouting? You're breaking down this starch and protein? Why, people sprout different things? That's what's going on?

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 Yeah, yeah, and it helps to eliminate the pooper.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 The pooper, because there's poopers in these grains, right?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 And that's what gets rancid so quickly, in the whole grain.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Wow. Wow.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 The fat of having whole grains rather than white flour, it's true that they contain much more mineral value, but still, they're a risk for the rancid fats.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 For the rancid fats, because they got them in there because they've not been polished out.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 Right.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Right. Wow.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 This guest recommended that people could do a test. I wanted to ask you about this NMR lipoprotein panel. Are you familiar with this?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 NMR?

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 Yes, sir.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Nuclear magnetic resonance. I don't know if that's a particular blood test.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 It's supposed to show the different size particles of the different cholesterol and things like that in there.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 But you've not heard of this one, NMR. Oh, it actually measures the number of small LDL particles.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 Oh. Yeah.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 Yeah, the smaller particles get rancid much more quickly because their surface is greater in relation to the mass.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Wow. So we don't want small LDL particles. We want big ones, big puffy ones?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 Yeah, there's a close connection between heart health and egg eating helps to keep the particles big.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 And so eggs have a heart protective effect in reducing the number of ultra small fat particles.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 Interesting. So in general, we kind of put together the idea of the particles are big, they could clog up things, but it's just the opposite because of the rancidity factor.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 Yeah, the bigger particles are much less exposed to oxygen.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 Wow. That's pretty cool. Right.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 So in the heart disease, then the smaller starchy kind of things, they get into arteries and then that causes a problem.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 That's what's causing a mild and can cause myocardial infarctions as well.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 That hasn't been as directly and clearly shown, but the starches do cause vascular damage on the small vessels.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 They do cause vascular damage.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 Yeah, and that triggers immunological changes. The damage makes you have a general systemic allergic reaction to the starches or the grains they come from.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 And that would contribute to your heart and artery damage.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 And then that could also call in the cholesterol and also what comes after the cholesterol, something, another substance to try to smooth things out.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 And that could cause buildup of these things in the arteries because of the infection.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 Yeah, the cholesterol is involved in detoxifying the polyunsaturated fatty acids that cause oxidative damage to the lining of the artery.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 Wow.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 And so the cholesterol temporarily reduces inflammation and should over time gradually reduce the damage.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 But if you keep eating PUFA, you keep damaging the arteries and the PUFA combines with the cholesterol and gets overloaded in the tissue.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 So you get a plaque of what's really half and half PUFA and half cholesterol.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 Wow. And then that's where the calcium might come in too to try to patch things up.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Yeah, once the tissue is damaged, then the calcium tends to take it out of action.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 So this is one of the reasons why you've been such an advocate of getting PUFAs out of your life, right?

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 Right, a big part of it.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 And the information goes back close to 100 years.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 The 1930s was when they really started thinking about what's going on with age treatment.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 And in the 1940s, it was clearly established that PUFA increase accelerates age treatment formation and all of the degenerative processes.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 And it turns out that vitamin E slows that process and that was involved in not only selling vitamin E as a protective antioxidant, which isn't its exclusive function.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 It functions as an anti-inflammatory agent and as an anti-estrogen.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 But once they could show there was an antioxidant, that took over and they didn't talk anymore about the anti-inflammatory, anti-estrogen effect

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 because estrogen was being sold as a protective thing rather than a promoter of age treatment and tissue damage.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 Would that be an argument for most of us or some of us or all of us to do some vitamin E regularly just to be good for you? Reasonable?

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 I think so. The studies over the years have got different results, but it's because what is called vitamin E has been redefined so much.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 For a time, it was defined as a substance that increased fertility by opposing estrogen.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 Then it was turned into simply an antioxidant.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 And then the manufacturer changed and became very low in the anti-estrogen effect and tended to have more fatty acids, polyunsaturated fats, right in the vitamin E product.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 And during those years, vitamin E supplements tended to increase mortality because they were actually selling anti-vitamin E mixed in with the vitamin E.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 But when you look at the nature of the substance you're talking about, then yes, vitamin E is very protective.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 And then, go ahead, go ahead.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 It probably only takes about 30 to 50 milligrams per day to give you full protection.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 And what should we look for if our listeners want to find a vitamin E to take every day?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 What would be in a product? What would you look for?

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 A fair amount of viscosity and dark color and a high potency in the smallest volume.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 You don't want a big clear capsule that's been diluted.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 Like a huge one.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 Yeah, they get the most IUs for the smaller the capsule.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 Right, so you get less PUFA.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 Oh, you get less PUFA. But would you do a mixed, what do they call it, tocopherols, whatever that is, mixed one?

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 Yes, those are the anti-inflammatory components.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 And what are these things made out of, Doc, these vitamin E's? Where do they come from?

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 Plants make them as regulatory signal materials.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 Very interesting. Wow. Well, that's good information.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 So, again, on the potatoes, they're okay.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 You just need to cook them a lot, really cook them well, and put butter on them, right?

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 Right. Or cream. Cream's okay.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 Cream's okay. And then on the grains, now there is a company that you can get nixtamalized corn.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 I have some of that. That's really nice. You can find it online, just Google it.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 But then anything else, if you're going to do wheat, even the ancient wheat, you'd probably want to try to sprout it first, maybe, if you can.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 Yeah, and it isn't hard to nixtamalize your own stuff. It takes maybe an hour extra.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 Really? So you're using lime? Lye?

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 Yeah, calcium hydroxide.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 Calcium hydroxide. And you can nixtamalize pretty much anything?

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:48.000
 As far as I know, people have told me that they've used barley and some of the old fossil grains.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 Interesting. Do you do this, if you don't mind me asking, for your own grains? Do you use calcium hydroxide if you're going to eat it?

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 What was the first question?

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 Do you do this for yourself if you're going to eat some kind of grains? Do you make sure?

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 I've done it, but I usually just buy the masa prepared.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Yeah, the nixtamalized. Pretty cool. Very interesting. Let's take a few emails here.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 Good morning. My question for Dr. Peat is, if the worst comes to be in this crazy world, what would you do to survive without a thyroid?

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 Oh, they don't have a thyroid. Having been radiated, would there be a way to survive or just die a slow, happy death? Thank you.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 They don't have to die without a thyroid, do they, Dr. Peat?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 You can theoretically at least make it yourself.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 If you, for example, boil milk with oysters in it or seaweed, a source of iodine and trace minerals, the prolonged boiling will create iodinized casein, which in effect works like thyroid hormone.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 You can make it right in your kitchen. If it happens that you weren't able to buy a thyroid in a pharmacological form.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:47.000
 Wow, that's fascinating. So you're actually cooking oysters in milk, is what you're saying? Oysters in milk?

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 Yeah, the reaction between trace minerals, casein, and iodine will produce an active thyroid-like substance.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 Fascinating. Now that's, if I understand though, you're not a fan of just taking, no matter what kind, just iodine, right?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:24.000
 No, it's so easy to overdose and lots of people have a strange allergy-like reaction to added iodine or iodide.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 No one really understands what is going on. It's some peculiarity of the immune system, but it's fairly common.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 What would those reactions present themselves as with too much iodine?

00:59:41.000 --> 01:00:05.000
 Just getting very sick, headaches, constipation or diarrhea, arthritis pains, and the studies, I've seen about 70 different studies of the addition of iodide to salt.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 If you have three or four times more than the daily requirement of iodine taken in through iodized salt, over the years the risk of hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer greatly increase.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
 Wow.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:38.000
 So, on a population basis, the iodized salt has been harmful to public health.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.000
 Wow, and that's all, pretty much, most everybody eats, right? The iodized salt from the blue container?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:12.000
 Yeah, most of the salt in the store, I think, is iodized. If you're in an iodine deficient area, there are areas in the Andes and Mexico and around the Great Lakes that have traditionally been deficient in iodine.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 And so, it's okay in those regions, but some studies found that when iodine was being used as a dough conditioner, the average American was getting about 10 times more iodine than desirable if they ate bread.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 I see. There's a gentleman that emailed earlier that he had an Achilles heel problem and they had to operate and they loaded him up with antibiotics. He did, let's see, Anaceph IVs for three weeks.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:08.000
 And he wanted me to ask you how he can kind of repopulate everything down there, repopulate his microbiome thing.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:33.000
 Sometimes the bacteria in yogurt help. For example, the Greek yogurt has reduced lactic acid content, but still it's full of the anti-inflammatory bacteria. It's probably a safe addition to the diet.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 That's a real thick Greek yogurt.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
 Yeah.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 Aaron writes in, "I thought drinking orange juice caused an insulin spike and it was my understanding that an insulin spike was a bad thing."

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
 A what spike?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
 Insulin spike, insulin, with drinking orange juice.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:16.000
 Yeah. If you don't take it with other food, but just slowing down the absorption with milk, for example, will moderate that insulin spike.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:32.000
 And if you compare it to rice, sucrose in the orange juice contains an insulin-moderating component.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:51.000
 The fructose slightly inhibits the release of insulin compared to rice or corn starch, which breaks down into pure glucose, lacking the moderating effect of fructose.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:12.000
 So when you look at the glycemic index, the starch is at the top of the list and sucrose is well down the list because the fructose has a moderating effect.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:20.000
 And also the high potassium content of orange juice has a moderating effect.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000
 But you mentioned that you want to always drink it with something else that is okay on its own, orange juice?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:36.000
 If you drink it slowly, don't go down eight ounces at once, but just as if you're...

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
 A little bit.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:49.000
 Yeah, like if there are four oranges in a glass of juice, just spread it out over time as if you're eating the whole orange.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
 I see. That makes sense.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Tampone, January 17.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:08.000
 Mary says, "Dr. Peat, I have a low thyroid. How can I get armor thyroid from a pharmacy in Mexico, or is there something better to take than armor thyroid?"

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
 I guess she's in Mexico.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:31.000
 It's very hard to get in Mexico, as well as being expensive, but almost all of the drugstores in Mexico will have two forms of a compound that includes T3 and T4.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 Cetoplus contains the ratio that armor thyroid... In fact, they designed the product to be equivalent to armor thyroid, a four to one rate ratio of T4 to T3.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 And then another product called Novo T-Ral is a five to one ratio, and it's pretty good.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:12.000
 So if you just go out and get an armor or nature thyroid or whatever from pharmacy, it's about a four to one for T4 to T3 in general?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:22.000
 Yeah, the natural gland actually varies from three to one to four to one.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 Okay, pretty close. So the Cetoplus, which you can get into a Mexican pharmacy, is four to one, so that would be a reasonable replacement, right?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 Yeah, it works almost identically.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:47.000
 Almost identically. Okay.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:06.000
 Here's an interesting email. In Science News in 2003, the exosomes used as vaccine carriers were already proved to shed so much show that they were called a kind of biological FedEx.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:15.000
 Is this shedding why the vaccinated are causing more death than the unvaccinated?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:27.000
 Yeah, the phenomenon of shedding through our breath, sweat, urine, saliva, it's going on all the time.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 And Pfizer was fully aware of that and warned their team of vaccinators not to let pregnant women or breastfeeding women get exposed to someone who had been vaccinated.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:08:08.000
 So that knowledge going back at least 10 or 15 years was fully known by Pfizer, who put it in their instructions in the very beginning when they were testing the vaccines.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:22.000
 So folks that are getting this alleged COVID injection, what are they shedding in their sweat and their breath? What are they shedding?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:37.000
 Just like everyone is shedding some of their natural proteins, RNA, DNA, lipids, a little bit of all of our chemistry.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
 We shed this all the time, right? Just by breathing.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:55.000
 Yeah, you put a cold piece of metal under your nose and fluid condenses on it, then you analyze that and you find surprisingly big stuff.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:07.000
 The exosomes, the free pieces of RNA, free pieces of DNA, very complex, complex fixtures.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:16.000
 So what do you suppose that's about spiritually or philosophically or evolutionary? Why are we putting out these exosomes all the time?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:31.000
 I think it's a form of biological cooperation. Like bacteria, even bacteria of different categories.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:48.000
 If one group has been exposed to an antibiotic and survives, they will develop a bit of DNA that specifies how to make a detoxifier to the antibiotic.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 And they will join up with other bacteria, even of different species, and transmit their DNA instructions right through a little tube.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
 So the new species gains the knowledge.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
 Wow.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:21.000
 So if bacteria learned somehow to cooperate with each other and improve their survival, I think all of the higher levels are doing it constantly.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000
 Wow.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:39.000
 That we're sampling our environment in its genetic composition, and our organism probably most of the time is checking it to see if it has anything useful.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
 And occasionally some harmful material comes in instead.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:58.000
 So if we get some exosomes in from others out in the store that are not useful, it's not harmful to us generally.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:20.000
 Yeah, there's a lab in Germany that has found all of our food substances' DNA in our bloodstream and tissue, and some of them are actually incorporated in our own genomes.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 I didn't quite understand that. So what is the company doing in Germany with the food?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 If you eat beef regularly, you can find some beef genetic material circulating in your blood.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000
 Yes.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:52.000
 And then if you culture some of the animal's tissues, occasionally you can find that some of that DNA has made its way into the nucleus and become part of us.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:13.000
 There's evidence that an algae, a toxic algae, can deliver its toxic DNA to our system and become incorporated.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:33.000
 So there is some suggestion of a toxic effect being picked up from certain organisms, but also the possibility that we can use that material constructively.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:49.000
 So in a sense though, is it possible if we are around injected people with these, which we believe are very dangerous, things that we could learn from it or deal with it or not so much?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:03.000
 I think if you look at the mortality around different countries in relation to their continuing vaccination processes,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:24.000
 I think what's happening is that we're calling the shedding phenomenon and the vaccination delivery of the toxins, we're calling that an epidemic.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:43.000
 I think the epidemic is really long past what we're having is echoing of the shedding effect and the new vaccination damaging our resistance.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:51.000
 And no telling what this, whatever test they're using is picking up, right? There's just no telling, is there?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:00.000
 Yeah, they have failed to demonstrate the meaning of the tests they're giving.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:10.000
 Yes, sir. So all these new cases that we see in the news, it's just not relevant, is it Dr. Peat?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
 Relevant as far as spreading some kind of a mysterious thing.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:24.000
 Yeah, Terry Mullis' observations I think are still relevant.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:34.000
 You spin it enough, it'll pick about up anything I think is, those were his words, right? The CT, the circulation threshold.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:45.000
 Yeah, what you have to do is show a causal relation between your test and symptoms.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
 Which hasn't really been done, has it?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
 No.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:15:01.000
 No. Marilyn writes in, "What would you do for a child with a fever, cough and throwing up? What do you consider to be dangerous high temperatures and how would you treat it?"

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:15.000
 Aspirin and all of the anti-inflammatory things. Sugar has really been neglected as an anti-inflammatory thing.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:26.000
 It reduces stress, lowers the stress hormones and reduces the inflammatory cytokines.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
 Sugar.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
 To do the damage.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 Sugar.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
 Sugar.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
 Great.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000
 But, it teaches that for the last 30 years, they told us sugar was going to kill us, right?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 Yeah, but sugar corresponds pretty well to the production of carbon dioxide. And if something, if stress causes us to shift from glucose oxidation to fatty acid oxidation,

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:15.000
 that lowers the CO2 production and increases lactic acid production, which supports all of the inflammatory problems.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:24.000
 So, getting your CO2 up by maintaining glucose oxidation should be a basic thing.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:35.000
 So, when we saw sugar, it could be anything from organic beet sugar or maple syrup or honey or orange juice or fruit?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:47.000
 Honey and orange juice are very good. The maple syrup, the brown stuff is a fairly inflammatory material in itself.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
 Oh, the dark stuff. I thought the darker was the better. No?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:07.000
 Well, it does correspond in mineral content, but also there are amino acids which heated in the presence of the sugar, you get a toxic reaction between amino acid and glucose.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 Oh.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:18.000
 And that's brown. So, the browning of food tends to increase its allergenicity.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:24.000
 I thought they just got the maple syrup out of the tree and that's it. But no, they cook it.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 Oh yeah, you have to boil it for a long time. Same with cane sugar. If you just juice a stick of cane, you have a very nice amber colored solution, which is very, very safe.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 But if you cook it long enough to get black molasses, the reaction between amino acids and sugars are allergenic or toxic.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
 So, if you like maple syrup, you want to try to find a light one that's the least processed.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
 Right.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:16.000
 Wow. I can remember when I spent some time in Hawaii, they used to have these carts, Dr. Peat, on the road and they would just have the raw cane sugar, right?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:24.000
 And they would juice it right there. And you could have a glass of that. It was pretty fun. Yeah, right there on the side of the road.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
 Yeah, I think it's a very good juice.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:37.000
 Very good for you. Can Dr. Peat, wow, this is interesting. Can Dr. Peat discuss how hazardous raw and undercooked starch is?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 Like the presorption of raw starch, a cause of senile dementia and many other studies. Wow, this person's done some research.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
 So, what would be like a raw starch, an undercooked starch? What would that be?

01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:02.000
 Most people don't like to cook their rice until it's gummy, for example.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
 Yes, sir.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:13.000
 They like some separation of the kernels. Until it's gummy, you're still going to have some of the risky starch particles.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:26.000
 Wow, so that would be an undercooked would just be rice. And then what's, when we get that starch, that undercooked starch, what are the dangers? What goes on there?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:44.000
 If you aren't having it with fat and if you eat a lot of it regularly, then I think you have the risk that they saw in their experimental animals of premature dementia.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 Wow, it goes to the brain. It's just something that starts messing with the brain.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:20:06.000
 Yes, the arterioles that get plugged by a starch granule, everything downstream from that arteriole gets deprived of nutrition and is likely to die.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:19.000
 That's not good. So, in general, I guess even organic brown rice pasta or pasta could be a challenge to eat, right?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:28.000
 Yes, I think pasta and rice and such things should be boiled for at least 40 minutes.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 Whoa, could you imagine cooking pasta for 40 minutes? It would just be all gum, wouldn't it? Just be all gum.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 That's right.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:53.000
 But I guess you could take some organic, I don't know, einkorn and then sprout the weed and make your own or something like that would be okay, I guess, huh?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
 Right.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:13.000
 What does Dr. Peat think of tocotrino vitamin E versus mixed tocopherols role in the PUFA toxicity? So, we have tocotrino vitamin E versus mixed tocopherols.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:37.000
 I would go with the tocopherol mixture. In feeding experiments, the tocotrinols cause liver enlargement if they gain very much of it and that indicates some kind of a stress effect from the trienes.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:53.000
 Here's a good one. Is dry vitamin E legitimate? Dirk Pearson and Sandy Shaw recommended back in 1982. I remember that book. Remember that Pearson and Shaw book? Dry vitamin E, any such thing?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:03.000
 It does have some vitamin E value, but there is no dry vitamin E.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
 No such thing.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:17.000
 Yeah, it's just, yeah, succinane is sometimes sold that way as having special anti-tensor effectors.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
 I see.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 Remember, Dirk at one point was recommending rubbing estrogen into his scalp to make his hair grow.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
 Yeah, did it work?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
 No.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 That didn't work. That didn't work.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 Got any ideas? Writes an email for thinning hair. It seems to start after I had a plate and screws put in my wrist after it broke. Oh. So, I guess this person had a little plate put in their wrist. Could that affect hair thinning?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
 Could it affect what?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
 Hair thinning? Thinning of hair?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:26.000
 Oh, conceivably, but the biological vitality of the scalp and the hair follicle corresponds, for example, low thyroid people tend to lose their hair.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 And just increasing your metabolic rate will increase your ability to grow and retain the hair.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:49.000
 And so, if something is causing constant stress, that could slow your metabolism and contribute to hair loss.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:24:01.000
 Interesting. After all these years, have you ever seen any quality information on why the hairs tend to lose their color, gray? Why that is?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:25.000
 Many years ago, when I taught in Bozeman, Colorado, or Montana, the rate of white-haired, prematurely gray-haired people seemed very high in those very cold towns.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:34.000
 And I decided that the stress to the skin was probably a factor.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:55.000
 Radiation, when a person has dental x-rays, the whiskers will sometimes turn white in circular areas on the cheeks, a series of overlapping circles,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 suggesting that the radiation was knocking out the ability to oxidize the pigment.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:14.000
 Copper is both the respiratory catalyst and the pigment-forming catalyst.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:31.000
 So, if you're copper deficient, you're going to tend to have white grain hair as well as lower metabolizing, maybe more inflamed tissue.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:40.000
 What do you think about drinking water out of a pure copper vessel from time to time? Do you think that's valuable?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:49.000
 Yeah, getting enough copper in relation to iron, I think, is a protective factor.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:26:07.000
 So, people who eat too much meat or other iron-rich food are going to compete and displace the copper that is needed for energy production and pigment formation.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:16.000
 And so, meat, like muscle meat or rib eye and T-bones that is fun to eat, that has a lot of iron.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:29.000
 Yeah, as well as, for most people, too much phosphate and too much tryptophan and other excitatory amino acids.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:43.000
 And too much heme, everything that it provides too much of tends to support tensor development and degenerative processes.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:54.000
 Wow. But I thought tryptophan is a sleepy time, you say, but it's excitatory or inflammatory in the meat, tryptophan?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:17.000
 Yeah, the three amino acids that correlate with aging, degeneration and inflammation, loss of thyroid function are methionine, cysteine and tryptophan.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:26.000
 Wow. So, chicken, beef, pork, any difference there?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:36.000
 Yeah, a little bit. The red muscle beats have quite a bit more iron.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000
 So, chicken a little bit easier on the body?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
 For the iron content.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:56.000
 For the iron content, anyway. And then how about fish in general? I think I remember, I've been kind of eating, you said some of the best choices are scallops? You like scallops? Good choice?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
 Probably number one.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
 Number one?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:20.000
 Scallops, crab, calamari, all of the crustaceans and mollusks are pretty good.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
 Shrimp?

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000
 Yeah, shrimp, high copper in relation to iron.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:38.000
 I see. I see that copper, that kind of turquoise color in the lobster and things, that's what you're getting more copper there rather than iron. Interesting.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:48.000
 Do people generally who eat a lot more fish wherever they live have better mortality rates than the heavy meat eaters in general?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:29:03.000
 Yeah, I think part of it is the less iron content and the low fat fish I think are the best.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:14.000
 Low fat fish, so other than, let's see, salmon would be a high fat fish with a lot of threes, right, which you're not fans of, omega-3s, correct?

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:22.000
 Yeah, and the shrimp and scallops are relatively low fat.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
 Cool. One more and then we'll let you go.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:38.000
 I consume too much salt in a day sometimes. The next morning my hands and joints will be stiff with some pain or flexing. Any ideas on how to relieve, purge some of that salt?

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.000
 Wow. Why would salt do that to this person's joints, Dr. Peat?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
 Salt?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:55.000
 Salt. Too much salt, they tend to get little creaky joints and pain in their hands when they eat too much salt.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.000
 I don't know. I don't think I've ever heard that.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:13.000
 Yeah, I've never heard of that one. But now again, so just to know, to repeat, your favorite, if I understand, is the Morton's Pickling and Canning salt, right, with no iodine?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
 Right. It's very pure.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:29.000
 Very pure stuff. Well, we covered a lot of territory here this morning. Thanks for all that information on the whole starch and grains thing because we've been getting a lot of emails since we had this fellow on.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:43.000
 So I think he was kind of on the right track, really. I mean, he was talking about generally, in general, you didn't hear the show probably, but just commercial grains and could be a problem for a lot of people, right, just eating them.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
 Yes, if they aren't prepared properly.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:55.000
 If they aren't prepared properly. Dr. Peat, thank you. How's your newsletter's coming? Do we have a new one soon?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:06.000
 Oh, I'm going to write something about cancer. I return to the subject about every five years or so.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
 Oh, you do?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:22.000
 Some of the things I've been working on for 20 or 30 years are just now starting to really take off as subjects of interest.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:42.000
 Oh, that's great. That's great. Well, we look forward to that, sir. And you can get Ray Peat's newsletter by just emailing Ray Peat's newsletter. Ray Peat, let's see, is it plural pleats and newsletter, right? Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com. Is that right?

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
 Ray Peat.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:56.000
 Yeah, and it's going to be four times a year rather than six times a year. And the subscription per year will be something around $10.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
 Oh, my God.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:16.000
 $10. Because PayPal charges almost 8% fee on $10. We're going to make $10. $10.20.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:36.000
 Well, God love you. So you can get that, folks. That'll be four times a year. Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com. Dr. Peat, as usual, it's just such an honor to have you. We would love talking to you. Did you enjoy the little headset thing? You think we should stay with it or get back to the phone next time?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
 I understood almost everything you said.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:52.000
 Yeah, well, you sound great. I mean, you sound much closer than on the phone. If you don't mind, we could try it again as long as you can hear me. Well, thanks a lot, sir. You take care of yourself. We appreciate it, okay?

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:15.000
 Thank you, sir. Ray Peat. Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com. And so that was great. Yeah, we were able to put this little thing together because, well, we don't have the telephone thing going. Just can't do it.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:33.000
 Well, okay. Well, that was great, huh? Yeah, it was good to get some really clarity on the whole grain thing.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:54.000
 Because I've been thinking about that, you know, since Dr. Davis came on the show. Yeah, people are emailing me, what's the name of that website where you get the nixtamalized corn?

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:10.000
 I'll have to look that up. I don't have it handy. But there is a website. I bought a bunch of it, a big thing of it.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:17.000
 So there, if you want to grain, it's already been nixtamalized. But then you can also do it yourself.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
 We'll have to look into that.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
 Calcium hydroxide.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:34.000
 So we're going to talk to Bridge and see if she'll sprout her einkorn, even take it to another level before she makes bread.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:44.000
 But he did say that the einkorn and these ancient wheats are very, very easier in general for the whole digestion process, which is pretty fun.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:56.000
 OK, kids, we will see you tomorrow. We're going to talk about the Freemasons and these guys and where we got, how they get into our life, how they all started.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
 And then also Paul John Lando, Dr. Lando will be here tomorrow.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000
 So we're going to have a good time, have a lot to talk about. And thanks for your ongoing support.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
 Let us know if we can help with anything. Adam will be here on Wednesday and we'll talk more about the whole starch thing.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:24.000
 And he knows a lot of stuff about it as well. So we're learning more and more how we can eat what we like and still not kill ourselves.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000
 It's great. So I love you all very much. Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:35.000
 We will see you tomorrow at 10 o'clock. Patrick Timpone and may the blessings be.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is one radio network dot com.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.580
 (upbeat music)

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:49.560
 Thanks for watching.
