 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 and from 7.30 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject of vaccination.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911, or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1800 568 3723.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 That's 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Incidentally, we can also be reached toll-free on 1 888 WBM HERB for consultations or further information at the end of the show.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So here we are, 20th of June, almost the solstice, seems to happen fairly regularly that we get our shows on the solstices and equinoxes.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 This month's subject has come around fairly fortuitously in terms of the recent press on the whooping cough outbreak.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 I don't know if we call it an epidemic, but the whooping cough outbreaks that have been occurring in California and in different states across the US in clusters.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 So I wanted to do the show on vaccinations.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 I know there's many different opinions out there about vaccinations, how useful they are, how harmful they could potentially be.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 I know the autism and the MMR vaccination debate is still raging on.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 So this evening, as in all of our shows for the past few years now, we're pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 I think while the studio is getting him on the line, I just want to outline for people who maybe have never heard Dr. Raymond Peat speaking on different health topics,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 of which he'll give his opinion tonight on vaccination from his broad scientific background, that things are not always as they seem.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 So even though diseases have raged through humanity since the beginning of time, there are various different things that have happened to the world that we live in

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 that have certainly made it a harder place to live in, if you like, in terms of the exposure to various toxins, for want of a better word, that we are definitely exposed to now.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Both the estrogens in the environment, the radiation, the cosmic radiation, and the normal radiation, background radiation of our everyday life.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 And the diet and lifestyle that most people are currently engaged in have certainly degraded, I would say, for want of a better word, the energy with which human beings have to fight infection.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 So given that as an organism, we have an innate store of energy with which we come to the world with, and slowly but surely over time, from infancy to adulthood and old age,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 the processes that occur during our lives with food and our subjection and exposure to various things certainly interfere with our bodily systems.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And the immune system is a very complex and finely tuned weapon, if you like, against infection.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Infection has, as I've said, always been present in the world.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 So from the very early times until now, it's nothing new that we coexist with a wide range of organisms, some of which are pathogenic.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 And when we come into contact with them, they certainly cause disease in the body.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 So some diseases are worse than others, obviously, and some that have had wide media attention, things that we'll look at this evening, like polio.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 I'm always struck by that vision.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 I'm 48 now, and so I remember kind of growing up as a 6- or 7-year-old and seeing pictures of polio victims that had happened, you know, 15 years previously or 20 years previously.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 They're still very much in the forefront of the media then, and the children that were wearing braces and calipers because they were paralyzed.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 And there were a few people that were in the media that had suffered polio, and they obviously were, you know, seen on TV and portrayed, and it was certainly talked about.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 So diseases that have severe outcome like polio, I think, certainly struck the population at large as something to try and do something about.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And I think modern science, when it started getting up speed with pharmaceuticals and various different approaches to disease, some of which were not exactly scientific, as we'll see,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 certainly took full steam ahead, and polio vaccination and that, you know, going worldwide to eradicate polio like smallpox became big campaigns of government and industry alike.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 And so pharmaceutical industries that were concerned with producing the vaccines that would be distributed to people worldwide certainly had incentive from government to do such a thing.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 And as we'll also find out, it's strange enough, perhaps if you think about the concept that a government-sanctioned process can be outside of the law,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 I find this quite a strange concept in medicine, the Hippocratic Oath that doctors take.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 The first thing is "First do no harm." So that's the basic tenet of medicine, "First do no harm."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 So as we talk about this this evening with Dr. Peat, let's understand two concepts.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 One is "First do no harm." And the second is the science and the research that should guide our decision in medicine should be very objective, subjective, and open to evaluation.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 And when a product like a vaccine has been indemnified by a government so that it cannot be prosecuted because when people get damaged by vaccines, and it's definitely happened,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 the company that manufactured the vaccine can't be taken to court.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 I find that very, very, very strange that that law would be put into effect to protect vaccine manufacturers because inherently they know that these things are unsafe.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 So the United States legal standard applied to vaccines defines them as "unavoidably unsafe products that are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use."

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 So the reason why vaccines are unsafe, or in other words harmful, is because they're made up of chemicals and other elements that are poisonous to the body.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 And the vaccine industry has naturally, as I said, been indemnified by governments, meaning there can be no liability directed at pharmaceutical industries producing vaccines for vaccination damaged individuals.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 So "First do no harm" and the fact that vaccine companies are actually protected by law, it's a very strange concept that's allowed.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 And as we'll also see, I was looking at an interview with a doctor who was basically looking at polio as a subject of one of the vaccination questions that were arising and saying that polio in itself is 95 to 98 percent,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 one of the better words, asymptomatic. So the fact that 98 percent or up to 98 percent of a population can contract polio, they won't actually have any outlying symptoms of any disease as such.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 It's only the 1 percent that actually can get sequelae of the polio virus and out of those 1 percent, only a few of those people actually get the paralysis that's associated with polio and which has been so widely portrayed on the news.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 So like I said, those two things definitely want to be kept on your minds. And as you listen to Dr. Peat and his explanations, a lot of what he says is very mind opening because it's not something that we're normally exposed to because the media and corporations have definite agenda when things are being produced and sold.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 And so what we definitely get by the TV and the radio to the most part is a fairly one-sided story. So Dr. Peat, often when you hear him speaking, he seems very controversial.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 That's a pretty good word for him, pretty controversial. But a lot of what he said is very scientific. So that's like I said, what should be driving medicine and research.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 And when he comes out with these statements that sometimes might seem outrageous if you've not heard it before, it's actually the product of investigative work and scientific review that doesn't always come to the fore.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 So when we get to getting Dr. Peat to explain his basis for immunity and infection and how as human beings I think we've been exposed to various things that have degraded our ability to fight infection, that it will become a little bit more obvious, especially when you remember the first two things I said.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 First, do no harm and that vaccine corporations are indemnified by the government and they cannot be held liable. So just think on those things and then we'll talk to Dr. Peat and ask him to explain those basic fundamentals of disease and how things have definitely changed in our environment for the worse.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 And now we're suddenly barraged with vaccinations from birth at an alarmingly increasing rate. OK, so I don't know if we have Dr. Peat on the line. Yeah. OK. Hi, Dr. Peat, you there?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Hi. Hi. Thanks for joining us. Sounds a little weak. I'm sorry. You can hear me OK? Oh, yeah, I can hear you fine. Can you hear me? Good. Can you hear me all right? Yeah. Now. Good. OK. All right. Good.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Well, I've basically given people the outline of what we're going to talk about tonight. But as always, I think it's a good idea to give people the opportunity of hear your scientific background, your professional background, and then we'll get into the show.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 OK. Although I concentrated on physiology, reproductive aging and biochemistry during my four years at the University of Oregon, it happened that in the seminar of developmental biology that I took, I think it was in the fall of 1969, the professor was sponsoring an international conference on immunology.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 And so I got to hear the latest big shot research into explaining the clonal selection theory of adaptive immunity.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 And they would give their presentation and then disappear. And in between, younger professors would give their current research. And the most memorable thing about the conference for me was a professor describing his in vitro experiments with white blood cells that had been clonally deleted.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 But when the concentration was proper, they could reconstitute themselves in the original as if each one had knowledge of what the whole organism was.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 And that really was contradictory to all of the mechanistic assumptions of the current clonal selection theory.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 But it happens that it corresponds very closely to what 30 years later is being seen as a feature of the epigenetic expression of genetic information throughout the body.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 In which, for example, skin cells from different parts of the body are different from skin cells in a different part of the body.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Each cell knows where it belongs in terms of the whole organism as if each part is sort of a microcosm.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 And that researcher in 1969 showed evidence that the immune system works that way. That each cell is kind of a microcosm.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And as the clonal selection theory was developing, it really was trying to justify the vaccination practice and theory.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 The practice of vaccination was entirely empirical. People didn't know anything about what was going on.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 They didn't even know there were cells that were practicing vaccination.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 So that was just a trial and error thing. No theory at all.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Early in this century, Paul Ehrlich developed the approach to immunity that led to the clonal selection theory, which is currently pretty much the dominant theory,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 except it has been modified recently, the last four or five years, by recognition that the innate immune system,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 what we share with primitive animals and plants, that the innate immune system really is involved in the adaptive immune system.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 But from Paul Ehrlich's view and mainline immunology, the adaptive system was the only part that was of interest.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 And in 1969, I talked to some of my professors about the innate immunity,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 which in the year that Paul Ehrlich got his Nobel Prize, Ilya Metchnikoff also shared the Nobel Prize.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 But Metchnikoff presented information about the innate immune system,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 and that was really pretty much ignored until just the last four or five years.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 But that's where I think the really interesting stuff happens.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 And in 1969, when I talked to my professors, they were completely uninterested in the innate immune system.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 But I had been reading William F. Koch, who early in the century, almost simultaneously with Ilya Metchnikoff's work,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Koch developed evidence that oxidative cell metabolism is responsible for innate resistance and immunity.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 And it was, in effect, the biochemical explanation for the innate immunity that Ilya Metchnikoff had showed as a developmental process.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Metchnikoff was an embryologist, and he saw immunity as a process of maintaining the integrity of the organism,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 but in a developmental, almost embryological manner.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 And Koch's work at the same time was showing that it was the energy of cells, the oxidative metabolism, that made this innate immunity work.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 And people ignored or disparaged W.F. Koch because an essential part of his theory of oxidative metabolism was based on free radical reactions

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 that would break down allergens and viruses and toxins using free radical chemistry.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 But biologists didn't know that there was such a thing as free radical chemistry until the 1950s.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 So pretty much Albert St. Georgi was the only biologist who took W.F. Koch seriously.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 And he didn't really concentrate on immunity, so it's now just barely coming into scientific awareness that the innate immune system

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 and metabolic processes do have something to do with why some people don't get disease and others do.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Right. I mean, because even currently, I'll jump ahead a little with this before we go back to the kind of progression from antiquity to now with our health,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 but even now there are populations of people that don't come down with a disease when there's a raging epidemic going on.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 I mean, we're talking about unvaccinated people, people that don't have any supposed protection have their own innate defense.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 People writing about the economics of immunity often refer to vaccination as the economically viable method.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 They acknowledge that sanitation and nutrition prevent disease, but they say it's cheaper to vaccinate.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 And the World Health Organization around 1970, I think, did an experiment in Central America in which they gave a medical team with vaccination

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 and all of the regular medicine help to one village, another village they didn't do anything to,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 the third village they didn't provide any vaccination or medical help, but they provided clean water and a nutrition supplement to pregnant women and young children.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 And doing that for several years, they came back and the health was best in the nutrition and clean water village,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 better than the control village. The health in the medicalized and vaccinated village was worse.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 So scientifically, that pretty much says that even though it might not be economically viable to clean up the environment,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 it definitely is better than vaccination as a way to improve the health.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Especially with all the attendant risks. I started at the beginning of the show as you were being brought in,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 that the thing I find staggering about the ethics, if you like, of the industry that produces vaccinations is that they're completely outside of the law

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 so far as litigation for any damage is caused. I find that incredible.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 And there's very little talk about the actual damage. But when you look in the literature, even in medical literature,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 which is heavily biased against saying anything bad about vaccines, you see a tremendous amount of evidence showing that people who are vaccinated

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 have a lot of very serious health problems. Everything from baldness, sterility and ovarian failure, psoriasis, autoimmune skin diseases.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 And those are things that show up pretty visibly and easily diagnosed.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 But long range studies suggest that there will be a similar significant increase among vaccinated people of the really serious degenerative diseases that can

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 contain an autoimmune factor such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 But even the mild problems aren't mentioned when people are talking about the safety of vaccines.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 So how do you think, I guess before we get into the so-called science behind vaccination, the methodology behind it,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 what they seek to obtain and actually how the immune system now as an ever evolving organism is actually considered

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 in the light of current and groundbreaking scientific research. How do you think we as a species, I wonder going back to perhaps Egyptian times,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 we know the Egyptians definitely got things like leprosy, that they got enteric diseases, cardiovascular disease and they got some evidence there

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 that a few cases, they may have found a few cases even of a one or two cancers that they might have found out of hundreds of mummies that were put through

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 CAT scans and various other investigative procedures. They said that they did find, they found no evidence of breast cancer which I found quite interesting

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 amongst any of the females and in terms of a society, I wonder if you have any thoughts about the type of strength of their immunity

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 and how that's changed throughout the middle ages and until now.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Well, current experiments show that simply diet and sanitation, good light exposure and avoidance of pollution and toxins will make a tremendous difference

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 and I assume that in a pre-industrial society, there was a lot less heavy metal exposure. I don't think Egypt was big on iron industry and refining and such.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 I think the seed oils have I think been a major contribution to bad health along with heavy metals and those two things interact, destroying our innate immune system.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 Types of experiments that prevent animals from getting the usual polyunsaturated fats show that they're extremely resistant to all kinds of injury including infections

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 and one of the most interesting things relative to the classical instruction theory of adaptive immunity is that organs, for example kidneys, can be transplanted from an animal that has been deprived of polyunsaturated fats

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 into another animal as if they were genetically related. The androgenicity of the tissues is extremely low simply by avoiding the polyunsaturated fats and you see similar things in liver transplants among humans.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 So you mean the animals, sorry for interrupting, but the animals that were transplanted, the organs that were transplanted from the animal with no PUFA in its diet had a lot less antigenic reaction in the body of the recipient?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Yeah, so even though their genes and proteins are theoretically antigenic, they should be antigenic, but because of being free of the associated free radical breakdown products of the oxidized fats, those proteins aren't recognized as foreign.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 Wow, so when we hear about tissue typing and donor matching and finding that match for that kidney, you're saying that actually in animal experiments they've taken those organs out of animals who have a fairly disparate genetic makeup and the organ is still not rejected?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 True, if you look at the age and gender of liver donors, females have a higher level of circulating polyunsaturated fats in the blood and tissues and those increase with age and the least successful, the most antigenic and likely to fail liver comes from older females.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Older donors and female donors corresponding to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Interesting, I wasn't expecting that. Okay, so what do you think about in terms of the, I'll tell you what, let's put it out in the air what's going on here and I think actually there might even be a caller. So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMED Garville, 91.1 FM.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us this evening and we're going through the subject of vaccination and at some point here we'll get into the bad press about vaccination and some of the people that are claiming damages and the link between autism and MMR and then not to mention all the adjuvants that are put into vaccines to make them supposedly reactive in the body so the body does something about mounting an immune response because the material in the vaccine itself isn't that reactive.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 The vaccine itself isn't antigenic enough but if people would like to call any time from now until 8 o'clock the number like I said is 923 3911 if you're in the area. If you're outside the area the number is 1800 KMUD Rad. So Dr. Peat let's take this first caller and see where we're going.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 You're on the air? Hello? Hi caller you're on the air where you from? Where you calling from? Kansas City. Kansas City, hi.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Yes I had a couple of questions. One of them was about gluten. So you had mentioned that estrogen sensitizes the intestines to gluten. So if someone were staying off of gluten how long should they kind of stay off of it before trying it out again or is it like so many of the so called gluten experts who say that you basically have to stay off of it forever?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Dr. Peat? I think the hormone balance is what makes the difference. If you get your defensive anti-inflammatory hormones including thyroid up and as the anti-inflammatory T3 part of the thyroid increases the TSH which is pro-inflammatory decreases.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 High estrogen goes with low thyroid function and an inflammatory state which resembles autoimmunity. Animals treated with estrogen are very susceptible to autoimmune diseases.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 So I think the gluten reaction is in effect a type of autoimmune reaction in that you have to shift the whole organism so that it's acting properly rather than overreacting to inflammatory signals.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Okay so that means that if you're able to do that that eventually you could actually just eat gluten without a problem in the future then?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 Yeah I think so. I've talked previously about the intestine as a source of serotonin and nitric oxide and histamine which promote inflammation and those things are increased by any stressor but they're intrinsic parts of the immune system and they tend to change with aging as well as stress.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 Very recently there's been research showing that nitric oxide turns off all of the steroids starting with pregnenolone in the white blood cells which should turn off autoimmune reactions.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Since nitric oxide turns off steroid synthesis right at the first step you want to do things that will minimize your exposure to serotonin, histamine and nitric oxide and increase things that will promote the anti-inflammatory, anti-autoimmune processes.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Okay that's great thank you. I just have one other question. If you could maybe give a couple of practical things someone could do who's suffering from age-related macular degeneration.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 Sometimes aspirin helps by keeping down the prostaglandins and polyunsaturated reactive oxygen species. So vitamin E, thyroid, aspirin, pregnenolone and progesterone are all protective.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 So basically just everything that works in the way of restoring energy production then we could basically say that you should be able to regenerate the cells in the eye I guess. Is that right?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Yeah I think so. The cells are tending to regenerate constantly in the brain, retina, pancreas and so on. Even in sick people there are new stem cells being born.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 The problem is to keep them from dying because of the stressful situation in the tissue. Caffeine is another generally protective thing that blocks the toxic effects of nitric oxide and other things that kill cells and deprives them of energy.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Okay thank you for that. That was great.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Okay thank you for your call. We have another caller on the line so we'll take this next caller. Where are you from caller? Hi you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 You were on the air. Engineer, did we have the caller or is he gone?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 She must have hung up.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 Hello?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Oh hi you're on the air.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 I'm on the air yes. You asked me where I was from?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 Yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 I'm from here in Humbrol near Phillipsville.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Okay Phillipsville. Go ahead.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 What I wanted to ask is in relation to the vaccination thing. What I don't hear you addressing is that so many of the diseases that children get vaccinated for traditionally have been pretty much wiped out and they were very deadly diseases.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 A lot of children died of whooping cough, tetanus was a death sentence, usually diphtheria was. My father almost died of diphtheria as a child and he was one of the few that made it.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 His first cousin died of polio because it affected her breathing.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 I have another friend who went through her whole life with one leg shorter than the other because she'd had polio and that was quite distressful for her.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 But so many, you know, smallpox, so many deadly diseases you don't hear about anymore because children were massively vaccinated.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 So what about the, I mean whatever harm vaccinations might cause are not anywhere nearly as harmful as the diseases that they've wiped out.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Well I think that can be contested and I think that was the point of this evening's show was to bring out some of the scientific evidence behind that contest.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 So perhaps...

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 But didn't people die a lot from those diseases?

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Well people die a lot from the kind of diseases that are ravaging the world right now like the cancers, the massive increase in cancers. People are tragically mentally dying from dementia and Alzheimer's right in front of their families.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Autism is becoming pretty rife amongst children and goodness knows what it's predisposing them to be like in the years to come.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 So I think whilst you're very true and correct that these diseases have certainly brought around deadly consequences for some of the victims in the world.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 A lot of them.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 Yeah, the purpose of tonight's...

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 And mostly children.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Yeah, the purpose of tonight's show was to bring out where we've come from and where we're at now and why it is that there is this supposed need for this massive vaccination.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 Well do you think that we should vaccinate children against these deadly diseases so they don't get whooping cough and tetanus and diphtheria?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Well the point of tonight's show was to bring out the reasons for and against it and that's I guess where we're going to go with the show.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 So perhaps if you wait a little while and we get further through the questions that I have for Dr. Peat.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Like I said at the very beginning of the show, his philosophy and approach to this is very different and does seem very shocking at first.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 Well I just want to know, you know, what would you do without vaccinations, you know, what would you do about all these deadly diseases that we've...

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 As he's already said, you know...

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 I know we haven't been able to conquer cancer. We've come a long way. It's not the death sentence that it used to be for a lot of people.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 Yeah, I think what Dr. Peat has said that hit the nail on the head really is that good hygiene, sanitation and nutrition has done more than vaccination has done for reducing disease.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 And it's the health of the organism that's really the important factor.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 So whilst we're not saying carte blanche that vaccinations are deadly and shouldn't be used, what we're trying to get over and hopefully we'll, as the show goes on, otherwise we'll carry on next month,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 is that the nutrition state of people in the terms of how they live, the drugs that they maybe have, that they're on, medications, the kind of quality of food that's in the food supply these days,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 the water they're drinking, the air they're breathing, the sunlight they're not getting, all of these things are degrading.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 Well technically it's obvious that a stronger immune system is going to ward off, you know, is going to help you ward off all diseases.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 Exactly.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 The stronger your immune system...

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 And so if we get that opportunity later on here, we're going to discuss the immune system and how experiments have conclusively proved that in groups of animals that have been treated and tested,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 they're significantly better in their outcomes when faced with the same infection that other animals die from.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Sure.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 So I think it's basically not a one way or the other.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 What we want to do is just open people's minds to things that they may not have thought about.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 I think that's the whole point of our shows.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 They're pretty groundbreaking in terms of getting people to think differently about a subject that's so long and so often we get brainwashed with only one way and actually we don't hear the full truth and so that's the whole point.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Well I'm all for boosting the immune system and, you know, better eating and, you know, better understanding of all the things that go into that.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 So I'll get off the phone and...

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 All right.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 ...thank you.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 Thanks for your call.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
 OK, we do have one more caller so let's see where this caller is going to go.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 And where are you from, caller?

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Is that me?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Yes, where are you from?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 I'm here from Phillipsville.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 You're from Phillipsville as well, are you? OK.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 Yes.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 So, um, there's... I'm a homeopath.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 OK.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 And there's a wonderful book by Richard Moskowitz called Plain Doctrine that has a few hundred pages on very medical vaccination by vaccination assessment of each vaccination.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 And for one thing, whooping cough is a terribly ineffective one, which is partially why everybody is getting it these days because they've been vaccinated and vaccinated and all they do is, say, have some more vaccine.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 And it doesn't work very well.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Measles works very well.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 And some of them, like whooping cough, have some terrible consequences.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 And it seems to me it should be in a case-by-case basis.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 I mean, I would be interested in a tetanus shot, but I don't want a pertussis.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 I've already had whooping cough, and I certainly don't want a diphtheria.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 There's 22 cases in, I don't know, the last 10 years in the U.S., so why are they doing that?

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 Money. That's why.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Money.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
 Money.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 You know, a hippy and a newborn baby, that's crazy.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 Anyway, it's a wonderful book, but, you know, I go both ways.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 My great-grandfather died of, uh, what is it, Viruela?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 Pox. What is the pox?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Smallpox.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Smallpox.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Say again?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 His children had the vaccine, and it was horrible, and their legs got all red and sort of pussy,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 and he was repelled, and he was a guy, he was a macho in Cuba, and he didn't want to get vaccinated.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 So when he came in contact with it, he got it and went off and died by himself.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 So there should be a little sanity, but there isn't any sanity at all.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 So it's a wonderful book. It's called "Plain Doctrine" by Richard Moskowitz, and it does it very scientifically, not hysterically at all.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Good.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 But, you know, my great-granddaughter has had 40,000, and the granddaughter believes in herd immunity,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 and I'm horrified. With so much cancer in the family? Terrible.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 Okay, well, thanks for the show.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 You're welcome.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 Bye-bye.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 I think, unless we get more callers coming in, let's get into the adjuvant side of vaccinations

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 and how these are definitely proven to be very toxic and unsafe.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 Okay. One of the newer adjuvants of interest is Phytol, which is a plant oiling material,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 and heavy metals have been used as adjuvants for a long time, and they are pathogens in themselves when they're in the diet and environment.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 But since even the conventional immunologists realize that simple foreignness of a protein isn't enough to make it reactive,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 isn't enough to make it function as an antigen, even though it's completely foreign,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 so they need to make the body treat it as something dangerous, and that's what activates the immune system

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 and effectively keeps the viruses or bacteria from multiplying.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 But following the trend that L.A. Metchnikoff sketched out at the beginning of the century,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 a few people 25 and 30 years ago brought that innate immunity back theoretically to look at the evidence of vaccination

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 and how an adjuvant makes the immune system react.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 And it's now recognized as the danger or damage theory of immunity,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 where it used to be the otherness, the foreignness of an antigen that was recognized.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 It's increasingly seen that it's injury that triggers the immune system, and so it's not at all just the foreignness.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 And the originators of this danger or damage theory of immunity are Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Matsinger.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 And they showed that the implications of thinking of the immune system as a developmental process

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 rather than as an immune process seeking out foreign organisms as the pathogen,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 that anything pathogenic, which could be radiation, heavy metals, toxic fats, and so on,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 these are the real agents of damage, and that's why they have to be used with the bacterium or virus.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 The thing I remember was the Thiomersal that was, I think they say now that it's been banned since 2002,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 but I don't know how true that is.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 And that obviously was causing a lot of damage in people that were receiving it.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 And I think this is when a lot of the attention came out for vaccinations

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 and the products that were used as adjuvants in vaccines were then starting to be questioned.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Some people think that they're talking about the amount of mercury as a toxin,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 but it's really the way that the tiny amount of toxin or mercury or adjuvant is presented that causes the problem.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 It isn't mercury itself.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 For example, kids whose mother ate lots of seafood turn out to have above average IQs along with a high body load of mercury.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 So in a healthy body, even mercury isn't necessarily toxic,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 but presented in the wrong way, activating these adaptive defensive reactions,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 it's that that can lead to things like autoimmunity that really cause the damage.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 So when they substitute phytol for aluminum or mercury, for example,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 I think the effects are going to be just as bad, if not worse.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 So it's all about the potentiation of it.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 Yeah, yes, potentiating the disturbing properties.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 Okay, so I think there's a caller coming in.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 So is there a caller?

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 Yes, we had a dear listener who wanted to know if I could ask for Dr. Peat to comment on the effects of breastfeeding

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 on the immune health of the child as well as its relationship to vaccines, breastfeeding in relation to vaccines.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 Besides being good nutrition and extremely low in iron, incidentally,

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 iron is one of the factors in the environment that accumulates and progressively leads to oxidative injury of all of the tissues.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 So milk provides extremely good nutrition, including a relative absence of the harmful iron.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 It also provides various immune protective materials, antibodies and things such as transferrin or lactoferrin

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 that help to manipulate the body load of iron.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 Besides being deficient in iron as a food, the lactoferrin helps the body keep its iron in the right place,

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 prevents stress from letting the iron react with polyunsaturated fats and so on.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 So breastfeeding provides undamaged proteins that are really part of the baby's immune system.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:40.000
 And even RNA from the mother's body, I think even DNA has been demonstrated to pass from the mother's milk into the baby's genetic makeup.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 So if you are brought up on cow's milk or goat's milk, you get many of the immunological protective factors,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 but you're probably also incorporating some of the goat or cow's genetic material.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 And I don't want to speculate on what the caller exactly was wondering about,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 but I think they were curious if the antibodies that are released in the breast milk,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 are they ever an alternative or a viable option to any specific vaccines that are out there already

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 that people get vaccines for their child but they don't have to because the breast milk provides the proper antibodies?

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 Yeah, the mother's immunity does show up in the baby if the baby is breastfed for a couple of years.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 Part of that transfer is by microvesicles, they're called, little particles about maybe less than a thousandth the size of a cell,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 but they contain proteins and RNA, possibly some DNA.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 And these microvesicles can pass through the intestine wall and circulate as sort of immune cells,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 even though they're extremely small, they can be taken up specifically by cells that they're appropriate for.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 So they're kind of like miniature stem cell repair kits that the milk is providing.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 And would a longer duration of breastfeeding, say beyond two years, lead to more active immunities?

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:42.000
 Yeah, they probably should supplement some iron because usually a baby is born with an overload of iron.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:50.000
 The heavier the overload, I think the higher the risk of disease is in the newborn baby.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 But by the time a baby is about two years old, it has grown into that excess of iron.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 And around that time, it might be needing some food containing iron, such as eggs.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 But the protective immunity is still being passed along up to three or four years.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 Okay, so I don't know that we're going to have, we certainly have some more time to go before the end of the show,

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 but maybe we'll carry on this next month because I'd really like to ask you, Dr. Peat,

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 about your current understanding of the immune system and how they tell us vaccines are supposed to be working

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 and the perceived risk and the odds of a lifelong, perhaps lifelong struggle with any number of conditions

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 that may have been stimulated by the vaccine that we probably are going to find out in maybe another 30 or 40 years,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 a little bit like the polyunsaturated fat cover-up, perhaps, that's just come into light now with doctors saying

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 that saturated fats are actually better and more protective.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 But I don't know that we'll have in six minutes any chance to cover that.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 But perhaps if we just put it out in the air that the number, if you want to make a quick call, is 923-3911.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 Or if you're outside the area, the 800 number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 Okay. I think part of the picture that people should keep in mind is that in just the last 20 years,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 the image of the organism has become more like a continuing stream of developmental changes,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
 like we're the last stage of embryonic development.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 We're still just a big, slowly developing embryo, really, with all of our parts being in play,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 interacting with the environment.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 And what happens during gestation and in the first two or three years of life,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 when there are fewer cells involved, each of those cells has a longer history of descendants.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 And the more you disturb the organism early in life, the greater the distortion is going to be in adulthood.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 But we're still in process, even after middle age, stem cells are still being educated and responding,

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 trying to optimize conditions.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 And so it's never too late to correct damage that was done at an early stage.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 But when possible, the early environment should be optimized by avoiding stresses as far as they can be avoided.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 Do you think there's any point at which an organism might be fully protected, if you like,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 in terms of the insults given to it by vaccines or any other outside influences?

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 Do you think there's a point beyond which the capacity will have reached a maximal point or not?

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 There are two types of experiments in mice and rats that I think say a lot about human conditions.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Germ-free animals, even though they're susceptible to infection because they've never been exposed to infections,

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 they happen to be very tough and adaptive, resistant to other kinds of stress.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 In middle age, their mortality rate is much lower than germ-infested animals.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 And for example, they're very resistant to obesity.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 They can be fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet, and they just don't get fat,

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 even though they come from a strain of obese animals.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 The absence of germs and inflammation makes them resistant to such things as obesity and diabetes.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 And the other line of experimentation is giving them a diet completely lacking in the so-called essential fatty acids.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 Those animals are extremely resistant not only to trauma and chemical poisoning, biological toxins and so on.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 They have an extremely strong immune system.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 They are hard to infect, takes a huge dose of injected cancer cells or bacteria, for example,

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 to produce a viable infection.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 I'll have to hold you there, Dr. Peat, because I want to make sure people get the information about how to reach you on the web

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 and read some of the articles behind what they've heard this evening.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 So thanks so much for joining us.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 Okay, so yeah, we didn't really get a chance perhaps to get into the crux of vaccines and the for and against

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 and put it out there as a kind of take the advice and ask yourself the questions with the new information.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 But perhaps we'll get the chance to carry this on next month.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 Anyway, for those people who've heard the show and want to know more about Dr. Raymond Peat

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 and his definite wisdom and his learned experience, www.raypeat.com.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:01.000
 His website is full of articles that are fully referenced, almost a scientific-based literature in his arguments

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 for and against a wide range of things.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 So well worth looking at his website.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
 He doesn't sell anything, but he has a lot of good information to give away for free.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 Anyway, yeah, for those people who've listened to the show and for those who've called in,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 thank you for your time and calling in.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 We can be reached 1-888-WBM-ERB Monday through Friday.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 And tomorrow is the solstice, so longest day of the year.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 Things start getting a little dimmer as we work through to fall.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 But hey, I saw the rivers on the way in.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 It looks like the end of August.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 Anyway, so all the best and see you on the third Friday of next month.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 All right, thank you, Doc.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000
 And thank everyone for their calls.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 The Herb Doctor got quite a few calls of support during that show,

00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.000
 and I think a lot of the listeners are on board with another episode about vaccines.
