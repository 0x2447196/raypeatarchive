00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Well, very pleasant. Good morning to you. This is Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Just trying to get our act together here after a couple weeks off and still working out a few bugs.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 We had a piece of equipment that went down and then by the time we got it back in and set it all back up,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 we lost a lot. It's kind of like rebooting your life and you got to repeat, put it all back together again with our microphone.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Had a problem with the microphone yesterday with Paul Alondo and the quality, so we apologize for that.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 But, you know, it's life. What are you going to do?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Well, we were not able to have Dr. Ray Peat on this Monday because of technical issues

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 and Mercury was still doing its retrograde thing, but he is here today and we're excited about it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 We have a lot to talk about and he's a PhD that's been working in this field for a very long time,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 back in the 60s and taught at schools and really worked with hormones from the very beginning.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 He knows a lot about thyroid stuff and we're always available to take your questions by email.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 And we'll go right to the telephone and say hi to Dr. Peat.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Good morning, sir. Good morning.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Good morning.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Nice to talk to you. Boy, I tell you what, man.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 I need some more orange juice. During a commercial, I'm going to go get some here.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Okay.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 So, I'd like to start with this and this is a personal thing, but I think people will really get some information from this because of evolving the Omega-3s.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 So, Beck, you've taught us that this Omega-3 thing, too many of these are not good, right? Omega-3s?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Yeah. In some ways, the more double bonds you have in a molecule, the longer chain and maybe five or six double bonds, the more antithyroid it is and the more pro-estrogen and that combination is especially bad for metabolism.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 So, Omega-3s are double bonded and it's anti-estrogen, so that would be...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Pro-estrogen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Pro-estrogen, right, which we don't want, right?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 So, I noticed that if I was doing a lot of salmon when I first started hearing about this and every now and then I would get these little red blotches, you know, on my forearm.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Yeah, how big in diameter are they?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Oh, I'm talking, I don't know, let's see, maybe a quarter of an inch and then it's maybe an inch or inch wide, one of those marks.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Yeah, those are actually little hemorrhages and it's weakness of capillaries and a combination of high cortisol and high estrogen is typically involved in that.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 Oh, so it's not an Omega-3 thing?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Well, to the extent that that goes with higher estrogen and estrogen activates your adrenal glands to make cortisol and the combination makes weak, leaky capillaries.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 So, that's what that is if you got a little blotch. So, I was doing really great and I hadn't seen them for a couple months and then I got off the, what do you call it, the salmon and just was doing other kind of fishes.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 And then I ate a handful of walnuts one morning and I know they're very high in Omega-3s and then I got this little blotch.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 So, I was kind of attributing that to the walnuts and they're very high in Omega-3s but could that be it?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Yeah, except walnuts also have other very powerful allergens and the allergens will trigger cortisol too. It's hard to tell with a complex food like walnut.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 I see. So, the high cortisol is what could make your little capillaries weak there, right? High cortisol?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Yeah, and that tends to increase with aging.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 Aging. Well, I don't believe in aging so we don't do that. So, what could I be doing? But cortisol, isn't that just a reaction to the world around us as well?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Yeah, not having enough energy to meet the demands of the world.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 A lot of that going on, right, Doc?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Yeah, I've been experimenting the last few months with reducing my protein intake and increasing carbohydrate.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Interesting.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 I think most people are overeating on protein. It's essentially you get enough but depends on the rate of metabolism and affluent countries. I think most people get much more than enough protein.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 Yeah.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Have you heard of the messianin effect on aging?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 No, I don't know that one.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 Animal studies where you restrict messianin right down to the bare minimum which might be only half or a third as much as people normally eat. Their life span is extended by 40% even without limiting calorie intake.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 So, the low calorie diet, the reason that can extend life span is mostly two things, lower messianin intake and lower PUFA intake.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 So, in general, do you think it's possible that over the years we've just got to start eating too many little steaks or whatever, just protein in general?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 I think so.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 What about, so how are you feeling like when you've been doing that? You can feel like you do better with that?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Yeah, actually. Better appetite in general and a livelier feeling.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 So, that would be substituting a little more rice or potatoes or something rather than a steak?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Yeah, oatmeal for breakfast.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Oh, oatmeal for breakfast. That sounds fun. That's pretty strengthening, right? Oatmeal, feeling your oats and all that thing?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Yeah, and as long as you get enough milk in your diet, the mineral binding quality of oatmeal has scared a lot of people away from it, but all you need to do is make sure you're getting enough milk.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 It's so great. I mean, there's so many people out there in the natural world that just poo-poo the dairy. I mean, the milk, oh my goodness. Do you think milk was poison the way they talk about it?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Yeah, it's largely the calcium content, but there are innumerable anti-stress factors in milk besides the calcium.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 We have a great source of kind of well-fed goat milk here at the farmer's market. I'm going to pick up a gallon and I do good with it. I mean, I just warm it up a little and phew, man, I do good with it. I don't know what it is.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Yeah, very digestible. A lot of people feel something unpleasant when they have a glass or two of ice cold milk, but if you just bring it up towards body temperature, it's the drop of body temperature that a lot of cold drink can actually stop your heart just by a reflex action.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Like when we were kids, remember you were going into the refrigerator and take a big hit of cold milk, remember that? Boy, shoot. Or cold milk and cereal and sugar. You know, it's so funny. Go ahead.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 In hot weather, it could be very nice, but I knew of one old guy that was in good health, sat down to eat a bowl of ice cream and after just a few bites, dropped dead his heart stopped.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 No kidding. Why doesn't the heart like real cold stuff?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Partly it's a stress reaction, but the stomach has nervous connections to the heart that send out signals of inflammation and cause vascular constriction and rhythm changes.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 I see. If I wake up in the middle of the night, sometimes I want to read for a while and have a little glass of goat milk and I'll just warm it to like maybe 105 or 110 and boy, a little sugar in there, boy, that'll put you back 99 really quick.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Right.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 How is it possible that sugar, you know, that we've been told forever will make the kids hyperactive and can actually settle one down? That just seems counterintuitive, you know?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 It lowers adrenaline and cortisol. It increases your metabolic rate, but a higher metabolic rate allows your nerves and muscles to relax, takes energy to relax, and that's what warm sugar and milk are good at.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Isn't that funny? So the higher metabolic, so that's tied into the thyroid, right? Which is what the thyroid does, it keeps the metabolism happy?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Yeah. The calcium and sugar combined activate the oxidative metabolism and turn off the various stress kinds of metabolism.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 It's amazing, isn't it, that sugar could actually settle you down? I mean, whoa.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Yeah, hospitals pretty commonly use a little bit of sugar when they want to do something like a skin trick, a blood test or something on a baby so they don't notice the pain.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Really? They know that?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Uh-huh.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Interesting. When folks go to the hospital, what do they normally just kind of, the first thing they do is they put them up to a little drip. I don't want to get off on this subject too much, but what are they putting in there?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 You know what I mean, a bag when they hook people up right away?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Oh, yeah, glucose, isotonic glucose solution is a very common…

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Sugar?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Yeah.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Hmm.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 But they don't use it enough and they tend to keep it down in concentration like 5% sugar is the standard concentration, but if you use about three or four times that much, the concentration, whether it's salt or sugar, the concentration itself,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 helps to restore your own energy production because when you're starved of energy, your cells take up too much water and if you put in a slightly hyperosmotic solution in your blood, whether it's glucose or salt, that draws the excess water out of your cells and helps with resuscitation.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 That's very, very cool. Dr. Ray Peat is here. We have lots of emails, but if you want to jump in, we'll see how many we can get to.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. Before we go to the emails, I just want to bring up the carbon dioxide. I've been doing a little research and you can get a… I think you mentioned like a 10-kilo tank, right? 10-kilo tank and you can get an aluminum one so it's not so heavy, not too expensive, and then get it filled up.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 And then there's a place that somebody sent me a link, Dr. Peat, where I think it was used for ozone where you can just put yourself in a bag, right? All the way up to your neck.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 Yeah, I don't have the location for getting them. Occasionally, people tell me that they got some full-length, very tough plastic bags that are just perfect.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Yeah, and then when you get the tank, does it come with a little doohickey on there that you can just open it up and it'll just go right into a bag? It'll do that?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Yeah, the tank usually comes just with like an outdoor water faucet handle and you turn that and it blasts out. A lot of people want to sell a 100 or 150 dollar regulator, but if you're just filling a bag, speed is fine. You can blow up a big bag in 5 or 10 seconds because it comes out so fast.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Oh, I see. So you're going to be filling the bag up first and then jumping into it?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Yeah, you keep the neck of the bag high because it's heavier than atmosphere and it doesn't fall out if you keep the opening upward. And then you can climb into it carefully.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Tell folks who are just new to this idea of carbon dioxide what kind of benefits one might have when they hang out in a bag for an hour or so.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 A book published in 1905 describes sitting in a tub of CO2 for an hour like spending a day at the beach, refreshing and restorative.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 And if you just put it on one arm, for example, a small bag of pure CO2, in about 15 or 30 minutes you can see that arm is pinker than the other one.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 And it will usually stay noticeably pink for a few hours after that because the CO2 saturates the cells and fat and connective tissues, everything.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 It just becomes slightly more acidic but the amount is enough to keep the blood circulating more freely.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 And it binds to hemoglobin, releasing the oxygen in the tissue and that also opens up the blood vessels.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 So it's a real nice circulation thing, the CO2, right?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Yeah. When you look at what's happening in the heart, the heart will pump more with every beat because the blood vessels in the extremities are relaxed.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 And so the blood flows very easily and so the heart can pump a lot with each stroke.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Say that again now? I kind of lost you there.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Well, normally the small arteries out in your extremities are offering resistance and that keeps your blood pressure up.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 But when they're relaxed, your blood pressure comes down and so your heart pumps more blood faster through those open arteries.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Just because they're relaxed?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Yeah.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 They're relaxed. Yeah. Speaking of the heart, is this true? Many people argue, not a lot, but some people argue like Cowan and others,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 that even when the big arteries kind of get gooped up with something, calcium or whatever, that the body puts out these kind of ancillary pathways to keep the Mr. Heart happy.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 You think that's true?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Yeah. And the acid nature of the CO2 molecule helps to keep the soft tissues from crystallizing calcium, brings them back into the solution.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 But in the bone, the carbon dioxide plus dissolved calcium actually increases the crystallization into the bone.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 And people who've lived in a submarine with well above normal CO2 for months at a time, they find that their bones are getting denser and denser with time.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 Up to a year or more, the bones keep adding calcium and carbon dioxide.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 So it's actually putting the calcium where it wants to be rather than in the arteries.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 Yeah. And the opposite of that, when you block the formation of CO2, you get the formation of lactic acid instead.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 And in your bone, those have exactly opposite effects.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 The parathyroid hormone makes local lactic acid in the bone that dissolves your bones. And CO2 has just exactly the opposite effect.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 And a drug called acetazolamide that raises the carbon dioxide in your body, it has a side effect of increasing bone density.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 So could that be tied in at all to remember when these people were running 25 miles and a couple of them fell over for the hard stuff?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Maybe they were over-breathing possibly and getting rid of it?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 Oh, yeah. And a surprising proportion of the population is over-breathing even at rest to the extent that your hypothyroid, instead of making carbon dioxide, you will make an excess of lactic acid.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 And that's a sign of over-breathing. So when too much exercise raises your CO2, it means you should have been exercising more slowly.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 So that's the tie-in where Cowan talks about with the lactic acid in this stroph... how do you say that thing? Wobanine or whatever that is, right?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And it's supposed to get rid of the wobanine and Cowan argues that he talks about this wobanine or strophemphibus that gets rid of the lactic acid for the heart.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Well, your liver is what brings it down to normal after over-exercising or being hypothyroid.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 If you're at rest, the liver will take lactic acid out of the blood and combine it to make glucose again. But that takes extra energy.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 So you need some good thyroid function for your liver to have the energy to turn lactic acid back into glucose.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 And so a low thyroid person very easily gets into a low CO2 high lactic acid condition even without noticeably breathing hard or exercising.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Those are the people who, if they take an airplane up to Mexico City, for example, don't have time to adapt.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 They get various kinds of altitude sickness, headache, swelling of the lungs and brain.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 And in extreme situations, they can treat it with breathing a little bit of concentrated CO2.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Fascinating. Dr. Ray Peters with us, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 I got a little thyroid story. I don't want to talk about me all the show, but I was doing a little bit of the piggy thyroid that I got somewhere in Thailand.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 And I started doing that and got my TSH from, I don't know, it was like three or four to .5, like you said was the best.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 And I didn't feel a whole lot different, but the little .5 thing made me feel good.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 So I guess about, I don't know, two months ago or so, I dropped the whole thing on the floor.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 And these little pretty thyroids were all over the floor, right?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 And I figured the only way I could get them up would be a dustpan and then they'd be all dirty.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 So I just gave it up. And I said, well, let me see.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And you know what, Dr. Peat, to this day, it's only been two months, but my temperature is just like, boom, you know, 98.2 or three or four first thing in the morning.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 I feel fine. So maybe those little piggies just kicked up my thyroid and I'm good. I don't know.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Yeah, over the years, I've known several people who did that.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Once you get it up, it's the same with progesterone.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Both thyroid and progesterone support each other.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 And so if everything else is good about your way you live, what you eat, just a few doses of progesterone or thyroid can remedy the situation and you don't need the supplement.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Interesting. Yeah, I take a little bit of that, the one that you recommend, the Progest-E, you know, three or four times a week, you know, I'll take a little dab of it.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 So I'm getting a little progesterone. So the body just kind of figured it out.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 So there could there be a lot of people on thyroid not knowing that they could maybe stop taking a bit if they played with it?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Yeah, you don't want to stop taking it if your temperature falls and you start feeling bad again.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 Right, right. I mean, exactly.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 How long would it take for the temperature to fall if you're going to want to wean off of it, Dr. Peat, to know if you're on the wrong track here and it's not time to get up?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 The active hormone has a very short stay in the body, about 12 hours for T3, but the T4, the thyroxine, has about a two-week residency in the body.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 So after two weeks, you still have half of the amount of thyroxine that had been there previously.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 So you'd be able to tell fairly soon if it's not time to do that.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Yeah, about a week, you feel yourself cooling off.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 But even if folks that stay on it, it's not a bad thing, is it? I mean, it's not going to hurt you, right?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 If you completely suppress your thyroid function, I did that once using a Cytomel T3, and I looked in the mirror one morning, and I had two grooves about the size of my index finger, one on each side of my voice box.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Really?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 And I realized my thyroid had shrunken down to almost nothing.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 And so I stopped taking the T3, and in 24 hours, my neck was level and smooth again.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Wow.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 The gland is extremely flexible and quick to recover.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Yeah.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Wow, interesting.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 Okay, let's do a little break, and then we're going to come back, and then we'll dig into these emails.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 We have lots of them.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 We're getting back on track here after a long time of, you know, a couple weeks.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Phew, man.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 It seemed like forever.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 I have to retrain myself, but the equipment thing is kind of balancing out and feeling a little more comfortable here after a few days of whoop-dee-loops.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 So thanks for your ongoing support.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 We had a lot of emails during the time saying, "What's wrong?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Where are you?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 Are you okay?"

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 And so we appreciate that.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 If you have heard us talk about the hydrogen machine that we promote, I think it's a—you know, I can't really speak highly.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 It's just—I really enjoy it.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 I do it a lot, you know, and I'm feeling good and looking good, and everything's happy.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Except a little red blotch on my forearm.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 That's the worst thing I've got going on, man.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 I'm in good shape.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 But anyway, so—but check it out.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 There's so much information on molecular hydrogen.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 If you'd like to learn more about it, just go on our website, oneradionetwork.com, and you can just Google—or not Google, but on our search function, put in there "George Wiseman."

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 And, you know, watch some of his videos on BitChute, or just listen to them, and George will really fill you in on why you might want to experiment with this.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 And it's a lifetime warranty, and a one-year, no questions asked, money-back warranty.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 So, hey, I mean, what's not to like about that?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 If you don't like it after 10 months, my goodness, just send it back, and he'll give you your money back.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 And it's a browns gas, so it has this expanded water he calls EXW.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 Gerald Pollack talks about.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 So we drink the water.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 I've been doing a couple quarts a day of the hydrogen water.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 And, you know, I didn't do it for a long time because I felt, well, I'm breathing the gas.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 But I—after talking to George last time, I got into—started to breathe—drink the water, and I can really feel a little difference there.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 So I think it's valuable to do it.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 It takes 10 minutes to juice up the water, and then you rock and roll, and then breathe the gas as much as you can, the browns gas.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 And there's a 20% off now.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 George and I worked out a deal.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 We wanted to get more people.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Not like George needs a business.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 I mean, he's about a month behind in just getting these things out.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 So when you order one, he can't get it out right away.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 But, you know, I don't think the backlog is going to, you know, heal up anytime soon because a lot of people, they talk about it, and they tell their friends.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 And man, try it.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 So I think you'll enjoy it.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 You know, it's no risk thing.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 So try it.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 20% off, 20% off on—use promo code 1RADIO and a lifetime warranty on the hydrogen machine.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Go to molecularhydrogeninstitute.org, and you'll see all kinds of peer-reviewed studies.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 I don't know if that even means anything these days, but check it out.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 And they're doing a lot of work with molecular hydrogen, not even browns gas, but molecular hydrogen, which is not quite as powerful in China and all kinds of Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 A lot of work being done with the folks, helping folks to recover from strokes.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 So there's a powerful technology that is at your disposal.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Go to our website.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Try it if you'd like.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Promo code 1RADIO, 20% off, 1RADIO—I can say it—1radionetwork.com.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Previously with Dr. Ross Stewart, who just kind of came up with this, telling about how he works with people and their neurotransmitters.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 How do we produce sufficient amounts of glutathione in the liver, which of course is a big filter for all the blood, pulling half-spent hormones, waste, dead cells, and other toxins out of the blood?

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 The higher the level of glutathione, the longer a person's going to live and the better their blood is.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 And I'm glad you're doing a sulfur product.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Once you start getting any of these kinds of symptoms, all the way from autism, all the way through Parkinson's, you can't get enough sulfur from eating broccoli and kale and cauliflower and garlic and onions.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 You can't get enough.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 You need to supplement it.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 Well, the information just keeps on coming with sulfur.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 The sulfur that we promote is 99.97% pure.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 No additives.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 No excipients.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 Just click and order on the front page of OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 And if you'd like to get more than four pounds, a lot of people do, just email me, Patrick, at OneRadioNetwork.com and we'll hook you up for that.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 I did, you know, it was really interesting.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 I've been experimenting with it.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 I do about a tablespoon twice a day.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 And last night, I did about, oh, two teaspoons just in my mouth and then I flushed it down with some water right before bed because I had some pretty wild dreams.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 Now, I don't, you know, I know I believe that dreams are a spiritual experience and they're not mental.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 You know, they definitely are.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 We as soul, we go into another reality.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 But I know it helps the recall.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 So people say, "Well, I've had these wild dreams."

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 But again, I just think that we have these dream experiences all the time.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 And for some reason, somehow, the sulfur helps, you know, helps you remember them.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 I don't know how that works, but it does.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And so I was really having a good time last night.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 I was all over the place.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 So check it out, the sulfur.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 It's really, really a good product.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 We have this on sale and then we'll be right back with Dr. Peat and we'll dig in to your phone calls.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 This is a colostrum that's on sale right now.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Here's a little primer on colostrum.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Colostrum is this amazing food.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 And of course, we have it in a powdered form, so it comes kind of like a dried milk, although technically colostrum is not really a dairy product.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 It is the sort of first food for mammals.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 It's made where dairy products are made in the body or it comes from that same place, but not really a milk, even though it comes from udders.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 And of course, all mammals produce colostrum and they produce that colostrum to feed their young mammals.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Really love the idea that if we're going to have cows and we're going to milk them, that that colostrum becomes the most medicinal part of that whole system.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 So colostrum in human bodies does a lot of different things, but its primary stuff is it keeps the immune system in shape.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 So when we're using colostrum, it keeps our immune system kind of like going to the gym almost, like keeps it fit so that we can fight off infections.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 One of the things it does really helps us do really well.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 That's a natural, normal thing for us, but we're living in a world that really breaks our immune system down.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 So we need immuno allies.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 Probably nothing in the world supports our ability to stay antiviral the way colostrum does.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 That's a lovely product.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 We've been taking it for years.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Not that that means anything to you, but we have and love it.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 You can click and order colostrum and you can order the one or two kilo containers.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Get on the auto ship for the best price.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 It was yum.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Cacao in there a little bit.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Just a little bit of stevia.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And strawberry.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 From the hill country in Texas.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 This is one radio network dot com.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Well, once a month we have the honor of talking with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 He has a PhD.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 And it's rayPeat.com, right?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 I haven't looked for a while.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 Here's rayPeat.com.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Ray Peat's newsletter at gmail.com if you'd like to sign up for that, baby.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 And every few months you're doing that now, Dr. Peat, right?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Four times a year.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Four times a year.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 Oh.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 Yeah.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 You're not going to retire on us, are you, any time soon?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 No plans.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 That's good.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 We don't want to lose you.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Okay, let's go to some emails.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 You ready?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Are we on lots?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Okay.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Here's a 67-year-old male human who's been diagnosed with chronic lympho-lympo-cytic

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 leukemia.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 He has a low blood cortisol and low energy.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 What areas can I focus on to slow down the steadily increasing lymphocytes?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 My white blood cell count was about 15.5 last year.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 This year, 18.5.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Eternally grateful from James.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 Okay.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.500
 It's probably a good idea to have a blood test measuring both lactic acid and carbon

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:19.000
 dioxide because adequate carbon dioxide slows cell division and reduces inflammation.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 There's usually some sort of inflammation like an antigen involved in all of the leukemia,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 lymphoma-type problems.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 And so, they're finding that for both lymphoma and leukemia, both aspirin and acetazolamide

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 or something to increase your body's CO2 content will slow the growth.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Now, as long as I've known you, you've not ever been adverse to aspirin, right?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.500
 It's pretty safe kind of a thing?

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.500
 Yeah.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:12.000
 It's been, I guess, 40 years since I first dared to.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:21.500
 A woman who was desperate with inflammatory breast cancer, extremely painful, and doctors

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.000
 wouldn't touch it.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:33.500
 It occurred to me that she would be an obvious one to emphasize the pain-controlling effect

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:41.500
 and, as a side effect, reduce the inflammation and growth of the cancer.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:47.500
 So, I suggested she take aspirin until the pain subsides.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:57.000
 And just two or three days, she said the redness and swelling and pain had all subsided so

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.500
 that she could then wear a brassiere and talk to doctors about what to do.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.500
 My goodness.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:10.000
 It can make a very quick, a very profound difference.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.500
 So, aspirin is anti-inflammatory mainly?

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:14.500
 Mm-hmm.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.000
 Mainly anti-inflammatory.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Why does it lower, if the body's heating up to, in theory, get rid of whatever, right,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.500
 with the flu or something, that's the mechanism, right?

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.500
 Why would the aspirin lower that mechanism?

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.500
 Isn't that?

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.500
 It doesn't always.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.500
 Oh, it doesn't?

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:47.500
 The basic effect, if you're not suffering from an infection or something, if you just

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:54.000
 take an aspirin and check your temperature, very typically, your temperature and pulse

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 rate will rise with the aspirin because it's activating the respiratory system the same

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 way thyroid does and it even activates the thyroid action on cells.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 So there's no downside to popping some good old bare aspirin every now and then just for?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 Yeah, it's always best to take it with food because any concentrated crystalline substance,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 whether it's vitamins or salt or sugar, can injure your stomach membranes.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 So it's very important to have food or milk with it.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 Is the initial component of aspirin, the white willow bark, to this day, I mean, is that

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 where they get it?

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 You can buy it not too expensively on the internet.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 If you enter bulk aspirin, one of the advertisements coming up will be white willow bark.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 Really?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 I mean, it's the same thing, really?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 Well, the bark has lots of other stuff, so it's a low dose of aspirin.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 You can get a pound of aspirin for something in the range of $12 to $20 a pound.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 So is it good old bare stuff you get at whatever?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Is it pretty pure?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 Pretty good, except they put additives in it.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 They put additives?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Yeah.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 The bare I've had good luck with, but some aspirin tablets have junk like talc.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 Yeah, and sometimes they coat them up and God knows what they do with them, right?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 They put coatings.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Yeah, wax and that's the one.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 What about people, I know people that go to cardiologists that the cardiologists recommend

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 they do these little baby aspirins.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Is that recommended for people?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 I really think a lot of the stories about aspirin like Reye's syndrome, don't give aspirin

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 to babies with a fever, that started I think around 1970s, mid or late 1970s.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 Tylenol was having a big sales campaign and simultaneously with that a lot of stories

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 about people dying from bleeding or Reye's syndrome from taking aspirin came out.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 But later several studies questioned whether there ever was such a thing as Reye's syndrome.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:07.600
 One study in Australia found that people who took Tylenol had higher incidence of so-called

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.000
 Reye's syndrome than those who took aspirin.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 So I think a huge part of the myth about aspirin came because of Tylenol advertising.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 And now they're giving even premature babies, they'll treat them with Tylenol.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 And despite knowing that Tylenol causes kidney failure, during pregnancy or prematurity,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 it is strongly associated with causing autism and liver failure.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 It's very poisonous stuff and it happens that aspirin is an antidote to the toxicity of Tylenol.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 Really?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 Boy, they sell a lot of Tylenol, don't they?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Dr. Peat out there?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 It's big, isn't it?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Huge.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Big brand.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 Here's an email from Phil, he's in London with Queen Mom.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 "You recommend a lot of calcium, but does too much calcium affect the absorption of other minerals like magnesium?"

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Milk has about a 10 to 1 ratio, I think it is, of calcium to magnesium.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 But still, the body can sort it out and get all the magnesium you need from milk.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 From milk.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
 And you're okay with pasteurized milk?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Yeah, I generally use that kind.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Do you?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 "Would you please ask Dr. Peat what causes dry macular degeneration and if it can be halted or reversed? Thanks." From Karen.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Good nutrition is the basic thing, but stopping leaky blood vessels and deteriorating capillaries is what you have to do.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 And aspirin is generally protective.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 I think there are other things, other drugs that improve the metabolism of the retina.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 For example, agmatine is a very harmless chemical derived from arginine that lowers the production of nitric oxide when there's an inflammation or degeneration.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 So there are lots of ways to protect the retinal metabolism.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 Back to the leaky blood vessels again, what would be positive foods to eat to support the blood vessels?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Beets, right? Beets as well?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 B vitamins.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Generally a balanced, rich diet.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 If you cut down on your fat intake, that means you're going to eat more of the other foods and fat doesn't contain B vitamins.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 So a low-fat diet is pretty similar to a high B vitamin diet.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 Low-fat, oh, I see. Okay, I see how that balances out.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Here's from John, "I'm taking methylene blue. Is it okay to take with stromulus 2 mg tablet?"

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 What's methylene blue, Dr. Peat?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Oh, it's been around for about 150 years.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Really? What is it?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 The diet industry found that it was somewhat germicidal.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Paul Ehrlich advocated it for killing parasitic diseases.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 He used doses of, I think, 500 mg at the time.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 But one of its side effects is if you go into the sunlight and your tissues, sometimes the white of the eye turns blue if you're taking a lot of it.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 It sensitizes you to sunlight and can cause red blood cells to break down and sunburn easily and so on.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 So I don't recommend the high doses.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 It's being used for Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative nerve diseases because it is an electron donor and acceptor both.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 So it can pick up electrons in the electron transport chain and carry them past a defect in your enzymes and deliver that electron to the other side of the defect.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 So it's like a short circuit for getting your electron transport and respiration going again.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 And to do that, for example, people with depression, they're not making enough mental nervous energy.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 Just a half a milligram is plenty for that electron transport effect.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 People sometimes pop right out of a depression with just a tiny dose of methylene blue.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 And what about John and taking it with his stromulus?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 Is that okay? John wants to know.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 What is the other stuff?

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 Stromulus. I'm sorry. S-I-R-O-L-I-M-U-S. Two milligrams.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 Oh. What was the purpose of taking it?

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 Well, I don't know, but he just wanted to know if it was okay to take the methylene with.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 He's taking two milligrams of stromulus.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 I have never looked at that particular interaction, but serolimus, I think, has anti-cancer functions, anti-immunity, can be very protective for some infections, fungal infections, for example.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Interesting. Here's one from Alex. All right, let's see what we have here. It's kind of long.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 I'm going to paraphrase a bit, if you don't mind, Alex.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 Let's see. You got an MMR, measles, mumps. Is that MMR, measles, mumps, rubella?

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 Yeah, I guess that is. Seven years ago, had a reaction. My spine, shoulders, and hips are all crooked.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Wow. My left foot got hammer-toed. The clinic did blood work, diagnosed me with, I'm going to spell it, oh, it's A-N-K-Y-L-O-S-I-N-G spondylitis.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 Wow. For a short period, I took doses of humerus to help, but wanted to take my health in my own hands.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 Wanted to know if Dr. Peat had any theories on what I could do.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 Did they suggest any diet changes?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 Let's see. He said, "I seem to do pretty well staying away from starches and sugars. For about a month every year, I get super bad inflammation."

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 Concentrating on his digestion, more fiber, more digestible carbohydrates, but not too much at once in case there are bacteria converting them.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 But the fiber will help to move the bacteria through and out of the system faster, and possibly antibiotics as well as the fiber to help clean out the bad bacteria.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 So that will get them moving out of the colon, Dr. Peat, right?

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 Yeah, and making sure your thyroid is good so that your digestion is active and quick.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 Here's an email from Beverly.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 Can Dr. Peat explain why so many people feel better when they're taking this ivermectin if they believe they have COVID?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 And we know the positive tests are not correct, so we don't even know if they have it. Thanks.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 It has many, many known effects, but I think its essential activity is that it's anti-inflammatory.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Anti-inflammatory.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 Yeah, like aspirin. It can be good for everything.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 So that's why people feel better maybe?

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 I think it's the anti-inflammatory effect.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 We talked to some ladies long ago out of Mexico, and they were using ivermectin, gosh, I guess 10 years ago, Dr. Peat, with the autistic kids claiming that it worked on their parasites.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 Yeah, it's originally a parasite killer, but I think any good anti-inflammatory thing is going to help with autism.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
 Yeah, uh-huh, okay.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 Can Dr. Peat share with us what brands of oysters are available in the United States?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 He would recommend it being very low in contaminants or toxins. Is it preferable that they be placed in salt, brine, or in olive oil?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 Yeah, just for taste. I like the Crown Prince brand of smoked oysters in olive oil, but I don't think you can be sure of their level of contamination.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 I think they come from the west of Japan, and so they aren't in the worst of the radioactive pollution.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 But when possible, if you can get South American oysters that are lower in industrial and radiation toxins, that's preferable.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 And it's okay then if they're in a can, so obviously they've been cooked, but they still have benefits?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Oh, sure, yeah. Besides the smoked things in the can, we usually, at the fish section of a supermarket,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 we'll have freshly shelled oysters in a little container, so you can get, I think it's a 10-ounce container that has 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 oysters in it.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 Yeah, and the benefits of oysters are?

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 They're very rich in all of the sea minerals, selenium, copper, iodine, zinc, and so on.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 But they're also high in iron, so if you're worried about excessive iron, it would be better to alternate with things like crab and shrimp.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 Yeah, yeah. And you like lobster too, huh?

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 Oh, it's great. It's very similar nutritionally to shrimp, though, and the price of lobster is sometimes excessive.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 We can get some really, really fun, I mean, great tasting lobster here, but boy, they have gone up in price in the last month.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 Whoa! You know, everybody's kind of jumping on the whole inflation thing, right?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 Yeah.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 Yeah, it's like, okay, everybody's raising their prices.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 Okay, this is from Chris. He's in Canada.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 Oh, Canada, could you please ask Dr. Peat what to do if someone has very, very dry skin,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 and the only things that tend to help very little are all polyunsaturated fats like almonds, sesame, flax,

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 the desired saturated fats like coconut, cacao, shea butter, tallow, lanolin get absorbed, but the skin is still dry.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 Oh, so he's putting all the good stuff on his skin, but he's saying that the poofers are the only ones that seem to help.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 What's a fellow to do?

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 Correct the thyroid function.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 Ah, thyroid again, boy.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Yeah, thyroid makes you form the skin oils and sweat at the same time, so it moisturizes and oils your skin.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 And once again, your fav is a TSH, and this is pretty much the numbers that you concern yourself with, the TSH at .5 or below, correct if I'm right?

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 Around, yeah, one study showed that .4 and below, but .5 is fine.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 Wow, and over the years you've got to the point where you don't really look too much at all the free T3 and all that other stuff?

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
 No, because there are so many things.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 For example, if you have poofer circulating in your blood, whether it's N-6 or N-3, both of those block the function of thyroid, so you're going to have lots of thyroid hormone in your blood, but it's being blocked in effect by the polyunsaturated fats.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 Wow, and do all nuts have poofers?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 All nuts, well, macadamia are pretty low in poofer, more saturated fats, and I think the taste quality goes up with the saturated fats.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 So what are some other ones that are low poofers other than macadamia? Do we have other choices?

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 I think cashews are fairly low in poofer.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 What about pistachios?

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 They're from a moderate climate, so I think they're fairly high in poofer.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 And then the oils, that would be all the usual suspect, right? Olive, not olive, but more corn and all the oils, and soy and all that stuff, right?

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 Those are the things that block thyroid.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 Block thyroid.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 Man, I wonder how much corn oil they sold over the last 50 years. My goodness.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 Wesson oil, right?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 Yeah, cottonseed oil was the first one to be promoted because it was a waste product, very, very cheap.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 And in the 1950s, they started selling it as a health food, and they claimed that it would prevent heart disease.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 The more you ate, prevent cancer, and even would make you slim.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 But it turns out to cause cancer, to cause heart disease, and obesity.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 You know, it's funny, Dr. Peat. I grew up in the 50s, and I remember my mom saying, "I don't use that Wesson oil. It's not good for you."

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 I wonder how she knew that. I wonder how she knew. Well, she's Italian. Maybe just all the olive oil, right? I don't know. She knew it.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 Probably, yeah.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 She said, "Don't use that. No, that's bad stuff."

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 It's great. Go ahead.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 It's a waste product, essentially, from the cotton industry.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 Which is what canola, too, right? I mean, that's one of the number one, even in health food stores, PUFA. Right, canola?

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000
 Yeah. It varies in PUFA content.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 But Hans Selye did studies with it, showing that it wasn't the erucic acid. Canola was designed to be low in erucic acid.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:52.000
 But Hans Selye showed that it's the linoleic-related PUFA that make canola harmful to your heart.

00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:02.000
 He showed a high canola diet caused when he would slice up the hearts of experimental animals.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000
 The heart was full of little dead areas.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:21.000
 But if he gave them cocoa butter, a highly saturated erucic acid-rich fat, that would block the effect of the PUFA and protect their heart from canola oil.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000
 Really? So, it might be good for all of us to have a little cocoa butter?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
 A little chocolate, yeah, if it's pure actual chocolate.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:49.000
 But a bulk quantity of chocolate on the market is made with an oil that is also used in oil-well drilling as a lubricant.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:01.000
 Oh, good. But you can also get bars of, hunks of organic cocoa butter too, right? And you can melt that and put it in a smoothie, you think?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:12.000
 Yeah, you want to check. Sometimes a person can be allergic to something in it. It depends on exactly how it's made.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
 Always good to check for allergies.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:26.000
 Here's one from Robert. "Is it possible to reduce an enlarged prostate? If it's possible, how can I, if I need to take antibiotics, which are the safest for digestive problems?"

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:34.000
 Okay, I've got two questions here. Enlarged prostate and if it's possible to shrink it up, do you know a way?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:56.000
 Yeah, pregnenolone is helpful by lowering general stress and inflammation, but aspirin and thyroid, getting your thyroid function up and using aspirin, both of those reduce ordinary inflammation of the prostate.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:12.000
 So that's what it is. And how are you, any relative good stuff by looking at the PSA, this very popular test they give to guys, the PSA?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:41.000
 Yeah, better not to look at it even. Around 1990 when that came out as a test indicating prostate cancer, suddenly the death rate from prostate cancer went up, I think it was 50% in a year or two because they were giving more treatments just on the basis of PSA, no evidence of cancer.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 But the more treatment they gave, the more people died from the treatment associated with having diagnosed cancer.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:06.000
 My goodness. And then Robert wanted to know if he had to take antibiotics, are they the safest for digestive and not killing all the good stuff?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:33.000
 Yeah, you can take the dose that stops the symptoms without totally sterilizing your intestine and risking the development of dangerous toxic bacteria like the difficile or something like that.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:47.000
 Yeah, that microbe, the difficile. Wow, so you're suggesting that if you wanted to take one, you could do it until the symptoms go away and then quit.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:14.000
 Yeah, I think that's safest because I have talked to just hundreds of people who got chronic bowel problems from following through on the idea that you have to take all of your prescription every day for the full number of days it was prescribed. That's very often enough to totally disrupt your natural bacteria.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
 And does that take a while to build back?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
 Sometimes never comes back.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
 Sometimes never comes back. Really? Never?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 With great effort fixing your hormones and your food and supplementing the bacteria sometimes by enema because that gets past your stomach digestive enzymes that kill most of them.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
 So what would you put in your enema?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
 The right kind of bacteria.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:59.000
 That kind of bacteria. Interesting. Have you ever heard of a bacteria called L-roteri?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
 Yeah.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:15.000
 A microbe? We've been making some yogurt with it. We had a guest on and recommended it and you get it and it's out of Sweden and it seems to be, my body seems to like it. I don't know what it's doing but I'm playing with it.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:37.000
 Yeah, years ago I got some antibiotic bacteria. It was a combination of Bacillus subtilis and I think Lyconeformis was the other species and those are producers of antibiotics.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:06:01.000
 And I found that you could make yogurt with those. Very bland tasting. More like what they used to make a pudding by adding rennet to it. It doesn't sour the milk but it makes a sweet jelly out of the milk.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
 Here's kind of a complicated one. I'm going to get through it though. Try to keep your email short if you can.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:28.000
 This is Thomas in Sweden. He used to take about 5-10 mg of progesterone on his neck and a similar dose of DHEA orally to mitigate his headaches. After 7 months he had to stop since he gained 15 kg of pure fat, not water.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:41.000
 And since stopping I've continued to gain another 3 kg the last 2 months. Of course I can't be sure if the progesterone but before this nothing including desiccated thyroid could ever even move my weight upwards.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
 So what the heck happened here? Can Dr. Peat give us some idea what could have happened?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
 Did he say he was using the progesterone on his neck?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
 Cream on his neck, correct.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 Oh yeah, he was essentially absorbing none.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
 Oh, really? When you put on your neck you don't absorb any?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 Or on your skin. The creams are with the greatest attention and rubbing in you might absorb as much as 10% of what you put on but usually it's less than that.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
 Really?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:29.000
 And so putting on only 5 or 10 mg your body won't even know that it has had a boost of progesterone.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.000
 So these progesterone creams and all this stuff that they sell, they just don't work in your opinion?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:43.000
 Well if you put on 1000 mg on your skin you definitely will feel it.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 And all you need is a dab of that really inexpensive progestease and you're there, right?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 Yeah, if you put it on your lips or tongue or take it with food it's essentially 100% absorbed because it mixes with the fats in your food and is absorbed bypassing the liver circulating in the chylomicron fractions.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:23.000
 Wow. Here is Vince. He said, "We live in a goiter belt. Do you recommend that we take iodine? If so, how many mg per day?" Thanks for the show.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:43.000
 A little bit of iodized salt is okay if you're eating a lot of local foods for example but if you get seafoods or imported foods you're likely not to be iodine deficient.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 And several dozen studies of the association between iodized salt or any iodine supplement and nodules or cancer of the thyroid, there's a very strong relationship between getting a little too much iodine.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:28.000
 For example, even half a mg a day of supplement continued for a long time is associated with increased degeneration, nodules and cancer of the thyroid.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.000
 So the Morton's pickling and canning salt, does that have a little iodine in there?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
 None at all.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
 None at all but it doesn't matter, right?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
 Not if you eat seafood about once a week.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
 That's it?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:53.000
 The average American gets food produced in many different kinds of soil. So very few people.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:10.000
 Farmers, salt-sufficient farmers in the greater belts are the only ones who might be at risk. But if they buy fertilizer made elsewhere, then sometimes that will provide iodine.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 Patrick Timpone, Dr. Ray Peat is with us on generally the third Monday but we had a technical thing so he was kind enough to come on on this Wednesday the 23rd of March as we're live here on Radionetwork.com.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:50.000
 Rachel writes in, "Dr. Peat has always recommended a small amount of T4 at bedtime to hold the TSH down during the night. I'm currently on Lavoxerine and some T3. Could you please ask Dr. Peat if the Lavoxerine/thyrine needs to be taken on an empty stomach and away from food?"

01:10:50.000 --> 01:11:12.000
 That's what pharmacists and doctors almost always recommend. Take it in the morning before breakfast on an empty stomach. But that's unphysiological. The body doesn't dump your day's thyroid in your bloodstream all in one dose in the morning.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 It trickles it out steadily during the day and the closer you can come to that, a little bit with each meal gives you closer to the way the body uses thyroid.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000
 So was she incorrect? She assumed you recommend taking T4 at bedtime?

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:55.000
 Yeah. If someone is having a stressful night, for example, the stress hormones rise during the night if you're deficient in some nutrients including carbohydrates.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:07.000
 And TSH goes up during the night along with several other stress hormones that disturb your sleep and keep you tired.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.000
 Can you actually get a product where you're just getting T4 if you want to take a little at night?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:25.000
 Yeah. Almost all prescribed thyroid in the US is only T4. And for women, women have a very poor average response to T4.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
 Why is that I wonder?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:45.000
 Because estrogen inhibits the conversion of T4 to the active hormone. And so doctors, they think that when you increase the T4 too much that you're getting hyperthyroidism.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:13:03.000
 But if you're not converting it properly as about half of all women do, then too much T4 starts turning under the influence of stress hormones into reverse T3 rather than active T3.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:11.000
 So it lowers your metabolic rate and other thyroid functions to take too much T4.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:23.000
 So when folks go to the doc and they get a prescription for thyroid, whatever the most natural one I guess, whatever it is, it's just T4. That's it?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:39.000
 Yeah. And that's not at all natural. That's a synthetic which in a healthy young man, it works just like thyroid hormone because their livers can activate it.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:55.000
 But the reason women have about 10 times the incidence of thyroid disease as men is that estrogen limits the ability to convert thyroxine to real hormone.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:05.000
 And so it's a really very irrational unscientific thing to prescribe thyroxine for women.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:14.000
 So then ladies with high TSH, they would try to find some kind of source of just a pig thyroid or beef or something?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:38.000
 Yeah. If you have very high TSH, you at least benefit from suppressing that T4. It is fine for acting on your pituitary to ease off on the TSH and that will greatly protect your thyroid from developing nodules if you just suppress the TSH.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:15:03.000
 Because TSH itself when it's elevated is producing the symptoms that are associated with hypothyroidism. It isn't just a lack of metabolic activating T3 hormone. It's the actual positive direct pro-inflammatory effect of TSH itself.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 I had a good friend, a lady friend mentioned to me that her hair was starting to see some hair falling out and I was kind of musing that it was a low thyroid. Is that close?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:38.000
 That's undoubtedly the most common reason for thinning hair. There are fewer hairs because so many fall out and the hairs that do grow if your thyroid is low are thin, frail hairs.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 I see. Excellent. Ted wants to know about systemic enzymes versus aspirin. Systemic enzymes are a blend of enzymes like serpeptase, pancreatic, bromelain, papain and others when taken between meals.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:12.000
 I don't know this word, gets rid of the fibrin in the blood dissolving blood clots and exogenous proteins through the body. Does aspirin act in the same way?

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
 So systemic enzymes versus aspirin.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:29.000
 The traditional way of getting those enzymes was to powder the pancreas gland of animals.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
 Yeah, pancreatic.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:44.000
 Yeah, that's a very good mixture of digestive enzymes that do help with things like preventing clots and inflammation.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:59.000
 But since you can't heat the dry gland to sterilize it, there's always a risk of the animal having some kind of infectious disease.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:14.000
 So essentially, pancreatic enzyme substances have to be still alive tissue, which means they could have bacteria and other pathogens.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:28.000
 And the alternative is to use similar enzymes made by a fungus, most commonly a fungus is used.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:45.000
 And that always leaves antigenic traces of the fungus itself, and so you have the potential to have an allergic reaction to fungal enzymes.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 So if you wanted to take systemic enzymes in between meals, is there anything you can use that is safe?

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
 I would go with pancreatic.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
 Just go do the pancreatic?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
 Yeah, despite the risk of infection.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
 I wonder if they have organic, that might help, I don't know.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
 Yeah.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
 They might, wow.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:14.000
 Didn't Dr. who was it, Gonzales, he did a lot of work with cancer, remember?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
 And he used to do, yeah, the pancreatic enzymes, yeah.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
 Yeah, Dr. Kelly.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
 Kelly's work.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:28.000
 One of the pioneers in that, and it goes back early 20th century.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 And that has fairly recently been supported by new types of studies that show that the pancreatic enzymes entering the intestine are actually reabsorbed into the system.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:19:04.000
 So if you make them yourself properly, or if you take them as powdered pancreas gland, you're actually getting those enzymes into the bloodstream, not just into your intestine.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:24.000
 And so there's clear evidence that they do get into the bloodstream, act as proteolytic enzymes, just as I think it was Dr. Beard at the turn of the 20th century, who advocated that as a cancer treatment.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000
 And Kelly and Gonzales developed it and followed up.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:39.000
 Interesting. So that would be the best pancreatic enzyme you can find that can really get into the bloodstream and do all the good things we like with enzymes, right?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
 Yeah.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
 Do raw foods do the same thing?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:20:00.000
 Except they are combined with a lot of antigens and indigestible material, so they can cause intestinal irritation, indigestion and gas and so on.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:06.000
 Yeah. Well, Martin is in Montana, great state.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:15.000
 Can you ask Dr. Peat, what is good cortisol levels and what is too high and what is too low?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:41.000
 If you have lots of production of the protective steroids, which are precursors to cortisol, pregnenolone and progesterone and a moderate amount of DHEA, those protect against cortisol, but the progesterone also functions the same way cortisol does.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
 So if you have enough of those, you don't need any cortisol.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 And so if you're vigorously producing steroids, you should have a very low cortisol level.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 The stress of nighttime is what causes the cortisol level to rise around dawn.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:15.000
 This is from Fabio. People have stated that COVID infects the intestines and that its long-lasting effects from bowel inflammation can include coughing.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:29.000
 Apart from experimenting with an easily digestible diet to reveal foods that are responsible, what supplements could be taken to stop persistent cough that leaves a person in dire need of oxygen?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
 Serotonin is the major thing.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:47.000
 Inflammation of the intestine is responsible for the great bulk, more than 90% of all of the serotonin in the body is produced in the intestine.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:22:11.000
 And if it's irritated, that increases. And if your intestine is inflamed, that interferes with your liver's ability to regulate the way the blood platelets handle serotonin.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:33.000
 And so the platelets, which should be detoxifying the serotonin, taking it mostly to the lungs where it's destroyed, they can't handle the extra serotonin, which then causes the blood vessel inflammation, leading to clots and/or hemorrhaging.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:51.000
 And so anti-inflammatory things, first, very easy to digest foods, but aspirin, ciproheptazine is an anti-serotonin that calms intestinal inflammation.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:16.000
 And keeping your CO2 up has the action of acidifying your platelets and the acidic granules in the platelets bind to serotonin and allows the serotonin to be carried to the lungs and liver for detoxifying.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:40.000
 And so the hyperventilation caused by the serotonin itself tends to drive off your CO2, causing your platelets to spill serotonin into the blood, causing the clots and blood vessel inflammation, carditis and so on.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:48.000
 What's all that stuff going on with the shots, right, with the injections too?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:56.000
 So what about breathing into a bag to get more CO2? Can you do that?

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
 Yeah, that's the quickest, simplest way to get some.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:14.000
 I've seen people control their hypertension, spending a few minutes every day. You can see the blood pressure come down the first or second days of doing that.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:28.000
 Interesting. There's reports with an email of a doctor that had people that had their saturated oxygen levels down to 35 and lived.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 Can one's oxygen level go that low and then if one uses carbon dioxide to saturate the body with CO2, this then helps the blood carry more oxygen?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:52.000
 Is this partly due to the fact that CO2 would alkalize the body, raising the voltage to then carry more oxygen?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 In itself, it doesn't alkalize the body, but the bicarbonate, baking soda for example, directly regulates the pH neither too high nor too low.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:33.000
 The CO2 has so many protective effects on blood vessels, on circulation through the lungs.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:58.000
 Just by adding CO2 to a person with breathing difficulties, for example, on Mount Everest, they were putting people in a big body bag, adding oxygen as a way to bring them out of inflamed lungs and brain from the altitude.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:08.000
 Someone noticed that in these airtight body bags, they were accumulating pretty high levels of CO2.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.000
 It wasn't the oxygen, it was the increased CO2 curing the altitude sickness.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:29.000
 The same thing that happens in altitude sickness happens from the serotonin poisoning and inflammation caused by COVID and other degenerative diseases.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:42.000
 Can you ask Dr. Peat how to cure P-A-R-O-N-Y-C-H-I-A?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.000
 P-A-R-O-N-Y-C-H-I-A

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:57.000
 Sometimes it's a vitamin deficiency.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:06.000
 Just improving your diet, vitamin A, sometimes putting vitamin A right around your nails.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000
 They have a word for everything, right?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
 Dana, she's in New Jersey.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:26.000
 I would like to know if eating farm-raised chickens four to five times a week is harmful to one's health due to high omega-6 content.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:33.000
 I've heard chickens and pork have a high omega-6 and it can be harmful to one's health.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.000
 Yes, definitely.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 Just by feeding them barley instead of corn and soy, the barley is lower in PUFA.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 Depending on the climate, there are many alternative foods that are lower in the PUFA content.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:16.000
 The general inflammatory properties of chicken and pork, standard American pork, has more than 30% polyunsaturated fats in its tissue.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:23.000
 Europeans don't like American pork because they say it has soft fat.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:32.000
 When I was a kid, lard was a solid like butter that would stay in the block at room temperature.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000
 Now it's semi-liquid.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
 Because of the feed?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
 Yes, eating too much corn and soy.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:51.000
 But you did say that if you could find a pork producer that was totally vegetarian, grass, the real deal, that's really low in all the bad stuff, right?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:09.000
 Yes, I've heard of three pig farmers that are producing pork fat that is solid and the content of PUFA is approaching beef and lamb, down around 4%.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
 Beef and lamb are about 2.5% to 3% PUFA.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000
 The pork from those farms is essentially as safe as beef or lamb.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:28.000
 Interesting. And you tell that when the fat is firmer and hard?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:34.000
 At room temperature. It should stay firm and white.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:44.000
 Pretty cool. If you can get good pork, it's really quite tasty and I guess it's a good protein.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:52.000
 Does Dr. Peat have any suggestions for sagging skin and extremely dehydrated skin?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
 All the water I drink just goes right through me. Bathroom breaks non-stop.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:02.000
 I don't consume any type of PUFA. By the way, I'm a 40-year-old female.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 So, here's a 40-year-old female, every time she drinks, she just keeps peeing it out. What could be going on there?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:17.000
 Yeah, the thyroid is the main thing that regulates hydration and oiliness of the skin.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.000
 I think my camera just went off. That's alright. You don't need to see me.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:30.000
 Let me put up Dr. Peat. Yeah, my camera just ran out of juice there. Let me put it up there.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:36.000
 Okay, well, so back to the thyroid again. My goodness.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:51.000
 I wonder, can you conjecture how, just give an idea of how much any of this COVID, fear, angst, whatever,

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:59.000
 you know, now we have Russia, how it affects the thyroid. Can you talk a little bit about that?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:22.000
 Yeah, anxiety is a constant suppressor of the thyroid. Great shock, the death of a close relative is often the trigger that turns a person's thyroid off.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:31.000
 Or an accident, just the emotional shock is enough to knock out your thyroid.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:40.000
 The body tries to go into hibernation to get away from the horror of the experience.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:56.000
 And I'm afraid that the fear campaigns from fear of nuclear war or whatever, fear of a virus or fear of terrorists,

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:02.000
 all of those are being promoted actively by the government and the media.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:08.000
 And they're harming everyone's bodies as well as their minds.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:15.000
 Yes, sir. And I've been reading articles. It's like thyroid. It's like an epidemic right now.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
 Mainstream media is talking about it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000
 Yeah. Have you been listening to Dr. Bakhti's videos?

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
 Oh, Bakhti's? Bakhti?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
 Sucharit Bakhti.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
 Yeah, he's been on the show a few times, but I haven't checked in with him a while. Is he talking about thyroid?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:44.000
 No, not about thyroid, but he's a plain talker about what's going on with the virus and vaccines.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:53.000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get him back on. And you think he's right on? You like his work?

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
 Yeah, I heard him just a few days ago on the Children's Health Defense.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
 Oh, yeah.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
 Kennedy's group.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
 Kennedy's group.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000
 Yeah.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:10.000
 And first of his talks, I didn't have any tiny disagreement with him.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:26.000
 He is over the last year and a half, he has investigated everything and now has a very, very clear picture of what's going on with the virus.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:31.000
 And what is he saying just in general? What's his take?

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
 It's a criminal hoax, essentially.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
 That the whole thing was a hoax?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:47.000
 The vaccine never was intended or conceived to prevent the infection.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
 Yeah.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:34:14.000
 It can't in principle, that's been known for more than 15 years. The people, the insiders can't have been so stupid and ignorant as to ignore all of the evidence showing that the vaccine was purely, essentially, a manner of chemical warfare.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:23.000
 Yeah, wow. And now did you hear the latest talk? We have a sub-variant of Fauci. A sub-variant.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
 A sub-variant.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
 A sub-variant. A sub-variant.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
 Oh, that's the new one. Yeah, it's a sub-variant.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000
 Yeah.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000
 These people, they don't quit.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:49.000
 A couple more and then we'll let you go to work. Let's see. In his opinion, what causes lupus? Can anything be done to help with all the redness in the face and broken capillaries and veins in the legs?

01:34:49.000 --> 01:35:09.000
 Oh yeah. I've been seeing people with lupus so-called do very quick recoveries. Just last year I've been following a woman who was diagnosed with lupus and could hardly move because of arthritis.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:28.000
 She just changed her diet and started supplementing thyroid and progesterone and avoiding the allergens and pro-inflammatory things. And it's all well.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 Autoimmune conditions are very well defined as the results of too much estrogen, too little progesterone and thyroid.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:54.000
 Let's see. How much protein is Dr. Peat doing? Is he going like 80 grams per day or less?

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:15.000
 I'm experimenting currently trying to get it down to as close to 50 as possible for the low messianin. But my habits make it hard to get it down that low. So probably around 60 right now.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
 So that would, where are you getting that protein from? What are you going to?

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:28.000
 Milk and even oatmeal has a surprising amount of protein in it.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:38.000
 Is there a big advantage to doing like the, what do they call those Dr. Peat, steel cut oats rather than just the smashed up?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.000
 No, I don't think there's any difference as long as you cook it thoroughly.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
 Yeah. And then you can put butter and milk in there too if you want, right?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
 Yep. Very delicious.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
 Might as well.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:00.000
 Yesterday at work I was feeling great. My knees didn't hurt. But on the way home I ate four little cookies with no chocolate in them.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:08.000
 And by the time I got home I went into a-fib. I did tapping on my hand and chest and I rubbed peppermint oil on my neck and chest.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
 I took liquid magnesium and 2-aspirin and I did the carbon dioxide with a brown paper bag.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.000
 After a couple of hours I was feeling much better and slept good last night and my body was pooped out.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.000
 Did I do good Dr. Peat with what I did even though the doctors would love to put me on pills?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:33.000
 Is there any, if there's only way this happens, is it a blue moon or could the cookies have chipped this off?

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:45.000
 Oh yeah. Irritation in the intestine is enough to send out inflammation signals that raise the free fatty acids in the blood.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:38:03.000
 And so carbon dioxide and grape or orange juice as a quick form of getting your glucose up to lower the free fatty acids. That is pretty effective for a stage.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:15.000
 Ray wants to know how much orange juice, thanks for the show, he says I really enjoy having him on. How much orange juice does Dr. Ray Peat drink per day?

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
 Around a little over a quarter.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
 You drink a quarter of orange juice a day?

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:43.000
 Oh, in warm weather much more than that. I try to aim for that amount. Now I'm trying a combination, maybe a pint of Concord grape juice and a little over a pint of orange juice.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
 And the benefits for you?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
 Anti-inflammatory.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:39:02.000
 Wow, that's the main benefits, anti-inflammatory. You can actually get organic, not from concentrate, but some real grapes, right? It's a store, can't you?

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:10.000
 Yeah, Newton, just Concord is the best one I've found.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:17.000
 Years ago people used to do the grape juice diet. Did they ever just drink grape juice for a week?

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:30.000
 Yeah, I knew people in the 40s and 50s who were doing that. And knew people who said they recovered from it.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
 It was hard on them, huh? You don't want to do that.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:50.000
 Two weeks I think was the thing to eat purple grapes or purple grape juice. And it definitely lowers inflammation.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:40:06.000
 What would Dr. Peat recommend to help someone resolve a chronic case of bruxism, which is when a person grinds their teeth while they sleep? Yeah, it can be hard on the teeth, boy.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:30.000
 Things that improve digestion, because nocturnal rise of serotonin from falling blood sugar and something irritating in the intestine causes the serotonin to rise, increasing nervous tension and symptoms like that.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:39.000
 Karen wants to know what are some good alternatives to eating oysters and shellfish? They can't get those or don't like them?

01:40:39.000 --> 01:41:00.000
 Oh, any way to get your selenium. That's the most likely thing that you'll lack if you don't eat any marine products. So even a selenium supplement can be helpful.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.000
 Or Brazil nuts have selenium, but then you're back into the PUFA range, right? In the PUFA land?

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:12.000
 Yeah, all of the seafoods contain PUFA, so you don't want to overdo it.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:24.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, we covered a lot of territory today. Thanks for your flexibility with coming on after your regular stint. And thank you, we really appreciate you coming on our show. It's an honor to have you.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
 Oh, okay.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
 Thank you, sir. See you real soon.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
 Thank you. Bye.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:39.000
 Bye-bye. Dr. Ray Peat, you can check out his newsletter at raypeatsnewsletter.com. If I can get my thing up here and close out the show.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:42:04.000
 Well, I think we're almost back to normal with our technical stuff. I'm going to take a little day off. Not that I need one. I've been off for two weeks. But working with this geeky stuff, you know, make your head explode, you know, on the phone with people.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:12.000
 So I'm going to take a day off tomorrow. We take Thursdays off. I'll see you at the Farmer's Market today, the Dripping Springs Farmer's Market. See you then.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:27.000
 And we have Colostrum on sale, 20%. Use promo code "RESTORE". The hydrogen machine, 20% off for this little puppy. Use promo code "ONERADIO".

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:51.000
 Don't forget Shen Blossom. I didn't mention them today, but it's just a wonderful company. I just made an order and getting a whole bunch of things from Shen Blossom. Just great, great, great, great products. Don't, don't, don't, or do, do visit them. It's on our front page. Shen Blossom. I think you'll find some really, really fun things there.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:43:14.000
 He's got some wonderful minerals. Dr. Peat talks a lot about minerals. He's got some wonderful, wonderful minerals from real food, real minerals. And you can take these. They have a midnight minerals. You can take a night. It helps you sleep and helps your body do all the wonderful things it does while you're out traveling in the far country in your soul body.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:30.000
 I love you all very much. Thank you. Thanks for your support. Appreciate you all, your, your kind messages during this time off. And a lot of you were worried about me, but we're fine. We're fine. Where'd you go, baby?

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:46.000
 We'll see you on Friday for our Friday edition. And we should have lots to talk about because we haven't been on. So see you Friday. But check in. BitChute. We have most of our video, all of our whatever videos up there.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:44:03.000
 And then we're running archive shows that we're going to update here soon on the, and then on the front page too. So stop by. Let me know if I can help with anything. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:24.000
 Love you all very much. Thanks. You're doing great. Don't believe anything out there. You know, whatever germs, COVID, nuclear war. It's all just crap. You know, it's all fear porn, man. Just all fear porn. They just want to make you crazy. Just don't buy into it.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:45.000
 Hi, dude. We're going to go now. See you soon. I love you. See you Friday.
