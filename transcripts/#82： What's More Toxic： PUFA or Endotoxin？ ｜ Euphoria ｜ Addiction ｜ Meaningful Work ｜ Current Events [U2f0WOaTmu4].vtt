WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 Okay, Generative Energy number 82 with Ray Peat and Georgi Dinkov.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.440
 And Ray, you were just saying you were reading about the war.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.620
 And so I'm sure to the chagrin, is that the right phrasing, to everybody that hated the

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.380
 last time we talked about this stuff, I do want to talk about the Ukraine and Russia

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.380
 once again.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.600
 So give us, I don't know, give us maybe an update of your point of view and everything

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.560
 you've learned or that's transpired since then and where you think this is all heading,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 et cetera.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.080
 I actually think it's all a piece with the pandemic.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:51.240
 I think all of it was planned out years ahead to do anything to destroy the economy so that

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.160
 the monopolies will have total power.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.800
 And so like a planned out war, do you think if they said, "Oh, if we do this, then Russia

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 will do that."

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.000
 It's like that planned out to a T?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.640
 Yeah, I've read two or three articles, different people predicting exactly what's happening

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.840
 now in Ukraine and Europe eight years ago.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 Oh, wow.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.440
 Do you think China and Russia are also kind of benefiting from this war too?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.720
 They're using it to cover their own political and economic problems?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160
 Oh, definitely.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:43.320
 The likely outcome, if they don't resort to nuclear war, will be for Russia and China

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.760
 to totally dominate the world economy.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:59.440
 And that's why the World Economic Forum class is in such a panic now for at least 10 years.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.240
 How close do you think we are to nuclear war?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.680
 What is the likelihood of that happening in your point of view?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:23.440
 The chances within the next two hours are moderate and increasing from then unless there's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.360
 a dramatic reason for settling and establishing peace in Ukraine.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.000
 Did something happen a few hours ago or today or yesterday?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.280
 No, just the last several days.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:55.440
 Everyone's intention has been expressed and they are starting to realize that Russia so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.760
 far has definitely been winning and that they're on the threshold of totally losing the empire

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:20.760
 and for the whole world to start reorienting around the Asian economic system.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.280
 Something we might have touched on last time we talked, but I have since done a mild amount

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.080
 of investigation into, but apparently the CIA was supporting all those white nationalist

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.040
 groups in the Ukraine.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.880
 And so maybe we didn't touch on the CIA connection.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.280
 We've been talking about the CIA for at least a little while now.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
 What do you think about that?

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 Does that make the whole situation a little bit more clear if a person is under the impression

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.400
 that the CIA is kind of the tool of the ruling elite and then they've been for 50 years supporting

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.040
 the white nationalist groups in the Ukraine?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:07.440
 Yeah, and remember when we talked about World War II and the outcome of why the Cold War

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:27.280
 started, the Dulles and Bushes and the banker class in general was working creating Hitler

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.760
 for their basic purpose.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:38.400
 The first World War, the basic purpose of the ruling class is to get access to Russia's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.840
 resources without the Russians.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.520
 That's been on the record for a long time.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.560
 The Germans had the documents saying that the Russians who couldn't be slave labor would

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:09.120
 be sent off to starve in Siberia, so essentially eliminating the population so that Germany

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.920
 could have the resources.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:24.920
 But the United Kingdom and the US weren't happy with that falling solely into the Germans'

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920
 control.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:36.520
 So they worked with Hitler, supported his war against Russia to the extent that they

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.120
 figured they could destroy Russia and then take on Germany.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:56.440
 All of that was in place behind the scenes during Roosevelt's management of the war.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:08.760
 Both England and the US were stalling month after month, joining the war.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:19.680
 Stalin said, "Wasn't it raining too much for you to invade the continent?"

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:28.400
 Finally when they saw that Russia was just driving straight through to the West, that

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:36.200
 was when they invaded to stop the Russians halfway.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:48.080
 But instantly when Roosevelt died, that faction represented by Harry Truman was in control.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:59.160
 Since Truman, the support of the Nazis and working with the Nazis everywhere, Ukrainians

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:12.840
 and Hungarian fascists, Polish fascists, everyone who lost their power temporarily in Europe

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:23.600
 moved to North America mostly, Canada and the US, and now those people are adding their

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.320
 weight to American policy.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:40.560
 The Ukrainian fascists have been in business right since they allied themselves with Hitler

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.640
 during the war.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.600
 Just to be clear, I think we have talked about this before, but Nazism, the huge problem

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.960
 with it in your view is the eugenicist aspect of it.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.880
 Because again, if you like Trump now, you're like a Nazi or something.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.760
 So just to clarify that term.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:12.400
 No, it's a whole scheme for the World Economic Forum type, the absolute ruling class, to

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.560
 control everything.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:29.760
 Not just genocide, it's just something along the way to make that happen and become stable.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.400
 But it's an idea of ruling the world.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.760
 And then, Georgi, you can interrupt at any time, a comment I received multiple times

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.160
 after the last conversation was, "What is Ray talking about here?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.680
 Isn't he anti-war?"

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.760
 And so how do you...

00:08:48.760 --> 00:09:00.160
 A few days ago, Trump put out a statement saying that for the good of the world, peace

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.640
 has to be established in Ukraine.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:11.840
 And he's supporting two anti-war candidates for Congress.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:20.760
 And so part of his being called a Nazi is that he's against war.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:29.920
 But I guess in the empire game, there isn't really a way to be a pacifist or...

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.920
 I know you don't think...

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:38.400
 Do you think violence is necessary, or maybe for the elites to use violence?

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.880
 What do you think about that?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.480
 You're not happy that people are dying in the Ukraine or Russia, right?

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.520
 No, the sooner they can stop it.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:56.040
 As Trump said, peace in the Ukraine is the central world issue right now.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.560
 But at the same time, without this war, the empire would have relentlessly continued subjugating

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.720
 and crushing everything in its path.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:13.880
 Yeah, Putin has said that the outcome looks like it's going to be ending the Western hegemony.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.520
 What do you think that will manifest as?

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:27.440
 Well, without the Asian and the Russian and the Indian economy, if they form a new center,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.840
 and if that's the new economic center, what is the Western world going to do with its

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.720
 collapsing slash non-existent economy?

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.880
 I mean, wouldn't that mean collapse?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.200
 And in that case, the elite loses its power?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:55.000
 I'm afraid it will turn into something much less than a third world, that the Shah of

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 Iran might be a model for the government of the West.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.040
 If there's a widespread economic collapse, in other words, if basically...

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.960
 Where is this power of the elite?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.080
 What is it going to be based on if all of their money suddenly is worthless?

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.120
 I mean, all of their possessions abroad will probably be confiscated, as Russia has already

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.440
 started doing.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.840
 Chinese will probably follow suit soon enough.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.680
 And then if basically the world dumps the Western model, doesn't the power of the elite

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680
 disappear as well?

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.680
 The only thing they have remaining is weapons.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:43.720
 Oh, they'll declare the common people their enemy, like the Shah of Iran did.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720
 Oh wow.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.000
 So basically they'll start cannibalizing each other as a way of maintaining power?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.240
 I think so.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.680
 Another first time we talked about is, where does Israel play into this whole empire game?

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.400
 You see them as just kind of regulating the US's activities, or how do they work into

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.640
 what's happening right now?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:18.960
 They are leaders in insisting that there are no Nazis in Ukraine, even though the leaders

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:31.160
 of the Azov factions fly at swastikas and declare that they have all of the German Nazi

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:37.160
 symbols and salutes and phrases.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:49.000
 So it's impossible to say that they're not Nazis, but Israel is saying, since they aren't

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:57.360
 having Jewish genocide, at least not on a large scale, they can't be Nazis.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.880
 That's the extent of Israel's reasoning about Nazism.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:15.640
 But they are practicing genocide against Russians, so they right now aren't focusing on Jews,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.720
 though they probably will eventually.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:30.320
 But people in Israel are talking about the Ukraine as the New Jerusalem, historically,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.320
 arguing that it's an extension of Israel.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.320
 Is that a prophecy thing?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:46.440
 Yeah, I think it's the whole thing about the New Jerusalem.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:55.200
 I've been hearing about it for many decades, but I don't really have an investigation of

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.880
 what the theological side is.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.520
 Oh, I didn't know that.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.960
 So this could be part of a whole biblical or Talmudic type of thing?

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960
 This whole... yeah.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.680
 It's shocking to find that stuff out.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.280
 Go ahead, Georgi.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.040
 A little bit back to the war.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.560
 I keep coming back to this theme that basically if the West uses control of the world financial

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.600
 markets and of the world's productive resources and activity, then what is even the elite

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.000
 going to do with all of its fake money?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.240
 How are they going to get the things they need if almost nothing is produced in the

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.280
 developed world anymore?

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:43.600
 Is war essentially their only resort, basically, third world war?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:59.200
 I think their plan is to use the military to control the basket of deplorables.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.880
 Us basically?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.080
 Mm-hmm.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.320
 Okay.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.280
 So it will turn, just like you said, the Shah of Iran basically will be brutal dictatorship,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:14.240
 the so-called Western world, and then food will be rationed or non-existent altogether?

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.440
 That's kind of where things are going?

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440
 Yeah.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:24.920
 If you're a well-behaving robot, then your bank account will show enough for food.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.540
 Okay.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.160
 So we were talking about that a little bit before we hit the record button.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.360
 I think people really don't like when we talk about this stuff, but don't offer any type

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.360
 of solution.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.680
 And so we kind of understand the chess pieces that are being put in place in terms of a

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.360
 digital ID and not being able to obtain food.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.100
 And so I guess, how are you inoculating yourself from those types of things?

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:53.960
 Or what would you tell other people to maybe think about?

00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:00.960
 Digital people on the internet are giving instructions on how to make your own food,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:09.320
 if necessary, growing it in your windowsill and on your roof and front yard instead of

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.080
 a lawn and so on.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.440
 And are there, from your point of view, are there things you could grow that are calorically

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:22.680
 dense enough to really make a dent in a person's diet, I guess?

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:34.520
 Because really on a moderate plot of land, some of the fairly high-calorie root vegetables.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.720
 And just, I know we've talked about it before, but to run through them, like sugar, maybe

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.920
 buying gelatin, ghee, what else?

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:50.960
 Yeah, it's good to have a few years of that stuff stored up.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.640
 We get a few beehives for them to produce honey.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:03.880
 Yeah, if you have nearby vegetation that they can eat.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.960
 Do you think they'll allow, again, I'm asking you to speculate here, but do you think they'll

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.040
 allow the cities to just become completely chaotic?

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.600
 Like a lot of those, maybe the Fabian Society, they have a motto of "order through chaos."

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.600
 And so how crazy do you think they would let it get?

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:32.880
 I think the police have the resources to keep everything, a lot of dead dissenters and other

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880
 things peaceful.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.840
 Okay, well, we can move on here unless, Georgi, you have other questions.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.280
 But what, we didn't talk really about the vaccine stuff last episode, and so a lot has

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.120
 transpired I think since then.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.680
 And so you're probably familiar with them more than I am, but haven't some major landmark

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.640
 studies come out saying that something we've been talking about probably since the beginning,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.520
 that the spike protein would not be localized, that it would venture into every part of the

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.640
 body and cause harm?

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.200
 Is there anything you've learned since the last two months ago, last time we talked,

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.680
 that is interesting about the vaccines?

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:25.040
 The weight of the evidence is that Bhakdi and Yeadon were essentially right, that it isn't

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:39.280
 just a temporary risk of death, but that it's a very prolonged, maybe lifelong or transgenerational

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.320
 risk of degenerative disease and death.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.760
 Did you see the new studies of the deadly hepatitis in children?

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.720
 I didn't get that.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.160
 Over the last week, there have been news from all over the world, actually, from multiple

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:07.080
 countries about the identification of a worrying rise of cases of hepatitis in children of

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:13.160
 unknown origin and basically it's so severe that about half of the children require liver

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.680
 transplants and some children have already died.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:30.880
 No organ is exempt and autopsies, not very many, but extremely clear evidence, macroscopic

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:41.800
 evidence in the autopsies of continued presence of the spike protein months and up to a year

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:56.480
 after the vaccine and evidence that they died of the vaccine with remote organs, the blood

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:13.840
 vessels being infected by the spike RNA produced the antigen spike and the immune system kills

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:22.120
 the lining of the blood vessels that are infected and so there's a prolonged, maybe lifelong

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:31.080
 attack of the immune system against your own blood vessels leading to clots and having

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:43.720
 microscopic or macroscopic clots in the various vessels can create a wide variety of very

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.960
 nasty diseases.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.680
 Are you familiar with the condition Kawasaki disease?

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.320
 Not very familiar, but I know it's a clotting disorder.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:02.080
 Yeah, it's a chronic inflammation of the blood vessels and basically the cases of this

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.400
 have been rapidly rising again over the last two years and they're claiming they don't

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.160
 know what's causing it.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.240
 Do you think the vaccines are capable of causing that?

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:22.680
 I think any vaccine is capable of causing it, just injecting aluminum hydroxide affects

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.680
 the brain.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:34.120
 The particles travel not just into the bloodstream, but up the nerve axons into the brain cells

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:42.240
 themselves modifying the brain so that the brain creates ongoing inflammation.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:49.000
 Kind of a weird question, but do you think the vaccines are more effective than the ruling

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.120
 elite thought or less effective?

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:15.840
 Probably more effective than they imagined in their design in the sense of killing people.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:25.000
 And you think that multi-schedule thing is to obscure the harm that they're doing?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.840
 Or are you saying that whole mechanism is kind of a slow death or it's going to accelerate

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.440
 any age-related problem the person happens?

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.480
 That's why it's a little bit ambiguous what specifically is going to happen to a person

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.760
 when they get one of those?

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:50.400
 If you look at the newest information, both from the UK and some coming out of the US,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:23:02.560
 the more shots a person has, the more likely they are to die or be hospitalized or be infected.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:11.680
 One group of studies showed that with the two shots and a booster, you were twice as

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:16.280
 likely to die or be hospitalized.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:27.000
 The others in the UK show a three-fold increase in those serious outcomes for having the booster

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 shot.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 What do you think of the data coming out of the UK and Germany showing the potential that

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.960
 vaccines may cause vaccine-induced AIDS or VAIDS as they call it?

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.000
 I haven't seen those.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Do you think they have the potential of causing chronic immune deficiency?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:06.440
 Yeah, chronic immune arousal is at the same time causing deficient defective immunity.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.160
 So the body will be busy attacking its own inflamed tissues instead of being capable

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.720
 of handling a new infection from an unknown virus?

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:28.280
 Yeah, autoimmune people are an example, sort of mild example of what is probably happening

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.520
 to the mass of the vaccinated people.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.560
 Ray, you've been interacting with the public for a long time.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.920
 Are you finding it harder and harder to do that, maybe since people are cumulatively

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920
 becoming more crazy?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.840
 I would say people are becoming dumber.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.040
 Let's just be blunt about it.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:55.080
 Has that been especially difficult, maybe this year or last year?

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.960
 I'm getting more emails than ever before.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:08.720
 And the extreme fanatics have stopped sending me threatening letters.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.800
 Maybe they got vaccinated.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.440
 Maybe the vaccine did do something good after all.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:24.280
 I know you said it provides you information and orientation, but it doesn't take a toll

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.920
 on you or something like that, communicating with totally crazy people?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.120
 Or do you feel like it's your duty because you critique the culture so you should support

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.400
 people and their fight against it?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.280
 Or how do you feel about the whole thing?

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:49.320
 As far as I can, I try to give them any available insight or support.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:55.000
 But even when that insight is immediately turned around and posted on a forum and disregarded

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.240
 or something, I guess you could care less about what people are saying on the internet.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:11.680
 How do you constructively use your time, given that it's so easy to spiral out of control

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.040
 or to be depressed about the whole situation?

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:30.800
 I keep working to some extent on things I've been interested in for many years, mainly

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:47.520
 in the idea of ordering principles, the physics of life and potential.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:53.840
 And I almost never talk about that because people don't often ask me.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:06.480
 But I'm paying more and more attention to physical questions and what the possibilities

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:16.520
 are suggested by some of these eccentric physical ideas.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:25.840
 So for you, your work is the guiding principle of your life?

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.240
 Your work, what you feel like you need to accomplish.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:41.000
 Yeah, it's all one piece, whether it's biology or physics or ideas about consciousness.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Georgi, interrupt me at any time, we only have an hour with Ray today so we're going

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.320
 to cut it pretty short here.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.360
 But I have kind of a, I don't know if this is maybe a fun question, but Ray, if a germ-free

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:01.000
 rat, who would win in a battle of enduring stress between a germ-free rat and an EFA

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.800
 essential fatty acid so-called deficient rat?

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.800
 Who do you think would win that?

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.160
 Oh, I've heard of EFA deficient.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.160
 And why do you think that?

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:29.880
 The experiments that have been done, the germ-free live longer, healthier, but they don't have

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:38.240
 the powerful stress resistance that the fatty acid deficient rats have.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.360
 Is there something that can bind with and deactivate PUFA?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360
 Well, it's in the bloodstream.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:49.920
 I think you mentioned vitamin E once, I think it was Selye's idea or Broda Barnes's, I forget.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.360
 But is there any substance that can actually bind with those fatty acids and make them

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.760
 less harmful?

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.160
 Not in the blood, I think.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:06.000
 It has to be the liver and kidneys excreting them.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.400
 Right, but I'm saying, so in terms of, we cannot really saturate them on demand while

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.600
 they're floating around in the blood or binding them in a way that basically prevents them

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.860
 from doing their damage.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.840
 This is only done in specific organs.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:32.640
 So far, it's only intestinal or rumen bacteria using vitamin E that can do that.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640
 Okay.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:40.280
 Do you think it's feasible to develop something that, there are now drugs on the market that

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.400
 inhibit the absorption of all fats from the intestine.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.400
 Is there, do you think it would be possible to develop something that targets specifically

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.040
 the less saturated fats?

00:29:51.040 --> 00:30:00.160
 Oh, yeah, I'm sure that would be possible because they have a greater tendency to absorb

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.640
 at certain surfaces.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:12.000
 Again moving on subjects here, but I was watching a documentary on the cartels producing fentanyl

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.760
 and I thought of your, what is it Ray, the Biological Balance and Addiction newsletter

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.520
 you wrote many years ago.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.320
 And so I was thinking about the fentanyl, like what, is that having an anti-stress effect

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:27.240
 that makes people very addicted to it?

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:34.240
 And then maybe just explain your view of what happens when somebody becomes, like using

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.280
 this in parentheses, but like addicted to a substance.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.320
 What in your view that meaning behind that would be?

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:56.960
 Some of this sense of freedom from social pain, a family that says they're worthless

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:03.920
 or a society that makes them feel worthless.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:15.120
 They can just go into a dreamy state under the influence of morphine for example.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:30.600
 But that is imitating in some ways the euphoria that good steroid hormones should be producing.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:41.680
 And so part of the predisposition to use the drugs is that the stressful social conditions

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:55.040
 they're in are turning up their harmful hormones and suppressing their own progesterone, DHEA

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.000
 and pregnenolone.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:08.640
 And that was how I found out that pregnenolone can help people withdraw pretty quickly from

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.240
 the opiates.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.160
 Quick question about pregnenolone.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.200
 Why do you think no pharma company so far has tried to develop pregnenolone or at least

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:27.400
 use it or even in medicine as a sort of like the mother of all hormone replacement therapies?

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.360
 I mean if it's the precursor for all of them, wouldn't something like a transdermal cream

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:39.680
 or a suppository or some other kind of a product that basically contains pregnenolone be able

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.440
 to replace all of these other HRTs that are trying to sell to the public?

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.560
 Was there ever an attempt earlier in the 20th century to do that or they never tried it?

00:32:50.560 --> 00:33:02.480
 In the early 1950s, there were studies showing that it's much better than cortisone or cortisol

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.640
 for the uses.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:11.400
 Those have anti-inflammatory and so on.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:21.360
 But its role in the system makes it even worse than progesterone.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:34.040
 Progesterone cures essentially everything, trauma, all of the degenerative and stress-related

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.520
 diseases.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:48.360
 And it's hormonally more powerful than pregnenolone, but pregnenolone has the same position in

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.440
 the system.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:59.200
 When you take other hormones, the body's production of that hormone decreases.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:07.360
 But in the case of progesterone and pregnenolone, those substances support the body's production

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:15.480
 of more up to their ability to make more.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:24.560
 So if you're deficient in progesterone, sometimes a single dose or two can activate your body

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:34.600
 to return to normal production if you have the thyroid, vitamin A, and cholesterol needed.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:40.960
 And to a degree, the same situation with pregnenolone.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:54.600
 It stabilizes the damaged mitochondria and makes it possible for your cells to organize

00:34:54.600 --> 00:35:03.120
 energy production and more pregnenolone and progesterone production.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:17.760
 The drug companies first realized that the progesterone and DHEA were terrible drugs

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.240
 because they tend to cure diseases.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:33.800
 And the effects of pregnenolone, there are no recognized hormonal effects.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:45.200
 But if you have enough of it, in experiments, a rat, for example, would be given 10 grams

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:58.160
 per rat per dose of pregnenolone with no harmful effects except to stop stress hormone production.

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:10.440
 And so pregnenolone is a relatively expensive material if you supplement it adequately.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:23.640
 But since it isn't patentable, those three steroids are something that it's just a matter

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:31.920
 of the cost of producing them and marketing them.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:41.360
 They could essentially cure most of the current diseases if they were made available massively

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.600
 and cheaply.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.800
 But that doesn't interest the drug companies because they don't have patents.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.760
 So I guess my question was, was pregnenolone ever considered by the drug companies even

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:56.160
 before they realized it's going to basically destroy their business?

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.360
 But was there ever a publication or a conference that you were aware of that a doctor stood

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.040
 up and said, "Hey, instead of giving all these people these individual hormones, here

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:10.480
 we have pregnenolone," which seems to be the rate-limiting step to synthesizing everything

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.480
 else.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.840
 "Why bother trying to calculate this optimal dosage for, I don't know, estrogen or testosterone,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.840
 cortisol?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.840
 Let's give everybody pregnenolone."

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.040
 Was there ever a movement discussing this?

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.960
 No.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:36.400
 There was a symposium in 1950 that revealed the curative effects of pregnenolone and progesterone.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:49.200
 But right in that same symposium, following an article on how I think it was progesterone

00:37:49.200 --> 00:38:00.520
 massive amounts was causing cervical cancer to disappear, that same journal published

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:11.680
 an article on treating cancer with estrogen and their own data showed that estrogen caused

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:21.000
 the cancer to become worse and they concluded that estrogen has great promise as a cancer

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.120
 therapy.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:37.040
 The data pharmacologists and the research community was intelligent enough to know that

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:43.920
 a drug that could cure a disease but not be patented was worthless.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:52.400
 Was there a symposium in Mexico where Sally, I think, had a presentation?

00:38:52.400 --> 00:39:00.240
 I think it was published with Abraham White, I think, was the editor.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.680
 Yeah, I have that in a PDF.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.000
 I think it was in Mexico and there are a few studies on pregnenolone that were presented

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.560
 at that symposium.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.640
 I hate to bring it back to the Russia stuff, but I did think this last time and want to

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.640
 bring it up.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:18.480
 I think a lot of, at least for myself, I'm trying to figure out what's going on and I

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.160
 peruse my news sources to try to figure out what's going on in Ukraine, Russia, etc.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.360
 But Ray, in Mind and Tissue, you're talking about one of the themes of Russian culture

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.600
 has been that of the potential to waiting to be fulfilled, Russia waiting to lead the

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.520
 world into a spiritual awakening, the spiritual richness of peasants, etc.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.920
 And so what I'm trying to point out is that when was this book, you published this when

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.040
 I was born, I think in 1985, and so for you this...

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.320
 Oh, no, I wrote that in 1973.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.400
 Oh, well, even better.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.720
 So anyways, you're like a Russian scholar, you know, you've been thinking about Russia

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:03.080
 for a very long time, and so you didn't just consume some news source that taught you how

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080
 to think about this.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.720
 And so for you, have you been thinking that this was going to happen for a long time,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.840
 this empire clash, and it's just kind of crazy that you're living through it?

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:27.120
 It was just sort of a vague suspicion 50 years ago, but that's what you infer from reading

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:44.960
 people like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy and the psychologists, that they see a certain spiritual,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:56.720
 psychological, cultural attitude as being necessary to save the world.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:02.520
 And then the West is like beyond rehabilitation, or maybe nothing is beyond rehabilitation,

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:04.360
 but it seems extremely unlikely.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:09.840
 And so maybe Russia is a chance for a future of humanity?

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:26.600
 Yeah, exactly, because through the way Christianity reached Russia, they didn't make the fundamental

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:34.240
 mistakes about the nature of reality and the nature of human being.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:49.800
 And the West is so committed to a kind of individualistic, random management of the

00:41:49.800 --> 00:42:01.880
 physical world that the mental, spiritual world doesn't rest on any kind of real cosmology.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:06.560
 Okay, I'm going to let you go in a second here, but I want to do this advertisement.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.560
 So you can purchase your newsletter, there was a price change, right?

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.760
 It's $36 for 12 issues now?

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:17.600
 Or $10 for four.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.560
 And you can email that price to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.800
 And are you just backlogged with tons of people asking for these?

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:36.520
 Yeah, it takes sometimes a few weeks to even get an order acknowledged.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.520
 Good to know.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.600
 And then they can order all your books through the same email.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.640
 And then Progesti from Keenogen, you can email Catherine to purchase@keenogen@gmail.com.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:51.280
 Each bottle contains 3,400 milligrams of progesterone.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.600
 And Ray, something I really appreciate that you did is you wrote like a little, I don't

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:59.000
 know, like a snippet of how to use or your thoughts on progesterone for men.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 And so what was it?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.080
 Was that just you got so many questions and inspired you to write that?

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.560
 That wasn't like a newsletter, right?

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.440
 No, it was just a page.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.440
 I thought it was really useful.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.840
 And I kind of posted it everywhere.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.720
 I hope you don't mind that I did that.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.240
 That was very useful and I think it clarified things for a lot of people.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.560
 So I appreciate you doing that.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.120
 And so, okay, let's wrap up here.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.480
 And Ray, just let us know what you're working on for next.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:32.400
 Oh, the last newsletter was on cancer.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:45.240
 And I'm going to fill in some of the background of that around some of the messenger substances

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:58.640
 that can be controlled to some extent to even actually not just preventing cancer, but if

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:06.200
 you do it in a highly supportive way, even sometimes redress cancer.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200
 Amazing.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.080
 That was a fast hour.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.360
 Thank you so much for joining us.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360
 Really appreciate it.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.680
 And again, guys, we have an hour with Ray and we're not going to exceed that.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.240
 Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.120
 I thought we covered a lot of ground.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.600
 Really appreciate you, Ray.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.680
 And stay on the line here and we'll end the show.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.320
 Guys, thank you so much for watching.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.400
 We have an amazing audience.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400
 Really appreciate you guys.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.920
 We'll be back probably two weeks from now.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.920
 Thanks again.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920
 Have a safe weekend and we'll talk to you guys soon.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.920
 Okay.
