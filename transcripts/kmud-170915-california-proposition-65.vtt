00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 Well once again welcome and thank you for tuning in to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.640
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.400
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show before, we have a very special

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.200
 guest speaker with us, Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.200
 There is the odd occasion where people have called in and they've never heard him before,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.400
 but I know a lot of people that are listening to the show are listening purely to glimpse

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.520
 some of his insights because I know he's always got a different answer for things.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.520
 The number here if you're in the area is 707-986-923-3911 or there's an 800 number for people outside

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.960
 the area code which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.440
 From 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.080
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of Cal Prop 65, California's Proposition

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.080
 65.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.340
 I started very briefly towards the end of July's show saying I wanted to bring out some

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.160
 inconsistencies or incongruencies with Prop 65 in the legislature in California and we'll

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.760
 be bringing Dr. Peat on here in probably 10 or 15 minutes.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 I wanted to outline some specific testing that we've done personally for products as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.260
 part of GMP protocol for ICP-MS testing of metals and specifically for the California

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.980
 Proposition 65 metals which are arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.220
 So what I wanted to start with was the 1986 California voters approved initiative to address

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.520
 their growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals and that initiative became the Safe

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.220
 Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 better known by its original name of

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 Prop 65.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.460
 Now Prop 65 requires the state to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.940
 or birth defects or other reproductive harm.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.860
 This list which must be updated at least once a year has grown to include approximately

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.180
 800 chemicals since it was first published in 1987 and Prop 65 requires businesses to

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 notify Californians about significant amounts of chemicals in the products they purchase

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.780
 in their homes or workplaces or that are released into the environment.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.180
 By providing this information Prop 65 enables Californians to make informed decisions about

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.960
 protecting themselves from exposure to these chemicals and Prop 65 also prohibits California

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.360
 businesses from knowingly discharging significant amounts of listed chemicals into sources of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.360
 drinking water.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.360
 Hooray you say.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.380
 The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, the OEHHA, as only these acronyms

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.780
 can be so stupendously long, administers the Prop 65 program.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.080
 OEHHA which is part of the California Environmental Protection Agency also evaluates all currently

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.860
 available scientific information on substances considered for placement on the Prop 65 list.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.020
 Now two months ago and the month prior to that, it was June, May, June and July, we

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.200
 did a program with Dr. Peat on progesterone explaining how the marginalization and demonization

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.980
 if you like actually of progesterone is completely wrong and how the scientific evidence to put

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.420
 it on the Prop 65 list was completely erroneous and there are very very innocuous products

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.800
 that are on the Prop 65 list that you probably have never never heard of or never imagined

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 could be on there.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.880
 But Prop 65 labels are just becoming increasingly apparent in stores especially in the supplement

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 departments.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 We walk the aisles of the supplement departments and take a look at whatever products you're

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.720
 looking at for alternative health care and you often find these small Prop 65 labels

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.160
 stuck on the bottles just purely saying that the products may contain chemicals known to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.560
 the state of California to cause reproductive harm or cancer and as we'll find out it's

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.480
 a lot of litigation here.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.600
 It's not really factual and I'm going to bring out some very striking incongruencies here.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.920
 Now a chemical can either be listed if either of two independent committees or scientists

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.800
 and health professionals find that the chemical is being clearly shown to cause cancer or

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.760
 birth defects or other reproductive harm and these two committees, the Carcinogen Identification

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.800
 Committee, the CIC and a Developmental and Reproductive Toxicant Identification, this

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.240
 is the DART, they're part of OHHAS's Science Advisory Board.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.880
 The committee members are appointed by the governor and are designated as the state's

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.720
 qualified experts and these are experts for evaluating chemicals under Prop 65.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.480
 When determining whether a chemical should be placed on the list the committees base

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.960
 their decision on the most current scientific information available and the OHHAS staff

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.920
 scientists compile all relevant scientific evidence on various chemicals for the committees

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920
 to review.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.920
 The committees also consider comments from the public before making their decisions.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920
 So that's the first way.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.800
 The second way for a chemical to be listed is if an organisation designated as an authoritative

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.360
 body by the CIC or DART, the Identification Committee, has identified it as causing cancer

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.600
 or birth defects or other reproductive harm.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.540
 The following organisations have been designated as authoritative bodies, the US Environmental

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.320
 Protection Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration, National Institute for Occupational Safety

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.400
 and Health, the National Toxicology Programme and the International Agency for Research

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 on Cancer.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.200
 The third way for a chemical to be listed is if an agency of the state or federal government

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.340
 requires that it be labelled or identified as causing cancer or birth defects or other

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.680
 reproductive harm.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.800
 Now most chemicals listed in this manner are prescription drugs that are required by the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.080
 US FDA contain warnings relating to cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.520
 We've seen plenty of drugs like that.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.400
 Now the fourth way requires the listing of chemicals meeting certain scientific criteria

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.600
 and identified in the California Labour Code as causing cancer or birth defects or other

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.760
 reproductive harm.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.720
 And this method established the initial chemical list following voter approval of Prop 65 in

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.760
 1986 and continues to be used as the basis for listing as appropriate.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760
 Now how about this?

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.400
 Businesses with less than 10 employees and government agencies are exempt from Proposition

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.760
 65 warning requirements and prohibition on discharges into water drinking sources.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.120
 OK, did you catch that?

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.420
 So if your business has less than 10 employees or you're a government agency, you're completely

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.560
 exempt from discharging waste into drinking water and the relevant Prop 65 warnings.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.660
 So Proposition 65's warning requirement has provided, on the upside, an incentive for

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.800
 manufacturers to remove listed chemicals from their products.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.680
 For example, trichloroethylene, which causes cancer, is no longer used in most correction

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.760
 fluids for wiping out type.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.520
 Reformulated paint strippers do not contain the carcinogen methylene chloride and toluene,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.560
 which causes birth defects or other reproductive harm, has been removed from many nail care

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560
 products.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.160
 In addition, the Prop 65 enforcement action prompted manufacturers to decrease the lead

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.760
 content in ceramic tableware and wineries to eliminate the use of lead-containing foil

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.080
 caps on wine bottles.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.120
 So whilst the Prop has some very positive benefits, it drastically needs reframing within

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.600
 a realistic criteria.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.480
 How can a business with fewer than 10 employees be exempt from a legislation that would sue

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.780
 a larger company producing the same product?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.640
 And how is it that commonly available foodstuffs are far over the maximum reliable daily limit

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.120
 currently in place and legislated for by Prop 65?

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.040
 It seems the only winners from Proposition 65 are the attorneys who bring the lawsuits,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.000
 and there are some additional facts that are not so commonly known.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.720
 Now, chief amongst these are, since Californians have been warned of possible carcinogens for

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.520
 the past 27 years, one would expect to see a decline in cancer rates compared to those

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.440
 states that didn't adopt similar right-to-know laws.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.200
 In fact, no such decline exists.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.360
 There isn't a single medical study that demonstrates any public health benefits of Proposition

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.400
 65, and there is no evidence that Prop 65 has lowered cancer incidence amongst Californians.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400
 Most startling.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.200
 Proposition 65 has been a bonanza for the bounty hunter law firms that drive such lawsuits

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.880
 using paid plaintiffs.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:39.440
 Between 2000 and 2011, there were 2,381 settlements that cost targets nearly $180 million, exclusive

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.920
 of plaintiffs' legal costs and court costs.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.400
 Sadly, the systematic legalized abuses surrounding Prop 65 have resulted in all too real economic

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.560
 effects on individuals as well as their employers.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.720
 Our workers suffer lower income or job security in affected businesses, and the California

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.520
 government has had to spend taxpayer money for administrative and court costs relating

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520
 to the law.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.920
 So let's look at some real-world examples of actual values for some Prop 65 chemicals

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.340
 that I've personal experience working with, and being GMP-compliant, we have to periodically

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.080
 test our products for the so-called California Big Four.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.080
 So these are, as I said, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.080
 How do we do this?

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.080
 The most common process now is called ICP-MS.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.920
 It's inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and one of the most sophisticated technologies

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.520
 to date, to quantify components to detect levels down to three parts per billion.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.600
 So typically a PPB, part per billion, quantification is what's used, and typically that detection

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.360
 limit is about four parts per billion, as low as it can go.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.280
 It may well change as time goes on and technology improves, but certainly much more sophisticated

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.000
 than the previous calibrations for it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Now Prop 65 components of natural medicinal herbs which are tested by ICP-MS include,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.560
 as I said, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.160
 Now for above-ground foliage, the analysis shows typical ranges in the low teens to 60s

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.000
 of parts per billion, not of mercury typically, but for cadmium, arsenic, and lead.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.320
 Sub-analysis, typical ranges mid-twenties to hundreds, depending on the location grown

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.320
 and the species.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.600
 Now I'll just give you a quote here from some before and after extraction results that we've

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 done personally.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:22.160
 We'd purchase a product, we would spot check it for confirmation of a vendor certificate,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.880
 send it off and get an ICP-MS analysis for it.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.440
 Once the product's cleared QC and has been produced, that extract is also then sent off

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.680
 for ICP-MS analysis and then we can see what kind of product we've produced or what the

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.400
 extraction process has done for the metals that may have been present in the raw material.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.880
 So turmeric root, have a think about that will you?

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.440
 Lots of people eat turmeric for its health benefits.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.520
 It's documented anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity are published and have been known

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.720
 for some time, especially in Ayurvedic medicine.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.960
 Now the quantity, typical quantity in raw root was as follows.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:03.520
 Arsenic 395 parts per billion, cadmium 41.9, lead 646 and fortunately mercury was undetected.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.200
 So after extraction, the liquid extract was retested and came back with the following

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200
 report.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.240
 Arsenic 68.1, cadmium undetected, lead 6.6, mercury undetected.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.160
 Another fairly common herb, Lobelia.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.640
 Arsenic was 43.9, cadmium 79.6, lead 357 and mercury 10.2.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.840
 Now after extraction, the liquid extract was retested and came back with the following

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.240
 report where all the tested elements were actually below the detection limit.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.200
 And then Echinacea root, people are very familiar with Echinacea.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.200
 The arsenic there was 115 and the cadmium came back at 20.5 and the lead was 17.3 and

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.280
 mercury in that sample was undetected.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.080
 And then after extraction, the liquid extract was retested and came back with the following

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.120
 report arsenic 5.9, cadmium, lead and mercury undetected.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.620
 In fact, in all of the ICP-MS testing that we've done, which is extensive, extraction

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.900
 produces a 5 to 10 fold and above removal of any existing raw material components listed

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.580
 by Prop 65 and resulting in the maximum allowable daily limits, which are well within Prop 65's

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.560
 legislatively directed values.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.680
 In many cases, the raw material would fall outside the allowable exposure.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.900
 But what I really want to point out was the foodstuffs we had tested.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.080
 So crab, we had crab tested and this is local crab here from Sheldacove on the Pacific coast

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.080
 here.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.520
 So crab, arsenic came back at 12,400.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.680
 So previous herbs would be things like 395, 43 and 115.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.880
 The crab was 12,400.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.840
 Now when I spoke to the scientists at the lab that tested this, they did offer the consolation

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:38.420
 that this arsenic was not potentially a toxic product and that they could do specific speciation

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:44.240
 for this to find out whether or not the actual amount of toxic arsenic was as high as it

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.240
 looked like.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.080
 So anyway, the cadmium was 10.4.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.720
 The lead was 10.3 and mercury was 109, 109 parts per billion mercury.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:57.880
 Now this vastly exceeds the maximum allowable daily limits set by Prop 65, given you conceivably

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.920
 consume 8 to 10 ounces of crab in one serving compared with a half teaspoon dose of extract

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.000
 taken one to three times per day.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.320
 Now how about this, cod.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.520
 We tested cod and the cod came back with an arsenic count of 115.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.900
 Actually the cadmium was less than 9.4.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.420
 The lead came back at 30.3 and mercury was 473 parts per billion.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.680
 So eating a 12 ounce portion of this would give you way higher exposure to methylmercury,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.480
 the most toxic and abundant oceanic form that we get exposed to.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.840
 Okay, but it gets worse.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.640
 Halibut, we tested some halibut.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.640
 Arsenic was 602.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.640
 Cadmium, it was down to 9.2.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.000
 The lead was 23 and mercury was 794 parts per billion.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.420
 Again with a serving amount typically of 8 to 10 ounces.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.200
 So the last thing I did was for seafood was salmon.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.160
 There was a young fish, it was about a nine pound fish, so it was quite a small one.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.840
 And obviously we'll get into the whole predation thing and the food chain accumulation, et

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.240
 cetera, which became pretty evident.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.240
 So this nine pound fish came in slightly better with these values.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.960
 Arsenic was 428, cadmium 10.1, lead was less than 10.1, mercury was 72.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.360
 So still with a much higher MADL set by Prop 65, whichever way you cut it.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.440
 So legislation for dietary supplement manufacturers imposes stringent maximum allowable daily

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.640
 limits set by Prop 65 values, which pale into insignificance when compared to seafood, for

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.640
 example.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.600
 Now we also tested some elk meat, which had been hunted and it was not surprising that

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600
 it was very clean.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.680
 Now the only detectable component was arsenic and it had a value of 64.7, but lead, mercury

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680
 and cadmium were undetected.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.960
 So I just wanted to say that terrestrial roots and foliage crops naturally sequester minerals

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.800
 found in a rock, which form the soil in which they grow.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.080
 And pollution in industrial countries that's airborne finds its way back to the soil by

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.440
 being washed out in rains or as fallout from airborne particulates heavier than air, characterizing

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.040
 Asian or Indian farm products subjected to the conditions reminiscent of the era of industrialization

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040
 in Europe.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.360
 The products I mentioned were all certified organic, by the way.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.760
 Now terrestrial and oceanic life grazing on foliage or consuming other animals sequester

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.200
 these accumulated products.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.240
 And the higher up the food chain, the higher the value in the animal as seen from our experiments.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.800
 Now the whole point is the meaning of any initiative like Prop 65 to save us from harm

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.680
 has to be weighed both by the freedoms lost as a result of government being in charge

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.200
 to look after us, rather than we the people as a self-governing body with practical and

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.520
 reasonable jurisprudence, not dictated by our control for higher bounty hunters, but

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.480
 by common sense, which seems to have gone the way of the dinosaurs.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.840
 Now I know when I'd spoken to Dr. Peat preparing some of the material for two months ago, looking

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.760
 at progesterone, that progesterone was on the Prop 65 list.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:41.600
 And we went through the science and the committee papers that were used as "evidence" for suspecting

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:48.640
 progesterone as a mitogen or as a cancer promoter, when actually Dr. Peat is very familiar with

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.440
 the whole progesterone tobacco and having studied hormones, especially progesterone

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.440
 as one of his thesis past his PhD.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.160
 So Dr. Peat, are you on here?

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.200
 OK, well, sorry to have blathered on here for 20 minutes with what I was first talking

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200
 about.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:11.760
 But in terms of Proposition 65 and its actual effects to the consumer, don't you think that

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.920
 some of this is a little bit out of control in terms of writing laws for it and giving

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:25.200
 amounts which they say, they clearly say, that they're using a 1,000 times safety factor?

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.800
 So I know for progesterone that you're very aware of how maligned it was and there was

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.720
 absolutely no real evidence for it because the test that they did on the beagles, etc.,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.160
 was really pretty poor scientific process.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:44.800
 But in terms of Prop 65, do you have any thoughts on it in terms of how it affects people or

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.080
 what you think the government are doing?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.080
 Well, the way the committee is set up...

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.960
 Dr. Peat, could you speak up a bit?

00:15:51.960 --> 00:16:00.800
 People in charge of choosing the evidence are appointed and they are basically able

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.200
 to lobby for products that they're associated with.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.440
 When I was in contact with the agency about 10 years ago, three of the members were from

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.200
 a single university.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.400
 These three all had conflicts of interest.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:25.440
 One woman was a representative of a company developing transdermal products, including

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440
 hormones.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:33.160
 Two of the people were connected with the development of a new approach to birth control

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.760
 which involves the suppression of progesterone.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.560
 The articles that were chosen, supposedly all relevant evidence relating to the carcinogenicity

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.480
 of a substance are to be considered.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:54.720
 Fewer than 1% of the articles relating to progesterone and cancer were even listed.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:00.240
 And of those, two of them were about a totally different substance, a carcinogenic synthetic

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.520
 progestin.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:08.800
 And one of the articles that they cited as evidence of the carcinogenicity of the actual

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:17.240
 substance progesterone was actually someone's attempt to refute a famous publication showing

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.800
 that progesterone prevents and cures cancer.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:28.400
 And this publication was used explicitly a method that the one they were trying to refute,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.920
 a method that they said previously didn't work at all.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.360
 So they used a known false method to supposedly invalidate the evidence showing that progesterone

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:44.400
 cures cancer and that was listed by the committee as evidence that progesterone causes cancer.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.520
 It was like the people were basically drunk when they were choosing the papers.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.880
 I asked the chairman of the committee for the names of the people who made those crazy

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:02.680
 choices of evidence and she said they were too busy to give me that information.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:09.400
 My impression was that it was not really a regulatory agency in public interest.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.520
 It was a promoting product.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.280
 On a pay-for-view basis.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280
 Yeah.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:22.000
 And the university that these people worked for, I looked at their research support.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.800
 I forget the number, many, there were dozens of grants promoting arguments.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.720
 Which gave the impression that estrogen was therapeutic for many different things.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.200
 And I looked for how much they had on progesterone.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:43.400
 They had two or three research grants which were aimed to show that progesterone was harmful.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:51.840
 And this was 10 years ago, just three years after the Women's International Health Study

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:59.440
 showed that the combination of estrogen and synthetic progesterone caused cancer, stroke,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.400
 dementia, heart disease, blood clots and with...

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.600
 Would you be able to get a little closer to the microphone or the phone?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.920
 I think the engineer is trying to tell me that you're coming in very quietly.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.920
 Okay.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:20.000
 The result of that study, Women's International Health Study, showed that those negative results

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:29.680
 resulted in an extreme rejection by women of the use of that combination of synthetic

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.640
 progesterone and estrogen.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:39.160
 And there was an 80% decrease in the use of that particular prescription form of progesterone

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.480
 plus estrogen with the loss to...

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.080
 One company lost billions in sales.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.920
 Everyone invested in promoting estrogen, especially with the synthetic progesterone.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:00.440
 Their main profit-making product being becoming very unpopular.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:07.080
 And suddenly, at the same time when estrogen sales were falling, progesterone sales had

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.160
 increased 100-fold.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:16.920
 And suddenly, money became available to research progesterone as a toxic substance.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:23.080
 And since that time, since the early years right after the study came out, there has

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:31.000
 been just a flood of people researching progesterone as a brain toxin, a carcinogen and so on.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.640
 When you examine each one of these, they're doing things known previously to produce the

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.560
 results look bad.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:45.880
 For example, progesterone is known to reverse a brain tumor.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:53.240
 They were using about 100 times smaller dose and claiming that it caused the tumor and

00:20:53.240 --> 00:21:00.240
 finding changes in breast tissue that they said was associated with breast cancer to

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.200
 distract attention from the studies that showed that it reversed and prevented breast cancer.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:11.280
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Europe, Dr. Ron K. Medea, Garboville 91.1 FM from 7.30,

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.160
 that's now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.200
 You're invited to call in any questions related or unrelated to this month's discussion here

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.760
 of CalProp 65 and its effects and also we'll be, like I said, opening up for questions

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.120
 that don't have to be surrounded.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.880
 And I do have some questions that have been previously written that I want to ask Dr.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.120
 Peat about his feedback.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:37.600
 So Dr. Peat, I guess not to labor the CalProp 65 thing anymore other than to just explain

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.880
 that there certainly is a, isn't it the way always in government, no, there's certainly

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:49.240
 interested parties for and against certain things happening and obviously collusion between

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.080
 companies especially when there's plenty of money involved to protect vested interests.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.760
 But I think if people ever wanted to find out more about this, and I mentioned this

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:05.920
 on the last radio show that Dr. Carla Rottenberg's PhD dissertation was basically exposing all

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:12.160
 of the bad evidence, all the bad scientific, supposedly scientific reasons for which we're

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.640
 given that progesterone was to be deemed fit for the list.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.840
 I was actually very inconsistent and she clearly outlines the mistakes that were made.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.880
 But like anything else in big government, I think it's just extremely difficult to get

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.640
 it to change, just like trying to change the direction of an oil tanker once it's moving

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640
 in a certain direction.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.640
 It takes a long time.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.520
 It's taken how many years here to get people to stop, well hopefully stop consuming liquid

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.800
 oils and recognize the fact that the brainwashing surrounding saturated fats is actually very

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.280
 wrong and that people are actually much better off using saturated fats.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.960
 It's probably taken 50 or 60 years.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.400
 But anyway, we have a caller on the air.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.680
 So let's take this first caller.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.240
 Call away from and what's your question?

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240
 Hi there.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240
 My name's Ali.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240
 I'm from Calgary, Alberta.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240
 Okay, hi.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.120
 My question is, well, basically a few years ago I developed symptoms of success, such

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.280
 as like hirsutism and my voice actually got a lot lower.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.400
 And then about a year after the onset of these traits, I decided to supplement with progesterone

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.240
 after reading Ray Peat's writing.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.880
 Well, this hormone, it did work wonders for many symptoms.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.480
 However, my voice never went back to normal and a few other things never went back to

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.480
 normal.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.560
 And it actually also caused extreme irritability.

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.560
 So anyway, my question is basically, do you think it's possible to get my singing voice

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.440
 back to where I can sing high notes easily again?

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.440
 How old are you first?

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.440
 Did you say?

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.440
 So I'm 23.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.440
 23, okay.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.960
 So where is it possible to get your high notes back again?

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.760
 Because that's one of the main things that have been troubling you that hasn't returned

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.760
 is your, you say your voice has deepened.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.560
 Yeah, but, and my singing teacher actually told me that too.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.120
 Like my voice dropped like eight notes or something like that, even my singing voice

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.560
 or my speaking voice, sorry.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560
 Okay.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:58.720
 Well, her speaking voice doesn't sound as masculinized as many women that I've known

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:07.200
 who use androgens by prescription or just who had an ovarian problem with excess androgen

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.200
 production.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:14.880
 They very often get voices almost as low as mine, a normal male pitch.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:24.000
 But what happens under the influence of androgens, the way they change the hair follicle involves

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.920
 reorganization of the whole structure of the hair follicle.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:38.520
 But since the hair follicle has a finite lifespan, if you interrupt that stimulation consistently,

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:44.600
 like there was a study in France showing women who applied topical progesterone to sideburns

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:50.560
 and mustache and chest hair that had developed under androgen stimulation, they stayed with

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:57.960
 it through the expected life span of these hair follicles and refeminized their facial

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.960
 and chest hair.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:07.160
 But in the case of vocal cords, if they actually develop a male pitch, that's because they

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:14.040
 have grown and enlarged and it isn't, the whole voice box enlarges.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:21.400
 And generally you can't see a woman's Adam's apple, like a man's sticks out in proportion

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.120
 to how bass their voice is.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:30.520
 And if the whole cartilage voice box is enlarged, the vocal cords have to adapt and they simply

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:38.160
 don't have any way to get smaller without the framework that's holding them changing.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.880
 How long did you say that you were under the influence of this androgenic excess that gave

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880
 you the hair stitchism?

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.520
 It's actually kind of interesting, because it was only for a period of a few months,

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.800
 but I was living a very toxic lifestyle.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.160
 My job had me working eight hours, basically walking to and from tables.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.040
 I was a waitress and I never got a break.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.040
 I didn't get a chance.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:06.600
 And so I was like exercising for eight, sometimes 12 hours a day for about three months, four

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.600
 days a week.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.360
 And I don't know why it caused that in me, because clearly a lot of waitresses don't

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.640
 have that problem.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.840
 But I was a girl who had very, very, very high notes before and I had almost, sorry

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.840
 if this is too much information, I had almost no body hair at all.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:27.080
 And then after waitressing, both of those plus other changes happened, and I would call

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.560
 it virilization.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.920
 And then it also happened again a few years later when I was waitressing again.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.440
 And those were the only times that that's ever happened to me.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:44.520
 Since your voice doesn't really have a masculine quality, it's possible that some of the loss

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.400
 of the high notes is the result of swelling or edema.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:56.440
 And often something that suppresses thyroid function will cause edema of the vocal cords.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:05.040
 And just by correcting the thyroid, ideally, the water can quickly be extruded.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.320
 And the cartilage can change shape a little bit by losing some of its excess water.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.960
 And so it would be a good idea to have your thyroid carefully checked.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.840
 Check your waking temperature and pulse rate and your midday temperature and pulse rate.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:28.080
 And if your TSH is not in the lower end of the normal range, then it's possible that

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.240
 just a thyroid supplement would raise your range a little bit.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240
 That's excellent.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.240
 Thank you so much for your time.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.240
 Yeah.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.240
 By the way, did you ever get your estradiol to progesterone measured?

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.240
 Did you ever have that value looked at?

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.480
 Well, I actually didn't.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.280
 So I had my estrogen measured, and I have the whole thing that was measured a while

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.280
 ago.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.200
 And I didn't really pay too much attention to it.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.920
 The estrogen said it was like 60 or something lead test.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.880
 But I know from reading Ray's writing, at least this is how I interpreted it, I was

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.840
 under the impression that you can't actually measure estrogen in the blood and it's not

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.840
 a good reflection.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840
 Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.840
 Yeah.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.880
 Well, the blood test for estradiol is certainly very relative in terms of it's a subjective

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.760
 amount and when your progesterone is measured, there's a very definite ratio between the

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.440
 two, which is very...

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.240
 And he did not measure progesterone.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.240
 Okay.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.240
 All right.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240
 All right.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240
 Well, thank you for your call.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240
 Thank you so, so much.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240
 Okay.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.240
 So we actually have three callers on the line.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.560
 So let's take this next caller on the air.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:27.560
 Where are you from?

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.560
 What's your question?

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.560
 Yeah, my name's Jeff, and I actually have two questions.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.560
 He's from New York.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.560
 Okay, cool.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.360
 So the first one is I've actually been doing the doctor diet.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:39.960
 I've listened to all the shows and what I'm finding is that I'm taking milligrams of natural

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.720
 desiccated thyroid twice a day, so it's about three grains a day.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:49.000
 But the pulse in the AM is always right around 60, temperature is anywhere between 97.2.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.760
 So then if you go to midday, it's cutting up a little bit to like 70, sorry, to 68,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.360
 69, but it never gets to 75 or 80 ever.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:02.720
 The temperature never gets above 98.2, maybe rarely, maybe far.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.720
 So I'm in good shape.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.880
 I follow the diet, 60, and I'm just wondering, I know the range is, you talk about sort of

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.800
 pulse and specifically, I know there was a show that gave you questions about what if

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.640
 the pulse goes up and temp goes down, all that, but this is pretty basic.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.600
 It's like in the morning, what should it be?

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.400
 And at midday, what should it be relative to what I just gave you?

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.040
 And what would you do to change that?

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040
 That's the first question.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.040
 Okay.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.920
 And the second question, and part of the other thing is I found through this process, a lot

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.800
 of things have gotten better, mental clarity, all physical symptoms, temp time, actually

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.040
 there has been an increase in male pattern baldness on the very top of the head, ironically.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.240
 So I'm just wondering if that...

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.440
 And this is the only thing you're taking is these three grains of natural glandular?

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.440
 That's right.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.560
 I don't want to mess with the other because given all I've heard, I just feel like the

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.120
 body decides what it needs.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.600
 And I think Dr. Peat said that on other radio programs, the body will decide it's a much

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.680
 safer way to do it.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.120
 It may not be directly immediately as effective, but I prefer doing that for the reason I mentioned.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120
 Okay.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120
 So what question, Claire?

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120
 Yeah.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.520
 Have you ever had a blood test for TSH?

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.520
 Yeah, I have.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.200
 It was about 1.8.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.520
 I haven't had it in a while.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.920
 At that same time, I had a cholesterol, total cholesterol of 330.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.720
 The guy wanted to put me on statin drugs and I brought his attention to the piece you mentioned.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.880
 I have a copy of that shows there's no correlation between cholesterol.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.760
 And to me, that was an indication of heart attacks.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.760
 But this is an indication that clearly my thyroid was underactive, which has kind of

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:25.760
 got me.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.840
 Were you taking this glandular when you got your TSH of 1.8?

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.840
 I started taking that, right.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.360
 So you got a TSH of 1.8 and then you decided to start using a natural glandular?

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360
 Yeah, 1.8 is high.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.360
 Yeah, I can tell.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.800
 And my T3 level on the low end of the scale, that's their scale, which may or may not be

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:42.800
 useful.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.600
 And the T4 was sort of on the average end.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.320
 And they didn't take burst T3, so I don't know that.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.840
 Have they measured the cholesterol since you've been taking thyroid?

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.680
 No, I'm due for another blood test.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.440
 But my guess is it'll go down.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.960
 But my real question related to the temperature, I think I can answer those questions after

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960
 the next blood test.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.840
 My guess is it'll go down dramatically because I am in very good physical shape.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.200
 I know you guys say don't jog, but I do do under two miles three times a week, mostly

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200
 with sprints.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.960
 So I feel that no activity is not useful.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.800
 But obviously, as you pointed out, jogging is repeatedly running marathons, et cetera,

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.960
 is long-term detrimental.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.880
 But I don't think you go to the other end and literally do nothing but ride a bike.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.800
 You've got to do more than that, at least in my case.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.960
 And I think you said that sprinting is okay in some of your write-ups.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.640
 In other words, doing like five, six sprints for 20 yards, et cetera, after sort of warming

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.640
 up.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:35.200
 Have your muscles enlarged noticeably since taking the thyroid?

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.200
 Not at all.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.200
 I have the same weight.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.200
 My weight goes from 172 to 178, sort of centered around 175.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.880
 It's been my weight for a long time.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.640
 I do find it drops, though, from sleep to the next morning, but usually in that range.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.160
 Mental clarity is so much better.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.320
 But that's really the key, and that's why I'm to this.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.120
 And you're definitely right about the PUFA.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.120
 No doubt about it.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:03.080
 In the animal experiments, it takes about four years for a complete exchange when you

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.760
 stop eating PUFA.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.240
 It's just a random exchange of what's in your present diet and what's in your body, and

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.960
 that takes four years to be complete.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:21.000
 So it takes about two years to get a good 50% reduction in it where you'll start feeling

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.080
 your thyroid more consistently.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.760
 Because for taking three grains, your pulses and temperature do seem pretty low.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760
 The human is overweight.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.400
 It takes four years, but on the lean side, more muscular and more active, perhaps that

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.640
 accelerates the process.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.320
 But by the way, there's no chance that you can eliminate PUFA.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.480
 I mean, the notion of getting five milligrams per day is like fantasy.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.760
 You just can't do that.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.920
 It's like impossible for anybody, even you, Dr. Peat.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.880
 There's no way you can limit it to five milligrams, right?

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.000
 Because if you add up the milk you drink and the eggs, et cetera, it's...

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.520
 No, five grams, I think, was...

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.480
 Sorry, five grams, not milligrams, five grams.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:55.880
 You mentioned was the limit.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:33:02.320
 Yeah, it's possible to get it down to a couple of grams a day, which is the inflection point

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:09.080
 where you see cancer correlating very closely to the amount of PUFA in your diet is around

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.200
 four grams per day.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.520
 And so you're pretty safe if you keep it under four grams per day, which you can do just

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:24.360
 by low-fat milk or skimmed milk, fruit, and low-fat cheese and eggs and such.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360
 I do all that.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.040
 The only thing I do take is cooked vegetables.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.440
 I've been doing that like twice a day.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.480
 Ironically, I was thinking to myself, sometimes I can't sleep at night, I'm thinking, "If

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.360
 you cook food, you're killing the enzymes.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.800
 And if your body, if your stomach's not generating those enzymes, you're going to have trouble

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.880
 breaking down that food, even if there's less PUFA in it."

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.000
 I'm wondering whether digestive enzyme, you know, Lita Lee talks about that.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 I know you know her.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.440
 Is that something that ultimately is useful, recognizing you have to worry about additives?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.160
 No, I think if you're going to eat vegetables, they should be thoroughly cooked.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:34:00.080
 Otherwise, partly the problem is that you can't extract all the nutrients if they aren't

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.640
 thoroughly cooked.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:08.200
 And some of the carbohydrate complexes are going to feed bacteria if they aren't thoroughly

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.200
 cooked.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:15.720
 I think measuring your cholesterol again and having your vitamin D level checked, sometimes

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:22.120
 a deficiency of vitamin D interferes with the way your body is handling the thyroid.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.840
 It probably leads to more reverse T3 production.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:32.200
 But the vitamin D level in the blood should be around the middle of the range, 15 nanograms

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:40.840
 per milliliter, and the healthiest population for having no thyroid disease, essentially,

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.640
 they were in the below 0.4 on the TSH scale.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:50.600
 And cholesterol is a pretty good indication of how you're responding to thyroid.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.800
 It should be around 200 or a little less.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:35:02.320
 And in the 1930s, cholesterol was recognized as a good diagnostic indicator of thyroid

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320
 function.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:08.840
 Someone published a study showing that when you removed someone's thyroid gland, immediately

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.080
 as the metabolic rate went down, the cholesterol went up.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:21.000
 And when you supplemented thyroid, the cholesterol came down as an exact mirror image of the

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 metabolic rate.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.120
 So I think that's exactly what's going to happen here because before I started your

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:29.560
 program for years, my total cholesterol was 200 and I had very good levels according to

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560
 modern medicine.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.000
 When I started your diet, I started eating a lot of ice cream.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.920
 I didn't used to eat that and a lot of milk.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.380
 And I ended up, that's when it skyrocketed to 330.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.360
 But I think when you make a change like this, it's a shock to your body.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.800
 And to your point, I think I need to go through another blood test and see whether or not

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.720
 the impact on the thyroid supplement and the vitamin D level, by the way, which was in

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.720
 the 40s, but I tried to get that up a little bit.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.800
 It's below 50, but it's not dangerously low.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.600
 It's on the low end, somewhere between 40 and 50.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.200
 But the real question was the temperature and pulse.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:06.240
 If your symptoms are not there, is it reasonable to have a pulse that sort of ranges between

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:12.360
 60 and 70 throughout the day if you're athletic and at a temperature that really never gets

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.720
 above 98.2?

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.480
 I wouldn't worry about it.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:22.400
 Some people have a big heart that pumps efficiently and does fine at 65 beats per minute.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.400
 Yeah, you're right.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:27.040
 In fact, I was told I had someone, when I was a younger kid, they said I had a larger

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040
 heart.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.040
 I think that exactly might be true.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.600
 You've been very kind with your time.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600
 There's one last question.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600
 This is a real quick one.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.600
 There's another guy named Lawrence Wilson.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.280
 I don't know if you've ever heard of him.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.080
 He's a very prolific writer.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.840
 He deviates from you on a couple of points, no fruit.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.440
 He says take omega-3s, but it's very good.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.320
 But the one thing he does say, and I know you're big on coffee, he's big on coffee too,

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.320
 but not orally.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.960
 He's big on coffee enemas.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.880
 I know in the past you came up once and you mentioned that that can be stressful.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.080
 A bigger problem for people over 50, one of the biggest problems, as you've mentioned,

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.320
 is iron toxicity is a real problem.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.680
 If you do a coffee enemas on a regular basis, is that a way, other than bloodletting, to

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.320
 ultimately reduce the toxicity of iron in your body?

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.280
 Well, just drinking coffee every time you eat an iron-containing food.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:20.120
 I always have coffee with oysters or eggs or meat because it drastically limits your

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.480
 absorption of iron.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.120
 But my question is, maybe you don't have a position to answer that.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.120
 You may not know, I just know a lot, but maybe you don't have experience in this area, or

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.040
 do you have a view on coffee enema in terms of whether it's stressful or not?

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.040
 Because it's like running.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.720
 If you run the first time, you're going to be stressed.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.120
 But if you do the same running 10 weeks in a row, it's not going to be as stressful because

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.440
 your body got used to it.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:47.640
 Yeah, I know there's a lot of benefit some people have from the coffee enema, but I think

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:54.440
 you can get the same benefit, probably more, by having it with food so that you don't give

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.680
 yourself a sudden jolt of stimulation.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.640
 That's where the stress is.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.320
 It can make you burn fuel so fast that you get hypoglycemia.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.640
 Okay, well, I appreciate the calls, caller.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.080
 I don't want to cut you too short, but we do have two more callers who are waiting to

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.080
 get some questions in.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.640
 So let's take this next caller.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.120
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.120
 We lost this one.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:22.080
 It had to do with endometriosis and IUDs, their relation and the health of that.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.440
 Dr. Peat, do you think IUDs could be responsible for endometriosis from an irritation point

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.440
 of view?

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:35.640
 Yeah, it's been well established that endometriosis is from the prolonged excessive exposure to

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.280
 estrogen without interruption from progesterone.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:49.240
 And the mechanism of the plain plastic or copper IUD is to send a signal to the ovary

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:55.120
 that the uterus isn't ready for pregnancy because there's a foreign object in it.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:02.000
 The uterus perceives this injury and the signal travels up the fallopian tube and tells the

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.240
 ovary not to make progesterone.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:10.640
 So it's a very specific interruption of your hormone ratio the same way that the birth

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.640
 control pill is.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.960
 Right, so just constant stimulation, estrogen excess with no relief from a progestogenic

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.960
 part of the cycle.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.400
 Okay, very good.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.400
 Next caller, you're on the air.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.400
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.400
 Hi, this is Alex.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.400
 I'm from Southern Humboldt.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.400
 Okay, Alex, what's your question?

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:30.000
 Yeah, hey, my question is just I went through testicular cancer treatment last year.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.120
 I ended up having my left testicle removed and then went through chemotherapy and then

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.820
 after that had a surgery called an RPLND where they removed a section of lymph nodes.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.360
 And I'm just interested in generic advice you'd have for somebody who's gone through

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.480
 that and gone through a few months of chemotherapy.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.760
 I haven't had anything crop back up but I'm just interested in general health advice for

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.960
 somebody who's been through a treatment like that.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.480
 How old were you at the time?

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.680
 I'm 34 years old.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.280
 I was 32, just about to be 33 at the time of the diagnosis.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.720
 Yeah, was there an undescended testicle or anything like that or was it a lady tumor?

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.000
 No, yeah, none of the kind of the class things that would have really elevated my risk.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.240
 I didn't have an undescended testicle or anything like that.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.720
 They were both like normal testicles as far as I had known up until that point.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:19.880
 Okay, all right, Dr. Peat, did you hear the question to begin with?

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:26.640
 Yeah, when experimenters have removed, for example, one adrenal gland or one ovary, I

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.280
 don't remember any experiments with removing one testicle but the removal of some of the

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:39.720
 steroid-forming tissue in those other situations causes the pituitary to drive the remaining

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:46.840
 gland twice as hard basically to keep up the systemic level of the steroid production.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:54.960
 And so I think it's important to watch your LH and FSH levels and there are ways you can

00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:02.200
 without necessarily supplementing an androgen but you can reduce the stress, keeping your

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:10.400
 thyroid hormone level up, vitamin D level up, regulating your protein and sugar intake

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:19.320
 carefully and possibly supplementing pregnenolone which will feed into the system suppressing

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:27.600
 the exaggerated stress reactions that are more likely if your androgen is low.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:33.920
 Testosterone works closely with progesterone and pregnenolone to make it less necessary

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.880
 to produce the stress hormones such as cortisol.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:42.160
 Yeah, my testosterone levels are actually up because the one testicle that's left working

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.120
 double time so I'm at like the upper range.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.440
 I've been going to UCSF and going to the Oshkosh.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.800
 Do you know what your value is?

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.800
 Is it 6-700?

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.800
 I think it's up 700, like 750.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.960
 Okay, good.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:00.160
 I think it's good to concentrate on the whole anti-stress process because the androgen is

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:08.520
 probably compensating for the need for all of the stabilizing quieting hormones.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:13.920
 DHEA and pregnenolone and progesterone have a stabilizing effect.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:22.160
 Pregnenolone is the most neutral of those and will hold down the need to produce cortisol

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:27.240
 and help to restrain LH and FSH production by the pituitary.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.120
 Okay, is there anything dietary?

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.760
 They've got me on vitamin D definitely.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.480
 They want me to have elevated vitamin levels.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:38.120
 They have me taking like mushroom capsules from fungi perfecta and then it's like fish

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.880
 oil, vitamin D, fungi perfecta, mushroom capsules.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.960
 You want to stop the fish oil?

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:43.960
 I think that's about it.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.960
 Yeah, fish oil.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.960
 You want to cut the fish oil out?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960
 Cut it out?

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.960
 Oh, definitely.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.960
 Yeah.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.280
 That's been the mainstay of Dr. Peat's research in the last 40 years is the toxic effects

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.720
 of polyunsaturates and fish oil is probably the worst of them all.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720
 I mean, I'm well-versed.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.080
 I've been on his program a million times and I know the polyunsaturates are a problem.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.840
 I guess I was oblivious to the fact that fish oil was included in that category.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840
 Yeah, very much so.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.840
 Okay.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.840
 So, avoid the fish oil is definitely not essential.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:17.080
 I mean, the science, I'll go back and listen to the actual chemicals or reactions that

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.600
 you're speaking about but is there anything dietarily or whatever that you'd recommend

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.520
 just generically to be kind of a soft approach to try to achieve the aims you're speaking

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.080
 or talking about?

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:33.400
 Having the anti-stress effect of vitamin D, a high ratio of calcium to phosphorus is very

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.400
 helpful.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:39.880
 So, cut down your meat intake compared to your dairy intake or have a good ratio of

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.320
 dairy to meat and just eat small amounts.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.320
 Okay.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.320
 Yeah.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320
 Not a lot of muscle meat.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.280
 If you're going to eat meat, you're better off consuming the bone broths, the knuckle

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.280
 broths and the shanks.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:49.280
 And a little liver.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280
 Yeah.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.280
 Maybe once or twice a month.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.280
 Yeah, definitely.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.280
 I like all the nap bits.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.680
 I've been good about eating all that and I've been on that kind of a thing like Sally Fallon

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.080
 type diet for a while.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.080
 All right.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.080
 Well, thank you.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.080
 Thank you for your call.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.600
 We're going to have to close it out here because it's three minutes to eight o'clock and I

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.400
 just want to let people know about Dr. Peat's details.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.280
 So, thanks so much, Dr. Peat, for joining us.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.080
 There's a whole bunch of questions we didn't get to but great.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.240
 I'm glad people were listening and coming from all over the globe here.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240
 Thanks so much, Dr. Peat.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
 Okay.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240
 Good luck.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.240
 Okay.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.400
 So, for those people that have listened to the show, they want to find out more about

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.800
 Dr. Peat and his work and the publications that he's produced, his books or his newsletters

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:32.480
 or his research articles, it's www.raypeat.com.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.560
 Lots of articles fully referenced.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.400
 Under the resources tab, we've just uploaded all of the shows including the 2016 and 2017

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.400
 shows.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.880
 And yeah, big fans of Dr. Peat.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.200
 He's taught us a lot and it's how we live.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.680
 So, for those people that called in, I'm glad you joined.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.680

 Gosh, I'll be driving home in the dark here, folks.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.240
 It was just like yesterday.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.200
 We were at the solstice and now we're already winding forward to the autumn of fall.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.200
 Here it comes.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:13.200
