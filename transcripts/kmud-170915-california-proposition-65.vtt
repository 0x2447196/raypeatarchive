00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Well once again welcome and thank you for tuning in to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.280
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.360
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show before, we have a very special

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.880
 guest speaker with us, Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.520
 There is the odd occasion where people have called in they've never heard him before,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.800
 but I know a lot of people that are listening to the show are listening purely to glimpse

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.000
 some of his insights because I know he's always got a different answer for things.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 The number here if you're in the area is 707-986-923-3911 or there's an 800 number for people outside

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 the area code which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.800
 From 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.240
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic of Cal Prop 65, California's Proposition

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.360
 65.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.720
 I started very briefly towards the end of July's show saying I wanted to bring out some

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.520
 inconsistencies or incongruencies with Prop 65 in the legislature in California and we'll

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.040
 be bringing Dr. Peat on here in probably 10 or 15 minutes.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.320
 I wanted to outline some specific testing that we've done personally for products as

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.040
 part of GMP protocol for ICP-MS testing of metals and specifically for the California

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.440
 Proposition 65 metals which are arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.920
 So what I wanted to start with was the 1986 California voters approved initiative to address

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.820
 their growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals and that initiative became the Safe

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.880
 Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 better known by its original name of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.160
 Prop 65.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.920
 Prop 65 requires the state to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer or birth

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.720
 defects or other reproductive harm.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.840
 This list which must be updated at least once a year has grown to include approximately

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.080
 800 chemicals since it was first published in 1987 and Prop 65 requires businesses to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.840
 notify Californians about significant amounts of chemicals in the products they purchase

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.200
 in their homes or workplaces or that are released into the environment.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.600
 By providing this information Prop 65 enables Californians to make informed decisions about

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.480
 protecting themselves from exposure to these chemicals and Prop 65 also prohibits California

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.200
 businesses from knowingly discharging significant amounts of listed chemicals into sources of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 drinking water.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.160
 Hooray you say.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.480
 The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, the OEHHA as only these acronyms

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.800
 can be so stupendously long, administers the Prop 65 program.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.020
 OEHHA which is part of the California Environmental Protection Agency also evaluates all currently

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.500
 available scientific information on substances considered for placement on the Prop 65 list.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.680
 Now two months ago and the month prior to that, it was June and July, we did a program

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.480
 we got to be on progesterone explaining how the marginalization and demonization if you

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.200
 like actually of progesterone is completely wrong and how the scientific evidence to put

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.480
 it on the Prop 65 list was completely erroneous and there are very very innocuous products

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.560
 that are on the Prop 65 list that you probably have never never heard of or never imagined

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.440
 could be on there.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.120
 Prop 65 labels are just becoming increasingly apparent in stores especially in the supplement

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120
 departments.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.000
 We walk the aisles of the supplement departments and take a look at whatever products you're

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.240
 looking at for alternative health care and you often find these small Prop 65 labels

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.840
 stuck on the bottles just purely saying that the products may contain chemicals known to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.400
 the state of California to cause reproductive harm or cancer and as we'll find out it's

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.040
 a lot of litigation, fear, it's not really factual and I'm going to bring out some very

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.720
 striking incongruencies here.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.040
 Now a chemical can either be listed if either of two independent committees or scientists

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.320
 and health professionals find that the chemical has been clearly shown to cause cancer or

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.080
 birth defects or other reproductive harm and these two committees, the Carcinogen Identification

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.200
 Committee, the CIC and a Developmental and Reproductive Toxicant Identification, this

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.680
 is the DART, they're part of OHHS's Science Advisory Board.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.600
 The committee members are appointed by the governor and are designated as the state's

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.520
 qualified experts and these are experts for evaluating chemicals under Prop 65.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.680
 When determining whether a chemical should be placed on the list the committees base

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.720
 their decision on the most current scientific information available and the OHHS staff scientists

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.560
 compile all relevant scientific evidence on various chemicals for the committees to review.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.200
 The committees also consider comments from the public before making their decisions.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.200
 So that's the first way.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.000
 The second way for a chemical to be listed is if an organisation designated as an authoritative

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.360
 body by the CIC or DART, the Identification Committee, has identified it as causing cancer

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.680
 or birth defects or other reproductive harm.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.080
 The following organisations have been designated as authoritative bodies, the US Environmental

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.500
 Protection Agency, the US Food and Drug Administration, National Institute for Occupational Safety

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.280
 and Health, the National Toxicology Programme and the International Agency for Research

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.400
 on Cancer.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.400
 A third way for a chemical to be listed is if an agency of the state or federal government

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.520
 requires that it be labelled or identified as causing cancer or birth defects or other

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.840
 reproductive harm.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.440
 Now most chemicals listed in this manner are prescription drugs that are required by the

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.880
 US FDA to contain warnings relating to cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.880
 We've seen plenty of drugs like that.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.840
 Now the fourth way requires the listing of chemicals meeting certain scientific criteria

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.240
 and identified in the California Labour Code as causing cancer or birth defects or other

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.080
 reproductive harm.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.280
 And this method established the initial chemical list following voter approval of Prop 65 in

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.480
 1986 and continues to be used as the basis for listing as appropriate.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.360
 Now how about this?

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.880
 Businesses with less than 10 employees and government agencies are exempt from Proposition

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:57.200
 65 warning requirements and prohibition on discharges into water drinking sources.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.800
 OK, did you catch that?

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.880
 So if your business has less than 10 employees or you're a government agency, you're completely

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.440
 exempt from discharging waste into drinking water and the relevant Prop 65 warnings.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.280
 So Proposition 65's warning requirement has provided, on the upside, an incentive for

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.720
 manufacturers to remove listed chemicals from their products.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.480
 For example, trichloroethylene, which causes cancer, is no longer used in most correction

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.960
 fluids for wiping out type.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.240
 Reformulated paint strippers do not contain the carcinogen methylene chloride and toluene,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.560
 which causes birth defects or other reproductive harm, has been removed from many nail care

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.840
 products.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.920
 In addition, a Prop 65 enforcement action prompted manufacturers to decrease the lead

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.360
 content in ceramic tableware and wineries to eliminate the use of lead-containing foil

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.760
 caps on wine bottles.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.680
 So whilst the Prop has some very positive benefits, it drastically needs reframing within

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.400
 a realistic criteria.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.280
 How can a business with fewer than 10 employees be exempt from a legislation that would sue

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.200
 a larger company producing the same product?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.760
 And how is it that commonly available foodstuffs are far over the maximum reliable daily limit

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.560
 currently in place and legislated for by Prop 65?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.280
 It seems the only winners from Proposition 65 are the attorneys who bring the lawsuits,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.320
 and there are some additional facts that are not so commonly known.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.840
 Chief amongst these are, since Californians have been warned of possible carcinogens for

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.080
 the past 27 years, one would expect to see a decline in cancer rates compared to those

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.880
 states that didn't adopt similar right-to-know laws.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.760
 In fact, no such decline exists.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.920
 There isn't a single medical study that demonstrates any public health benefits of Proposition

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:59.800
 65, and there is no evidence that Prop 65 has lowered cancer incidence amongst Californians.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.560
 Most startling.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.600
 Proposition 65 has been a bonanza for the bounty hunter law firms that drive such lawsuits

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.000
 using paid plaintiffs.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.400
 Between 2000 and 2011, there were 2,381 settlements that cost targets nearly $180 million exclusive

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.120
 of plaintiffs' legal costs and court costs.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:29.440
 Sadly, the systematic legalised abuses surrounding Prop 65 have resulted in all too real economic

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.520
 effects on individuals as well as their employers.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.920
 Employers suffer lower income or job security in affected businesses, and the California

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.720
 government has had to spend taxpayer money for administrative and court costs relating

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.240
 to the law.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.480
 So let's look at some real-world examples of actual values for some Prop 65 chemicals

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.080
 that I have personal experience working with, and being GMP compliant we have to periodically

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.640
 test our products for the so-called California Big Four.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.560
 So these are, as I said, arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.160
 So how do we do this?

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.960
 The most common process now is called ICP-MS.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:16.360
 It's inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and one of the most sophisticated technologies

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.840
 to date to quantify components to detect levels down to three parts per billion.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:29.880
 So typically a PPB, a part per billion, quantification is what's used, and typically that detection

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.760
 limit is about four parts per billion, about as low as it can go.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.900
 It may well change as time goes on and technology improves, but certainly much more sophisticated

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.960
 than the previous calibrations for it.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.440
 Now Prop 65 components of natural medicinal herbs which are tested by ICP-MS include,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.680
 as I said, arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:59.400
 Now for above ground foliage, the analysis shows typical ranges in the low teens to 60s

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:05.960
 of the parts per billion, not of mercury typically, but for cadmium, arsenic and lead.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:12.120
 Root analysis, typical ranges mid-twenties to hundreds, depending on the location grown

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.320
 and the species.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.920
 Now I'll just give you a quote here from some before and after extraction results that we've

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.120
 done personally.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:27.560
 We purchase a product, we would spot check it for confirmation of a vendor certificate,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.680
 send it off and get an ICP-MS analysis for it.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.760
 Once the product's cleared QC and has been produced, that extract is also then sent off

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:42.600
 for ICP-MS analysis and then we can see what kind of product we've produced or what the

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:50.360
 extraction process has done for the metals that may have been present in the raw material.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.200
 So turmeric root, have a think about that will you.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.280
 Lots of people eat turmeric for its health benefits.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.720
 It's documented anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity are published and have been known

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.200
 for some time, especially in Ayurvedic medicine.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.920
 Now the quantity, typical quantity in raw root were as follows.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:19.800
 Arsenic 395 parts per billion, cadmium 41.9, lead 646, unfortunately mercury was undetected.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.200
 So, after extraction the liquid extract was retested and came back with the following

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200
 report.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:33.680
 Arsenic 68.1, cadmium undetected, lead 6.6, mercury undetected.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.520
 Another fairly common herb, Lobelia.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:47.080
 Arsenic was 43.9, cadmium 79.6, lead 357 and mercury 10.2.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.300
 Now after extraction the liquid extract was retested and came back with the following

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.960
 report where all the tested elements were actually below the detection limit.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.360
 And then Echinacea root, people are very familiar with Echinacea.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:06.040
 The arsenic there was 115 and the cadmium came back at 20.5, the lead was 17.3 and mercury

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.120
 in that sample was undetected.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.080
 And then after extraction the liquid extract was retested and came back with the following

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.700
 report arsenic 5.9, cadmium, lead and mercury undetected.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.920
 In fact in all of the ICP-MS testing that we've done, which is extensive, extraction

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.920
 produces a 5 to 10 fold and above removal of any existing raw material components listed

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:36.320
 by Prop 65 and resulting in the maximum allowable daily limits which are well within Prop 65's

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.860
 legislatively directed values.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.480
 In many cases the raw material would fall outside the allowable exposure but what I

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.600
 really want to point out was the foodstuffs we had tested.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:54.740
 So crab, we had crab tested and this is local crab here from Sheldon Cove on the Pacific

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:55.740
 Coast here.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.980
 So crab, arsenic came back at 12,400.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:08.260
 So previous herbs would be things like 395, 43 and 115, the crab was 12,400.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.960
 Now when I spoke to the scientist at the lab that tested this, they did offer the consolation

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:20.720
 that this arsenic was not potentially a toxic product and that they could do specific speciation

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.120
 for this to find out whether or not the actual amount of toxic arsenic was as high as it

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.120
 looked like.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:37.080
 So anyway the cadmium was 10.4, the lead was 10.3 and mercury was 109, okay, 109 parts

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.400
 of a billion mercury.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.960
 Now this vastly exceeds the maximum allowable daily limits set by Prop 65 given you conceivably

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.560
 consume 8 to 10 ounces of crab in one serving compared with a half teaspoon dose of extract

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.040
 taken 1 to 3 times per day.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.360
 Now how about this, cod, we tested cod and the cod came back with an arsenic count of

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.360
 115.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:10.080
 Actually the cadmium was less than 9.4, the lead came back at 30.3 and mercury was 473

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.680
 parts per billion.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.600
 So eating a 12 ounce portion of this would give you way higher exposure to methylmercury,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.880
 the most toxic and abundant oceanic form that we get exposed to.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:30.600
 Okay, but it gets worse, halibut, we tested some halibut, arsenic was 602, cadmium, it

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:38.440
 was down to 9.2, the lead was 23 and mercury was 794 parts per billion.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.060
 Again with a serving amount typically of 8 to 10 ounces, folks.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:48.320
 So the last thing I did for seafood was salmon, it was a young fish, it was about a 9 pound

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.800
 fish so it was quite a small one and obviously we'll get into the whole predation thing and

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.580
 the food chain accumulation etc which became pretty evident.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.560
 So this 9 pound fish came in slightly better with these values, arsenic was 428, cadmium

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.120
 10.1, lead was less than 10.1, mercury was 72.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.400
 So still with a much higher MADL as set by Prop 65 whichever way you cut it.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:17.600
 So legislation for dietary supplement manufacturers imposes stringent maximum allowable daily

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.560
 limits set by Prop 65 values which pale into insignificance when compared to seafood for

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.160
 example.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:30.280
 Now we also tested some elk meat, it had been hunted and it was not surprising that it was

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.280
 very clean.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.560
 Now the only detectable component was arsenic and it had a value of 64.7 but lead, mercury

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.480
 and cadmium were undetected.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:45.040
 So I just wanted to say that terrestrial roots and foliage crops naturally sequester minerals

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.720
 found in the rock which form the soil in which they grow and pollution.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.520
 In industrial countries that's airborne finds its way back to the soil by being washed out

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.840
 in rains or as fallout from airborne particulates heavier than air.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.320
 Characterizing Asian or Indian farm products subjected to the conditions reminiscent of

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.920
 the era of industrialization in Europe.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.440
 The products I mentioned were all certified organic by the way.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.320
 Now terrestrial and oceanic life grazing on foliage or consuming other animals sequester

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.040
 these accumulated products and the higher up the food chain the higher the value in

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.200
 the animal as seen from our experiments.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:30.120
 Now the whole point is the meaning of any initiative like Prop 65 to save us from harm

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:35.360
 has to be weighed both by the freedoms lost as a result of government being in charge

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.640
 to look after us rather than we the people as a self-governing body with practical and

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.480
 reasonable jurisprudence not dictated by either control for higher bounty hunters but

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.560
 by common sense which seems to have gone the way of the dinosaurs.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.960
 Now I know when I'd spoken to Dr. Pete preparing some of the material for two months ago looking

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.280
 at progesterone that progesterone was on the Prop 65 list and we went through the science

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:12.760
 and the committee papers that were used as quote unquote evidence for suspecting progesterone

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:19.440
 as a mitogen or as a cancer promoter when actually Dr. Pete is very familiar with the

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:26.520
 whole progesterone tobacco having studied hormones especially progesterone as one of

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.360
 his thesis past his PhD.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.480
 So Dr. Pete are you on there?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480
 Yes.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.480
 Okay well sorry to have blathered on here for 20 minutes with what I was first talking

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:47.480
 about but in terms of Proposition 65 and its actual effects to the consumer don't you think

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:55.040
 that some of this is a little bit out of control in terms of writing laws for it and giving

00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:04.280
 amounts which they say they use clearly say that they're using a 1000 times safety factor.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:10.800
 So I know for progesterone that you're very aware of how maligned it was and there was

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.400
 absolutely no real evidence for it because the test they did on the beagles etc. was

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:24.480
 really pretty poor scientific process but in terms of Prop 65 do you have any thoughts

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:32.440
 on it in terms of how it affects people or what you think the government are doing?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.440
 The way the committee is set up.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.280
 Dr. Pete could you speak up a bit?

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:54.960
 The people in charge of choosing the evidence are appointed and they are basically able

00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:01.200
 to lobby for products that they are associated with.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:09.000
 When I was in contact with the agency about 10 years ago three of the members were from

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.200
 a single university.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.720
 These three all had conflicts of interest.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:26.880
 One woman was a representative of a company developing transdermal products including

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.880
 hormones.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:36.880
 Two of the people were connected with the development of a new approach to birth control

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:44.400
 which involved the suppression of progesterone.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:52.080
 The articles that were chosen supposedly all relevant evidence relating to the carcinogenicity

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.360
 of a substance are to be considered.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:04.960
 Fewer than 1% of the articles relating to progesterone and cancer were even listed and

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:11.680
 of those two of them were about a totally different substance, a carcinogenic synthetic

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.480
 progesterone.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:23.680
 One of the articles that they cited as evidence of the carcinogenicity of the actual substance

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:36.520
 of progesterone was actually someone's attempt to refute a famous publication showing that

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.360
 progesterone prevents and cures cancer.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:51.520
 This publication was used explicitly a method that the one they were trying to refute a

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.880
 method that they said previously didn't work at all.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:04.720
 So they used a known false method to supposedly invalidate the evidence showing that progesterone

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.520
 cures cancer and that was listed by the committee as evidence that progesterone causes cancer.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:20.880
 It was like the people were basically drunk when they were choosing the papers.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:28.240
 I asked the chairman of the committee for the names of the people who made those crazy

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:36.680
 choices of evidence and she said they were too busy to give me that information.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:46.640
 My impression was that it was not really a regulatory agency in public interest.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:54.200
 It was promoting products on a pay for view basis.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:03.480
 The university that these people worked for, I looked at their research support.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:16.080
 I forget the number, there were dozens of grants promoting arguments, research that

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:21.960
 gave the impression that estrogen was therapeutic for many different things.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.240
 I looked for how much they had on progesterone.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:34.840
 They had two or three research grants which were aimed to show that progesterone was harmful.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:45.880
 This was ten years ago, just three years after the women's international health study showed

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:56.320
 that the combination of estrogen and synthetic progesterone caused cancer, stroke, dementia,

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.720
 heart disease, blood clots.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.920
 Would you be able to get a little closer to the microphone or the phone?

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.920
 I think the engineer is trying to tell me that you are coming in very quietly.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:25.320
 The result of that study, women's international health study, showed that those negative results

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:37.800
 resulted in an extreme rejection by women of the use of that combination of synthetic

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.800
 progesterone and estrogen.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:49.080
 There was an 80% decrease in the use of that particular prescription form of progesterone

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:57.960
 plus estrogen with the loss to one company, lost billions in sales.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:10.280
 Everyone invested in promoting estrogen especially with the synthetic progesterone saw their

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:18.440
 main profit making product becoming very unpopular.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:27.000
 And suddenly at the same time when estrogen sales were falling, progesterone sales had

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:37.200
 increased a hundred fold and suddenly money became available to research progesterone

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.760
 as a toxic substance.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:48.600
 And since that time, since the early years right after the study came out, there has

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:58.120
 been a flood of people researching progesterone as a brain toxin, a carcinogen and so on.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:07.960
 When you examine each one of these, they are doing things known previously to produce the

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.400
 results that look bad.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:19.480
 For example, progesterone is known to reverse a brain tumor.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:28.600
 They were using about a hundred times smaller dose and claiming that it caused the tumor

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:37.920
 and finding changes in breast tissue that they said was associated with breast cancer

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.880
 to distract attention from the studies that showed that it reversed and prevented breast

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.880
 cancer.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:52.200
 Okay, you are listening to Ask Your ObDoctor on KMED, Garboville 91.1 FM from 7.30, that's

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.400
 now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.600
 You are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's discussion

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:06.520
 here of CalProp 65 and its effects and also we will be like I said opening up for questions

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.960
 that don't have to be surrounded and I do have some questions that have been previously

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.800
 written that I want to ask Dr. Pete about for his feedback.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:23.600
 So Dr. Pete, I guess not to labor the CalProp 65 thing anymore other than to just explain

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:31.360
 that there certainly is a, isn't it the way always in government, no, there's certainly

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:37.680
 vested parties for and against certain things happening and obviously collusion between

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:45.600
 companies especially when there's plenty of money involved to protect vested interests.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.440
 But I think if people ever wanted to find out more about this and I mentioned this on

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:57.480
 the last radio show that Dr. Carla Rottenberg's PhD dissertation was basically exposing all

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:04.040
 of the bad evidence, all the bad scientific, supposedly scientific reasons for which were

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:12.680
 given that progesterone was to be deemed a fit for the list was actually very inconsistent

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.360
 and she clearly outlines the mistakes that were made.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.880
 But like anything else in big government I think it's just extremely difficult to get

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.840
 it to change just like trying to change the direction of an oil tanker once it's moving

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.520
 in a certain direction, it takes a long time.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.720
 It's taken how many years here to get people to stop, well hopefully stop consuming liquid

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.160
 oils and recognize the fact that the brainwashing surrounding saturated fats is actually very

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.960
 wrong and that people are actually much better off using saturated fats, probably taken 50

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.960
 or 60 years.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.800
 But anyway we have a caller on the air so let's take this first caller, call away from

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.800
 and what's your question?

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.360
 Hi there, my name's Ali, I'm from Calgary, Alberta.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.760
 Okay hi, welcome to the show.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:01.160
 My question is, well basically a few years ago I developed symptoms of androgen excess

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:08.280
 such as like hirsutism and my voice actually got a lot lower and then about a year after

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.520
 the onset of these traits I decided to supplement with progesterone after reading Ray Peat's

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.520
 writing.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.440
 Well this hormone, it did work wonders for many symptoms, however my voice never went

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.360
 back to normal and a few other things never went back to normal and it actually also caused

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.200
 extreme irritability.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.280
 But anyway my question is basically do you think it's possible to get my singing voice

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.280
 back to where I can sing high notes easily again?

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.440
 How old are you first?

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.440
 Did you say?

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.440
 So I'm 23.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440
 23, okay.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.720
 So whether it's possible to get your high notes back again because that's one of the

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.600
 main things that have been troubling you that hasn't returned is your, you say your voice

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600
 has deepened.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.080
 Yeah, and my singing teacher actually told me that too, like my voice dropped like 8

00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:00.000
 notes or something like that, even my singing voice, or my speaking voice, sorry.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Okay.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 Dr. Peat.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.280
 Well her speaking voice doesn't sound as masculinized as many women that I've known

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:20.080
 who used androgens by prescription or just who had an ovarian problem with excess androgen

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.080
 production.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:32.240
 They very often get voices almost as low as mine, a normal male pitch, but what happens

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:48.060
 under the influence of androgens, the way they change the hair follicle involves reorganization

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:59.000
 of the whole structure of the hair follicle, but since the hair follicle has a finite lifespan,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:07.520
 if you interrupt that stimulation consistently, like there was a study in France showing women

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:15.800
 who applied topical progesterone to sideburns and mustache and chest hair that had developed

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:25.400
 under androgen stimulation, they stayed with it through the expected lifespan of these

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.800
 hair follicles and refeminized their facial and chest hair.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:42.440
 But in the case of vocal cords, if they actually develop a male pitch, that's because they

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:53.320
 have grown and enlarged and the whole voice box enlarges.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:32:02.160
 Basically you can't see a woman's Adam's apple like a man's sticks out in proportion to how

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.400
 bass their voice is.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:15.120
 And if the whole cartilage voice box is enlarged, the vocal cords have to adapt and they simply

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:27.960
 don't have any way to get smaller without the framework that's holding them changing.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:34.400
 How long did you say that you were under the influence of this androgenic excess that gave

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.720
 you the hair cutism?

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:46.200
 It's actually kind of interesting looking back because it was only for a period of a

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:51.640
 few months, but I was living a very toxic lifestyle.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.560
 My job had me working eight hours basically walking to and from tables.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.480
 I was a waitress and I never got a break.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.200
 I didn't get a chance to eat.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:08.040
 And so I was like exercising for eight, sometimes 12 hours a day for about three months, four

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040
 days a week.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.960
 And I don't know why it caused that in me because clearly a lot of waitresses don't

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.360
 have that problem.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:23.480
 But I was a girl who I could sing very, very, very high notes before and I had almost, I'm

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.040
 sorry if this is too much information, I had almost no body hair at all.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:35.160
 And then after waitressing, you know, both of those plus other changes happened and I

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.760
 would call it virilization.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:44.840
 And then it also happened again a few years later when I was waitressing again.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.480
 And those are the only times that that's ever happened to me.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:57.960
 Since your voice doesn't really have a masculine quality, it's possible that some of the loss

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:05.360
 of the high notes is the result of swelling or edema.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:15.200
 And often something that suppresses thyroid function will cause edema of the vocal cords.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:25.920
 And just by correcting the thyroid, ideally the water can quickly be extruded.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:32.120
 Even the cartilage can change shape a little bit by losing some of its excess water.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.480
 And so it would be a good idea to have your thyroid carefully checked.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:44.960
 Check your waking temperature and pulse rate and your midday temperature and pulse rate.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:54.360
 And if your TSH is not in the lower end of the normal range, then it's possible that

00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:01.400
 just a thyroid supplement would raise your range a little bit.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.400
 That's excellent.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.200
 Thank you so much for your time.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.800
 Yeah, by the way, did you ever get your estradiol to progesterone measured?

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.400
 Did you ever have that value looked at?

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.960
 Well, I actually didn't.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.800
 So I had my estrogen measured.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.800
 And I have like the whole panel with me.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.000
 But it was measured a while ago.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.160
 And you know, I didn't really pay too much attention to it.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:32.080
 The estrogen said it was like 60 or something on the blood test.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.640
 But I know from reading Ray's writing, at least this is how I interpreted it, I was

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.320
 under the impression that you can't actually measure estrogen in the blood.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.840
 And like it's not a good reflection.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.840
 Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.480
 Yeah, well, blood test for estradiol is certainly very relative in terms of it's a subjective

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.360
 amount and when your progesterone is measured, there's a very definite ratio between the

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.400
 two, which is very...

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.400
 And he did not measure progesterone.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.400
 Okay.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400
 All right.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400
 All right, well, thank you for your call.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.400
 Thank you so, so much.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.400
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.200
 Okay, so we actually have three callers on the line.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.760
 So let's take this next caller on the way from.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.760
 What's your question?

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.880
 Yeah, my name's Jeff and I actually have two questions.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.880
 I'm from New York.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880
 You're from New York.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.880
 Okay, cool.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.400
 And first one is I've actually been doing the Dr. Pete diet.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:26.200
 I've listened to all the shows and what I'm finding is that I'm taking 90 milligrams of

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.920
 natural desiccated thyroid twice a day, so it's about three grains a day.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:38.600
 But the pulse in the AM is always right around 60 and the temperature is anywhere between

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.880
 97.2 and 97.8.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.680
 So then if you go to midday, it's cutting up a little bit to like 70...

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:54.360
 Sorry, to 68, 69, but it never gets to 75 or 80 ever and the temperature never gets

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.640
 above 98.2, maybe rarely, maybe if I'm right.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.640
 So I'm in good shape.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.120
 As I say, I follow the diet and I'm 60.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.880
 And I'm just wondering, I know the range is, you talk about sort of pulse and specifically,

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:15.080
 I know there was a show that gave you questions about what if the pulse goes up and temp goes

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.320
 down and all that, but this is pretty basic.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.680
 It's like in the morning, what should it be?

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.800
 And at midday, what should it be relative to what I just gave you?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.720
 And what would you do to change that?

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720
 That's the first question.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.320
 And the second question, and the other thing is I found through this process, a lot of

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:36.560
 things have gotten better, mental clarity, all physical symptoms, except I actually think

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:43.560
 there has been an increase in male pattern baldness on the very top of the head, ironically.

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.640
 So I'm just wondering if that...

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.960
 And this is the only thing you're taking is these three grains of natural glandular?

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:52.960
 That's right.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.760
 I don't want to mess with the other because given all I've heard, I just feel let the

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.320
 body decide what it needs.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.040
 And I think Dr. Pete said that on other radio programs.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.080
 The body will decide it's a much safer way to do it.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.120
 It may not be directly immediately as effective, but I prefer doing that for the reason I mentioned.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.800
 Dr. Pete, so was that question clear?

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.000
 Have you ever had a blood test for TSH?

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.400
 Yeah, I have.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.360
 It was about 1.8.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.880
 I haven't had it in a while.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.400
 At that same time, I had a cholesterol, total cholesterol of 330.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:30.440
 I wanted to put me on statin drugs and I brought his attention to the piece you mentioned.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:35.960
 I have a copy of that shows there's no correlation between cholesterol and...

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.800
 To me, that was an indication at heart attacks.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.240
 But this is indication that clearly that my thyroid was underactive, which has kind of

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240
 got me...

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.360
 Were you taking this glandular when you got your TSH of 1.8?

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360
 I started taking that, right.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.440
 So you got a TSH of 1.8 and then you decided to start using a natural glandular?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.320
 Yeah, 1.8 is high.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:02.600
 And my T3 level was on the low end of the scale.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.840
 That's their scale, which may or may not be useful.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.620
 And the T4 was sort of on the average end.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.400
 So they didn't take reverse T3, so I don't know that.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:17.040
 Have they measured the cholesterol since you've been taking thyroid?

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.960
 No, I'm due for another blood test.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:26.840
 My guess is it'll go down, but my real question related to the temperature, I think I can

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.560
 answer those questions after the next blood test.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.040
 My guess is it'll go down dramatically because I am in very good physical shape.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:37.720
 I know you guys say don't jog, but I do do under two miles three times a week, mostly

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.720
 with sprints.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.760
 So I feel that no activity is not useful.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:47.240
 But obviously, as you pointed out, jogging is...

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.240
 Repeatedly running marathons, et cetera, is long-term detrimental.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.480
 But I don't think you go to the other end and literally do nothing but ride a bike.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.920
 I think you've got to do more than that, at least in my case.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.520
 So and I think you said that sprinting is okay in some of your write-ups.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:07.000
 In other words, doing like five, six sprints for 20 yards, et cetera, after sort of warming

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.520
 up and that's...

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.760
 Have your muscles enlarged noticeably since taking the thyroid?

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.760
 Not at all.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.240
 I have the same weight.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:19.240
 My weight goes from 172 to 178.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.880
 It's sort of centered around 175.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.840
 It's been my weight for a long time.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.400
 I do find it drops, though, from in the evening...

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:33.280
 I mean from to sleep to the next morning, but it's usually in that range.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.200
 Mental clarity is so much better.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.680
 But that's really the key.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.880
 That's why I'm used to this.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.880
 And it definitely...

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.160
 You're definitely right about the PUFA.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.560
 There's no doubt about it.

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:54.520
 In the animal experiments, it takes about four years for a complete exchange when you

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.800
 stop eating PUFA.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:04.120
 It's just a random exchange of what's in your present diet and what's in your body.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.040
 And that takes four years to be complete.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:17.440
 So it takes about two years to get a good 50% reduction and you'll start feeling your

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.400
 thyroid more consistently.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.640
 Because for taking three grains, your pulses and temperature do seem pretty low.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.480
 If someone is overweight, it would take four years.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:34.920
 But on the lean side, more muscular and more active, perhaps that accelerates the process.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.760
 But by the way, there's no chance that you can eliminate PUFA.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.280
 I mean, the notion of getting five milligrams per day is like a fantasy.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.440
 You just can't do that.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.000
 It's like impossible for anybody, even you, Dr. Peet.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 There's no way you can limit it to five milligrams, right?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.480
 Because if you add up the milk you drink and the eggs, et cetera...

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.800
 No, five grams, I think, was...

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.080
 Sorry, five grams, not milligrams.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.480
 Five grams, you mentioned, was the limit.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:05.560
 Yeah, it's possible to get it down to a couple of grams a day, which is the inflection point

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:13.200
 where you see cancer correlating very closely to the amount of PUFA in your diet is around

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.160
 four grams per day.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.800
 And so you're pretty safe if you keep it under four grams per day, which you can do just

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:33.680
 by low-fat milk or skimmed milk, fruit, and low-fat cheese and eggs and such.

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.680
 I do all that.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.280
 What I do take is cooked vegetables.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.080
 I've been doing that like twice a day.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.040
 Ironically, I was thinking to myself, sometimes I can't sleep at night, I'm thinking, if you

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.240
 cook food, you're killing the enzymes.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.040
 And if your body, if your stomach's not generating those enzymes, you're going to have trouble

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.520
 breaking down that food, even if there's less PUFA in it.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.240
 I'm wondering whether a digestive enzyme, you know, Lita Lee talks about that.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.880
 I know you know her.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:03.240
 Is that something that ultimately is useful, recognizing you have to worry about additives?

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:09.120
 No, I think if you're going to eat vegetables, they should be thoroughly cooked.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:18.160
 Otherwise, partly the problem is that you can't extract all the nutrients if they aren't

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.160
 thoroughly cooked.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:27.680
 And some of the carbohydrate complexes are going to feed bacteria if they aren't thoroughly

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.160
 cooked.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:38.200
 I think measuring your cholesterol again and having your vitamin D level checked, sometimes

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:45.600
 a deficiency of vitamin D interferes with the way your body is handling the thyroid.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.800
 It probably leads to more reverse T3 production.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:57.600
 But the vitamin D level in the blood should be around the middle of the range, 15 nanograms

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.920
 per milliliter.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:16.520
 The healthiest population for having no thyroid disease, essentially, they were below 0.4

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.480
 on the TSH scale.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.880
 And cholesterol is a pretty good indication of how you're responding to thyroid.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.560
 It should be around 200 or a little less.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:38.840
 And in the 1930s, cholesterol was recognized as a good diagnostic indicator of thyroid

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.680
 function.

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:48.240
 Someone published a study showing that when you removed someone's thyroid gland, immediately

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:53.680
 as the metabolic rate went down, the cholesterol went up.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:04.200
 And when you supplemented thyroid, the cholesterol came down as an exact mirror image of the

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.200
 metabolic rate.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.280
 So I think that's exactly what's going to happen here because before I started your

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:14.520
 program, for years, my total cholesterol was 200 and I had very good levels according to

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.520
 modern medicine.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.280
 When I started your diet, I started eating a lot of ice cream.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.800
 I didn't used to eat that and a lot of milk.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.600
 And I ended up, that's when it skyrocketed to 330.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.960
 But I think when you make a change like this, it's a shock to your body and to your point,

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:35.040
 I think I need to go through another blood test and see what are the impact on the thyroid

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.360
 supplement and the vitamin D level.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.120
 By the way, which was in the 40s, but I'm trying to get that up a little bit.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.240
 It's below 50, but it's not dangerously low.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.680
 It's on the low end, somewhere between 40 and 50.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.200
 But the real question was the temperature and pulse.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:59.440
 Although if your symptoms are not there, is it reasonable to have a pulse that sort of

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:06.280
 ranges between 60 and 70 throughout the day if you're athletic and a temperature that

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.800
 really never gets above 98.2?

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.440
 I wouldn't worry about it.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:20.240
 Some people have a big heart that pumps efficiently and does fine at 65 beats per minute.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240
 Yeah, you're right.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:26.080
 In fact, I was told I had someone when I was a younger kid, they said I had a larger heart.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.280
 I think that exactly might be correct.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.640
 You've been very kind with your time.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.640
 There's one last question.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.920
 This is a real quick one.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.680
 There's another guy named Lawrence Wilson.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.880
 I don't know if you've ever heard of him.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.240
 He's a very prolific writer.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.200
 He deviates from you on a couple of points, no fruits.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.840
 But he says take omega-3s.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.840
 But it's very good.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.560
 And one thing he does say, and I know you're big on coffee, he's big on coffee too, but

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560
 not orally.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.880
 He's big on coffee enemas.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:02.480
 I know in the past you came up once and you mentioned that that can be stressful.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.720
 But the bigger problem for people over 50, one of the biggest problems as you've mentioned

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.760
 is iron toxicity is a real problem.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:14.040
 If you do a coffee enemas on a regular basis, is that a way other than bloodletting to ultimately

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.560
 reduce the toxicity of iron in your body?

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:23.160
 Well, just drinking coffee every time you eat an iron-containing food.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:32.640
 I always have coffee with oysters or eggs or meat because it drastically limits your

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.560
 absorption of iron.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.840
 But my question is, you maybe don't have a position to answer that.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840
 You may not know.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:45.120
 I mean, you know a lot, but maybe you don't have experience in this area.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.680
 Or do you have a view on the coffee enema in terms of it's, not whether it's stressful

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.200
 or not, because it's like running.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.000
 If you run the first time, you're going to be stressed.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.560
 But if you do the same running, you know, 10 weeks in a row, it's not going to be as

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.000
 stressful because your body got used to it.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.360
 So to me, it's a big problem.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.400
 I know there's a lot of benefit some people have from the coffee enema, but I think you

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:18.760
 can get the same benefit, probably more by having it with food so that you don't give

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.640
 yourself a sudden jolt of stimulation.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:26.360
 That's where the stress is.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:31.000
 It can make you burn fuel so fast that you get hypoglycemia.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.480
 Okay, well, I appreciate the calls, caller.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.840
 I don't want to cut you too short, but we do have two more callers that are waiting

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.840
 to get some questions in.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.720
 So let's take this next caller.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.200
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.200
 We lost this one.

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:50.480
 It had to do with endometriosis and IUDs, the relation and the health of that.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.240
 Dr. P, do you think IUDs could be responsible for endometriosis from an irritation point

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.240
 of view?

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:05.880
 Yeah, it's been well established that endometriosis is from the prolonged excessive exposure to

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.600
 estrogen without interruption from progesterone.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:25.080
 And the mechanism of just plain plastic or copper IUD is to send a signal to the ovary

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:32.360
 that the uterus isn't ready for pregnancy because there's a foreign object in it.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:41.700
 The uterus perceives this injury and the signal travels up the fallopian tube and tells the

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.520
 ovary not to make progesterone.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:52.680
 So it's a very specific interruption of your hormone ratio the same way that the birth

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.680
 control pill is.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.520
 Right, so just constant stimulation and estrogen excess with no relief from a progestogenic

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520
 part of the cycle.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520
 Right.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.520
 Okay, very good.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520
 Next caller, you're on the air.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.520
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.520
 Hi, this is Alex.

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.520
 I'm from Southern Humboldt.

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:07.520
 Okay, Alex, what's your question?

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.520
 Yeah, hey, my question is just I went through testicular cancer treatment last year.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:09.520
 I ended up having my left testicle removed and then went through chemotherapy and then

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.520
 after that had a surgery called an RPLND where they removed a section of lymph nodes.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.520
 And I'm just interested in generic advice you'd have for people who are in the hospital

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.520
 and they're not sure what to do.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520
 I mean, I'm not sure what to do.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520
 I mean, I'm not sure what to do.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520
 I mean, I'm not sure what to do.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.520
 I mean, I'm not sure what to do.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.520
 I mean, I'm not sure what to do.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:43.040
 I mean, I'm not sure what to do.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.880
 How old were you at the time?

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.080
 I'm 34 years old.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.720
 I was 32, just about to be 33 at the time of the diagnosis.

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:53.720
 Yeah, was there an understanded testicle or anything like that?

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:55.720
 Or was it lady, no, no.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:51:00.040
 Yeah, none of the kind of the classic things that would have really elevated my risk.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.560
 I didn't have an understanded testicle or anything like that.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.280
 They were both like normal testicles as far as I had known up till that point.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.280
 Okay.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.360
 All right, Dr. P, did you hear the question to begin with?

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:19.600
 Yeah, when experimenters have removed, for example, one adrenal gland or one ovary, I

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:26.120
 don't remember any experiments with removing one testicle, but the removal of some of the

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:35.480
 steroid forming tissue in those other situations causes the pituitary to drive the remaining

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:44.440
 gland twice as hard basically to keep up the systemic level of the steroid production.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:52.200
 And so I think it's important to watch your LH and FSH levels.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:52:03.560
 And there are ways you can, without necessarily supplementing an androgen, but you can reduce

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:13.880
 the stress, keeping your thyroid hormone level up, vitamin D level up, regulating your protein

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:26.160
 and sugar intake carefully, and possibly supplementing pregnenolone, which will feed into the system,

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:37.520
 reducing the exaggerated stress reactions that are more likely if your androgen is low.

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:45.880
 Testosterone works closely with progesterone and pregnenolone to make it less necessary

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.120
 to produce the stress hormones such as cortisol.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:55.040
 Yeah, my testosterone levels are actually up because the one testicle that's left is working

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.960
 double time, so I'm at like the upper range.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.240
 I've been going to UCSF and going to the Ostrich.

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.960
 Do you know what your value is?

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.960
 Is it 6, 700?

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.960
 I think it's up 700, like 750.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.040
 Okay, good.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:18.560
 I think it's good to concentrate on the whole anti-stress process because the androgen is

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:30.920
 probably compensating for the need for all of the stabilizing, quieting hormones.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:39.120
 DHEA and pregnenolone and progesterone have a stabilizing effect.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:47.280
 Pregnenolone is the most neutral of those, and it will hold down the need to produce

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:55.360
 cortisol and help to restrain LH and FSH production by the pituitary.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.240
 Okay, is there anything dietarily?

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.840
 They've got me on vitamin D definitely.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.800
 They want me to have elevated vitamin D levels.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:07.320
 They have me taking mushroom capsules from fungi perfecti, and then it's like fish oil,

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:09.760
 vitamin D, fungi perfecti, mushroom capsules.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.760
 You want to stop the fish oil?

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:12.760
 I think that's about it.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.760
 Yeah, fish oil.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.760
 You want to cut the fish oil out?

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:15.760
 Cut it out?

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:16.760
 How much?

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.760
 How much fish oil?

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.760
 You want to cut it out?

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.760
 Oh, definitely.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760
 Yeah.

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.280
 That's been the mainstay of Dr. Peet's research in the last 40 years is the toxic effects

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.360
 of polyunsaturates, and fish oil is probably the worst of them all.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.360
 Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm well-versed.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.680
 I've listened to your program a million times, and I know that polyunsaturates are a problem.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:39.960
 I guess I was oblivious to the fact that fish oil was included in that category.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.960
 Yeah, very much so.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.960
 Okay.

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:43.960
 So, avoid the fish oil.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.960
 It's definitely not essential.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:52.440
 I mean, the science, I'll go back and listen to the actual chemicals or reactions that

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.960
 you're speaking about, but is there anything dietarily or whatever that you'd recommend,

00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:01.200
 just generically, that would be kind of a soft approach to try to achieve the aims you're

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:04.080
 speaking, you're talking about?

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:11.080
 Supporting the anti-stress effect of vitamin D, a high ratio of calcium to phosphorus is

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.080
 very helpful.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:19.080
 So, cut down your meat intake compared to your dairy intake, or have a good ratio of

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.080
 dairy to meat, and just eat small amounts.

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.080
 Okay.

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.080
 Not a lot of muscle meat.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.600
 If you're going to eat meat, you're better off consuming the bone broths, the knuckle

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.400
 broths and the shanks.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.160
 And the little liver, maybe once or twice a month.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.760
 Yeah, definitely.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:38.640
 I like all the nasty bits, so I've been good about eating all that, and I've been on that

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.760
 kind of a thing like Sally Fallon type diet for a while.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760
 All right.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760
 Well, thank you for your call.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.680
 We're going to have to close it out here because it's three minutes to eight o'clock, and I

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.720
 just want to let people know about Dr. Pete's details.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.480
 So, thanks so much, Dr. Pete, for joining us.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.800
 There's a whole bunch of questions we didn't get to, but great.

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.440
 I'm glad people were listening and coming from all over the globe here.

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.440
 Thanks so much, Dr. Pete.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.440
 Okay.

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.440
 Good night.

00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.440
 Okay.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.080
 So, for those people that have listened to the show, they want to find out more about

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:11.760
 Dr. Pete and his work and the publications that he's produced, or books, or his newsletters,

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:19.360
 or his research articles, it's www.raypeat.com.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.920
 Lots of articles fully referenced.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.040
 Our website is westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:32.520
 Under the resources tab, we've just uploaded all of the shows, including the 2016 and 2017

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:33.520
 shows.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.280
 And, yeah, big fans of Dr. Pete.

00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.160
 He's taught us a lot, and it's how we live.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.960
 So, for those people that called in, I'm glad you joined.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.640
