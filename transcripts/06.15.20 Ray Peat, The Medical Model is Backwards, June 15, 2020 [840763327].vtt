00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.960
 Know the source, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.240
 - Well, welcome to hour two or part two

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.640
 or whatever you wanna call it,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.400
 of our little show here we do virtually every morning,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.440
 except for maybe Thursdays or so,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 on oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.560
 My name is Patrick Timpone,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.160
 and on the third Monday of the month,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.120
 second part of the show,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.600
 we have Dr. Ray Peat on PhD,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.920
 and you'll meet him in just a second.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.200
 Let me just give a quick little plug

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.080
 what's gonna happen tomorrow.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.920
 Christine Northrup is going to be on the show.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.860
 She's really an interesting lady.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.920
 I think you're going to enjoy her.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.240
 Paul Ryder and Brandon Smith on Wednesday,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.680
 and they're both into the geopolitical, financial world,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.760
 and I think you're gonna find both of them

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.600
 well worth listening to.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 So that's coming up Wednesday.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000
 Probably somebody else during this week too.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Dr. Jennifer Daniels next week,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.560
 Richard Mayberry next week.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.000
 A lot of cool things coming up.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.440
 We're gonna have a 4th of July special with Jack Graham,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.840
 and he's gonna tell you some things

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.160
 about the Declaration of Independence

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.560
 that you said, "Whoa,"

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.000
 or the revolution, and that's not possible.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.040
 So that's all coming up.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.140
 So join us now,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 and please just use the email this morning.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.980
 For some reason,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.900
 for some reason, we just can't get the 800 number

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.980
 to be working this morning,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.520
 so we'll work on that, have it for you tomorrow.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.900
 Ray Peat, a PhD, University of Oregon.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.180
 He specialized in physiology.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.720
 He started his work on hormones way back 50 years ago.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.180
 I was getting out of the military, or in the military,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.100
 and Ray Peat was working on hormones in 1968.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.960
 He wrote his dissertation

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.840
 with outlining the ideas on progesterone and hormones,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.680
 so he's been at it for a very long time.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.320
 And as I said, on the third Monday of every month,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.360
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, and he's right here.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.040
 Good morning, sir, how are you?

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.120
 - Good morning, very well.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.360
 - Well, you sound very well.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.000
 How do you spend most of your days these days?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.280
 - Reading, a little pending.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.080
 - I'm sorry, the last--

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.800
 - Mostly just reading, but occasionally painting some.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.200
 - Painting, too, huh?

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.800
 And what kind of things do you read?

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 - Oh, most recently, I was reading about a trial in Spain,

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.080
 the murder of the six Jesuits

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.040
 and their housekeeper and her daughter.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.160
 After 31 years, they're finally bringing the vice,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 vice-minister, I think it is, of defense to trial in Spain

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 for murdering their priest.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.440
 - So you just go for things that are just interesting to you,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.960
 not necessarily always in the health realm.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.360
 - No, no, I try to keep up a little bit on the news.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.040
 - So you sent me your last newsletter, thanks for that,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.400
 and you're saying that your argument of this,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.800
 and I'm just gonna read the first line,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.040
 as in I read it with Dr. Massey,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.880
 is a failure of energy metabolism

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.720
 limits the ability of cells to return

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.440
 from an excited active state to a stable resting state.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.320
 An unresolved excitation causes cells to emit signals

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.760
 indicating the need for repair, inflammatory signals.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.120
 Pre-existing inflammation is associated

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.840
 with high altitude sickness

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.320
 and the ability to get sick from the coronavirus

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.460
 as well as chronic diseases.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.680
 This implies that treatment

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.120
 for a so-called coronavirus infection

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.640
 should be to reduce cellular excitation and inflammation

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.560
 and normalize energy production.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.480
 It also implies that these treatments

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.680
 will have favorable effects on cell aging.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.360
 So Dr. Massey was talking earlier,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.080
 and I wonder if this ties in.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.920
 So is it possible that the lungs and the cells

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.920
 were doing something in response to the body's fear

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.720
 or angst or anything or?

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.360
 - Yeah, the emotions, a person, for example,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.360
 a sick person or an extremely old and frail person

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.340
 will often lose control of their emotions

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.060
 and have exaggerated intensity of emotions.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.340
 That's because the emotional system

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.820
 is stabilized in a young person

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.820
 so that they can experience something very upsetting

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.420
 and within hours or at most maybe a few days,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.140
 they'll be all the way back to normal.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.180
 But if a person's health is a little borderline,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.740
 fairly moderate emotional shock

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.220
 can linger for weeks and weeks

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.540
 like post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.100
 A very tough person can go through the same experience

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.220
 without the brain consequences.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.540
 - So I see, so as the organism is stronger,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.220
 it's easier to deal with the emotions that come up

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.220
 and then let them go and move on.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.140
 I see.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.020
 So you're saying that this is,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.860
 but this is about the lungs as well.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.760
 What's the connection there with the lung?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.580
 - The brain is just an extreme example

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.340
 of what's going on in every kind of cell.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.300
 The idea of excitation and recovery,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.740
 you see it in the nerve as an electrical

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.740
 and chemical change in which you disturb the nerve

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.100
 and it goes into an extreme metabolically intense process

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.420
 and then as it builds up its ATP again,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.300
 it goes back to the resting state

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.540
 and is ready for another stimulus.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.460
 Exactly that same thing happens

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.020
 in secretory cells, for example.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.620
 You irritate it and it'll give a burst of secretion

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.860
 and then if there's energy and oxygen,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.020
 sugar being supplied,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.060
 it'll quickly recover its ability to secrete again.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.060
 The lung surface cells, for example,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.500
 some of them are secreting mucus,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.100
 others secrete various smaller molecules,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.900
 but everything is metabolically active

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.740
 and irritation intensifies that activity

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.260
 and energy helps it return to its ready to work

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.300
 resting state.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.780
 - So is it possible that folks who maybe

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.780
 were sheltered in place and going through stress

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.540
 and being kind of confined,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.860
 that when they are quote unquote allowed

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.980
 to get back out, that the body could be healing,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.780
 which could demonstrate symptoms

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.140
 that they're actually sick?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.260
 - Oh, oh, for sure.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.780
 Especially if they've lost their job or their business

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.260
 while being shut down.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.180
 It's the bigger consequences.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.180
 For some people it's believing what Fauci and Gates

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.180
 are telling them and believing that there's really

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.260
 a special pandemic going on this year or something.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
 Radically different from last year.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.060
 - Is it your research and opinion then

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.900
 that the body then does show symptoms

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.620
 when it's actually getting healing

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.940
 rather than being sick with inflammation and such?

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.660
 - If you're really strong and healthy,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.580
 you can heal a slight wound without inflammation

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.300
 like a healthy fetus.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:21.940
 For example, a surgeon takes a sample of tissue

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.060
 and if the mother is healthy,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.780
 the wound will heal without inflammation

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.820
 and without leaving a scar.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.260
 And a very healthy young person

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.780
 will take a wound that'll close right up

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.100
 without making a big sore inflamed area.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.140
 It just sort of relaxes back into place

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.940
 and starts closing up the wound.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.900
 - So it's the idea then, the stronger and stronger we are,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.300
 the more we can do without being sore,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.220
 like exercising and stuff like that.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.300
 If we haven't for a while,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.020
 the body's gonna react more severely and more.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.100
 - Yeah.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.940
 For example, an old person who suddenly decides to do--

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:04.780
 - Exercise.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.300
 - Weight lifting or whatever

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.220
 will probably have lingering symptoms

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.340
 for three or four days

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.620
 where a young person would be sore overnight

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.260
 maybe but be entirely back in a day or so.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.020
 - Dr. Ray Peat is with us and you can get that newsletter.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.540
 And it's raypeetnewsletter, right?

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.500
 At gmail.com?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.100
 - At gmail.com.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.180
 - Yeah, and Patrick Timpona here with you.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.020
 And as I said, the 800 numbers are off

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.060
 so just do the email thing right now,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.060
 patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.020
 As you know, Dr. Peat, more and more states

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.420
 are now reporting more cases

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.420
 and they use that term, of course, cases.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.180
 And I guess they're tying it into the idea

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.440
 that if you are tested and you're positive,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.580
 then you are a case, right?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.580
 So they're reporting more cases.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.940
 And the governor of Florida came out and said,

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.340
 "Well, yeah, we are, but we're testing 30,000 people a day."

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.100
 So he's kind of catching on to this idea.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.180
 Can you explain to us this test that they're doing?

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.380
 Can you really help us understand

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.980
 exactly what it is testing and what it is not?

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.860
 - Well, even the Centers for Disease Control

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.300
 didn't know what they were testing.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.940
 They were mixing the numbers for both kinds,

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.600
 both major types of tests together.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.580
 So it was ridiculous.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:23.260
 People on the staff and professors were shocked

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.020
 when they learned that the numbers didn't mean anything

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.060
 because they were mixing two totally different types of tests

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.460
 that one showed the presence of the virus,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.260
 the other showed immunity to the virus.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:40.160
 So the government itself has been probably deliberately

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.100
 covering up, blurring,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.180
 essentially destroying meaningful information.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.860
 - So the test today that is being given,

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.860
 and they have this swab thing and even drive-thrus

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.460
 and lots of people are doing it,

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.580
 are they, is it possible that they can actually show

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.220
 a virus that is COVID-19 that is separate

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.300
 from other kind of stuff in the body?

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.300
 Can they really, can they do that?

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.180
 - To a certain extent, it can show.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.900
 Some, sometimes it can be right,

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.380
 but it's often a false positive.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.820
 Junk, junk will sometimes cause the reaction.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.620
 - So junk or antibodies and things like that

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.860
 actually shows up as an actual virus?

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.860
 - Well, other pieces of RNA can get amplified

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:34.420
 and the presence of a certain stretch of RNA

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:40.540
 is older, amplifying and measuring

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.660
 with the polymerase chain reaction test.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.660
 And if they find the presence of the virus,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:56.060
 the fact that somewhere between 35 and 80% of people

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:02.220
 can have the virus present and no symptoms at all.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.220
 So what does it mean if they find the virus present?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.260
 It can be just a few stray viruses

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.860
 that might be stuck somewhere or not,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.700
 since as many as 80% of the people don't have any symptoms

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.140
 when they have the virus.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.900
 The presence of a positive test usually is meaningless.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.020
 Usually it means that they're simply not reacting

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.300
 to a virus, so it isn't a pathogen.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.860
 - So if there's a corona COVID, what's the correct term?

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.100
 Is it COVID-19, that's the actual virus that they claim?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.940
 - Yeah.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.300
 - So, okay, so if this test can show a COVID-19

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.140
 in the PCR tests they're giving in some cases,

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.740
 then that means that that exists.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.220
 I mean, it must exist then, right, somewhere.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:58.580
 - Yeah, they argue that it is the number 19

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.740
 rather than last year's, right?

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.700
 Or some, there are so many of them

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.700
 and they're changing so often that you don't really

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.020
 know for sure what the test was standardized on.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.780
 - I see, so what you're saying, I hear you say

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.460
 it could show up some kind of a corona-type viruses

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.180
 and there's a lot of them, but we don't know

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.020
 that much about it, if it's very special,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.420
 where it came from, is it communicable?

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.980
 - Yeah, these people who make, they get a sample

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:34.540
 that they declare to be the real thing.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.380
 - Right.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.260
 - And then you really have to test the test

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:42.700
 to see whether what it's finding is meaningful.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.540
 - Yes, sir.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.820
 - But they just haven't done any big testing.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:50.260
 The FDA rushed them into use without testing the test.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.100
 So you can show that over and over,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.100
 it will truly reflect the standard you have in the lab.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:04.020
 Yes, it's amplifying that and has a very high reliability

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.300
 for that known virus, but when you go out

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.220
 and test it on people without standardizing the test,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.780
 you don't know how much, how sensitive it is

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.060
 to discriminating against junk RNA.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.820
 - I see, how long would it take, in your opinion,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.820
 to do that correctly?

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.820
 - Several months, probably thousands of people

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.620
 would have to be tested, doing multiple tests

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.180
 when you get a positive and examining them more carefully

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.780
 to see what the positive consists of, for example.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.420
 You should have to test, examine,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.580
 looking for other coronaviruses.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.340
 If you find other coronavirus positives

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.740
 in the person who tested positive for COVID-19,

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.460
 then that weakens the meaning of your test.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.380
 If you aren't testing for other related things,

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.300
 how do you know for sure what you have found?

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.060
 - So all of these different flu and cold viruses,

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.180
 my understanding, they are a corona genre type virus.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.860
 There's a lot of them?

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.460
 - Yeah, the coronavirus has been known

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.780
 to cause colds for decades.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.860
 - So there's no evidence, then,

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.060
 that whatever this COVID-19 is that they've called

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.580
 is any different or stronger or unique?

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.140
 Is there any evidence?

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.060
 - Very, very little evidence.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.500
 The best evidence, the Stanford professors,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.500
 about three months ago, were getting different ways

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.060
 of looking at existing evidence

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.060
 and studies on people in California

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.780
 and looking at the cruise ship that was infected.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.660
 Both of those approaches showed that it was very similar

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.100
 to the standard flu pathogenicity,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.180
 and possibly less, but in the vicinity

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.180
 of a fraction of 1% mortality of those infected,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.820
 which is in the range of the annual flu viruses.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.460
 - Dr. Rapide, is it possible

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.980
 that whatever these PCR tests are seeing

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.780
 that they're claiming is a unique coronavirus

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.660
 could be being produced by the body,

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.860
 an endosome or an exosome has been argued?

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.860
 - Oh, our DNA is full of stuff

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.060
 that looks like RNA viruses.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:40.100
 Some people say that it's half of our DNA,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.460
 which is about twice as much DNA as we need

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.260
 for our genes that construct all of us.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:53.260
 So there is this mysterious, dark, non-genetic DNA,

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:59.100
 which gives signs of being related to the RNA viruses.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.980
 And so it's very possible that stored

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.860
 in this immense amount of DNA,

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.860
 that there are already some overlapping bits of RNA.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.620
 When you're under stress, we put out exosomes,

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.980
 and they're in the same size range

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:24.980
 and structural composition of this type of virus,

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.380
 very similar under the microscope,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.740
 little round particles that are synthesized

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.380
 in a certain part of the cell

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.100
 and stream out of the cell being secreted in the blood.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.460
 But under stress, these are repair particles.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.140
 Injured cells will send signals,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.300
 for example, to the bone marrow,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.900
 and the bone marrow will manufacture exosome material

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.780
 containing RNA and DNA and proteins

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.860
 that help to repair the injured cells

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.460
 in other parts of the body.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.900
 The stem cell system is largely regulated

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.780
 through these exosomes and internal communication system.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.260
 And so the stress that turns those on

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.300
 happens to be the stress that the viruses use

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.660
 to activate their own synthesis and secretion.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.020
 - So is it possible then that stress or poisons

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.540
 or other insults on the body could be producing an exosome

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.860
 that looks just like a virus

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.380
 and is being identified as a virus?

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.940
 - Yeah, the important thing is that

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:41.620
 if the official government-approved researchers

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.620
 won't even look at this gigantic part of our DNA system,

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.860
 they're going to question whether we already have

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.380
 some very similar coronavirus-type RNA

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.700
 in our reservoir of genetic information,

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.420
 which will come out under stress.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.700
 If you don't look at it, you'll never find it.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.220
 - So is it possible that people under stress,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.980
 having to wear a mask, having to stay home,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.980
 losing their job, worried about their finances

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.660
 and their family could be creating these exosomes

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.820
 that could be shown up then as a virus?

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.420
 - Any stress can increase your exosome manufacture,

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:27.420
 but it's a fairly small industry to study

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.900
 of the exosome system.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:36.300
 The basic problem is that it was denied

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:40.820
 as contrary to the basic dogma of genetics

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.300
 and molecular biology.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.740
 It's the epigenetic system.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.980
 RNA viruses were said to be impossible

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.100
 because of the dogma that says information

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.300
 goes only from DNA to RNA to protein.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:02.260
 And so for a virus to contain only RNA,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.380
 but to get into our DNA went in the wrong direction.

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.380
 So the whole thing required about,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.500
 well, 50 years ago it started,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.500
 but the scientific community gradually adapted

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:23.020
 to accept that RNA viruses are a real thing,

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.780
 but seeing the whole genome,

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.460
 the whole DNA content of cells,

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.380
 seeing that as active and functional,

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.700
 that's the hard part.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.820
 They just prefer not to get involved in that,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.580
 especially as it relates to immunity

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.580
 because it opens up the area of doubt

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.460
 about a million fold.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.060
 - Doubt for the germ theory vaccines and pharmaceuticals.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.060
 - Yeah, basically the antibody vaccine theory

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.980
 would totally melt away into nothing

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.420
 if people started looking at the actual immune system.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.340
 - Wow, so Dr. Rapey, then was this what Pasteur was arguing,

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.540
 that there are RNA things out there,

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.420
 viruses that are separate from us and can attack us?

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.460
 I mean, that was his premise, right?

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.540
 - Yeah, there are things out there,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.540
 but the dogma says that they originated separately

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.100
 and what the evidence looks like

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.820
 is that these circulating viruses,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.980
 probably since they can't evolve,

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.740
 they can't exist except in a higher organism.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.900
 You can't evolve a lower thing like a virus

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.980
 if its existence depends on a mammal, for example.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.980
 You can't conceive of it coming into existence de novo,

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:01.260
 so you have to see it as a product of a higher organism.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.820
 We or other organisms under stress create exosomes.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:10.260
 Some of these get emitted into the environment

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.260
 and they spread information between organisms.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.540
 The way bacteria, if one bacterium is exposed

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.540
 to an antibiotic, it can produce a little particle,

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:28.180
 a bacteria equivalent of an exosome,

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.060
 having the genes which make it able

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.820
 to resist the antibiotic

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.580
 and it will approach another bacterium

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:42.580
 of a different strain even, or even a different species.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.580
 There's evidence that this particle can be transmitted

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.300
 across a fair genetic difference.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.580
 So one bacterium sends out a little tube

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.420
 connecting it to another bacterium that wasn't exposed

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.100
 and passes this particle of genetic information

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.260
 and the other bacterium can then integrate it

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.940
 and reproduce and all of its descendants

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.820
 will be immune to antibiotic.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.700
 So if bacteria can do it,

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:21.580
 it's only the genetic dogma of one-way information

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:27.340
 that makes people resistant to looking

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.460
 at the transmission of these particles

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.860
 between organisms.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:36.180
 So if you're around stress organisms,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.500
 this approach would say you're at risk

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.060
 of catching their stress.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:43.420
 - So let's see, so say a husband is stressed

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:46.180
 and creates exosomes and starts the process

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.100
 of healing, I suspect, then the wife

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.140
 could experience the same thing because?

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.820
 He's gonna teach her body, help her body

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.860
 to learn how to become immune from this thing.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.740
 - Yeah, the basic principle would probably be

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.900
 like the bacteria, the bacteria adapted

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.420
 and passed its adaptation onto its neighbors

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:15.420
 and the mechanism as far as it exists

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:19.500
 in plants and animals would be to pass

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.100
 these useful repair units onto other members

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.940
 of the family.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.740
 - Yes, so that could be possible

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.580
 than just a kind of a God, whatever you wanna call it,

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.420
 evolutionary process to make the species stronger.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.300
 Everybody's helping everybody to get stronger,

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.700
 essentially, is what I hear you saying.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.020
 - Yeah, yeah, there have been people

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.020
 making good arguments for this among plants

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.620
 in particular, going back 50, 60 years.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.380
 - So do we always have to feel symptoms,

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.140
 flu-like headache or whatever,

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.700
 when we take on one of these little repair guys

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.700
 to get stronger, do we have to feel bad?

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.900
 - No, not at all.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.740
 - Oh, okay.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.500
 - The fact that they're finding positive RNA evidence

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.100
 of the virus in people who don't have any symptoms at all,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.580
 maybe 80% of the people don't feel anything from it,

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.660
 so it's being passed on and probably integrated

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.580
 and creating better immunity, 80% of the people.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.860
 But if you have a sick, stressed, unhappy,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.820
 malnourished population, they are going

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.620
 to have trouble adapting.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.380
 - Okay, so there will be some people that will die,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.700
 or could die, right, because they're just sick

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.540
 or compromised in preconditions and the rest of it.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.980
 - Yeah, that would be the 1/10 to 1/4 of 1% infected.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.740
 - Yeah, what's happening, because of age and preconditions.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.060
 That's that's--

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.300
 - Yeah, in Spain, or Italy,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:57.260
 the mortality of men is 70%,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:03.940
 about almost three times greater mortality,

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:10.180
 but it's especially old men and young women.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.500
 The only young women that were dying

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.220
 were very, very sick individuals,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.180
 menstruating women of ordinary health

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.020
 were extremely resistant to the infection.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.340
 - Is there any evidence that the mortality rate

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.580
 of this particular virus or this particular flu season

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.380
 is any more severe than others, other years?

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.740
 - Not really, these figures suggest

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.740
 that it's a fairly typical year for mortality.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.860
 A few people have been watching a very odd thing

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.660
 in the CDC figures.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.620
 Starting last fall, we were noticing

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.940
 a very unhistorical decline

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.260
 in the total national mortality, a dip.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:07.700
 People just weren't dying of anything

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.220
 as often as they should.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:14.540
 Old age or accidents or whatever normally kill people.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.140
 There was a great drop in mortality.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:22.140
 Week after week, and 15% in many weeks through the winter.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:27.580
 And suddenly, in the first week of April,

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.180
 the people who had been missing

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.860
 from the national mortality,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.860
 suddenly there was this spike in excess mortality.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.860
 If you somehow had a block

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.340
 between the reporting of the deaths starting last fall

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.300
 and the recording of them in the CDC,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.020
 and then suddenly you broke the barrier

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.580
 to recording these deaths,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.220
 that could account for this huge spike in excess mortality

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.380
 because there had been a buildup

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.860
 of deficient mortality for weeks.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.420
 - So this whole idea of the so-called second wave,

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.580
 what would you expect, just knowing what you,

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.940
 understand how this works,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.020
 if people start to come out of their shelter in place,

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.860
 take off their mask, and don't do the six feet and all that,

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.700
 could we expect to see symptomatics being,

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.540
 you know, whatever they mean, more?

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.620
 And then if people get tested more,

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.860
 the numbers could theoretically, quote, get worse, unquote.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.780
 Possible?

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.900
 - Yeah, I think that's what's happening.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.140
 - That's what's happening.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.500
 - They're confusing the result of testing more.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:39.140
 They're saying, look, we're catching a lot of infections.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.820
 That means it's increasing,

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.460
 but people don't necessarily get sick

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.620
 when they have the virus in them.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.740
 So you shouldn't be looking at anything except who is sick.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.180
 - Yeah, and so in your opinion,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.140
 who is running the show here on a big picture

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.020
 coming up with this story?

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.420
 Is it the WHO and the CDC?

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.920
 And who's involved in this, do you have any idea?

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.260
 - Both of them.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:10.260
 They're tightly integrated with the pharmaceutical industry.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.220
 They are now just another agency

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.940
 controlled by not only the pharmaceutical industry,

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:21.140
 but if you look at what happened last fall

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.500
 in the Federal Reserve System,

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.820
 they started putting out that $6 trillion

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.180
 into the economy last fall

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.620
 before anyone was talking about a virus at all.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.900
 And then there was historically

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.500
 a big wave of resignations of CEOs

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.860
 of the biggest corporations late last fall,

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.940
 long before the stock market crash.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.320
 So they had inside news.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:57.340
 I saw a video in which Bill Gates was saying,

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.100
 "We were totally unprepared.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.220
 "We weren't anticipating this at all.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.860
 "We need to do better

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.860
 "and be anticipating further waves of infection."

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:17.020
 But he was one of the motivators of a program

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:23.180
 to model and create a play

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.880
 of how they would respond to it.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:33.500
 They had leaders of industry and finance

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.500
 and the health systems pharmaceutical industry

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.340
 get together last October

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.020
 and anticipate how they would respond to a pandemic

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.780
 caused by a coronavirus imported into the United States.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.060
 So it was all sketched out

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.580
 that they would have a dramatic new way

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.060
 of responding to a pandemic.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.620
 And a pandemic isn't necessarily a big thing.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:07.620
 There can be an international wave of cold.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.820
 Doesn't mean it's going to be anything deadly

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.020
 or very harmful.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.340
 - Are you speaking of the 2001 thing that they had?

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.460
 - Event 201.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.940
 - Yeah, Event 201, that was sponsored by the Gates.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.300
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.540
 - Yeah, very interesting.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.180
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us,

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.700
 Patrick Timpone on Radionetwork.com.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.700
 He's here on the third Monday at around 10.30.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.940
 Started a few minutes late.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.060
 Stay right there, Dr. Peat.

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:34.980
 We're gonna do a quick break

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.900
 and then we're gonna dig into your emails.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.780
 Over 7 trillion right now on the Fed's balance sheet.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.060
 So that's about, oh, I think 3 trillion or so

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.740
 treasury bonds that have been purchased

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.580
 by the private Federal Reserve Bank

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.980
 in the last three or four months.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.940
 We're gonna be speaking more about this

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.580
 with Brandon Smith of AltFinance.com.

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.600
 Very interesting fellow.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.100
 He's gonna be on 11 o'clock on Wednesday.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.980
 So we'll keep you abreast of this.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.100
 And then just so you know,

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.660
 there's about 3 trillion more that have been going out

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.380
 through the Fed, through the back door,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.700
 without being on their balance sheet,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.540
 going through hedge funds like BlackRock

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.380
 and things like that.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.540
 So this stuff is all out there if you look for it.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.980
 And so we try to keep you updated.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.740
 Well, it's a big challenge to living on planet Earth

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.780
 with cell phones, Wi-Fis and stuff.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.100
 We don't recommend you have a Wi-Fi in your home,

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.300
 but we do what we can.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.140
 I know your kids and you probably like to sit on the couch

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.100
 and play with your phone and say you like Wi-Fi,

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:30.940
 but don't do that.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.300
 So if you do do that, something like this will help you.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.380
 And this will help you even if you don't have Wi-Fi.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.620
 Previously, we talked with Brandon Amelani

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.980
 about his Blue Shield product

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.420
 to protect against EMFs in your home.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.340
 - The more connected we are,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.460
 the more electromagnetic radiation we're gonna have.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.260
 So years ago, I'd play with Q-Links

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.720
 and just anything I can get my hands on

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.540
 that whether I felt it working or not,

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:50.740
 I just wanted some kind of leverage

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.260
 against electromagnetic radiation and those frequencies

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.940
 and how they affect the cellular biology.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.180
 But then when I met Mark

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.300
 and started really getting deep to his technology

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.580
 and really looking at the microprocessing technology,

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:02.780
 I've never found any EMF company

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.340
 that would not only to test on

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.100
 not only human blood and urine analysis,

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.380
 but also on animals,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.980
 which totally weeds out the idea of placebo effect.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.460
 I mean, the fact that you can plug these devices

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.220
 into a chicken farm, a factory farm,

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.420
 for about 15,000 laying hens,

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.260
 and all of a sudden the mortality rate,

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.500
 which is averages from 60 to 150 deaths per month

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.540
 goes down to zero.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.860
 I mean, it's pretty profound that a little device,

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.620
 a little energy device could actually like

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.140
 create such a harmony and balance within the environment

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.020
 to where claustrophobic chickens

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.220
 that are crammed in together actually get along better

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.180
 and actually feel better.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.340
 And the biological markers are improved

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.580
 over that one year study.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.660

 we have a great probiotic line.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.300
 Check out Richard Ulrey here.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.300
 Dr. Richard Ulrey, authority on minerals,

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.180
 talks about gut bacteria, making the vitamins,

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.540
 and absorbing the minerals.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.780
 How it all works.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.820
 We need vitamins from our gut bacteria

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.620
 so we can absorb minerals,

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.100
 and then minerals provide a resonant frequency.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.360
 And those minerals carry these frequencies into the body,

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.060
 and multiple minerals will give you a frequency

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.280
 that allows all of our proteins

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.780
 to have individual distinct frequencies,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.600
 giving that three-dimensional structure.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.000
 This is where Wayne's products, Living Stream,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.880
 and that's the only primary products I carry.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.520
 When you do a stool test,

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.200
 and it says you don't have any bifalbacteria,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.000
 well, if you don't have any bifalbacteria,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.340
 you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.280
 If you don't have any lactobacillus,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.360
 you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.280
 - Here's an idea of a couple of the Living Streams

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.040
 you can take for what we're talking about here.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.300
 Bifido, Living Streams Multi-Blend,

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.620
 and the living minerals.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.380
 So we get in the minerals, the bifido,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.820
 and the lactobacillus.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.180
 And these special probiotics and minerals

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.580
 are all in human DNA form,

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.020
 and they are living alive.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.460
 In our store on oneradionetwork.com.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.460
 We've added two new products to our offerings

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.200
 that we're very excited about.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.660
 And one is the AquaTrue,

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:53.240
 AquaTrue Top of the Counter Reverse Osmosis System.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:55.380
 If you're watching on Facebook and YouTube,

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.620
 you'll see that, but you'll see it on the front page.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.140
 And it's really good one.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.740
 We've seen the lab analysis,

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.780
 and man, it cleans it all out, everything.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.740
 It's like a distiller on the top of it,

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.460
 but it's reverse osmosis.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.500
 But it's a very nice design

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.060
 where it's on the top of the counter.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.340
 We really like that.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.640
 And then check it out.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.860
 They have payment plans that are just terrific.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.480
 You just have, just with reasonable, reasonable credit,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.100
 you can just get a quick little thing here

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:28.100
 where you do 12 monthly payments at zero interest.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.060
 Isn't that cool?

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.900
 And then you can also do three monthly payments.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.100
 So these are really interesting.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.140
 I know many of you have been wanting

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.620
 to try to find a more affordable reverse osmosis system.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.220
 And you just keep the filters changed,

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.420
 and you'll be good to go.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.540
 It's called the AquaTrue,

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.320
 and it's on the front page of One Radio Network.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.260
 Click on there, and you can pay it.

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:53.260
 And I think the whole price is 3.29, something like that.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.640
 For the whole deal, you can do that straight away,

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.380
 or you can do monthly payments,

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:02.140
 either three payments at 99.99.66,

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.220
 and then, or 12 monthly payments.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.180
 So good stuff that we're finding.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.260
 And these are nice units.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:09.840
 I think you're gonna enjoy them.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.940
 And it's, you know, it'd be better than buying,

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.420
 you know, a lot of bottled water and stuff like that.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.720
 I mean, it's really nice water, and it's very important.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.480
 The AquaCure, AquaTrue, on oneradionetwork.com.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.840
 - Know the source, One Radio Network.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.880
 - Dr. Ray Peat, who's been at this health investigative

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.640
 and game for 50 years now.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.480
 You had your PhD 50 years ago, Doc.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.240
 - I'm, actually, it was in 1972.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.640
 - Oh, '72. - Yeah.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.200
 - Wow, 40 years ago, yeah.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.800
 What did you, when you were back there doing your PhD

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.960
 and the whole hormone thing,

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.760
 what was your kind of vision of where you,

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.440
 did you have an idea of where you wanted to go

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.840
 with all of this back there 40 years ago?

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.580
 - Oh, yeah.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:59.580
 In 1970, I sketched out about five ideas

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.680
 that I thought might be acceptable to the establishment

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.680
 in the next 10 or 20, at most, by the end of the century.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.400
 And one of those, I wrote up, sent to a journal,

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.680
 and it was published, Gilbert Ling was the editor

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.640
 of that journal, published in 1971.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.520
 And I was sure that those ideas,

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.680
 that there was so much movement in that direction,

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.160
 I thought they would be the standard by the 1990s.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.160
 And it's true that the supporting evidence

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.400
 has been very heavy in that direction.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:53.040
 But the power from the pharmaceutical industry

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.040
 to return to the 1950 paradigm of how the body works

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:04.360
 is so great that despite all of the movement in physics,

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.680
 chemistry, and cell physiology,

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.480
 the investment in medical school,

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.640
 advertising, product promotion, and so on,

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:22.640
 has been able to blot that out,

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.720
 stigmatize the actual facts,

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:30.720
 so that the dogma is now riding so far above the evidence

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.240
 that you see the journals reacting to the COVID problem

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:43.000
 in a basically insane way.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 I scanned through the PubMed what the journals were saying

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.100
 about nitric oxide, for example.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.520
 There's overwhelming recommendation in the journals

00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:01.120
 to treat COVID by having the person breathe nitric oxide

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.280
 or take drugs that will increase its production.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.960
 Pulmonary hypertension has been actually treated

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.320
 by giving them sildenafil,

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.120
 what's the male erection drug called,

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:24.640
 to create more nitric oxide as a treatment

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.880
 for lung problems.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.200
 But in fact, inflammation anywhere,

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.080
 especially in the lungs, creates more nitric oxide.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.320
 Nitric oxide creates inflammation and tissue damage.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.320
 And people who are susceptible to lung disease,

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.840
 for example, the people before they go to a high altitude,

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.880
 the ones who are going to get altitude sickness

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.120
 with COVID-like symptoms in their lungs,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.960
 these people are already at sea level

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.280
 exhaling more nitric oxide than normal.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:04.640
 And as they ascend, the nitric oxide increases

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:09.640
 and develops into pulmonary respiratory problems,

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.720
 edema of the lungs.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.520
 So they take some mechanical dogma

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.200
 promoted by drug salesmen,

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:26.200
 saying that this is how the drug works

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.760
 and that it will kill viruses, for example.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.240
 So it's appropriate.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.240
 But it means that they're recommending the harmful things.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.080
 At the same time, they're denying,

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:42.880
 like Lancet immediately came out with a journal article

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.880
 saying do not give a treatment

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:52.160
 that would be appropriate for high altitude pulmonary edema.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.120
 Don't use Losartan, for example.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:02.320
 And when all of this proves to be

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.160
 absolutely 180 degrees false,

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.120
 they'll just blindly go on and say,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.920
 well, that never happened.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.160
 We always recommended anti-inflammatory things

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.560
 and treating the symptoms and so on.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.880
 - In simplistic terms, in '71,

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.040
 when you submitted this article to Gilbert Ling,

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.200
 what was the basic differences,

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.480
 what you were saying, how the body works

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.360
 and what the AMA and the rest were saying?

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.840
 - For example, that the cell is structured

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.200
 all the way down to the atomic level.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.200
 Water is organized in the healthy living state

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.520
 and the disorganization of the cell,

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.520
 starting with the water, can be measured.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.200
 You can see the precancerous conditions

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.800
 by measuring the water.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.920
 And you can see the effect of aging, stress,

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.400
 estrogen excess as changes in the water structure.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.600
 In the animal, it'll happen half of a lifespan

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.440
 away from the terminal state,

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.040
 but you can see it coming

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.120
 if you look at the fine structure of the cell,

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.320
 especially the water.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.680
 - So what Pollack and other people are arguing,

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.800
 Dr. Pollack, the water structure

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.960
 inside our body is important.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.800
 - Oh yeah.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.640
 - Yeah, wow.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.640
 - It's the idea that the cell energy exists

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.080
 in the form of structure.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:34.920
 - Structure.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.360
 And there is evidence that 5G

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.040
 and other electromagnetic fields disrupts

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.760
 the structure of the water in the body.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.760
 - Yeah, in 1968, just before I went to start graduate school,

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.240
 I visited a lab in Russia, Yuri Holodov,

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.920
 who had been studying electromagnetic

00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.640
 and magnetic fields effects on cell water, cell structure.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.440
 And he gave me a great list of studies

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.280
 that had already been done.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.280
 And those just generally weren't available

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.760
 and were totally unknown in US science.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.960
 - And what year was this?

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.000
 - '68.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.560
 - '68, this was pre-cell phones.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.800
 He was talking about what kind of electrical forces.

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.800
 - He was using all sorts of direct,

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.000
 steady magnetic fields,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.880
 but the worst are particular frequencies

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.840
 that the cell resonates to.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.400
 - Has there ever been any studies with cell phones

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.000
 or cell phone towers and Wi-Fi's

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.520
 tying all this in together?

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.600
 - Oh, yeah, lots of studies,

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.640
 but the proportion of them focusing

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.560
 on how it acts on water structure,

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.080
 it's still very small.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.520
 - Are most of the studies they've done

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.240
 with the potential ill effects of cell phones

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.600
 are just simply the heat that comes out of these?

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.440
 Is that correct?

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.200
 - That was the main line story,

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.240
 starting back in 1940s and '50s

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.240
 when sailors were being melted

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.840
 by getting in front of a radar.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.880
 The scientific response was it's all the heat,

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.880
 and that has gone on all through the last century,

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.200
 claiming that there is no effect other than heat.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:37.200
 And so if the energy level is too small

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.680
 to heat the cell,

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:40.840
 that then there's nothing else it can do.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:45.840
 That ignores the fact all radiation interacts with matter

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:54.400
 with a sort of an antenna effect.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.320
 An antenna for radio or television

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.240
 is stretching a conductor out through space,

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.720
 so it absorbs long wave energy

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.320
 and allows it to be directed to your detector.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:14.320
 But x-rays and ultraviolet and so on,

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:19.760
 molecular electronic resonance within a molecule

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.200
 or inside an atom,

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.160
 it's still the principle of an antenna.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.440
 The wavelength relating to the structure

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:33.440
 that is organized will act on that structure

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.680
 and excite it, change its chemical properties and so on.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:43.680
 And if you deny that there is any meaningful structure

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:48.440
 between the molecular size and the whole cell size,

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:52.240
 then you are deliberately blinding yourself

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.000
 to all of these antenna effects

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.640
 that relate to frequencies that can resonate

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.640
 with all of the size ranges

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:05.520
 between a molecule and a cell or an organ.

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.400
 In studies with monkeys and rats,

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:12.000
 they found that the wavelength equivalent

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.280
 to the size of the brain or the capsule around any organ

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:20.240
 is more toxic than wavelengths.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.600
 For example, if you have a wavelength

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:28.600
 that's an inch long or three inches long,

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:33.020
 the inch long will affect glands of that size.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:37.480
 For example, the gonads, the one that's three inches long

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.860
 will affect the brain more than the gonads.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.340
 And the same principle applies

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.020
 to all of the levels downward,

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.980
 especially all of the levels of organization

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.060
 inside the cell.

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.520
 - So you're saying that if the basic structure

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.020
 is denied by the science,

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.860
 then are you saying they'll never get to the truth

00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.580
 of the effects of VMFs?

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.940
 - Yeah, part of that denial is to say

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.260
 that everything that happens inside the cell

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:12.260
 is like the reactions that would happen in a test tube.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:15.940
 It's molecules in solution simply,

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.140
 and it's the membrane that acts like the test tube.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:26.660
 All of standard biochemistry is committed to this dogma

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:28.660
 that if you grind up a cell

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:32.900
 and put it in a test tube with a watery solution,

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.580
 you can infer anything that happens in the test tube

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.940
 to what happens in the cell

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.140
 because it's all a matter of randomness in solution,

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.900
 even though you grind up the cell

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.660
 and destroy the life of the cell,

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.340
 which is what you were trying to study.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.700
 - You're painting the picture,

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.300
 if we are allowing this dogma

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.300
 to control the science behind all of the EMFs,

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.700
 it doesn't really paint a very favorable picture

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.940
 for consumers to ever have this technology get fixed

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.020
 or slowed down or stopped.

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:08.180
 - Yeah, and people just have to start seeing

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:12.220
 that the science that's used as a marketing tool

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.540
 to say it's all safe, don't study it anymore,

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:19.380
 it applies to actually every part

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:24.180
 of the medical pharmaceutical industries

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.900
 because they're all denying

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.820
 the meaning of structure in the cell.

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.580
 - Oh, including the AMA?

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.260
 - Oh yeah.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.340
 - The structure of the cell.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.540
 So how did you get onto this so early on?

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.700
 What was your awakening moment?

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:45.500
 - Gradually, political, listening to politicians

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.500
 and discovering that they're all lying almost all the time

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:55.060
 made me suspicious of,

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:58.020
 especially when politics and medicine get connected.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.980
 I started listening for the lies

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:05.980
 and saw that not only medicine, but basic science,

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:11.620
 they don't want any questions asked about their assumptions.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:19.260
 I spoke to a few famous biochemists

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.620
 and asked them if they didn't think

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.420
 that it would be better to use techniques

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.380
 that studied biochemistry and biophysics inside cells

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.060
 rather than squashing the cell,

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.580
 putting it in a test tube.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.300
 And they just laughed and scoffed

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:40.020
 and what a ridiculous idea.

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.940
 - Dr. Ray Peters with his PhD.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:45.420
 We're gonna dig back and get some leftovers from last month.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.740
 And I'm sorry we get behind

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.500
 because it's so fascinating talking with this man.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.060
 Here is an email, Dr. Peat.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.540
 It was about, they wanted to know about the time off,

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:56.980
 progestease as in a natural cycle

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.860
 when ingested or rub on the gums.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.220
 And he said, which he did answer,

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.820
 but I did want to know if time off is also necessary

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.300
 if it is used only by rubbing into skin

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.780
 and also if that would be the same for male.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.580
 - Oh, it's when you're using big doses

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.820
 that you feel systemically.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.780
 That's where the liver becomes more and more active

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.980
 at excreting it when you're getting these big doses

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.820
 on the level of a normal menstrual cycle.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:29.660
 And after two weeks of using it,

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.980
 your liver is throwing it off quickly.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:37.500
 So it would only keep rising if you became pregnant.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.340
 And that means that if you are not pregnant

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:43.020
 and have to keep dosing it,

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.620
 that the dose would have to increase

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.020
 in proportion to the liver's activity.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.260
 So to make it more efficient,

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:53.420
 laying off for a week or two lets your liver reset

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.540
 so that you're not excreting it so fast.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:00.260
 But if you're just using it for a topical effect,

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:05.060
 for like a sprain or a burn or something,

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.140
 your local effect is not gonna be harmed.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.300
 - Here's an email from Rose.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:13.780
 She said, "I've been on Synthroid for 30 years.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.060
 "And because of the current virus,

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.500
 "I've been starting to take my temperature

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.340
 "in about 96 1/2 to 97 1/2.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.500
 "What can I do to cause my thyroid

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.060
 "to function more normally?"

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.180
 She wants to get her temperature up.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.560
 - The conversion especially happens mostly in the liver,

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:33.180
 but in each tissue that needs energy,

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:38.180
 it requires glucose and selenium to do the conversion.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:43.500
 And women, by having a higher estrogen production,

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:50.060
 automatically have a weaker thyroid function systemically.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:54.260
 That's why women have about five times

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:56.260
 the rate of thyroid problems

00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:00.580
 because the estrogen affects the liver and the thyroid.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.220
 - And then she wants to know

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.940
 how she could get her thyroid to make,

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.260
 you know, to be just better.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:13.140
 - Sometimes selenium or getting more sugar in the diet,

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.780
 like orange juice, more frequently,

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.780
 sometimes that will get the conversion going.

00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:23.300
 But sometimes a few doses of progesterone

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.100
 can shift the balance,

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.420
 activating the thyroid gland and liver,

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:32.220
 which will then tend to stabilize your blood sugar

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.060
 so that the glucose is available

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.740
 for doing the conversion of T4 to T3.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.580
 - All right, interesting.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.860
 Mark wants to know,

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.740
 "What do I take for a cold sore and what causes them?"

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:47.740
 - Oh, it's almost always a herpes virus.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.940
 And the stress, systemic stress,

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:56.940
 pituitary activation is behind the nerve.

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.660
 It's the same thing.

00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:04.300
 Your energy dips and lets the nerve get excited.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.340
 And the excitation of the nerve gives the virus a chance

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:10.100
 to reproduce and travel out to the skin.

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:14.180
 And so basically keeping your thyroid hormone up

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.260
 so that your blood sugar is stable

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.980
 and doesn't let your nerves go into these stress states

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.660
 of prolonged excitation.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.940
 And then topically, aspirin.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.180
 Well, systemically, aspirin is antiviral

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:31.860
 as well as anti-inflammatory.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.100
 So it can reduce the number of outbreaks

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:38.620
 as well as minimizing the extent of the damage.

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:43.020
 But putting a concentrated solution of aspirin and alcohol,

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.740
 for example, on the outbreak is a safe way

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:51.460
 to reduce the growth of the sore and spreading.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.940
 - So many people have talked about over the years

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.020
 how this little herpes thing doesn't really want

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.820
 to ever go away and it keeps popping back up under stress.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.860
 Is there something unique with this virus

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.980
 that seems to be, I guess, everywhere?

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.700
 Isn't it that it wants to hang out

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.940
 and doesn't want to stay more dormant?

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:12.940
 - I think it's just the stressfulness of society.

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:18.820
 Not very good diet, electromagnetic stress

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.260
 in the background all the time.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.700
 - And it just seems to be one of the ones

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.500
 that pop out more frequently.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.340
 - Yeah.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.180
 - Yeah, for whatever reason.

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.620
 Here is an email from Eric.

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.420
 He's in Finland, good for Finland.

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:33.420
 I have heard that as much as 10,000 I use of vitamin E

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:37.380
 during a pandemic and otherwise a daily basis.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.820
 So what does Dr. Peat think about this?

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.860
 Oh, 5,000 every day, but 10,000 during a pandemic

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.820
 of vitamin E.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:45.780
 - Vitamin D.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.660
 - I'm sorry, vitamin, oh D, vitamin D.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:53.660
 - Yeah, it overlaps with progesterone

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:57.620
 in its cell protective stabilizing actions.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:02.020
 And it's been recognized as improving immunity

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:05.620
 against viruses, but it's working

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:09.260
 on the same energy stabilizing system.

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:13.620
 It's being considered one of the neuro steroids

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.220
 along with progesterone for brain protective effect.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.780
 - Just a reminder on One Radio Network

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:20.420
 and all of our guests, we don't give any kind

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.140
 of medical advice, we're not qualified.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.020
 We just give ideas about a research

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:27.420
 and do as thy will and take responsibility

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.140
 for anything that you do in your life.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.820
 And we'd like to remind you that, Dr. Peat,

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.260
 this is from Chris in Canada.

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.180
 What could possibly cause sudden drop

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:38.020
 in blood pressure to something like 79 over 59,

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.700
 making the person's arms feel numb

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.100
 and progressing to the rest of the body

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.300
 just for a minute or two,

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.700
 and then the blood pressure could return to normal.

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.100
 What could possibly be causing that?

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.460
 - Digestive things are sometimes behind it,

00:56:52.460 --> 00:56:57.380
 a surge of toxins from the intestine, for example.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:01.620
 I don't think any particular hormones

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:06.620
 have been identified for those sudden sharp drops.

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:10.460
 I think in the background, low thyroid people

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.620
 are more likely to experience those,

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:17.380
 similar to a person who's been squatting

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:21.140
 for an hour or so standing up

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:25.780
 will more likely experience a blacking out.

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.900
 The blood pressure doesn't respond as quickly

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.220
 if you have a background of low thyroid activity.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.500
 - So the getting dizzy, one, one is down,

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.980
 that was said to be adrenal,

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.740
 but you're suggesting that's a low thyroid.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:44.380
 - Yeah, the adrenals don't respond as quickly

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.180
 when your thyroid is low.

00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.180
 - Here's another listener,

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.500
 this one in Europe and Germany from Nuri.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.980
 "What's the physiological dosage," writes Nuri,

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:55.220
 "of the T4 thyroid hormone?

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:58.780
 "I take 175, but I still have hypothyroid symptoms

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.460
 "and tend to have hyperadrenal function,

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.580
 "which I block with propranolol."

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:04.900
 Propranolol.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:08.180
 - T4 isn't the thyroid hormone.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.180
 It's a precursor to the active hormone.

00:58:11.180 --> 00:58:14.500
 And it's the same as with women,

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:16.980
 several times more frequently than men.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.820
 But it can happen in men too,

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:23.660
 that the conversion of many things,

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:25.780
 such as a selenium deficient,

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.100
 can make the liver and other tissues reluctant

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.940
 to convert the T4 to the active hormone.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.220
 Prolonged stress hormones will tend to make it

00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.700
 go the wrong direction,

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:41.060
 towards reverse T3 rather than active T3.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:45.100
 Getting a better diet,

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:49.580
 but the simplest thing is to use a combination,

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.500
 such as natural.

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.820
 The traditional armor thyroid

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.060
 was what thyroid treatment was based on

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:01.860
 for the first 50 or 60 years.

00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:04.460
 And then the drug companies got involved

00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:09.460
 testing their T4 product on young male medical students,

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.940
 healthy male young individuals.

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:17.140
 And they said it worked just like the thyroid hormone,

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:19.140
 just like the natural thing.

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:24.140
 But it's exactly slightly older women

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.220
 who they should have tested it on,

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:30.380
 because you would have found that in women

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.660
 in their 30s and 40s, for example,

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.740
 just about as often as it improves things,

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.940
 it makes things worse to take only thyroxine.

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:40.780
 - I see.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:44.140
 So what if there are people that offer just,

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.500
 I don't know, it's not desiccated,

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.500
 I guess it's just beef thyroid from grass fed cows,

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.660
 and that's what it is, somehow they dry it.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:54.460
 I mean, would you have to be careful taking that?

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:59.340
 - The government required meat packers

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:04.340
 to discard the thyroid gland starting in the early 1940s.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:07.660
 Before that, it had been included in sausages.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:13.180
 People living on farms would include the thyroid

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.220
 in soups, sausages.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:20.220
 Their regular diet would include

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.780
 maybe half a grain equivalent, 30 milligrams of gland,

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.420
 if they were eating chicken or fish

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.500
 or beef sausage regularly.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.900
 - So just to dry it up, thyroid,

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.860
 these are from, I think, New Zealand.

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.260
 Would that have all the good stuff that people wanted

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.500
 and they could try this instead of the other,

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.580
 you know, pharmaceutical stuff?

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.820
 - Yeah, the thing is that Armour used to have

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.420
 a standardized way of extracting the fat,

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.580
 the fat and dehydrating it and testing the potency

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.340
 on mice, every batch.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:58.140
 So every Armour thyroid pill was highly standardized

01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.940
 with biological testing.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.420
 And now none of that is done.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.300
 The preparation is very different.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.300
 And so you can hardly tell what to expect

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.700
 when you take a natural thyroid product.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.740
 - I see, so early on, Armour, you were saying

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:17.140
 were just doing similar to what you could actually

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.180
 get online without a prescription.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.580
 It's just a beef--

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.580
 - Yeah, some of them that are deep added

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:28.900
 and dehydrated and pure stuff will be three times

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.380
 as strong as the old Armour.

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.940
 Very, very potent.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.740
 And others prepared in a different way will be so weak,

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.740
 you hardly feel the effect if you take 150 milligrams of it.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.700
 - Very interesting.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.340
 This is from Thomas, he's in Sweden.

01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:48.140
 Boy, we have a European contingency.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.300
 Well, these are from last month.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.300
 I'm still working on last month's emails, God.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.660
 Let's see, it was quite a nightly problem with leg cramps.

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.940
 And I was trying things like magnesium,

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.700
 potassium supplements, and it would get really bad

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.900
 if I had indulgence something sweet or salty in the evening.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.300
 Finally, I understood the best cure for this

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:10.340
 was almost instantaneous was to limp over to the kitchen

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.820
 and drink a big glass of water.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.340
 Now, I just wonder what could be the root cause of this

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.340
 if the hydration could have fixed the problem?

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.980
 - Possibly dehydration.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.140
 - It's just dehydration.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.260
 - Yeah, the pH of the blood changes

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.820
 if you're suddenly dehydrated.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.660
 But milk is a very good bedtime snack

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.220
 because it lowers several of the stress,

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.980
 almost all of the stress hormones are lowered

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.860
 by the content of milk.

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.700
 - So the idea, that's where it comes from,

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.420
 warm glass of milk before bed kind of works.

01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.220
 Dr. Peat, somebody wants to know about your soap.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.140
 Is there any natural soaps that are without proofers?

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:50.980
 Do we get proofers by using soaps with proofers?

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.900
 - By using what?

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:56.900
 - By using soap with polyunsaturated fatty acids.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:02.180
 - Coconut and olive oils are the traditional best for soaps.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:06.980
 And the polyunsaturated fats

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:09.580
 tend to make the soap go rancid quickly.

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:13.820
 So that's why they've historically preferred coconut oil.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.660
 - Coconut oil.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.180
 - And olive oil.

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.300
 - Do you think extra virgin,

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.380
 or I think you had a favorite kind of coconut oil,

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.300
 is a good thing for many people,

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.420
 most, you use your words, to consume regularly,

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.620
 like a big glob of it?

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.060
 Is it good for us?

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.340
 - If it's well refined.

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.860
 Some people are very allergic to coconut,

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:36.940
 so it's good to be cautious.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.940
 Even some refining doesn't get the,

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.940
 if it has a fragrant coconut odor,

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:49.460
 then you have to watch out for the allergens.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.580
 - But allergic reactions,

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:53.980
 you're only a cautionary tale for coconut oil?

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.960
 - Yeah, otherwise it's very safe,

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.940
 and helps to oppose the toxic effects

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.660
 of polyunsaturated fats.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:04.860
 - Oh, it's a counter to a poofus.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.900
 - Yeah. - Oh, that's great.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:08.500
 But you like to refine because of the allergic,

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.260
 the allergy potential.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.380
 - Yeah. - Right.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:16.260
 - Some people will have a very strong asthma attack,

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:18.820
 or hemorrhoids, or other symptoms from it.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.180
 - Here's an email from Mary.

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:24.380
 Can Dr. Peat talk about the physiologic role

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.180
 of norepinephrine and noreladrenaline?

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:29.780
 Norelpinephrine and noreladrenaline.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:35.820
 - It's the norepinephrine, was that the first one?

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:40.260
 - Yes, norelepinephrine and then noreladrenaline.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.540
 - They're the same thing.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.260
 - Same thing, okay.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.580
 - The nor is the type that nerves,

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:50.540
 other than the adrenal glands, form,

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:53.020
 but their effect is very similar.

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:53.840
 - Here's a good one.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.940
 50-year-old woman, slightly overweight, menopausal.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.100
 I drink milk, OJ, collagen, and honey before bed.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.900
 I seem to wake up every day at 3 a.m., wide awake,

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.300
 difficult to fall back to sleep.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.340
 Any thoughts?

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:09.740
 - It's okay to just wake up and have a snack,

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.900
 a glass of milk or orange juice.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.900
 As the liver gets inefficient from such things

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.180
 as PUFA exposure, estrogen exposure,

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:25.100
 hypothyroid, or other nutritional deficiencies,

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.740
 it becomes less able to store glycogen enough

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.220
 for the whole night.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.140
 - Hannah's also in Finland.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.780
 She says, "Can you give some advice

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.580
 "on how to get rid of varicose veins?

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:39.420
 "Is natural progesterone lotion useful?"

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.420
 - Can help, but getting your estrogen under control,

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:49.340
 the reason they so commonly develop during pregnancy

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:54.340
 is not only the pressure on the veins and the pelvis,

01:05:55.460 --> 01:06:00.460
 but the estrogen stops the smooth muscle,

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.340
 reduces the smooth muscle tone,

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.340
 and progesterone activates a smooth muscle contraction.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.500
 So getting the ratio in your body systemically

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.280
 in favor of progesterone is the important thing.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.740
 The veins are just a symptom.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.940
 Your whole body is experiencing an imbalance,

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.460
 so your health will benefit.

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.140
 If you have a blood test, for example,

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:31.140
 and get your progesterone at least,

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.900
 depending on your age,

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.500
 but it should be a few times at least greater

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.220
 than the estrogen level.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.420
 - Here's an interesting question.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.740
 This is from George.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.820
 He is in, I don't know where he is.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.980
 "When I have something with butter

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.020
 "and a little maple syrup in the middle of the night,

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.700
 "it really helps me to go back to sleep

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:50.540
 "sometime for four or five hours.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:53.220
 "Could this be telling me about my body?"

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.060
 That's a good question.

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.580
 What could that be saying that George's body

01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:01.100
 is needing more of if he has butter and maple syrup?

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.180
 - The maple syrup comes with some very good minerals,

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:09.580
 a lot of potassium that helps the sugar work,

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.580
 and the sugar is kept in your stomach and intestine

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.100
 longer when there's butter with it.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:18.940
 - That's great.

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:19.760
 Here's one for you.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.280
 "Are tamarinds and persimmons good and safe to eat?"

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.120
 - Yes.

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:24.940
 - Here's one for you.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.240
 "What are some natural foods and supplements

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.120
 "that Dr. Peat has seen to be successful

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.160
 "in restoring a full head of hair

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.200
 "to a person experiencing what appears to be

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.880
 "male pattern baldness?"

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.720
 Okay.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.120
 Have you come up with some things over the years

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.960
 that the guys have used to get back their old hair?

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:44.960
 - It requires changing your whole course of health problems.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.840
 The hair loss tends to coincide with circulatory problems,

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:56.120
 and behind the circulatory problems are metabolic problems.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.160
 So the things to work on are getting your vitamin D up,

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.400
 your thyroid and progesterone and DHEA up,

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:08.860
 and your cortisol and the other stress hormones,

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.860
 aldosterone and parathyroid hormone are very destructive

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:17.600
 to the hair follicle and blood vessels and heart.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.920
 And so if you change your metabolism,

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.920
 lowering parathyroid hormone and aldosterone and cortisol

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.320
 and all of the stress-related hormones,

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:31.000
 including prolactin, that's going to save

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.520
 your circulatory system as well as your hair.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.680
 - So along with everything else,

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.120
 when we react to things in the world

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.920
 and angst and stress and worry,

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.360
 you can lose hair over that.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.200
 - Yeah.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.080
 - And at the same time, your whole health is suffering.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.920
 - Do we know the physiological phenomenon going on

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.920
 with the gray and why some people gray early?

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.280
 Is there any science behind that, do we know?

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.920
 - Yeah, I've thought about it

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.320
 and experimented with it quite a lot.

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.600
 I started getting individual white eyebrows

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.360
 when I was in my 40s, and I was thinking about

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.320
 the melanin in the brain being deficient

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320
 in Parkinson's disease.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:17.000
 And thinking about what happens in that process,

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.720
 I realized that an excessive iron competes against copper,

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.880
 and copper is the enzyme that makes the dark pigment,

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.640
 and too much iron will simply get in the way

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.240
 and knock the copper out of your pigment enzymes.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.240
 And I didn't want to try just eating copper.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.280
 - Copper, right.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.840
 - I made a solution, put a penny, a real copper penny.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:44.120
 - A real copper penny, yeah.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:49.120
 - In a little bottle of water with an aspirin tablet

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:52.200
 and about half a spoonful of vinegar.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:57.200
 So it had two acidic things to help the solvent.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.720
 So it was copper aspirinate and copper acetate

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.840
 that I was using in the solution.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.600
 And I found, I put a drop of that on the white hair

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.760
 and watched it closely.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.720
 They grow very, very fast.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.800
 The very next day, and very visibly on the second day,

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.640
 I could see black pigment appearing at the root,

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.160
 just essentially an instantaneous restoration

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.400
 of pigment formation.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.840
 - Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.280
 So you, go ahead, go ahead.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.160
 - I did that on several hairs

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.160
 at different stages of their growth.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.040
 I would find one that was just starting out

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.240
 with a white tip and applied the copper.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.240
 And the rest of it would, with just one application,

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.920
 the remaining hair would come out pigmented.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.600
 - Did you ever do a lot of it

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:52.120
 and do it on top of your head?

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:52.960
 Do you have any?

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.720
 - I, after that, I started getting white whiskers

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.600
 on my cheeks and chin.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.200
 And I thought it would be a good test

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.200
 to put it under my lip on a little tuft of white whiskers.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.000
 And by that time, the penny had been sitting

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.600
 in the solution for months and was very blue.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.840
 And I had a burning sensation

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.360
 and went to wash it off quickly and it kept burning.

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.440
 So I kept dabbing it with water

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.760
 and finally looked to see what had happened

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.040
 that was caused that persistent stinging.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.320
 And rather than just finding a red area,

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:36.760
 I found a brown, mole-like elevation

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.040
 all around those white whiskers.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:43.320
 It had produced an instant mole,

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.640
 in effect, elevated pigmented cells.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.280
 - Wow, you did a lot of pigmentation.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.840
 - Yeah, and changed the structure.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:54.000
 The cells had invaded the area.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.600
 And so I just watched it over a period of a month

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.400
 that that had leveled out and disappeared.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.200
 But that got me interested in the phenomenon

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.640
 of pigment cell migration in the skin.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:12.640
 And the cells, it turns out that pigment cells

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:17.240
 can swim through the seemingly solid structure

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.560
 of your skin.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.400
 They can travel almost an inch a day in warm weather

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.360
 when your skin temperature is around 90 degrees.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.320
 They can migrate with amazing speed.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.120
 And I found that if I provided them

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.000
 with the nutrients that they needed,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.800
 which included copper,

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.800
 that they would, a mole would disperse or move and fade out,

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.680
 go back to being a normal pigmented skin.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.720
 - So interesting.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.320
 So you did the copper, aspirin, and vinegar,

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.920
 right, copper penny?

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.200
 - Yeah, I found that on my sideburns,

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.440
 only about 10% of the white hairs

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:06.560
 reverted to black pigment formation after one application.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.680
 And I realized that's because our eyebrows

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.560
 have a lifespan of only about a month.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.560
 Your facial hairs and head hairs live years.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.960
 Any one application is only going to affect

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.360
 a small percentage that are in the right phase of growth.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.120
 - I wonder if there'd be a source of copper

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.320
 you could experiment with

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.720
 other than trying to find a pre-64 penny.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.280
 - Yeah, I decided the safest was just to eat more oysters.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.240
 - Oysters?

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.840
 - Yeah, as a very strong source of copper.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.160
 - Ah, interesting, yeah.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.480
 You know, in Ayurvedic medicine,

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.800
 they recommend folks put their water

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.240
 in a copper vessel in the fridge

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.720
 and drink some of that every day.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.680
 - Yeah, that's safe.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.520
 - That's pretty safe?

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.080
 - Yeah, it's really fun. - Interesting.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.480
 Here is Cody in Vero Beach, Florida.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.360
 I have a question about vaccines.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.760
 Dr. Peat had discussed how some vaccines and adjuvants

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.040
 more or less permanently alter our body,

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.560
 being as they, that so many people,

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.720
 even those born as early as 1950s,

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.880
 have been subjected to vaccines and harmful adjuvants

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.000
 since a young age.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.360
 Are those that had vaccines hopeless

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.960
 and ever having true health?

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.680
 Is the damage of the vaccine significant enough

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.520
 at no amount of good diet, healthy life,

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.360
 and metabolic energy can reverse?

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.520
 - If you look at the inflammatory

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:28.280
 and degenerative disease trend in young people,

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:33.080
 starting with the great expansion of vaccination in America

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.240
 in the late 1980s,

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:41.520
 the increase of allergies in young people

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.400
 and all of the inflammatory degenerative diseases,

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:50.400
 there's a steady, sharp increase starting around that year

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.240
 when the vaccine expansion happens.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.560
 So it's hard to explain this deterioration of health

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.520
 otherwise, and it just makes it more urgent

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.280
 that these people start doing as many things right

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.160
 and to basically start being skeptical

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.480
 about recommendations of the medical system.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.040
 - Here's some good questions for you

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.520
 that have not been asked before.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.720
 We like new things.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.560
 It's always good.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.640
 Matthias, he says, does doctor believe in the zeitgeist

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.400
 that proclaims homosexuals are born that way?

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.320
 - Well, there are enough studies in animals

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.680
 as well as people during a stress situation

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:39.680
 such as famines, pregnancy subjected to extreme stress

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.360
 will cause great changes in their sexual behavior

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.600
 including the sexual preference.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.200
 - So it could be something that,

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.840
 an idea and a feeling and a tendency

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.760
 that could happen from birth that--

01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:01.000
 - Yeah, everything that happens to you during gestation

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
 is shaping you, your whole system of mental functions,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.120
 emotions, physical shape, rate of metabolism, all of that.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.880
 - This just in, this would be a timely thing.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.080
 Go ahead and mentioned it.

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.200
 Supreme Court out with a decision today,

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.720
 landmark, which now features two new justices

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.080
 appointed by President Trump,

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.400
 gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans individuals

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:28.240
 cannot legally be discriminated against by employees,

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.120
 meaning they can't be fired nor hired

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.760
 simply by being LGBTQ.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:33.720
 Just out this morning.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.660
 So that ties in with that.

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:37.240
 And how does doctor feel about abortion?

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.160
 Wow, they're really going after you this morning.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.240
 - Feel about what?

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.120
 - Abortions.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.040
 What's your--

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:45.880
 - It's best to control your conception.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.200
 But sometimes there's just not a system

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:55.200
 for properly sustaining the pregnancy in a healthy way.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.880
 So it's never a good thing in any sense,

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.880
 but avoiding worse things, I think it's a proper thing.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.920
 - Do you have any theories or thought about

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.520
 when soul comes into the body?

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:14.520
 - Oh, I think it's there before the body.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:20.040
 There's continuity of soul.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.080
 - In everything, right?

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:21.920
 - Yeah.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.360
 - Here's another interesting one.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.120
 When you're looking back on your life

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.840
 and reflecting what's the advice you would give someone

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.040
 maybe 50 years younger than you.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:33.840
 So Dr. Peat, you've had your body, what, 83 years, right?

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:34.680
 83?

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:35.520
 Is that right?

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.080
 So here's someone saying, okay, I'm 33.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.560
 What advice can you give me?

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.520
 - Oh, stay alert.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.360
 (laughing)

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.320
 This is the main thing.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.000
 Time, times are gonna get worse.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.640
 - Just stay aware of what's going on in the world.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.480
 - Yeah.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.240
 - Couple more, then we'll let you go.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.680
 Good questions this morning, thanks.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.520
 What does Dr. Peat think about a water filter

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.320
 through a Berkey water filter?

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.160
 I know it's not reverse osmosis.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.120
 A lot of credible people seem to like it.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.200
 Does it remove fluoride and other things?

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.080
 - I don't know what that kind is.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:05.920
 - Yeah, it's just--

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.440
 - Reverse osmosis is good.

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.120
 - Yeah, I don't know about Berkey either,

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.760
 but our pretty much is it.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.560
 Dr. Daniels has mentioned on Patrick's show

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:16.240
 that sauerkraut's used for internal scoring.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240
 Do you know about this and can suggest it

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.160
 or add something else?

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.480
 Internal scoring.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.320
 - What kind of juice?

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.440
 - Sauerkraut, sauerkraut.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.600
 - Oh, I don't know.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.640
 The taste tastes nice.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.400
 If a person finds it pleasing,

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.040
 the salt can be a protective,

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.680
 a relaxing factor that I don't think

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.960
 has any harmful effects.

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.680
 - This is from JD.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.960
 Can Dr. Peat give me ideas on getting rid of ulcers?

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.160
 What would you do to help somebody get rid of ulcers?

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.920
 I suspect, I don't know,

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.800
 they're talking about stomach ulcers, right?

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:53.560
 So is there a connection between some kind of a bacteria,

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.000
 what's it called?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.200
 - Yeah, the pylori.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.080
 - Pylori, yeah.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.960
 What do you know about stomach ulcers?

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.400
 - The stress predisposes the stomach

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.080
 to poor immunity.

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.880
 A properly working digestive system is sterile

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:14.720
 and that depends on a complete good nutrition

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.560
 with good thyroid function

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.880
 and getting a vigorous digestive process.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.920
 Lots of stomach, quick production of digestive fluids,

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.520
 quick peristalsis, all of that

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:33.520
 will keep your upper digestive tract completely sterile.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.560
 - Do you think the meme that's out there

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.760
 that as we age, we lose stomach acid,

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.480
 you think there's anything to that?

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.080
 - Yeah, the stress hormones increase

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:49.400
 and the energy hormones decrease with age.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.200
 Thyroid becomes less effective

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:56.920
 because of anti-thyroid factors, inflammatory mediators.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.240
 The things that promote fibrosis and scarring

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.120
 and atrophy and inflammation

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.360
 all tend to increase with aging

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:10.920
 and so all of the energizing anti-inflammatory things

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.120
 offset the aging process.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.280
 - So could that be a tie-in with people

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.800
 who are not busy and whatever, family disconnect

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.760
 and on medicine in nursing homes

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.120
 that that all just piles on of one another?

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.120
 - Yeah, and the things that have become so obvious

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.000
 with the COVID treatment

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.840
 and the facts of natural immunity to the COVID

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:42.840
 are revealing new things about how to offset aging

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:48.080
 because the things that cause the atrophy of aging

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.200
 predispose to the serious symptoms from the virus

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.480
 and so for example, the low sartan

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.240
 or the infodensin receptor blockers

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.240
 that have been so effective against the symptoms of COVID

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:10.320
 also offset many of the problems of aging,

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.240
 nerve degeneration, Alzheimer's type things,

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.180
 muscle frailty, osteoporosis, everything.

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:22.800
 There's no distinction between the degeneration of aging

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:27.800
 and the degeneration that kills you from a flu infection.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:30.040
 - Dr. Ray Peat, final question and then we'll let you go.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:33.520
 So in all of your experience being on this planet 83 years

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.680
 and looking at this for 50 years or so,

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.360
 do you think it's at all possible

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.920
 that a safe and effective virus or this COVID-19,

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:45.120
 whatever it is, could be available in the fall

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.920
 or even early next year?

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.520
 - A vaccine for it? - Yes, sir.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:55.040
 - No, has there ever been a safe and effective vaccine?

01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.560
 The whole issue of safety testing has been fraudulent.

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:05.280
 The CDC disobeyed an order of Congress

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.920
 in not doing safety studies

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.240
 when they gave the pharmaceutical industry

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.280
 immunity from damages caused by killing people

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.680
 with bad vaccines.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:17.840
 When they gave them that immunity,

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.760
 they were obligated by Congress to do safety testing

01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.640
 and report every two years.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.400
 For 30 years, they did absolutely nothing.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.720
 And the safety testing that has been done,

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:34.480
 for example, if you think that the aluminum adjuvant

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:38.080
 has been causing deaths and brain damage,

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.440
 you would test it against a blank,

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.200
 something for sure not containing aluminum,

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.400
 but they used aluminum in the so-called placebo.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.640
 They used a toxic placebo to measure the toxicity

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.840
 of the vaccine, deliberate, intentional fraud.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.280
 - So Bobby Kennedy and his group did a FOIA request

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.040
 for safe and effective studies,

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.200
 and they just turned up empty.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.720
 So you're suggesting that even for measles, mumps,

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:09.840
 or rubella, there's never been safe and effective testing

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:11.400
 does on these guys.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.120
 - And the same with flu vaccines.

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.600
 - Flu vaccines, never.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:19.200
 And I think it's important to look at who

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.760
 the US Public Health Service and the CDC is,

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.640
 who they are, and who the organization has been,

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.840
 what they've been doing historically.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.400
 During my lifetime, there have been just horrible,

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:40.400
 incredible scandals that they managed to keep secret.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.320
 They said if some good organization found out about this,

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.240
 there could be a lot of smoke.

01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.000
 For example, that they were infecting orphans

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.000
 in Guatemala with syphilis as part of a secret experiment,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.600
 that they were covering up evidence of radiation damage

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:05.600
 from nuclear accidents in experimental reactors

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.260
 in the United States and from Three Mile Island.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:12.880
 They've been on the side of the offenders

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.960
 keeping information from the public.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.800
 - Dr. Ray Peat, PhD, he's here on the third Monday

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.800
 of every month.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.160
 Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time once a month.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.320

 and then you work it out with the folks, right?

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.400
 Who send you an email?

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.720
 Raypeetnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.440
 Dr. Peat, happy painting, and we'll talk to you next month.

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.760
 Let us know if there's ever anything we can do for you

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.520
 and help you get any additional information out.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.400
 We're always available.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.560
 We'd have you on any time.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.600
 - Okay, thank you.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.440
 - Thank you, sir.

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.960
 Dr. Ray Peat, raypeetnewsletter.com.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.840
 What a wonderful find to have this gentleman available.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.360
 Thanks for all your great questions, boy.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.600
 You had some good ones today, baby, and we always do.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.760
 Okay, we have Dr. Christine Northrup,

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.080
 who's quite an interesting lady.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.080
 Sharon has put up a nice video of her

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.880
 on the front page of One Radio Network.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.000
 So come by tomorrow, we're gonna talk to her.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.640
 And then we're gonna dig into the world

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.800
 of finance and geopolitics.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:18.800
 Paul Reiter, he says that five times in the last 90 years,

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.400
 five times in the last 90 years,

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.760
 let me see if I can read the whole thing,

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:25.600
 elements of US power structure have tried

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.560
 to house a sitting president without an election.

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.120
 Five times, can you guess who those were?

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:30.960
 You guess?

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.780
 Five times.

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:34.040
 And then Brandon Smith, he's quite a fascinating fellow.

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:36.640
 I think his website is altmarkets.com.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.000
 Yeah, Brandon Smith, he'll be here on Wednesday.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:39.980
 Cool stuff coming up.

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.040
 I love you all very much.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.720
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.360
 Been an honor to be here with you.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.800
 We're getting closer, I think,

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.920
 to having the video thing tracking every day.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.960
 So you can see the guests,

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.160
 and yeah, we're making some headway with that.

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.440
 So again, if I can do anything for you

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.080
 during the week after the show,

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.080
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:01.960
 Love you all very much.

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.080
 Thank you, and may the blessings be.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:07.200
