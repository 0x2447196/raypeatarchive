00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.040
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.800
 Know the source.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.840
 One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.720
 Well welcome to hour two or part two or whatever you want to call it of our little show here

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.960
 we do virtually every morning except for maybe Thursdays or so on One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 My name is Patrick Timpone and on the third Monday of the month, second part of the show,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 we have Dr. Ray Peat on PhD and you'll meet him in just a second.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.600
 Let me just give a quick little plug what's going to happen tomorrow.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 Christine Northrup is going to be on the show.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.160
 She's really an interesting lady.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.240
 I think you're going to enjoy her.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.120
 Paul Rider and Brandon Smith on Wednesday and they're both into the geopolitical financial

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.880
 world and I think you're going to find both of them well worth listening to.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.200
 So that's coming up Wednesday.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 Probably somebody else during this week too.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.320
 Dr. Jennifer Daniels next week.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.280
 Richard Mayberry next week.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760
 A lot of cool things coming up.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.840
 We're going to have a Fourth of July special with Jack Graham and he's going to tell you

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 some things about the Declaration of Independence that you said, "Whoa!" or the revolution.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.000
 That's not possible.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.080
 So that's all coming up.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 So join us now and please just use the email this morning for some reason.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.120
 For some reason we just can't get the 800 number to be working this morning.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.640
 So we'll work on that and have it for you tomorrow.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.040
 Ray Peat, a PhD at University of Oregon.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.320
 He specialized in physiology.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.920
 He started his work on hormones way back 50 years ago.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.200
 I was getting out of the military or in the military and Ray Peat was working on hormones

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.340
 in 1968.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.040
 He wrote his dissertation with outlining the ideas on progesterone and hormones.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.040
 So he's been at it for a very long time.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:28.600
 As I said, on the third Monday of every month, Dr. Ray Peat is with us and he's right here.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 Good morning, sir.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 How are you?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 Good morning.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 I'm very well.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.600
 Well, you sound very well.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.280
 How do you spend most of your days these days?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 Reading.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.400
 A little painting.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.200
 I'm sorry, the last?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.320
 Mostly just reading but occasionally painting some.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.600
 Painting too, huh?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.400
 And what kind of things do you read?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.680
 Most recently I was reading about a trial in Spain.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:13.080
 The murder of the six Jesuits and their housekeeper and her daughter after 31 years.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:25.160
 They're finally bringing the vice-ministrate of defense to trial in Spain for murdering

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.240
 their priest.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.840
 So you just go for things that are just interesting to you, not necessarily always in the health

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.840
 realm.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.920
 No, I try to keep up a little bit on the news.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.160
 So you sent me your last newsletter.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.160
 Thanks for that.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.120
 And you're saying that the argument of this, and I'm just going to read the first line

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.400
 as I read it with Dr. Massey, is a failure of energy metabolism limits the ability of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.760
 cells to return from an excited active state to a stable resting state.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:10.880
 An unresolved excitation causes cells to emit signals indicating the need for repair, inflammatory

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.680
 signals.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.360
 Pre-existing inflammation is associated with high altitude sickness and the ability to

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.400
 get sick from the coronavirus as well as chronic diseases.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.920
 This implies that treatment for a so-called coronavirus infection should be to reduce

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.480
 cellular excitation and inflammation and normalize energy production.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.880
 It also implies that these treatments will have favorable effects on cell aging.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.040
 So Dr. Massey was talking earlier, and I wonder if this ties in.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:52.160
 So is it possible that the lungs and the cells were doing something in response to the body's

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
 fear or angst or anything?

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:07.720
 Yeah, the emotions, a person, for example, a sick person or an extremely old and frail

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:18.480
 person will often lose control of their emotions and have exaggerated intensity of emotions.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:28.200
 That's because the emotional system is stabilized in a young person so that they can experience

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.360
 something very upsetting.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:41.720
 And within hours or at most maybe a few days, they'll be all the way back to normal.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:51.800
 But if a person's health is a little borderline, a fairly moderate emotional shock can linger

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.800
 for weeks and weeks like post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.920
 A very tough person can go through the same experience without the brain consequences.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.920
 So I see.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.640
 So as the organism is stronger, it's easier to deal with the emotions that come up and

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.760
 then let them go and move on.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.200
 I see.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.200
 So you're saying that this is, but this is about the lungs as well.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.240
 What's the connection there with the lungs?

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:34.880
 The brain is just an extreme example of what's going on in every kind of cell.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:45.640
 The idea of excitation and recovery, you see it in the nerve as an electrical and chemical

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:56.760
 change in which you disturb the nerve and it goes into an extreme metabolically intense

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760
 process.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:06.160
 And then as it builds up its ATP again, it goes back to the resting state and is ready

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.200
 for another stimulus.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.040
 Exactly that same thing happens in secretory cells, for example.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.040
 You irritate it and it'll give a burst of secretion.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:28.760
 And then if there's energy and oxygen, sugar being supplied, it'll quickly recover its

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.800
 ability to secrete again.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:45.600
 And the lung surface cells, for example, some of them are secreting mucus, others secrete

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:56.880
 various smaller molecules, but everything is metabolically active and irritation intensifies

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:05.560
 that activity and energy helps it return to its ready to work resting state.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:12.360
 So is it possible that folks who maybe were sheltered in place and going through stress

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:23.200
 and being kind of confined, that when they are "allowed" to get back out, that the

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.400
 body could be healing, which could demonstrate symptoms that they're actually sick?

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.120
 Oh, for sure.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120
 Wow.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:43.440
 Especially if they've lost their job or their business while being shut down, it's the bigger

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.440
 consequences.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:55.000
 For some people, it's believing what Fauci and Gates are telling them and believing that

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.160
 there's really a special pandemic going on this year or something radically different

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.200
 from last year.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.360
 Is it your research and opinion then that the body then does show symptoms when it's

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:21.440
 actually getting healing rather than being sick with inflammation and such?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:31.760
 If you're really strong and healthy, you can heal a slight wound without inflammation,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.240
 like a healthy fetus.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:46.080
 For example, a surgeon takes a sample of tissue and if the mother is healthy, the wound will

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.040
 heal without inflammation and without leaving a scar.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:59.120
 And a very healthy young person will take a wound that will close right up without making

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.960
 a big sore, inflamed area.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:12.760
 It just sort of relaxes back into place and starts closing up the wound.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.640
 So it's the idea then, the stronger and stronger we are, the more we can do without being sore,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.480
 like exercising and stuff like that.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.560
 If we haven't for a while, the body's going to react more severely.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.560
 Yeah.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:36.400
 For example, an old person who suddenly decides to do weightlifting or whatever will probably

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:43.920
 have lingering symptoms for three or four days where a young person would be sore overnight

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.040
 maybe but be entirely back in a day or so.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.480
 Dr. Ray Peet is with us and you can get that newsletter.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.120
 And it's RayPeetNewsletter, right?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120
 At gmail.com?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.120
 At gmail.com.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.120
 And Patrick Timpona here with you.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.120
 And as I said, the 800 numbers are off.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.120
 So just do the email.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.480
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480
 As you know, Dr. Peet, more and more states are now reporting more cases.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480
 And they use that term, of course, cases.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480
 And I guess they're tying it into the idea that if you are tested and you're positive

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.480
 then you are a case, right?

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.480
 So they're reporting more cases.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.480
 And the governor of Florida came out and said, "Well, yes, we're reporting more cases."

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.480
 And so I think that's a good thing.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:36.480
 And I think that's a good thing.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:12:00.920
 Can you explain to us this test that they're doing?

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.160
 So it was ridiculous.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:14.640
 People on the staff and professors were shocked when they learned that the numbers didn't

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.240
 mean anything because they were mixing two totally different types of tests.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.640
 One showed the presence of the virus.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.680
 The other showed immunity to the virus.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:34.960
 So the government itself has been probably deliberately covering up, blurring, essentially

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.020
 destroying meaningful information.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.960
 So the test today that is being given, and they have this swab thing, even drive-thrus,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.760
 and lots of people are doing it.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:55.880
 Is it possible that they can actually show a virus that is COVID-19, that is separate

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.720
 from other kind of stuff in the body?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.880
 Can they really, can they do that?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.600
 To a certain extent, it can show.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:14.720
 Sometimes it can be right, but it's often false positive.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.280
 Junk, junk will sometimes cause the reaction.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.440
 So junk or antibodies and things like that actually shows up as an actual virus?

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:37.880
 Well, other pieces of RNA can get amplified.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:53.040
 The presence of a certain stretch of RNA is also amplifying and measuring with the

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.000
 polymerase chain reaction test.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:12.320
 If they find the presence of the virus, the fact that somewhere between 35 and 80% of

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:18.480
 people can have the virus present and no symptoms at all.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.080
 So what does it mean if they find the virus present?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:32.600
 It can be just a few stray viruses that might be stuck somewhere or not.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:41.400
 But since as many as 80% of the people don't have any symptoms when they have the virus,

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.920
 the presence of a positive test usually is meaningless.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:57.040
 It means that they're simply not reacting to a virus, so it isn't a pathogen.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.000
 So if there's a corona COVID, what's the correct term?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.040
 Is it COVID-19?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.960
 That's the actual virus that they claim?

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.960
 Yeah.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.960
 Okay.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:16.040
 So if this test can show a COVID-19 in the PCR tests they're giving in some cases, then

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.200
 that means that that exists.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.920
 It must exist then, right?

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.920
 Somewhere.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920
 Yeah.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:35.320
 They argue that it is the number 19 rather than last year's.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:46.800
 There are so many of them and they're changing so often that you don't really know for sure

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.480
 what the test was standardized on.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.480
 I see.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.800
 So what you're saying, I hear you say it could show up some kind of a corona-type viruses

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.600
 and there's a lot of them, but we don't know that much about it, if it's very special,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.600
 where it came from, is it communicable?

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:14.440
 Yeah, the people who make, they get a sample that they declare to be the real thing.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:24.760
 And then you really have to test the test to see whether what it's finding is meaningful.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.320
 But they just haven't done any big testing.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:33.240
 The FDA rushed them into use without testing the tests.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:41.000
 So you can show that over and over, it will truly reflect the standard you have in the

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 lab.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:51.720
 Yes, it's amplifying that and has a very high reliability for that known virus.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:58.320
 But when you go out and test it on people without standardizing the test, you don't

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:06.240
 know how sensitive it is to discriminating against junk RNA.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.240
 I see.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.760
 And how long would it take, in your opinion, to do that correctly?

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:23.120
 Several months, probably thousands of people would have to be tested, doing multiple tests

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:29.680
 when you get a positive, then examining them more carefully to see what the positive consists

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.680
 of.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:39.160
 For example, you should have to test, examine, looking for other coronaviruses.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:48.920
 If you find other coronavirus positives in the person who tested positive for COVID-19,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.120
 then that weakens the meaning of your test.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:18:03.840
 If you aren't testing for other related things, how do you know for sure what you have found?

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:11.200
 So all of these different flu and cold viruses, as I understand, they are a corona genre type

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.200
 virus?

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.200
 There's a lot of them?

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:23.880
 Yeah, the coronavirus has been known to cause colds for decades.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:30.240
 So there's no evidence then that whatever this COVID-19 is that they've called is any

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.600
 different or stronger or unique?

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600
 Is there any evidence?

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.000
 Very, very little evidence.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:48.240
 The best evidence, the Stanford professors about three months ago were getting different

00:18:48.240 --> 00:19:01.520
 ways of looking at existing evidence and studies on people in California and looking at the

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.040
 cruise ship that was infected.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:15.480
 Both of those approaches showed that it was very similar to the standard flu pathogenicity

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:26.360
 and possibly less, but in vicinity of a fraction of 1% mortality of those infected, which is

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.680
 in the range of the annual flu viruses.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:35.880
 Dr. Rapita, is it possible that whatever these PCR tests are seeing that they're claiming

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:45.480
 is a unique coronavirus could be being produced by the body, an endosome or an exosome has

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.480
 been argued?

00:19:51.480 --> 00:20:00.000
 Our DNA is full of stuff that looks like RNA viruses.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.640
 Some people say that it's half of our DNA, which is about twice as much DNA as we need

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.520
 for our genes that construct all of us.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:25.040
 So there is this mysterious, dark, non-genetic DNA, which gives signs of being related to

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.280
 the RNA viruses.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:38.360
 So it's very possible that stored in this immense amount of DNA that there are already

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:44.120
 some overlapping bits of RNA.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:54.280
 When you're under stress, we put out exosomes and they're in the same size range and structural

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:01.560
 composition of this type of virus.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:11.080
 Very similar under the microscope, little round particles that are synthesized in a

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:17.800
 certain part of the cell and stream out of the cell being secreted in the blood.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:23.480
 But under stress, these are repair particles.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:30.920
 Injured cells will send signals, for example, to the bone marrow and the bone marrow will

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:43.200
 manufacture exosome material containing RNA and DNA and proteins that help to repair the

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.360
 injured cells in other parts of the body.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:55.720
 The stem cell system is largely regulated through these exosomes and internal communication

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720
 system.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:06.200
 And so the stress that turns those on happens to be the stress that the viruses use to activate

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.320
 their own synthesis and secretion.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:15.400
 So is it possible then that stress or poisons or other insults on the body could be producing

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:22.720
 an exosome that looks just like a virus and is being identified as a virus?

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:32.520
 Yeah, the important thing is that if the official government approved researchers won't even

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:43.160
 look at this gigantic part of our DNA system, they're going to question whether we already

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:55.200
 have some very similar coronavirus type RNA in our reservoir of genetic information, which

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.560
 will come out under stress.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.400
 If you don't look at it, you'll never find it.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.080
 So is it possible that people under stress, having to wear a mask, having to stay home,

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:11.960
 losing their job, worried about their finances and their family could be creating these exosomes

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.760
 that could be shown up then as a virus?

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.160
 Any stress can increase your exosome manufacture.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:32.200
 But it's a fairly small industry to study the exosome system.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:45.480
 And the basic problem is that it was denied as contrary to the basic dogma of genetics

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.880
 and molecular biology.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.200
 It's the epigenetic system.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:24:02.960
 RNA viruses were said to be impossible because of the dogma that says information goes only

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.360
 from DNA to RNA to protein.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:17.600
 And so for a virus to contain only RNA, but to get into our DNA went in the wrong direction.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:29.080
 So the whole thing required about, well, 50 years ago it started, but the scientific community

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:36.840
 gradually adapted to accept that RNA viruses are a real thing.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:49.240
 But seeing the whole genome, the whole DNA content of cells, seeing that as active and

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.800
 functional, that's the hard part.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:25:02.040
 They just prefer not to get involved in that, especially as it relates to immunity because

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:11.960
 it opens up the area of doubt about a million fold.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.600
 Doubt for the germ theory, vaccines, and pharmaceuticals?

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:29.600
 Yeah, basically the antibody vaccine theory would totally melt away into nothing if people

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.360
 started looking at the actual immune system.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360
 Wow.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.920
 So, Dr. Rapi, then was this what Pasteur was arguing, that there are RNA things out there,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.720
 viruses that are separate from us and can attack us?

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.600
 I mean, that was his premise, right?

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:55.280
 Yeah, there are things out there, but the dogma says that they originated separately

00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:07.960
 and what the evidence looks like is that these circulating viruses, probably since they can't

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:17.480
 evolve, they can't exist except in a higher organism, you can't evolve a lower thing like

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:25.040
 a virus if its existence depends on a mammal, for example.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:34.880
 You can't conceive of it coming into existence de novo, so you have to see it as a product

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.200
 of a higher organism.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:47.360
 We or other organisms under stress create exosomes, some of these get emitted into the

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:57.440
 environment and they spread information between organisms the way bacteria, if one bacterium

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:08.000
 is exposed to an antibiotic, it can produce a little particle, a bacteria equivalent of

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:18.600
 an exosome, having the genes which make it able to resist the antibiotic and it will

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:28.840
 approach another bacterium of a different strain even or even a different species.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:37.760
 There's evidence that this particle can be transmitted across a fair genetic difference.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:46.080
 So one bacterium sends out a little tube connecting it to another bacterium that wasn't exposed

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:53.920
 and passes this particle of genetic information and the other bacterium can then integrate

00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:03.320
 it and reproduce and all of its descendants will be immune to antibiotic.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:17.920
 So if bacteria can do it, it's only the genetic dogma of one-way information that makes people

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:27.040
 resistant to looking at the transmission of these particles between organisms.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:34.000
 So if you're around stress organisms, this approach would say you're at risk of catching

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 their stress.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.360
 So let's see, so say a husband is stressed and creates exosomes and starts the process

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:53.360
 of healing I suspect, then the wife could experience the same thing because?

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:58.080
 She's going to teach her body, help her body to learn how to become immune from this thing.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.080
 Yeah.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:11.960
 The basic principle would probably be like the bacteria adapted and passed its adaptation

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:23.320
 onto its neighbors and the mechanism as far as it exists in plants and animals would be

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:32.280
 to pass these useful repair units onto other members of the family.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.280
 Yes.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:38.240
 So that could be possible then just a kind of a God, whatever you want to call it, evolutionary

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.280
 process to make the species stronger.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:47.280
 Species helping everybody to get stronger essentially is what I hear you saying.

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.280
 Yeah.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:56.920
 There have been people making good arguments for this among plants in particular going

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.920
 back 50, 60 years.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:08.640
 So do we always have to feel symptoms, flu-like headache or whatever, when we take on one

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.720
 of these little repair guys to get stronger?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.120
 Do we have to feel bad?

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.880
 No, not at all.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:23.120
 The fact that they're finding positive RNA evidence of the virus in people who don't

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:29.920
 have any symptoms at all, maybe 80% of the people don't feel anything from it.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:37.880
 So it's being passed on and probably integrated on creating better immunity in 80% of the

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880
 people.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:48.560
 But if you have a sick, stressed, unhappy, malnourished population, they are going to

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.480
 have trouble adapting.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:56.520
 Okay, so there will be some people that will die, or could die, right?

00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:02.400
 Because they're just sick or compromised in preconditions and the rest of it.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.880
 Yeah, that would be the 1/10 to 1/4 of 1% infected.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880
 Yeah, what's happening.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.880
 It's just not happening.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.880
 Yeah.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.880
 Because of age and preconditions.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.880
 That's at some level.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880
 Yeah.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:39.160
 In Spain, or Italy, the mortality of men is 70%, almost three times greater mortality,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.400
 but it's especially old men.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:55.120
 And young women, the only young women that were dying were very, very sick individuals,

00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:05.760
 menstruating women of ordinary health were extremely resistant to the infection.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.800
 Is there any evidence that the mortality rate of this particular virus or this particular

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.960
 flu season is any more severe than others?

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.360
 Other years?

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.360
 Not really.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:34.200
 These figures suggest that it's a fairly typical year for mortality.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:41.160
 A few people have been watching a very odd thing in the CDC figures.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:50.280
 Starting last fall, we were noticing a very unhistorical decline in the total national

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.280
 mortality.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.240
 A dip.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:01.440
 People just weren't dying of anything as often as they should.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:06.000
 Old age or accidents or whatever normally kill people.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:18.640
 There was a great drop in mortality week after week, and 15% in many weeks through the winter.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:28.280
 And suddenly, in the first week of April, the people who had been missing from the national

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:36.600
 mortality, suddenly there was this spike in excess mortality.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:46.000
 If you somehow had a block between the reporting of the deaths starting last fall and the recording

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 of them in the CDC, and then suddenly you broke the barrier to recording these deaths,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.480
 that could account for this huge spike in excess mortality because there had been a

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:07.800
 buildup of deficient mortality for weeks.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:15.320
 So this whole idea of the so-called second wave, what would you expect, just knowing

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:21.040
 what you understand how this works, if people start to come out of their shelter in place,

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.760
 take off their mask, and don't do the six feet and all that?

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:30.320
 Should we expect to see symptomatics being, whatever they mean, more?

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:36.360
 And then if people get tested more, the numbers could theoretically "get worse."

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.360
 Right?

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.360
 Possible?

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.600
 Yeah, I think that's what's happening.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:48.960
 They're confusing the result of testing more.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.480
 They're saying, "Look, we're catching a lot of infections."

00:34:52.480 --> 00:35:02.720
 That means it's increasing, but people don't necessarily get sick when they have the virus

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.720
 in them.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:08.960
 So you shouldn't be looking at anything except who is sick.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.960
 Yeah.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:15.760
 And so in your opinion, who is running the show here on a big picture of coming up with

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.640
 this story?

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.040
 Is it the WHO and the CDC?

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040
 Who's involved in this?

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.040
 Do you have any idea?

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040
 Both of them.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:32.160
 They're tightly integrated with the pharmaceutical industry.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:40.080
 They are now just another agency controlled by not only the pharmaceutical industry, but

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:49.740
 if you look at what happened last fall in the Federal Reserve System, they started putting

00:35:49.740 --> 00:36:00.920
 out that $6 trillion into the economy last fall before anyone was talking about a virus

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.280
 at all.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:12.880
 And then there was a historically big wave of resignations of CEOs of the biggest corporations

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:18.880
 late last fall, long before the stock market crash.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.020
 So they had inside news.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:31.640
 I saw a video in which Bill Gates was saying, "We were totally unprepared.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.560
 We weren't anticipating this at all.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:47.280
 We need to do better and be anticipating further waves of infection."

00:36:47.280 --> 00:37:04.320
 He was one of the motivators of a program to model and create a play of how they would

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.300
 respond to it.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:20.720
 They had leaders of industry and finance and the health systems, pharmaceutical industry,

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:29.440
 get together last October and anticipate how they would respond to a pandemic caused by

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.080
 a coronavirus imported into the United States.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:41.400
 So it was all sketched out that they would have a dramatic new way of responding to a

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.400
 pandemic.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:49.080
 And a pandemic isn't necessarily a big thing.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.680
 It can be an international wave of colds.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:00.840
 It doesn't mean it's going to be anything deadly or very harmful.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.680
 Are you speaking of the 2001 thing that they had?

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.680
 Event 201.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.680
 Yeah, Event 201.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:11.880
 That was sponsored by the Gates and those people?

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.880
 Yeah.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880
 Yeah.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.880
 Very interesting.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.680
 Dr. Ray Peet is with us, Patrick Timpone on Radionetwork.com.

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.600
 He's here on the third Monday at around 1030.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.520
 I started a few minutes late.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.520
 Stay right there, Dr. Peet.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.080
 We're going to do a quick break and then we're going to dig into your emails.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.680
 Over 7 trillion right now on the Fed's balance sheet.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:43.360
 So that's about, oh, I think 3 trillion or so treasury bonds that have been purchased

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.400
 by the private Federal Reserve Bank in the last three or four months.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:59.240
 We're going to be speaking more about this with Brandon Smith of AltFinance.com.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240
 Very interesting fellow.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.600
 He's going to be on 11 o'clock on Wednesday.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.120
 So we'll keep you abreast of this.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.720
 And then just so you know, there's about 3 trillion more that have been going out through

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.000
 the Fed, through the back door without being on their balance sheet, going through hedge

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.560
 funds like BlackRock and things like that.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.440
 So this stuff is all out there if you look for it.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.960
 And so we try to keep you updated.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:31.840
 Well, you know, it's a big challenge to living on planet Earth with cell phones, Wi-Fis and

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.840
 stuff.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.640
 We don't recommend you have a Wi-Fi in your home, but we do what we can.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.960
 I know your kids and you probably like to sit on the couch and play with your phone

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.920
 and say you like Wi-Fi, but don't do that.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.880
 But if you do do that, something like this will help you.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.160
 And this will help you even if you don't have Wi-Fi.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:53.320
 Previously, we talked with Brandon Amelani about his Blue Shield product to protect against

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.040
 EMFs in your home.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.240
 The more connected we are, the more electromagnetic radiation we're going to have.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.400
 So years ago, I'd play with Q-Links and just anything I can get my hands on that whether

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.760
 I felt it working or not, I just wanted some kind of leverage against electromagnetic radiation

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.560
 and those frequencies and how they affect the cellular biology.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.080
 But then when I met Mark and started really getting deep to his technology and really

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:18.320
 looking at the microprocessing technology, I've never found any EMF company that would

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.080
 not only to test on not only human blood and urine analysis, but also on animals, which

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.240
 totally weeds out the idea of placebo effect.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:30.320
 I mean, the fact that you can plug these devices into a chicken farm, a factory farm for about

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:35.640
 15,000 laying hens, and all of a sudden the mortality rate, which is averages from 60

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:41.360
 to 150 deaths per month, goes down to zero, I mean, it's pretty profound that a little

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.920
 device, a little energy device could actually create such a harmony and balance within the

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.520
 environment to where claustrophobic chickens that are crammed in together actually get

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.080
 along better and actually feel better.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.920
 The biological markers are improved over that one year study.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.440
 There's quite a bit of science with this Blue Shield product.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.320
 You can see the ad on the front page.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:06.040
 Promo code OneRadio will get you a 10% discount.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.640
 This works on the cells in the body.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.960
 Very cool technology.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.360
 Front page, blueshieldoneradionetwork.com.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360
 You betcha.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.280
 Don't forget, we have colostrum on sale right now.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.280
 It's a big sale.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:26.000
 I need your Thrival Link colostrum, and you're going to use the promo code.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.560
 Pick it up again here quickly.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.280
 Mouse, help me out here.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.680
 WERimmune, W-E-R immune.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.960
 Any Sir Thrival Link on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:44.920
 Just put that in there, you're going to get 20% off on all colostrum products on Sir Thrival.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.080
 That's a pretty cool thing.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.400
 If you'd like to get into some probiotics, we have a great probiotic line.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.920
 Check out Richard Ulrey here.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:42:00.720
 Dr. Richard Ulrey, authority on minerals, talks about gut bacteria, making the vitamins,

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.080
 and absorbing the minerals.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.440
 How it all works.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:09.120
 We need vitamins from our gut bacteria so we can absorb minerals, and then minerals

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.080
 provide a resonant frequency.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.720
 Those minerals carry these frequencies into the body, and multiple minerals will give

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:23.200
 you a frequency that allows all of our proteins to have individual distinct frequencies, giving

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.960
 that three-dimensional structure.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:30.840
 This is where Wayne's products, Living Stream, and that's the only primary products I carry.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:35.800
 When you do a stool test and it says you don't have any bifalbacteria, well if you don't

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.920
 have any bifalbacteria, you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.920
 If you don't have any lactobacillus, you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.320
 Here's an idea of a couple of the Living Streams you can take for what we're talking

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320
 about here.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.880
 The bifido, Living Streams Multi-Blend, and the living minerals.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:56.680
 So you get in the minerals, the bifido, and the lactobacillus.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:02.560
 And these special probiotics and minerals are all in human DNA form, and they are living

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.240
 alive.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.760
 In our store on oneradionetwork.com.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:13.360
 We've added two new products to our offerings that we're very excited about, and one is

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:21.800
 the Aquatru Top of the Counter Reverse Osmosis System.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.880
 If you're watching on Facebook and YouTube, you'll see that, but you'll see it on the

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.440
 front page.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.680
 And it's a really good one.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:35.000
 We've seen the lab analysis, and man, it cleans it all out, everything.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.720
 It's like a distiller on the top, but it's reverse osmosis.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.320
 But it's a very nice design where it's on the top of the counter.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.680
 We really like that.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.840
 And then check it out.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.080
 They have payment plans that are just terrific.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:53.040
 You just have, just with reasonable, reasonable credit, you can just get a quick little thing

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.480
 here where you do 12 monthly payments at zero interest.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.320
 Isn't that cool?

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.620
 And then you can also do three monthly payments.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.200
 So these are really interesting.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.920
 I know many of you have been wanting to try to find a more affordable reverse osmosis

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.720
 system, and you just keep the filters changed, and you'll be good to go.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.600
 It's called the Aquatru, and it's on the front page of One Radio Network.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.640
 Click on there, and you can pay it.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.920
 And I think the whole price is $3.29, something like that.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.720
 For the whole deal, you can do that straight away, or you can do monthly payments, either

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:35.520
 three payments at $99.966, and then, or 12 monthly payments.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.640
 So good stuff that we're finding.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.480
 And these are nice units.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:43.560
 I think you're going to enjoy them, and it's, you know, it'd be better than buying a lot

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:45.640
 of bottled water and stuff like that.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.000
 And it's really nice water, and it's very important.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.080
 The Aquatru on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.640
 Know the source.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.640
 One Radio Network.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:05.000
 Dr. Ray Peet, who's been at this health investigative and game for 50 years now.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.400
 And you had your PhD 50 years ago, Doc.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.440
 Actually, it was in 1972.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:13.840
 Oh, '72, okay.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.840
 Yeah.

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.240
 Well, 40 years ago, yeah.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.680
 What did you, when you were back there doing your PhD on the whole hormone thing, what

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.880
 was your kind of vision of where you, did you have an idea of where you wanted to go

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.400
 with all of this back there 40 years ago?

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:45.320
 In 1970, I sketched out about five ideas that I thought might be acceptable to the establishment

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:53.200
 in the next 10 or 20, at most by the end of the century.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:04.560
 And one of those I wrote up, sent to a journal, and it was published, Gilbert Ling was the

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:11.440
 editor of that journal, published in 1971.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:21.080
 And I was sure that those ideas, that there was so much movement in that direction, I

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.680
 thought they would be the standard by the 1990s.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:40.160
 And it's true that the supporting evidence has been very heavy in that direction.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:51.600
 But the power from the pharmaceutical industry to return to the 1950 paradigm of how the

00:46:51.600 --> 00:47:03.040
 body works is so great that despite all of the movement in physics, chemistry, and cell

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:14.560
 physiology, the investment in medical school, advertising, product promotion, and so on,

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:23.840
 has been able to blot that out, stigmatize the actual facts.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:35.560
 So the dogma is now riding so far above the evidence that you see the journals reacting

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:43.320
 to the COVID problem in a basically insane way.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:55.600
 I scanned through the PubMed what the journals were saying about nitric oxide, for example.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:02.480
 There's overwhelming recommendation in the journals to treat COVID by having the person

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:10.960
 breathe nitric oxide or take drugs that will increase its production.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:23.080
 The hypertension has been actually treated by giving them sildenafil, what's the male

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:34.200
 erection drug called, to create more nitric oxide as a treatment for lung problems.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:43.400
 But in fact, inflammation anywhere, especially in the lungs, creates more nitric oxide.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.760
 Nitric oxide creates inflammation and tissue damage.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:58.760
 And people who are susceptible to lung disease, for example, the people before they go to

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:06.760
 a high altitude, the ones who are going to get altitude sickness with COVID-like symptoms

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:15.120
 in their lungs, these people are already at sea level exhaling more nitric oxide than

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:28.920
 normal and as they ascend, the nitric oxide increases and develops into pulmonary respiratory

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:34.120
 problems, edema of the lungs.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:47.840
 So they take some mechanical dogma promoted by drug salesmen saying that this is how the

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.960
 drug works and that it will kill viruses, for example.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.560
 So it's appropriate.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:01.080
 But it means that they're recommending the harmful things.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:08.160
 At the same time, they're denying, like Lancet immediately came out with a journal article

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:18.720
 saying do not give a treatment that would be appropriate for high altitude pulmonary

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.440
 edema.

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:27.800
 Don't use Losartan, for example.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:37.240
 And when all of this proves to be absolutely 180 degrees false, they'll just blindly go

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.920
 on and say, "Well, that never happened.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:48.080
 We always recommended anti-inflammatory things and treating the symptoms and so on."

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:58.160
 In simplistic terms, in '71 when you submitted this article to Gilbert Ling, what was the

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:04.440
 basic differences, what you were saying about how the body works and what the AMA and the

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.200
 rest were saying?

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:18.160
 For example, that the cell is structured all the way down to the atomic level.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:28.120
 Water is organized in the healthy living state and the disorganization of the cell starting

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.700
 with the water can be measured.

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:38.840
 You can see the precancerous conditions by measuring the water.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:51.520
 And you can see the effect of aging, stress, estrogen excess as changes in the water structure.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:52:00.880
 In the animal, it'll happen half of a lifespan away from the terminal state.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:07.000
 But you can see it coming if you look at the fine structure of the cell, especially the

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.640
 water.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.960
 So what Pollack and other people are arguing, Dr. Pollack, that the water structure inside

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.960
 our bodies is important.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:29.400
 It's the idea that the cell energy exists in the form of structure.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.640
 Structure.

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:37.120
 And there is evidence that 5G and other electromagnetic fields disrupts the structure of the water

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.120
 in the body.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.120
 Yeah.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:52.880
 In 1968, just before I went to start graduate school, I visited a lab in Russia, Yuri Holodov,

00:52:52.880 --> 00:53:03.200
 who had been studying electromagnetic and magnetic fields effects on cell structure.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:10.880
 And he gave me a great list of studies that had already been done.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:20.600
 And those just generally weren't available and were totally unknown in US science.

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:21.600
 And what year is this?

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600
 '68.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600
 Wow, '68.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.080
 This was pre-cell phones.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:32.160
 He was talking about what kind of electrical forces.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:45.200
 He was using all sorts of direct, steady magnetic fields, but the worst are particular frequencies

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:50.480
 that the cell resonates to.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:56.240
 Has there ever been any studies with cell phones or cell phone towers and Wi-Fi's tying

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.240
 all this in together?

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:10.120
 Oh, yeah, lots of studies, but the proportion of them focusing on how it acts on water structure,

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.920
 it's still very small.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:17.960
 Are most of the studies they've done with the potential ill effects of cell phones or

00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.880
 just simply the heat that comes out of these?

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.960
 Is that correct?

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:35.600
 That was the main line story starting back in 1940s and '50s when sailors were being

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.520
 melted by getting in front of a radar.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:48.400
 The scientific response was it's all the heat and that has gone on all through the last

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:55.800
 century claiming that there is no effect other than heat.

00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:04.200
 And so if the energy level is too small to heat the cell, then there's nothing else it

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:21.360
 can do that ignores the fact all radiation interacts with matter with a sort of an antenna

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.360
 effect.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:32.800
 An antenna for radio or television is stretching a conductor out through space so it absorbs

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:42.200
 long wave energy and allows it to be directed to your detector.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:55.440
 But x-rays and ultraviolet and so on, molecular electronic resonance within a molecule or

00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:01.720
 inside an atom, it's still the principle of an antenna.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:13.120
 The wavelength relating to the structure that is organized will act on that structure and

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.320
 excite it, change its chemical properties and so on.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:27.360
 And if you deny that there is any meaningful structure between the molecular size and the

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:36.400
 whole cell size, then you are deliberately blinding yourself to all of these antenna

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:46.800
 effects that relate to the frequencies that can resonate with all of the size ranges between

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:52.080
 a molecule and a cell or an organ.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:57:01.480
 In studies with monkeys and rats, they found that the wavelength equivalent to the size

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:11.200
 of the brain or the capsule around any organ is more toxic than wavelengths.

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:21.800
 For example, if you have a wavelength that's an inch long or three inches long, the inch

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:26.480
 long will affect glands of that size.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:34.680
 For example, the gonads, the one that's three inches long will affect the brain more than

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:37.040
 the gonads.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:46.000
 And the same principle applies to all of the levels downward, especially all of the levels

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.360
 of organization inside the cell.

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:54.920
 So you're saying that if the basic structure is denied by the science, then are you saying

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.200
 they'll never get to the truth of the effects of EMFs?

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:10.880
 Yeah, part of that denial is to say that everything that happens inside the cell is like the reactions

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.720
 that would happen in a test tube.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.880
 It's molecules in solutions, simply.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:23.240
 And it's the membrane that acts like the test tube.

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:32.840
 And all of standard biochemistry is committed to this dogma that if you grind up a cell

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:42.400
 and put it in a test tube with a watery solution, you can infer anything that happens in the

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:50.480
 test tube to what happens in the cell because it's all a matter of randomness in solution.

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:55.720
 Even though you grind up the cell and destroy the life of the cell, which is what you were

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:59.600
 trying to study.

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:07.080
 You're painting the picture, if we are allowing this dogma to control the science behind all

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:14.880
 of the EMFs, it doesn't really paint a very favorable picture for consumers to ever have

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:19.960
 this technology get fixed or slowed down or stopped.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:28.640
 Yeah, and people just have to start seeing that the science that's used as a marketing

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:38.760
 tool to say it's all safe, don't study it anymore, it applies to actually every part

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:50.880
 of the medical pharmaceutical industries because they're all denying the meaning of structure

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.880
 in the cell.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.880
 Oh, including the AMA?

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.880
 Oh yeah.

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:59.720
 The structure of the cell, wow.

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.480
 So how did you get onto this so early on?

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:12.160
 What was your awakening moment?

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:23.560
 Gradually political, listening to politicians and discovering that they're all lying almost

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:33.520
 all the time made me suspicious of, especially when politics and medicine get connected.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:46.600
 I started listening for the lies and saw that not only medicine but basic science, they

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:55.880
 don't want any questions asked about their assumptions.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:06.480
 I spoke to a few famous biochemists and asked them if they didn't think that it would be

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:14.480
 better to use techniques that studied biochemistry and biophysics inside cells rather than squashing

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.440
 the cell, putting it in a test tube.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:24.080
 And they just laughed and scoffed and what a ridiculous idea.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.560
 Dr. Ray Peet is with his PhD.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.600
 We're going to dig back and get some leftovers from last month.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.080
 I'm sorry we get behind because it's so fascinating talking with this man.

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.600
 Here is an email, Dr. Peet.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.680
 It was about, they wanted to know about the time off progeste as in a natural cycle when

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.320
 ingested or rub on the gums.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:54.320
 And he said, which he did answer, but I did want to know if time off is also necessary

01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:04.160
 if it is used only by rubbing into skin and also if that would be the same for males.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:13.920
 When you're using big doses that you feel systemically, that's where the liver becomes

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:21.400
 more and more active at excreting it when you're getting these big doses on the level

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:25.280
 of a normal menstrual cycle.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:32.400
 And after two weeks of using it, your liver is throwing it off quickly.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:37.520
 So it would only keep rising if you became pregnant.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:44.920
 And that means that if you are not pregnant and have to keep dosing it, the dose would

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:50.280
 have to increase in proportion to the liver's activity.

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:57.160
 So to make it more efficient, laying off for a week or two lets your liver reset so that

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.220
 you're not excreting it so fast.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:11.960
 If you're just using it for a topical effect, like a sprain or a burn or something, your

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.480
 local effect is not going to be harmed.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.480
 Here's an email from Rose.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:23.080
 She said, "I've been on Synthroid for 30 years and because of the current virus, I've

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.360
 been starting to take my temperature in about 96.5 to 97.5.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.560
 What can I do to cause my thyroid to function more normally?"

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.200
 She wants to get her temperature up.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:46.240
 The conversion especially happens mostly in the liver, but in each tissue that needs energy,

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:53.280
 it requires glucose and selenium to do the conversion.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:08.040
 And women, by having a higher estrogen production, automatically have a weaker thyroid function

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.040
 systemically.

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:18.160
 That's why women have about five times the rate of thyroid problems because the estrogen

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:27.720
 affects the liver and the thyroid.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:34.200
 And then she wants to know how she could get her thyroid to be just better.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:41.760
 Sometimes selenium or getting more sugar in the diet, like orange juice, more frequently,

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.800
 sometimes that will get the conversion going.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:54.160
 But sometimes a few doses of progesterone can shift the balance, activating the thyroid

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:03.360
 gland and liver, which will then tend to stabilize your blood sugar so that the glucose is available

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.200
 for doing the conversion of T4 to T3.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200
 I see.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200
 All right.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200
 Interesting.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.680
 Mark wants to know, "What do I take for a cold sore and what causes them?"

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:22.080
 Oh, it's almost always a herpes virus.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:33.680
 The systemic stress, pituitary activation is behind the nerve.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:35.640
 It's the same thing.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:41.520
 Your energy dips and lets the nerve get excited.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:47.520
 The excitation of the nerve gives the virus a chance to reproduce and travel out to the

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.080
 skin.

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:58.040
 So basically keeping your thyroid hormone up so that your blood sugar is stable and

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:04.760
 doesn't let your nerves go into these stress states of prolonged excitation.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:15.520
 And then topically, aspirin, well, systemically aspirin is antiviral as well as anti-inflammatory.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:23.680
 So it can reduce the number of outbreaks as well as minimizing the extent of the damage.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:31.920
 But putting a concentrated solution of aspirin and alcohol, for example, on the outbreak

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:40.360
 is a safe way to reduce the growth of this disorder and spreading.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:46.240
 So many people have talked about over the years how this little herpes thing doesn't

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.160
 really want to ever go away and it keeps popping back up under stress.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.880
 Is there something unique with this virus that seems to be, I guess, everywhere?

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:01.680
 Isn't it that it wants to hang out and doesn't want to just stay more dormant?

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:10.200
 I think it's just the stressfulness of society.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:17.600
 Not very good diet, electromagnetic stress in the background all the time.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.640
 And it just seems to be one of the ones that pop out more frequently.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.640
 Yeah.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.080
 Yeah, for whatever reason.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.600
 Here is an email from Eric.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.600
 He's in Finland.

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.600
 Good for Finland.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:36.920
 "I have heard that as much as 10,000 I use of vitamin E during a pandemic and otherwise

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.000
 a daily basis."

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.800
 So what does Dr. Pete think about this?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.600
 Oh, 5,000 every day, but 10,000 during a pandemic of vitamin E.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:54.600
 Of vitamin D. I'm sorry, vitamin D.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:05.440
 Yeah, it overlaps with progesterone in its cell protective stabilizing actions.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:16.680
 And it's been recognized as improving immunity against viruses, but it's working on the same

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.400
 energy stabilizing system.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:27.200
 It's being considered one of the neuro steroids along with progesterone for brain protective

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.200
 effect.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.840
 Just a reminder on One Radio Network and all of our guests, we don't give any kind of medical

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840
 advice.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840
 We're not qualified.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:40.000
 We just give ideas about research and do as thy will and take responsibility for anything

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.480
 that you do in your life.

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.960
 And we'd like to remind you that.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.360
 Dr. Pete, this is from Chris in Canada.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:52.440
 What could possibly cause sudden drop in blood pressure to something like 79 over 59, making

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:57.840
 the person's arms feel numb and progressing to the rest of the body just for a minute

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.720
 or two, and then the blood pressure could return to normal?

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:08.520
 What could possibly be causing that?

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:24.280
 Negative things are sometimes behind a surge of toxins from the intestine, for example.

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:37.760
 I don't think any particular hormones have been identified for those sudden sharp drops.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:46.400
 I think in the background, low thyroid people are more likely to experience those, similar

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:58.280
 to a person who's been squatting for an hour or so, standing up will more likely experience

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.360
 a blacking out.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:08.040
 The blood pressure doesn't respond as quickly if you have a background of low thyroid activity.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:15.080
 So the getting dizzy when one is down, that was said to be adrenal, but you're suggesting

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.280
 that's a low thyroid.

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:25.600
 Yeah, the adrenals don't respond as quickly when your thyroid is low.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.880
 Here's another listener, this one in Europe and Germany from Nuri.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.920
 What's the physiological dosage, writes Nuri, of the T4 thyroid hormone?

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:44.400
 I take 175, but I still have hypothyroid symptoms and tend to have hyperadrenal function, which

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.000
 I block with propranolol.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:58.440
 T4 isn't the thyroid hormone, it's a precursor to the active hormone.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:06.520
 It's the same as with women, several times more frequently than men, but it can happen

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:15.280
 in men too, the conversion of many things such as a selenium deficiency can make the

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:24.760
 liver and other tissues reluctant to convert the T4 to the active hormone.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:31.800
 Prolonged stress hormones will tend to make it go the wrong direction towards reverse

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:39.120
 T3 rather than active T3.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:48.920
 Using a better diet, the simplest thing is to use a combination such as natural.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:59.920
 The traditional armor thyroid was what thyroid treatment was based on for the first 50 or

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:08.240
 60 years, and then the drug companies got involved testing their T4 product on young

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:16.000
 male medical students, healthy male young individuals, and they said it worked just

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.200
 like the thyroid hormone, just like the natural thing.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:30.880
 But it's exactly slightly older women who they should have tested it on because you

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:40.280
 would have found that in women in their 30s and 40s, for example, just about as often

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.960
 as it improves things, it makes things worse to take only thyroxine.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.320
 I see.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:55.760
 So what if there are people that offer just, it's not desiccated, I guess it's just

01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:02.920
 beef thyroid from grass-fed cows, and that's what it is, somehow they dry it.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:08.920
 I mean, would you have to be careful taking that?

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:19.880
 The government required meat packers to discard the thyroid gland starting in the early 1940s.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:29.000
 Before that, it had been included in sausages, and people living on farms would include the

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:41.640
 thyroid in soups, sausages, their regular diet would include maybe half a grain equivalent,

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:51.240
 30 milligrams of gland if they were eating chicken or fish or beef sausage regularly.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.320
 So just to dry it up, thyroid, these are from, I think, New Zealand.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:01.880
 Would that have all the good stuff that people wanted, they could try this instead of the

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.960
 other pharmaceutical stuff?

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:13.520
 Yeah, the thing is that Armour used to have a standardized way of extracting the fat and

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:20.040
 dehydrating it and testing the potency on mice, every bat.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:30.520
 So every Armour thyroid pill was highly standardized with biological testing, and now none of that

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.760
 is done.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:41.000
 The preparation is very different, and so you can hardly tell what to expect when you

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.440
 take a natural thyroid product.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.440
 I see.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:49.360
 So early on, Armour, you were saying, were just doing similar to what you could actually

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.400
 get online without a prescription, just a beef?

01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:03.320
 Yeah, some of them that are deep added and dehydrated and pure stuff will be three times

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.800
 as strong as the old Armour.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.800
 Very, very potent.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:18.160
 And others prepared in a different way will be so weak you hardly feel the effect if you

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.920
 take 150 milligrams of it.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:22.920
 Very interesting.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.400
 This is from Thomas, he's in Sweden.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.960
 Boy, we have a European contingency.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.640
 Well, these are from last month.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.480
 I'm still working on last month's emails.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.480
 God.

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480
 Let's see.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:40.200
 It was quite a nightly problem with leg cramps, and I was trying things like magnesium, potassium

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:46.520
 supplements, and it would get really bad if I had indulged in something sweet or salty

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:47.520
 in the evening.

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.400
 Finally, I understood the best cure for this was almost instantaneous was to limp over

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.920
 to the kitchen and drink a big glass of water.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.360
 Now, I just wonder what could be the root cause of this if the hydration could have

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.800
 fixed the problem?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:05.800
 Possibly dehydration.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.800
 Yeah, just dehydrate.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:16.560
 Yeah, the pH of the blood changes if you're suddenly dehydrated.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:24.200
 But milk is a very good bedtime snack because it lowers several of the stress.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:30.240
 Almost all of the stress hormones are lowered by the content of milk.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:35.800
 So the idea that's where it comes from, a warm glass of milk before bed, kind of works.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.840
 Dr. Pete, somebody wants to know about your soap.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:43.600
 Is there any natural soaps that are without Prufus?

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.440
 Do we get Prufus by using soaps with Prufus?

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.520
 By using what?

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:55.080
 By using soap with polyunsaturated fatty acids.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:04.320
 Coconut and olive oils are the traditional best for soaps.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.640
 The polyunsaturated fats tend to make the soap go rancid quickly.

01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:21.680
 So that's why they've historically preferred coconut oil and olive oil.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:27.160
 Do you think extra virgin or I think you had a favorite kind of coconut oil is a good thing

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:33.880
 for many people, most, you use your words, to consume regularly, like a big glob of it?

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.440
 Is it good for us?

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:44.960
 If it's well refined, some people are very allergic to coconut, so it's good to be cautious.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:57.160
 Even some refining doesn't get the, if it has a fragrant coconut odor, then you have

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.600
 to watch out for the allergens.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.360
 But allergic reactions, you're only a cautionary tale for coconut oil?

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:15.920
 Yeah, otherwise it's very safe and helps to oppose the toxic effects of polyunsaturated

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.920
 fats.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.360
 Oh, it's a counter to Prufus.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.360
 Yeah.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.480
 Oh, that's great.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.120
 But you like to refine because of the allergic, the allergy potential.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.120
 Yeah.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.120
 Right.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:35.800
 Some people will have a very strong asthma attack or hemorrhoids or other symptoms from

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.800
 it.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.360
 Here's an email from Mary.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:52.160
 Can Dr. P talk about the physiologic role of norepinephrine and norel adrenaline?

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.320
 Norelpinephrine and norel adrenaline.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:06.320
 Yes, the norepinephrine, was that the first one?

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.760
 Yes, norel, epinephrine, and then norel adrenaline.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760
 They're the same thing.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.840
 Same thing, okay.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:25.560
 The nore is the type that nerves, other than the adrenal glands, form.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:28.440
 But their effect is very similar.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.440
 Here's a good one.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.560
 50-year-old woman, slightly overweight, menopausal.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.120
 I drink milk, OJ, collagen, and honey before bed.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:39.960
 I seem to wake up every day at 3 a.m. wide awake.

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:41.080
 Difficult to fall back to sleep.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.320
 Any thoughts?

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:52.920
 It's okay to just wake up and have a snack, a glass of milk or orange juice.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:20:04.920
 As the liver gets inefficient from such things as PUFA exposure, estrogen exposure, hypothyroid

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:13.800
 or other nutritional deficiencies, it becomes less able to store glycogen enough for the

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800
 whole night.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.880
 Anna is also in Finland.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:21.720
 She says, "Can you give some advice on how to get rid of varicose veins?

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:27.240
 Is natural progesterone lotion useful?"

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:38.440
 It can help, but getting your estrogen under control, the reason they so commonly develop

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:51.280
 during pregnancy is not only the pressure on the veins and the pelvis, but the estrogen

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:59.840
 stops the smooth muscle, reduces the smooth muscle tone, and progesterone activates a

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.640
 smooth muscle contraction.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:10.360
 So getting the ratio in your body systemically in favor of progesterone is the important

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.760
 thing.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.480
 The veins are just a symptom.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:24.200
 Your whole body is experiencing an imbalance, so your health will benefit if you have a

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:35.160
 blood test, for example, and get your progesterone at least, depending on your age, but it should

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:41.400
 be a few times at least greater than the estrogen level.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.080
 Here's an interesting question.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.080
 This is from George.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.080
 He is in, I don't know where he is.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:52.960
 "When I have something with butter and a little maple syrup in the middle of the night,

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.800
 it really helps me to go back to sleep sometime for four or five hours.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.560
 It could just be telling me about my body."

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.200
 That's a good question.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:09.600
 What could that be saying that George's body is needing more of if he has butter and maple

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.600
 syrup?

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:19.360
 The maple syrup comes with some very good minerals, a lot of potassium that helps the

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:30.680
 sugar work, and the sugar is kept in your stomach and intestine longer when there's

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.160
 butter with it.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.000
 That's great.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
 Here's one for you.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.160
 "Are tamarinds and persimmons good and safe to eat?"

01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.160
 Yes.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.160
 Good.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.080
 Here's one for you.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.840
 What are some natural foods and supplements that Dr. Pete has seen to be successful in

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.360
 restoring a full head of hair to a person experiencing what appears to be male pattern

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.360
 baldness?

01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360
 Okay.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.000
 Have you come up with some things over the years that guys have used to get back their

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.880
 old hair?

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:11.320
 It requires changing your whole course of health problems.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:22.800
 The hair loss tends to coincide with circulatory problems, and behind the circulatory problems

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.320
 are metabolic problems.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:33.360
 So the things to work on are getting your vitamin D up, your thyroid and progesterone

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:41.840
 and DHEA up, and your cortisol and the other stress hormones.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:49.920
 Aldosterone and parathyroid hormone are very destructive to the hair follicle and blood

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.960
 vessels and heart.

01:23:52.960 --> 01:24:03.760
 And so if you change your metabolism, lowering parathyroid hormone and aldosterone and cortisol

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:12.120
 and all of the stress-related hormones, including prolactin, that's going to save your circulatory

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.480
 system as well as your hair.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:19.640
 So along with everything else, when we react to things in the world and angst and stress

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.040
 and worry, you can lose hair over that.

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:28.880
 Yeah, and at the same time, your whole health is suffering.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:35.440
 Do we know the physiological phenomena going on with the gray and why some people gray

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.440
 early?

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.760
 Is there any science behind that?

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.760
 Do we know?

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.480
 Yeah, I've thought about it and experimented with it quite a lot.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:56.560
 I started getting individual white eyebrows when I was in my 40s, and I was thinking about

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:05.720
 the melanin in the brain being deficient in Parkinson's disease.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:14.160
 And thinking about what happens in that process, I realized that an excess of iron competes

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:20.000
 against copper, and copper is the enzyme that makes the dark pigment.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:29.440
 And too much iron will simply get in the way and knock the copper out of your pigment enzymes.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:36.520
 And I didn't want to try just eating copper.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:38.760
 I made a solution.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:43.520
 Put a penny, a real copper penny.

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:53.040
 In a little bottle of water with an aspirin tablet and about half a spoonful of vinegar.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:59.920
 So it had two acidic things to help the solvent.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:07.080
 So it was copper aspirinate and copper acetate that I was using in the solution.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:16.160
 And I put a drop of that on the white hair and watched it closely.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.240
 They grow very, very fast.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:29.280
 The very next day, and very visibly on the second day, I could see black pigment appearing

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.880
 at the root.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.080
 Just essentially an instantaneous restoration of pigment formation.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.320
 Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.760
 So you, go ahead, go ahead.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:46.720
 I did that on several hairs at different stages of their growth.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:54.160
 I would find one that was just starting out with a white tip and apply the copper and

01:26:54.160 --> 01:27:01.000
 the rest of it would, with just one application, the remaining hair would come out pigmented.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.360
 Did you ever do a lot of it and do it on top of your head?

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.920
 Did you have any?

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:14.600
 After that I started getting white whiskers on my cheeks and chin.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:22.840
 And I thought it would be a good test to put it under my lip on a little tuft of white

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.840
 whiskers.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:35.840
 And by that time, the penny had been sitting in the solution for months and was very blue.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:42.800
 And I had a burning sensation and went to wash it off quickly and it kept burning.

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:49.320
 So I kept dabbing it with water and finally looked to see what had happened that caused

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.320
 that persistent stinging.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:28:01.000
 And rather than just finding a red area, I found a brown mole-like elevation all around

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.800
 those white whiskers.

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:12.880
 It had produced an instant mole, in effect, elevated pigmented cells.

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:16.680
 Wow, you did a lot of pigmentation.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.880
 Yeah.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:23.280
 And changed the structure of the cells that invaded the area.

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:32.080
 And so I just watched it and over a period of a month that had leveled out and disappeared.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:40.080
 But that got me interested in the phenomenon of pigment cell migration in the skin.

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:51.680
 And the cells, it turns out that pigment cells can swim through the seemingly solid structure

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.720
 of your skin.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:29:00.600
 They can travel almost an inch a day in warm weather when your skin temperature is around

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.540
 90 degrees.

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:07.160
 They can migrate with amazing speed.

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:17.120
 And I found that if I provided them with the nutrients that they needed, which included

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:31.200
 copper, that a mole would disperse or move and fade out, go back to being a normal pigmented

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.200
 skin.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200
 Interesting.

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:37.640
 So you did the copper, aspirin, and vinegar, right?

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.640
 Copper penny?

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:39.640
 Yeah.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:52.840
 I found that on my sideburns, only about 10% of the white hairs reverted to black pigment

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.800
 formation after one application.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:02.560
 And I realized that's because our eyebrows have a lifespan of only about a month.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:10.880
 Your facial hairs and head hairs live years.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:16.760
 Any one application is only going to affect a small percentage that are in the right phase

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760
 of growth.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.700
 I wonder if there'd be a source of copper you could experiment with other than trying

01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:24.840
 to find a pre-64 penny.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.840
 Yeah.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:29.760
 I decided the safest was just to eat more oysters.

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:30.760
 Oysters?

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:34.240
 Yeah, as a very strong source of copper.

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.240
 Ah.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.240
 And safe.

01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.240
 Interesting.

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.240
 Yeah.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.400
 In Ayurvedic medicine, they recommend folks put their water in a copper vessel in the

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.520
 fridge and drink some of that every day.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.120
 Yeah, that's safe.

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.120
 That's pretty safe?

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.120
 Yeah.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.120
 That's really fun.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.120
 Interesting.

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.120
 Here is Cody in Vero Beach, Florida.

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.040
 I have a question about vaccines.

01:30:54.040 --> 01:31:01.200
 Dr. Pete had discussed how some vaccines and adjuvants more or less permanently alter our

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:08.580
 body being as they, that so many people, even those born as early as 1950s, have been subjected

01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:13.200
 to vaccines and harmful adjuvants since a young age.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:18.000
 Are those that had vaccines hopeless in ever having true health?

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.360
 Is the damage of the vaccine significant enough that no amount of good diet, healthy life,

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.520
 and metabolic energy can reverse it?

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:39.560
 If you look at the inflammatory and degenerative disease trend in young people, starting with

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:53.880
 a great expansion of vaccination in America in the late 1980s, the increase of allergies

01:31:53.880 --> 01:32:02.600
 in young people and all of the inflammatory degenerative diseases, there's a steady sharp

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:09.720
 increase starting around that year when the vaccine expansion happens.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:16.720
 So it's hard to explain this deterioration of health otherwise.

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:26.120
 And it just makes it more urgent that these people start doing as many things right and

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:36.280
 to basically start being skeptical about recommendations of the medical system.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.160
 Here's some good questions for you that have not been asked before.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.640
 We like new things.

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.640
 It's always good.

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:50.000
 Matthias, he says, "Does Dr. believe in the zeitgeist that proclaims homosexuals are born

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.200
 that way?"

01:32:53.200 --> 01:33:03.280
 Well, there are enough studies in animals as well as people during a stress situation

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:14.000
 such as famines, pregnancy subjected to extreme stress will cause great changes in their sexual

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:22.520
 behavior including the sexual preference.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:31.400
 So it could be something that an idea and a feeling and a tendency that could happen

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:36.720
 from birth that...

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:48.040
 Everything that happens to you during gestation is shaping you, your whole system of mental

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:58.000
 functions, emotions, physical shape, rate of metabolism, all of that.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.320
 This just in, this would be a timely thing, go ahead and mentioned it.

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:07.080
 Supreme Court out with a decision today, landmark, which now features two new justices appointed

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.480
 by President Trump.

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:14.560
 Gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans individuals cannot legally be discriminated against by

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:21.880
 employees meaning they can't be fired nor hired simply by being LGBTQ.

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.880
 Just out this morning.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:25.200
 So that ties in with that.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:28.520
 And how does Dr. feel about abortions?

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:33.040
 Wow, they're really going after you this morning, abortions.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.040
 Feel about what?

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.040
 Abortions.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.040
 What's your...

01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:54.880
 It's best to control your conception but sometimes there's just not a system for properly

01:34:54.880 --> 01:35:09.760
 sustaining the pregnancy in a healthy way so it's never a good thing in any sense but

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.520
 avoiding worse things I think it's a proper thing.

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:22.080
 Do you have any theories or thought about when soul comes into the body?

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:33.920
 Oh, I think it's there before the body actually.

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.040
 There's continuity of soul.

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.560
 In everything, right?

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.560
 Yeah.

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.200
 Here's another interesting one.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:46.400
 When you're looking back on your life and reflecting what's the advice you would give

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.240
 someone maybe 50 years younger than you?

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.600
 So Dr. Pete you've had your body what 83 years, right?

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:55.600
 83?

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.600
 Is that right?

01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:02.240
 So here's someone saying okay I'm 33 what advice can you give me?

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:10.760
 Oh, stay alert is the main thing.

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.120
 Times are going to get worse.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.000
 Just stay aware of what's going on in the world.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
 Yeah.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.200
 A couple more then we'll let you go.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:21.360
 Good questions this morning.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.360
 Thanks.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.360
 What does Dr. Pete think about a water filter through a Berkey water filter?

01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.560
 I know it's not reverse osmosis but a lot of credible people seem to like it.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.000
 Does it remove fluoride and other things?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.880
 I don't know what that kind is.

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.960
 Reverse osmosis is good.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:43.480
 I don't know about Berkey either but pretty much is it.

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:49.840
 Dr. Daniels has mentioned on Patrick's show that sauerkraut is used for internal scoring.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.960
 Do you know about this and can suggest it or add something else?

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:54.960
 Internal scoring.

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:55.960
 What kind of juice?

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:56.960
 Sauerkraut.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:57.960
 Sauerkraut juice.

01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:58.960
 Oh.

01:36:58.960 --> 01:36:59.960
 I don't know.

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:00.960
 It tastes nice.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:20.080
 If a person finds it pleasing, the salt can be a protective, relaxing factor that I don't

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.360
 think has any harmful effects.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.360
 This is from JD.

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:29.520
 Can Dr. Pete give me ideas on getting rid of ulcers?

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:32.800
 What would you do to help somebody get rid of ulcers?

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:38.560
 I suspect, I don't know, they're talking about stomach ulcers.

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:44.080
 Is there a connection between some kind of a bacteria, what's it called?

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.120
 Yeah, the pylori.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.120
 Pylori.

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.120
 Yeah.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:51.640
 What do you know about stomach ulcers?

01:37:51.640 --> 01:38:03.040
 The stress predisposes the stomach to poor immunity.

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:13.840
 Properly working digestive system is sterile and that depends on a complete good nutrition

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:25.920
 with good thyroid function and getting a vigorous digestive process, lots of stomach, quick

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:35.880
 production of digestive fluids, quick peristalsis, all of that will keep your upper digestive

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:41.160
 tract completely sterile.

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:49.680
 Do you think the meme that's out there that as we age we lose stomach acid, do you think

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.440
 there's anything to that?

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.440
 Yeah.

01:38:52.440 --> 01:39:01.640
 The stress hormones increase and the energy hormones decrease with age.

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:12.720
 Thyroid becomes less effective because of anti-thyroid factors, inflammatory mediators,

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:21.240
 the things that promote fibrosis and scarring and atrophy and inflammation all tend to increase

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:33.320
 with aging and so all of the energizing anti-inflammatory things offset the aging process.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:39.120
 So could that be a tie in with people who are not busy and whatever, family disconnect

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:46.800
 and on medicine and nursing homes that that all just piles on of one another?

01:39:46.800 --> 01:40:00.440
 Yeah and the things that have become so obvious with the COVID treatment and the facts of

01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:10.600
 natural immunity to the COVID are revealing new things about how to offset aging because

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:23.200
 the things that cause the atrophy of aging predispose to the serious symptoms from the

01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:33.080
 virus and so for example, the low sartan or the entrotansin receptor blockers that have

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:43.520
 been so effective against the symptoms of COVID also offset many of the problems of

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:56.440
 aging, nerve degeneration, Alzheimer's type things, muscle frailty, osteoporosis, everything.

01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:05.400
 There's no distinction between the degeneration of aging and the degeneration that kills you

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.480
 from a flu infection.

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:10.800
 Dr. Ray Peat, final question and then we'll let you go.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:16.200
 So in all of your experience being on this planet 83 years and looking at this for 50

01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:26.400
 years or so, do you think it's at all possible that a safe and effective virus for this COVID-19,

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:33.160
 whatever it is, could be available in the fall or even early next year?

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.400
 A vaccine for it?

01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:38.840
 Yes sir, a vaccine.

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:45.040
 No, has there ever been a safe and effective vaccine?

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:52.800
 The whole issue of safety testing has been fraudulent.

01:41:52.800 --> 01:42:02.640
 The CDC disobeyed an order of Congress in not doing safety studies when they gave the

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:12.200
 pharmaceutical industry immunity from damages caused by killing people with bad vaccines.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:18.960
 When they gave them that immunity, they were obligated by Congress to do safety testing

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.480
 and report every two years.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.360
 For 30 years, they did absolutely nothing.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:33.320
 And the safety testing that has been done, for example, if you think that the aluminum

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:45.760
 adjuvant has been causing deaths and brain damage, you would test it against a blank,

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:55.040
 something for sure not containing aluminum, but they used aluminum in the so-called placebo.

01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:00.520
 They used a toxic placebo to measure the toxicity of the vaccine.

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.840
 Deliberate intentional fraud.

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:11.640
 So Bobby Kennedy and his group did a FOIA request for safe and effective studies and

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:14.080
 they just turned up empty.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:20.400
 So you're suggesting that even for measles, mumps, or rubella, there's never been safe

01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:23.600
 and effective testing done on these guys.

01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:26.040
 And the same with flu vaccines.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:28.440
 Flu vaccines, never.

01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:37.840
 And I think it's important to look at who the U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:50.440
 is, who they are, and who the organization has been, what they've been doing historically.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:44:00.440
 During my lifetime, there have been just horrible, incredible scandals that they managed to keep

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:01.440
 secret.

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:09.680
 They said if some good organization found out about this, there could be a lot of smoke.

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:20.120
 For example, that they were infecting orphans in Guatemala with syphilis as part of a secret

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.160
 experiment.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:31.960
 That they were covering up evidence of radiation damage from nuclear accidents in experimental

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:38.920
 reactors in the United States and from Three Mile Island.

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:43.760
 They've been on the side of the offenders, keeping the information from the public.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.760
 Dr. Ray Peet, PhD.

01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:50.960
 He's here on the third Monday of every month.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:53.840
 Dr. Peet, thanks so much for your time once a month.

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:55.240
 We really appreciate it.

 And they just send you an email and then you work it out with the folks, right?

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.560
 Who send you an email?

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:10.560
 RayPeatnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:14.600
 Well, Dr. Peet, happy painting.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.400
 And we'll talk to you next month.

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:23.520
 Let us know if there's ever anything we can do for you, if we can help you get any additional

01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:24.520
 information out.

01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:25.520
 We're always available.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.520
 We'd have you on any time.

01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:27.520
 Okay, thank you.

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.520
 Thank you, sir.

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.520
 Bye-bye.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:30.520
 Bye.

01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.520
 Dr. Ray Peet, RayPeatnewsletter.com.

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:38.880
 What a wonderful find to have this gentleman available.

01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:39.880
 Thanks for all your great questions.

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.000
 Boy, you had some good ones today, baby.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:43.880
 Yeah, we always do.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:50.640
 Okay, we have Dr. Christine Northrup, who's quite an interesting lady.

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:55.640
 Sharon has put up a nice video of her on the front page of One Radio Network.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:59.680
 So come by tomorrow, we're going to talk to her.

01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:06.680
 And then we're going to dig into the world of finance and geopolitics with Paul Reiter.

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:17.960
 He says that five times in the last 90 years, five times in the last 90 years, let me see

01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:24.560
 if I can read the whole thing, elements of US power structure have tried to oust a sitting

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:28.880
 president without an election.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:31.920
 Five times.

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:33.920
 Can you guess who those were?

01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:37.880
 Can you guess?

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.520
 Five times.

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:43.280
 And then Brandon Smith.

01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:49.080
 He's quite a fascinating fellow.

01:46:49.080 --> 01:46:51.560
 I think his website is altmarkets.com.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:56.680
 Yeah, Brandon Smith, he'll be here on Wednesday.

01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:58.280
 So cool stuff coming up.

01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.640
 I love you all very much.

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.880
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:03.240
 Been an honor to be here with you.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:09.280
 We're getting closer, I think, to having the video thing tracking every day.

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:13.560
 So you can see the guest and we're making some headway with that.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:20.120
 So again, if I can do anything for you during the week after the show, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:25.300
 I love you all very much.

01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:28.640
 Thank you and may the blessings be.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:33.680
 We talk about your health, wealth and well-being on OneRadioNetwork.com.
