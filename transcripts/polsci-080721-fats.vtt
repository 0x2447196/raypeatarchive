00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Welcome to Politics and Science.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 Politics and Science can be heard weekly on WMRW LP1 95.1 FM, airing on Wednesdays at

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.200
 5 p.m. and Sundays at noon.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.920
 And in the Bellows Falls area, it can be heard on WULL LP Bellows Falls at 101.1 FM, airing

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.560
 from 3 to 4 p.m. on Sundays and from 9 to 10 a.m. on Mondays.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.340
 Politics and Science presents the viewpoints of its participants and does not necessarily

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.360
 reflect the viewpoints of any other person or organization.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:47.800
 And my guest today on Politics and Science is Raymond Peat, endocrinologist and physiologist

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 from Eugene, Oregon.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 And Ray, how are you today?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 Good.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 Good.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800
 Good.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 Good.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 Hands like...

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 And Ray, maybe you should give your resume a bit, Ray, because obviously you can do it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 better than I.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 Oh, well, I'm not sure I can.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 Okay.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 I was a humanities person first, and while I was studying painting and literature and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.440
 such, I was interested in science and read widely in libraries and encyclopedias and

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.120
 such.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.600
 And my first teaching job while I was studying linguistics at Ohio State was in a little

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.200
 college where I got assigned to teach biology.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.880
 And that, because I had been reading in it for so long, the experience of teaching it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.440
 was fun.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.040
 So I taught art and English for a few years after that, but finally decided to go back

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.440
 to graduate school in 1968 to study biology, actually, in a university.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:10.880
 And my first courses in the sciences didn't impress me that I would be able to learn much

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880
 in a university.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.760
 Same in English and philosophy and psychology and other departments I tried being a graduate

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 student in.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 I basically felt that the institutions were anti-educational, that their purpose was to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.120
 prepare people to conform, to get a job and go along with the system.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.680
 But by the time I finally decided to be a biologist, I had learned how to be quiet enough

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.320
 that I could get through the degree program.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.920
 The graduate school experience, I think most people, having done it, recognize that it's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:08.200
 exercise in conformism rather than anything very special about learning.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.880
 You mean that they're looking for certain behavioral patterns from their students?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.920
 In the '60s, a psychologist at Oregon State University did a study of academic success

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:32.400
 and how students had scored on the Miller Analogies test, which is somewhat a test of

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400
 cultural knowledge.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:41.080
 You have to know the language, but it's partly a study of mental flexibility and ability

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.200
 to reason about new problems.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.640
 She found that the students who scored average on the Miller Analogies test were the straight

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.880
 A, very successful students in graduate school.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.840
 The ones who deviated from the average, either up or down, were the less successful in graduate

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
 school.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:19.880
 Meaning that having an average ability and conforming really is the way to be an outstanding

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.520
 graduate student.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 So after you were a graduate student, you got your PhD in...

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 In 1972.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.520
 Okay.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:44.200
 And I actually took more courses in biochemistry than in biology, but the degree was in biology.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200
 Right.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.120
 And since then you've taught at a number of universities, I believe.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.800
 Yeah.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.400
 I taught some courses at the University of Oregon, but also in Mexico, University of

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.800
 Veracruz, and State University of Mexico.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.240
 And you write extensively in a newsletter that I know of called Ray Peat's Newsletter.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.800
 Yeah.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:27.280
 I've been doing that since 1981, when I, having had essentially all of my research rejected

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:34.480
 by the journals, I decided just to go ahead and publish my own things and not have to

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.360
 deal with editors.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:47.960
 I had sent some very simple, critical things as letters to editors, for example, Science

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:56.840
 Magazine, pointing out that they were drawing racist conclusions from evidence that had

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.280
 absolutely nothing to do with their conclusions.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:11.520
 And even a little two sentence criticism like that was rejected as being more extreme than

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.440
 the authors of the study I was commenting on.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:28.080
 And I considered science to be so political that I decided to publish my own books and

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.080
 newsletters.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.440
 I think some of your writings are what prompted me to name the show Politics and Science,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.360
 because the two seem very closely interwoven.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.120
 In fact, they seem to be able to not escape from each other, and to the detriment of science,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.120
 I'm afraid.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.120
 Yeah.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:58.040
 In the '50s, including when I first started teaching biology, my course was officially

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.640
 named Biology Introduction for Physics Majors.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:13.600
 And since the students were planning to major in physics, I thought that the biological

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:19.640
 work should find something that would relate to their interests.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:32.240
 And I thought that information technology, how the organism was interpreted as information

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:40.280
 and radiation biology, how the organism interacted with radiation, I thought those were things

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.560
 that would be important to physics majors.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:52.640
 And the radiation issue, when the students got interested in reading what the government

00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:01.360
 was saying about the safety of radioactive fallout, that caused great turmoil in the

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.320
 trustees of the university.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:14.720
 And they invited a professor from the University of Illinois to apply for my job.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:23.280
 When he arrived, his invited speech on the topic of his choosing was on radiation biology.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:32.360
 And he said he started his lecture looking at his wrist and saying, "You notice I'm not

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.360
 wearing a wristwatch."

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:42.760
 He said, "I realized how much radiation was being emitted from the dial and threw my watch

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.200
 away in a radioactive disposal."

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:54.600
 And he not only didn't get the job he wanted to apply for, but he got fired from the University

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.600
 of Illinois.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.600
 I wonder how many they had to go through before they found a proper replacement for you.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.600
 I never heard.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:09.000
 Yeah, well, it sounds like you're not alone out there.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.440
 And I know at one point you recommended to me a book called Cold War in Biology, which

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.320
 certainly speaks to the politics that are going with the science.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:29.920
 Yeah, that's a good introduction to the politics of genetics in a broader sense, not just the

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.680
 racist genetics that they were teaching in American universities, but the whole history

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.720
 way back to the 19th century.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.720
 Yeah.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.080
 And maybe at some point we can cover that again.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.920
 I was hoping today that we'd talk about fats somewhat.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.840
 That's still a subject that's in the news all the time.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.600
 The government always makes recommendations for what kind of fats you should be eating,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.960
 and they seem to change their minds about every five years or so.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.040
 They come out with a new proclamation.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.760
 For a while they were telling you to avoid...

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.280
 I remember when I was growing up, they told you to avoid greasy fried foods, which I think

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:15.480
 at that time was vegetable oil, or I suppose it could have been coconut at that point,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.840
 but I think a lot of people were frying their foods.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:27.120
 And Wesson oil was the standard in the '50s when I was born in '55, so probably 1960 I

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.800
 became aware of things like that.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.720
 So and then at some point they did tell you that those fats were good for you, the vegetable

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.240
 oils, and that the thing to avoid was butter.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.440
 Yeah, Wesson oil was cottonseed oil.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440
 Oh, was it?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.960
 I always thought that was corn.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:54.800
 Well maybe it was at some time, but in the '50s when I investigated it, it was cottonseed

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.160
 oil.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:06.880
 That has a long history, way back Mark Twain in one of his books told about hearing a conversation

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:15.880
 in the, I think, 1860s, people were on his boat talking about how they were going to

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.440
 make Americans eat cottonseed oil instead of butter.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.240
 That's right.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.160
 Yeah, talk about... there's a fat conspiracy for you.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.160
 I think I read that.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:35.280
 They were planning... they were taking olive oil from Italy and then cutting it 10 to 1

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.120
 with cottonseed oil.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:46.480
 About 10 years ago the FDA did a survey of all of the imported olive oil sold in the

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.080
 U.S. and reported that 70% of it was adulterated still.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.080
 Is that right?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.800
 Well that's not too encouraging.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:02.120
 So I thought, I was thinking if you feel like it, maybe we could start with a bit of the

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:09.040
 history of fat consumption, sort of what's traditionally been eaten by humans and how

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:18.040
 that's evolved in the last century or so.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:37.520
 Well, in the 19th century my relatives were still preferring fat meat to lean meat and

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.960
 the taste of it seemed to be an important guide.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:52.720
 People really didn't trim the fat from their meat because it tasted good.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:13:11.400
 It was fairly isolated areas where they used the exotic oils like extracted oils.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:24.120
 They just ate either oily fruits, the coconut itself, or avocados and sunflower seeds and

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:30.680
 fat poultry and fat beef and pigs and so on.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:43.200
 I guess around the 18th century was when the industrial market started promoting cod liver

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:50.360
 oil and some of the seed oils.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:14:00.440
 Even fish oil was primarily used for varnish and lamps right up until the time of petroleum

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.240
 when petroleum became so cheap.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:18.760
 Then the plant and fish oils became too expensive and they went looking for new markets.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:29.480
 The coconut oil is easy to get out with primitive technology and so the oriental countries where

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:40.560
 it was grown, they would boil the semi-dried coconut meat and float off the oil.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:50.120
 It was very cheap and was being used to feed chickens and pigs and such in the United States

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.000
 and to make Oreo cookies for example.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Because of its cheapness it didn't get rancid.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.520
 But the agricultural industry in the 40s experimented and found that even though it was cheap it

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:20.440
 stimulated the animals appetites and metabolic rates and caused them to eat more food and

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.960
 gain less weight.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.880
 One reaction was to use chemical poisons to slow their metabolic rate by poisoning the

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.840
 thyroid gland.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:43.080
 Another discovery was that if they used fish oil or linseed oil or cottonseed oil, any

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:50.000
 of the unsaturated fats, they could slow the metabolic rate and make them put on fat more

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.840
 cheaply.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:16:04.240
 So the seed oil industry now had a fairly good market in feeding pigs.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:14.800
 But around that time, around 1950, the petroleum chemists found a new use for petroleum other

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:23.440
 than fuel, making paints and plastics out of it, where the fish oil and linseed oil

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:31.160
 had been major bases for making paints and varnishes.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.560
 Now those markets were lost.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:44.720
 So the linseed oil industry in particular looked for new ways to sell their products

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.760
 since the paint market was drying up.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:58.360
 And that was when the oil as an essential nutrient idea started being promoted.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:10.760
 The study that has been cited for many decades was performed in connection with the lard

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.760
 industry.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:20.520
 That claimed that unsaturated fats were essential nutrients.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:31.120
 And so the linseed oil industry, because their product is rich in unsaturated fats, picked

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:41.880
 up that isolated bit of research, which happened to be fairly unscientific because they had

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:50.480
 neglected or ignored or suppressed the studies which previously had demonstrated that animal

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:59.240
 thrived on a diet completely lacking the unsaturated fats or any fats in fact.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:07.480
 But that study was so promoted by the oil industry that it created the idea that the

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.560
 unsaturated fats are essential nutrients.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.600
 So even though they claim they're essential, you're saying there was an experiment where

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.880
 animals thrived without them?

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:27.680
 Yeah, starting about 1910 to all through the 1920s, there were several experiments in which

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.160
 animals were actually healthier when they didn't get any of the fats.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:43.680
 A German study that I saw, an abstract in biological abstracts, it was published in

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:52.520
 1927, showed that as the animals received less fat in their diet, the incidence of cancer

00:18:52.520 --> 00:19:02.200
 decreased, and the cancer rate was directly proportional to the amount of fat in the diet.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:14.080
 And the fat study and the others that showed increased longevity were ignored in the research

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.680
 that claimed the essentiality of the unsaturated fats.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:28.080
 Yeah, I mean, you hear that from so many people that they're essential, and I know it's just

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.440
 sort of ubiquitous that these things are...

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:40.640
 The University of Texas had a famous nutrition lab under Roger Williams, who wrote Nutrition

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.760
 Against Disease in the '50s or '60s.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:56.960
 And in his lab in the 1940s, the rat disease that was supposedly caused by a deficiency

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:05.880
 of essential fatty acids, the people in this Texas lab said, "That looks exactly like our

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.520
 vitamin B6 deficiency disease."

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:18.120
 And the B vitamins, only one or two of the B vitamins were known at the time the original

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120
 research was done.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:26.800
 But in the '40s, they had identified the deficiency disease specifically caused by a vitamin B6

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800
 deficiency.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:42.400
 And so they reproduced the diet fed in the 1929 research to their animals, but gave them

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:52.040
 vitamin B6, and it completely cured the essential fatty acid deficiency without any essential

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.320
 fatty acids.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:05.720
 And the apparent interpretation of what had happened, why the fat-free or low-fat diet

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:13.960
 caused those symptoms was that the essential fatty acids suppressed the metabolic rate

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.760
 as the pig farmers demonstrated.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:26.520
 And when your metabolism is suppressed, you don't eat as much food or drink as much water,

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.120
 and so your nutritional requirements are depressed.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:41.880
 But if you stimulate their metabolism by not giving them the suppressive essential or unsaturated

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:48.920
 fatty acids, then you will reveal a vitamin deficiency.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:57.880
 And as your metabolic rate increases, you eat more protein, and to process that protein,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:04.160
 you use up your vitamin B6 faster.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:14.760
 So do you think people are thinking that these symptoms that are caused by the vitamin B6

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.120
 deficiency, they're blaming it on the lack of these EFAs?

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:29.520
 There have been a few other isolated studies through the '50s and '60s.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:41.400
 Usually one patient would get eczema, and that would get published as proof that the

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:47.520
 essential fatty acids deficiency disease existed.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:54.200
 But at that time, when they were giving a fat-free diet, they were often giving intravenous

00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:06.720
 feeding, and their concept of complete intravenous nutrition until well into the 1970s was radically

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.040
 deficient in several of the essential known nutrients.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.680
 Zinc, for example, wasn't included.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:25.120
 And a biotin deficiency can produce some of the related symptoms, and when your metabolic

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:32.560
 rate is high and you metabolize more protein, that's one of the deficiencies.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:40.720
 Zinc, biotin, B6 are among the first deficiencies to show up when you're having a high metabolic

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.960
 rate and eating protein, but not a very rich vitamin source.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.960
 I see.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:54.000
 So you're saying the control group that wasn't being given the "essential fatty acids" weren't

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.200
 getting any minerals and vitamins?

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.200
 Yeah.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:07.720
 Several of the publications were on intravenous feedings that they called "complete nutrition."

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:17.360
 Some hospitals were keeping babies on this intravenous feeding, and even though the nutrition

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:26.920
 journals knew what the essential nutrients such as zinc were, hospitals refused to include

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:34.360
 them because doctors weren't doing it, and it was just the nutritionists who said humans

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.160
 needed zinc.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.640
 So it's a little confusing because I think people think they have a symptom, say eczema

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:51.400
 or something like that, and some naturopathic consultant tells them to eat flax oil or something

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.400
 like that.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.400
 Yeah.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:25:02.880
 If you suppress your metabolism, you can get under the metabolic rate at which you need

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:10.520
 a certain amount of nutrition, and so you can cure a vitamin B6 deficiency or a biotin

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:19.680
 or a zinc deficiency sometimes just by taking a toxic thing that suppresses your metabolism.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.120
 So you're saying in the long run, though, that has other bad effects.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.120
 Yeah.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:32.080
 The same with, for example, fish oil to suppress inflammation.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:41.720
 But even people who were advocating its use published reports showing radical suppression

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:47.120
 of immunity by eating a moderate amount of fish oil.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:53.560
 David Horvath, for example, went on advocating polyunsaturated fats therapeutically, even

00:25:53.560 --> 00:26:02.360
 though he published evidence showing decisive suppression of the immune system.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:08.840
 You can get away with that for six months or a year, maybe a couple of years, suppressing

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:15.320
 inflammation just by knocking out your immune system, but it's not good in the long run.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320
 Right.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.080
 You also hear on the fish oil front, you hear that, I know some people take fish oil to

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.640
 fight depression, and what's your take on that?

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:33.280
 I've read all of the publications on it, and some of them say it makes depression worse.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.640
 Some say it doesn't do anything.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.280
 These are the studies you've seen.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280
 Yeah.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:52.200
 And if you select the few that say it helped the certain group, you can truthfully report

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.040
 that this group improved, but someone else reporting that their group got worse on fish

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.040
 oil.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:09.640
 If there's a bias in the journal, who gets published, then you don't actually see the

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:15.720
 empirical data that existed in the world, but not in the medical literature.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720
 I see.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.800
 I just read a quote that you had used in one of your newsletters from somebody who used

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.960
 to be the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960
 Portia Angel.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960
 Yeah.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.960
 What was that quote, Ray?

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.960
 Do you remember?

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.960
 No.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.600
 It was something to the fact that you can't really tell the truth of the studies that

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:41.240
 you're reading unless you know all the studies that they rejected, or something to that effect.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:52.640
 If you have probability at the 5% level, but if you rejected 10 or 20 or 100 publications

00:27:52.640 --> 00:28:00.160
 with negative results, you're biasing the statistics.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:07.160
 Well, maybe we should ... I don't think we've quite actually covered all the different fats.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:13.720
 Most people have questions about ... They probably want to know what is bad and what

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720
 is good.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.280
 Is canola as bad as cottonseed oil and those kind of things?

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.280
 Maybe you could cover the spectrum there for a minute.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:33.360
 In the 1960s, there was a lot of concern that there was a special toxic fat in mustard oil,

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.920
 rapeseed oil.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:44.080
 So, they bred a variety that didn't have that particular fatty acid, and that became canola.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:56.720
 But meanwhile, Hans Selye was experimenting, and he showed that giving rapeseed oil would

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:05.040
 typically cause spots of tissue in the heart to die.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:12.840
 The mainstream medicine said that was because of the toxic fatty acid that the breeders

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.520
 were eliminating.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:27.280
 But Hans Selye gave purified linoleic acid, a major component of rapeseed oil, and showed

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:36.280
 that that was the actual toxic agent to the heart, not the so-called special toxic fatty

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.280
 acid.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:43.480
 It was the most essential fatty acid itself that was killing heart cells.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:53.320
 And he added chocolate fat, cocoa butter, to the diet, and that protected the heart.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:02.720
 In spite of the same amount of linoleic acid in the diet, adding spuric acid in the cocoa

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.720
 butter was protective.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720
 I see.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.860
 So, it's the ratio that is important.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:19.680
 One of the early rat studies that got me interested in coconut oil was putting, I think there

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:33.360
 were 15 different groups of rats on one series with pure coconut oil, high fat, low fat,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.120
 and medium fat.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:41.720
 Another one was pure, unsaturated, I think it was corn oil, high, medium, and low.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.040
 And they kept them on that diet throughout their lifespan.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:54.560
 And at the end of the normal lifespan, the fat rats were the ones on an unsaturated fat

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560
 diet.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.840
 The lean rats were the ones on the coconut saturated fat diet.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:07.320
 And the quantity of fat they ate didn't make any significant difference.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:17.320
 It was the ratio, the degree of unsaturation, corresponded to the degree of obesity at the

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.320
 end of their lifespan.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:27.840
 So, the high fat, low fat isn't the issue, it's the unsaturation that is the problem.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.680
 I see.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:38.720
 And a series of French publications in the 1980s really defined what the pig farmers

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.080
 had demonstrated practically.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:55.280
 The French showed biochemically how it works by using specific fatty acids on animals and

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:02.400
 examining the effects on different components of the thyroid system.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:16.080
 And they showed that increasing the number of unsaturations, the two double bonds was

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:37.120
 worse than mono-unsaturated, and three double bonds was worse than the two double bonds,

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.120
 and the worst was the multiply unsaturated.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120
 And every component of the thyroid system that they examined from the secretion of the

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:48.040
 thyroid gland, its transport on proteins through the blood, and the cells response to it, each

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:57.000
 of those components was selectively inhibited in proportion to the unsaturation of the oil

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 that the animal was getting.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.440
 It very neatly explained what the pig farmers found out economically.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.880
 That by slowing down the metabolism of the pig it would gain weight.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880
 Yes.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.760
 With the unsaturated fat diet.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.600
 This is probably we should devote a whole show to the thyroid itself, but perhaps you

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:23.400
 could just, I think a lot of people are not knowledgeable about what the thyroid does

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:32.840
 for them and their body, and perhaps you could just summarize that.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:40.760
 The real thyroid hormone, the active part of it wasn't discovered until the 1950s, but

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:55.240
 the function of the thyroid was studied since the mid and late 1900s, and it was known to

00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:05.600
 activate all of the organs of the body to respire, consume more oxygen, and perform

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600
 more perfectly.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:16.480
 And the deficiency of thyroid very early was learned to cause mental retardation or even

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:29.760
 under development of the brain and idiocy and infertility that developed later was a

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.680
 very early observation.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:41.040
 In some areas of the world, Cretans were good employees because they were passive and stupid

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040
 and didn't reproduce.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:51.480
 So there was the medical establishments in those areas didn't want to cure it because

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.600
 they were good for herding sheep and such chores.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.760
 You're saying it was a form of eugenics or the opposite of eugenics actually?

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760
 Yeah.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:12.760
 And Brode Barnes in the 1930s did studies both on rabbits and in Europeans and showed

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:23.200
 that the goiter gulps were highly susceptible to heart disease at a very young age.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:29.600
 In their 30s, they started having atherosclerosis and heart attacks.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:42.120
 And when iodine was introduced to those regions, the heart disease mortality decreased considerably.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:50.120
 But those areas also had a very high cancer rate, especially breast cancer.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:36:02.800
 And as recently as the 1980s, when I talked to some cancer biologists in Mexico, they

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:10.600
 were reporting that the iodine deficient regions in the mountains around Mexico City still

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.920
 had a very high rate of tuberculosis, heart disease and breast cancer.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:22.160
 All of the things that Brode Barnes had noticed in Eastern Europe in the 30s.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:28.800
 So, excuse me, but the iodine, deficiency of iodine slows your thyroid function?

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.680
 Yeah.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:40.920
 In those regions, some specific regions, iodine deficiency or iodine deficiency resulting

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:51.280
 from some particular food or contaminant, in those areas, iodine deficiency was the

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.040
 thing that could be remedied.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:37:02.160
 But in many areas, the diet interacts with limited iodine so that it isn't just an iodine

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:10.600
 deficiency, but it's eating vegetables that interrupt the formation of thyroid, even though

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:15.480
 there is some iodine in their diet.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:23.560
 The cabbage family and the unsaturated fats are the two most famous causes of interrupted

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.160
 formation of the thyroid hormone.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.120
 And people with low thyroid get goiters, which are big protrusions.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:39.320
 The pituitary gland produces thyroid stimulating hormones that compensate when your thyroid

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.280
 is being blocked.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:47.240
 Naturally, estrogen inhibits the thyroid release too.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:54.960
 And so the body is designed so that if the estrogen is inhibiting the gland, the thyroid

00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:03.000
 stimulating hormone increases to overcome that block and activates the thyroid to work

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.440
 harder.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:12.520
 And if you keep your estrogen or goitrogen high, the TSH works harder and harder and

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:21.600
 the gland gets bigger and bigger until sometimes it gets to be as big as a cantaloupe.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:30.880
 Women at puberty and during pregnancy often get a fullness in the neck.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:39.960
 And that typically causes women to have creases in the skin of their neck above and below

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.720
 the region where the thyroid is.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:51.240
 The thyroid gland is at the base of the neck on both sides of your windpipe.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:39:01.840
 Most women, but almost no men, have a defining crease right above their collarbone and just

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.280
 above their Adam's apple.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.840
 And that defining crease is from a low thyroid?

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:18.440
 Yeah, because at puberty, the thyroid gland naturally enlarges to overcome the effect

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.440
 of estrogen.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:27.040
 And that makes a fullness so that the bending of the neck causes those creases to outline

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.000
 the puffy area where the gland is.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.520
 And is that something that's completely normal?

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:42.680
 Yeah, that's part of what makes women look attractive because it corresponds to the years

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.600
 between puberty and menopause.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:55.720
 One of the things, going back to the essential fatty acids, which is ostensibly the subject

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:01.600
 of the show, you said that one of the reasons it's ridiculous to call them essential is

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600
 that they're ubiquitous.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.560
 They're in everything, every green vegetable you eat.

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.840
 And it's actually hard to get away from them.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.800
 So how we can have a deficiency is a good question.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:23.600
 It's a question of marketing and the idea that you could be deficient in something that

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:29.960
 is in every organism, even tropical organisms.

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:36.960
 Coconuts have about 2% of those fats, 1 to 3%.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:49.080
 And ruminants, sheep and cows and deer and such, have an organ to grow bacteria which

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.360
 detoxify those plant fats.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:41:01.040
 But still, 1 or 2% of the fats get through the detox system of the rumen.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:12.760
 And so beef fat and lamb fat still have, unavoidably, about 2% of those unsaturated vegetable oils.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:24.640
 So even if you ate nothing but beef and lamb and coconuts, you'd still have more than anyone

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:30.680
 ever claimed the essentiality required.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:38.080
 So by the most extreme ideas of essentiality, it's impossible, unless you eat a laboratory-prepared

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.480
 diet, to have a deficiency.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:49.040
 But the marketing departments of the Linseed Oil companies and the Wesson Oil and so on,

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:57.320
 they convinced people that since it's essential in a trace amount, it must be much better

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.920
 in a very large amount.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:09.920
 But several more recent studies have demonstrated that as you increase the unsaturated fats

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:19.680
 in the diet, the cancer incidence goes up more or less in proportion to the amount.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:29.040
 And when you extrapolate it to zero, the cancer incidence, just like the 1927 study, approaches

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.600
 zero.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.160
 When you say extrapolate to zero, you mean no unsaturated fats?

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:37.480
 Yeah.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.800
 Okay.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:45.600
 And fish oil, there's a lot of marketing of fish oil too as a supplement, just as a dietary

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.200
 supplement, not necessarily for depression.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.680
 Yeah.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:43:03.120
 A few years ago, the FDA warned that the total shouldn't exceed, I think it was three grams

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:08.920
 of DHA and EPA.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:19.680
 But they more recently have dropped that and have begun promoting it without the warning.

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:29.120
 But it definitely becomes toxic as the immune suppression studies demonstrated.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:36.280
 And the odd thing about the fish oil is that it's so unstable.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:42.800
 The only reason it was a good varnish is that it oxidizes almost instantly at room temperature

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800
 even.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:50.400
 And in your body, it's mostly oxidized before it reaches your bloodstream.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:56.920
 It has to pass through your digestive system to reach the bloodstream.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:05.760
 And by the time it gets there, it has been heated and circulated in tiny particles exposed

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.760
 to oxygen.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:17.600
 And so those so-called beneficial anti-inflammatory effects are actually produced by the oxidative

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.920
 breakdown products of the fats.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:31.760
 And so even in the biochemistry of it, it's a toxic effect that is being sold as a benefit.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.420
 I see.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.960
 So it's suppressing your immune system and that's what's getting rid of some of your

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:38.960
 symptoms perhaps.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960
 Yeah.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:48.440
 It's the free radical oxidative decomposition products that are circulating in your blood

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.440
 system.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:45:03.260
 A very small part of it reaches your tissues as the original starting DHA and DPA.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:05.900
 And Raymond, would you like to touch?

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.180
 We're talking to Raymond Peet, by the way.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.700
 I should say that more often.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.260
 Endocrinologist and physiologist from Eugene, Oregon.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:18.900
 We're talking about mostly about fats today, but also we're talking about the marketing

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:24.380
 of them and the scientific research that's gone into fats.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.580
 And how much does the marketing affect the scientific research?

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:36.980
 You know, the media seems to still be very down on saturated fats and still promoting

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.380
 unsaturated fats.

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.380
 Yeah.

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:47.220
 And they apparently have taken over the government because I see the government has basically

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:53.820
 a promotion of fish oil on their website.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.820
 Would that be the FDA?

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.340
 Is that the FDA or what's the website?

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.340
 Okay.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:09.460
 And the industry, just like the soy oil industry has subsidized research on the health value

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:20.580
 of soy oil, the fish oil industry is now rich enough that they are sponsoring conferences

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:28.740
 and paying researchers to produce studies and getting people on boards of editorial

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:31.740
 boards of the journals.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:46.140
 So just like the atomic energy industry controlling the research on the safety of radiation, the

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:53.900
 health effects of the fats are being promoted by the industry, not by objective science.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.900
 Yeah.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:47:00.980
 And I think a lot of people are familiar with the global warming being contested by the

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:07.580
 oil industry and all of the money they spend on research.

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.700
 Now you mentioned cancer in terms of unsaturated oils.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:12.700
 Does that apply?

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:20.900
 I guess fish oil is also very unsaturated oil and that applies to fish oil as well?

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:33.460
 Except that the shorter 18 carbon oils that you get from seeds fit into our enzyme systems

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:41.740
 more powerfully and so inhibit our own enzymes more powerfully.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:52.580
 The fish oils are very long and don't directly attack our enzymes in the same way.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:48:00.540
 They're unstable and spontaneously all by themselves turn into these free radical and

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:03.140
 aldehyde toxins.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:10.620
 But they are safer to our enzyme systems because their number of carbons is very different

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.860
 from the fats that we make or that we get from seeds.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.060
 And they also come with quite a few vitamins too that are good.

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.060
 Yeah.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:29.380
 And when you squeeze an oily fish, you can't help getting some vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:38.660
 D and a little E. But the E pretty much is destroyed quickly by the oxidative process.

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:50.140
 But the B comes through very strongly because it's harder to oxidize the K and A probably

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:58.340
 usually have enough activity to be of some benefit when you eat the fish oil.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.340
 I see.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.060
 So we have about five minutes left, Ray.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:07.020
 And I thought maybe we could quickly, people are probably wondering, well, what would you

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.580
 think would be good to eat?

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:14.580
 For instance, is olive oil okay, coconut oil, margarine?

00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.300
 Maybe you could run through the...

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.300
 Okay.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:23.940
 The coconut oil is around 10% of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:32.600
 And if you're only going to use half a teaspoon or so for flavoring a food or a teaspoonful

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:38.220
 every other day or something, that is small enough that it isn't harmful.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.060
 As a minor flavoring, olive oil is fine.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.060
 I see.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:52.580
 But as a major part of the diet, I think butter, beef fat, lamb fat and coconut oil are the

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:59.780
 safe ones and cocoa butter, chocolate.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:09.220
 And some studies have found that the longer saturated fats are very protective.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:15.940
 They're being investigated for curing cancer, heart disease.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:25.260
 And some of the best studies are using the long-chain saturated fats as well as ordinary

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:31.460
 butter fat and so on for treating liver disease.

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:39.180
 Alcoholic hepatitis, for example, is being successfully treated with saturated fat because

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:50.300
 about 20 years ago, they noticed that alcoholic liver injury requires polyunsaturated fats

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.300
 in the diet.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:51:01.940
 And some Hindus noticed that in the areas of India where they have primarily butter,

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:08.540
 alcoholics don't get liver disease at the high rate that they do in the areas that get

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.620
 the unsaturated fats.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:20.500
 And so the animal studies finally led to human studies in Chicago in which they are finding

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:28.140
 actual cures of alcoholic liver disease just with a good diet plus the saturated fats.

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.340
 Those ongoing studies now or there's something that...

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:32.540
 Are they old or...

00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.740
 I haven't seen anything new in the last year or two.

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:36.740
 Okay.

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:37.740
 Yeah, they're recent.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.380
 I see.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.580
 And when you say long-chain, is that coconut oil?

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:51.420
 Well, that goes up to 16 carbons and butter is 18 carbons.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:52:05.220
 And they are using experimentally some derived from sugarcane wax and other unusual long-chain

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:10.420
 fats, but those are being used therapeutically in cancer too.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.420
 I see.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:17.940
 And the unsaturated oils are just in everything now because of course the government has sanctioned...

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.340
 Our government has sanctioned them and you can't buy a potato chip that isn't cooked

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:27.020
 in canola oil or some other vegetable, unsaturated vegetable oil.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.100
 So how do we...

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:34.500
 If you say you go out to dinner, is there anything you can do to protect yourself?

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:42.620
 About 15 years ago, there was this big campaign to get coconut oil off the market.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:51.100
 It in recent years is coming back and I think if people just nag the cooks in restaurants

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:59.180
 and buyers in grocery stores, they can change things.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:07.300
 And it's changing back in the last few years to people demanding that they get real butter

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:14.820
 and other saturated fats in products.

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.860
 And finally, I think most people are worried about getting fat when you say butter, even

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.660
 though we all love it, I think.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.660
 There's nothing that tastes better on things, but...

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:32.100
 The animal studies from the industrial agriculture level all the way down to lab studies show

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:44.180
 that the polyunsaturated are extremely fattening in proportion to their role in the diet.

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:51.220
 The proportion to the saturated fats is more important than the actual quantity of fats.

00:53:51.220 --> 00:54:04.820
 I noticed in Finland where dairy foods are very common, basically probably the most common

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:16.980
 food, just going across the border from Russia to Finland, you go from a starch-eating, vegetable-based

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:23.700
 diet where everyone's fat over to a lean, healthy population where they eat lots of

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:28.820
 butter fat.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:38.300
 In general, Americans who eat milk and milk products are lean, and it's partly the calcium

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:44.340
 and vitamin D, but also the butter fat itself is helpful.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:50.620
 I guess that's the French paradox, again, that they always talk about.

00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:54.620
 How come the French are so healthy when they eat all that nasty saturated fat?

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.620
 Yeah.

00:54:55.620 --> 00:55:00.700
 Well, Ray, I guess we're basically out of time.

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.780
 Is there anything else you'd like to add?

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:07.580
 We're talking to Raymond Peet, endocrinologist and physiologist from Eugene, Oregon.

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:14.620
 People are concerned about skin health and appearance, and experiments with rabbits is

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.620
 interesting.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:24.460
 Rabbits were put on either a corn oil diet or a coconut oil diet and shaved, and so the

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.100
 sun would hit their skin.

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:33.140
 Those on the unsaturated corn oil diet got wrinkly, sun-damaged skin, and the ones on

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:40.620
 the saturated fat diet, as it's sun, it was relatively harmless to their skin.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.060
 Yeah, that's kind of telling, isn't it?

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:47.260
 Well, Ray, thanks so much for being on today.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:54.220
 The hour flew by in what seemed like a couple minutes, and I appreciate you doing it.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.220
 Okay, thank you.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:59.740
 And I'll give out your website and contact, just your website information for people.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.740
 Okay, very good.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.740
 Thanks, Ray.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.740
 Bye-bye.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.740
 Bye-bye.

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:08.140
 And that was Raymond Peet.

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:10.740
 I hope you could hear some of that.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.700
 His voice was very weak.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:17.820
 But Ray Peet's website is raypeet.com, if you're interested.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.100
 It's that simple.
