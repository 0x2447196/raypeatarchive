00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Well, once again, this is Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED 91.1 FM.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 graduating there with a degree in herbal medicine,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 and we run a clinic in Gallipol where we consult with clients

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbs,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 dietary supplements, and nutritional counseling.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 So welcome again to the show for those people who regularly tune in,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 and then for those of you who maybe have just tuned in for the first time, welcome.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 We do take callers on the show from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 And as always, it has been the format for many years now.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 I can't believe how quickly time has gone by.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat will be joining us to share his wisdom.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 This month the subject is going to be a little bit political.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 I can't say it's not because the subject that we'll be covering will definitely involve politics.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 And whilst I'm not advocating any one side for the sake of being neutral,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 there are certain fundamental tenets of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 that this great nation was founded on in 1777 with the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Declaration of Independence, et cetera.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 That's what our whole country is built on.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 So there will be a little political,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 and we invite callers to call in with any questions related or unrelated

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 to some of the topics of the political and physiological side of the topic.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Okay, so if people want to call in, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 So we're going to cover -- I think the broad topic is going to be on authoritarianism

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 and just to couch those terms that authoritarianism would cover.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Freedom of expression and freedom of religion and freedom of assembly, et cetera,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 those freedoms are not dominated by authoritarianism.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 And so we're going to bring out both kind of physiological perspective

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 as well as mental and political perspectives.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 And so, Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Yes.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Hi. Okay, so thanks so much for joining us on the show.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 As always, there are people perhaps who have just tuned in now

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 or may listen to this on an audio archive later on on the web.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Would you just give a line of your background, your scientific background, and your research?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Yeah, the relative part of my science background is that I descended against some

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 of the fundamental ideas in all of the sciences, really, especially in biology.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 I had a master's degree in humanities from the University of Oregon for several years

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 before I went to study biology, 1968 to '72 for a Ph.D.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 But I found that when I followed the college instructor's directions to give the students

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 different perspectives on scientific issues in a course called Physics for Biology Majors,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 the trustees really didn't want their students to hear the other side of some of the things

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 that were issues then in the 1950s, such as the dangers of fallout from radiation or medical radiation.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 So my whole activity over the years has been looking at descending ideas in all of the sciences.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Okay. So with reference to political ideologies, I know you've mentioned many times from both your run-ins

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 or challenges with various authoritarian figures within the studying community in order to gain your Ph.D.,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 in order to pass the exams, not to pass the exams for want of not being intelligent enough

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 to write a good enough thesis, but in order to get along.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 It's just like another kind of club where I've known from my own background that there are those people

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 who perhaps come up with dissenting, for want of a better word, ideas that are challenged,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 not mainstream, usually vehemently opposed and fundamentally threaten those kind of structures

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 that are in place in the ruling ideology of a university for this instance of explanation.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So in terms of authoritarian figures in the academic background, even, not just talking about politics

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 and geopolitics, you've been very familiar with those things that have happened that would either be blocking

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 what you would find as new research or old research, which was there, just needed to be uncovered.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And how do you think that manifests itself in academia?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 In 1965, I saw a really interesting study by a professor at Oregon State University, which I never attended,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 but in this study, she looked at the academic success of graduate students in all the departments, I think,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 at Oregon State, which used to be an agricultural college, so it tends to be more agriculture-oriented

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 rather than humanities as the university in Eugene. But she ranked the scores on mental tests,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 I think it was the Miller Analogies test, and she looked at the way the brain functions.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 The Miller Analogies measures mental flexibility as well as vocabulary and other aptitudes,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 but it's heavy on flexibility. They change the rules partly every ten questions or so.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 They use different kinds of analogy. She found that from the lowest academic achievers in graduate school,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 the lowest scores on that test corresponded nicely. And up to the middle range of the Miller Analogies test,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 that increased in rank with the academic success up to the straight A, four-point students.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 But then as the students' mental scores on the Miller Analogies test increased, their grades decreased.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And again, the very highest on the mental abilities were lower, very unsuccessful graduate students.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 That obviously is a matter of authoritarian fitting in, being other-directed rather than being powered

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 by curiosity and desire for knowledge, which really didn't fit in and made them fail.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Okay. So I think probably just to get into some of the politics, let's go for the jugular and go for some of the politics

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 in science, in academia, and then the politics within the framework which those establishments are raised or fostered.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 I think in the past, certainly up until probably the end of the Second World War,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 and I know I've brought this out with you several times about the German repatriation that was demanded

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 after the fall of the Third Reich and how the corporate assets within Germany were seized,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 as well as some of the mind capability, the intellectual capability of either the physicists or the chemists

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 or pharmacologists, etc., that were working for these big institutions were seized and brought to America.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 How the background of the New World Order was founded and Nuremberg Trials and how that whole thing basically

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 virtually acquitted a lot of these people, given that they would then work for the United States

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 in their newly seized businesses with newly seized information, and how this New World Order concept

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 is very much being exposed today on the Internet, and we're even beginning to see the emergence of news channels

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 like Fox, actually openly debating now concepts that Donald Trump's been bringing out in his various rallies.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 He's definitely not bought out, and he's definitely not a politician.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 I hear a lot of the ideologies that he has which seem to harken back to a minimal government,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 the way the Constitution was written, more decision-making by the state, less government involvement,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 make better deals, etc., etc., the kind of rhetoric I know I've heard from him.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 And then we have the counterpart to that in the campaign, Hillary Clinton, who definitely has,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 if you want to go look for it, been implicated with many different, in parentheses, crimes for which

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 they're calling for her indictment, whether it's Benghazi or whether it's the email server that got hacked

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 or whether it's the funding that she's gotten from dictators and other countries,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 maybe not dictatorial countries, but definitely nations that are certainly opposed to America's ideology.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 Where this brings our country, and in terms of the mindset in academia, the mindset in succeeding in academia,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 because the dogma that's established and is not challenged, that's set up by pharmaceutical companies

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 that have a lot of money, a lot of government lobbying power, and how this whole thing really is opposed

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 to free will and freedom of expression and a constitutionally sound republic that the republic was built on.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 And free trade, as opposed to free trade.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Yeah, I mean, there's both the TPP and other policies that have been brought up and documentation that's been brought up

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 but certainly not an American-owned or controlled framework, too.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 So I think the whole concept of other powers being in control all kind of rolls into the geopolitical space

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 that we're in at the moment with this, gosh, this kind of out of left field comes Donald Trump with his rhetoric

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 and the old kind of fabric of control and two-party monopoly, this both Republican and Democrats,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 they both seem to be very much on the same kind of side of the fence and they're all definitely much against Donald Trump

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 for whatever it is that he's standing for.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 And I know I've seen him being accused of being fascist, it's definitely one of the words,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 that's why I wanted to bring out the politics side of this hour talk with you, Dr. Peake,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 because I know you've come from a background in academia of being very much aware of the dominant authoritarian background

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 who doesn't want to accept your new uncovering of old research that proves otherwise, as well as --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 As well as new research that proves otherwise.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 So in terms of that kind of struggle between academia getting along in society,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 being free enough to have the expression to do that and new ideas and novel concepts come into market

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 because of a free market and basically the whole point is that we're not able or we shouldn't be allowed

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 and we're not allowed to offend by killing or defaming someone to verbal kind of abuse and physical abuse,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 but that free markets let good ideas come to pass because they give the people the choice to either support it or not.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Well, it's like the fascist hospitals, too.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 I mean, I was threatened to be thrown out on the streets when I needed care in the hospital

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 because I wouldn't go along with one of their procedures.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 I mean, that's fascism.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Yeah, the ruling class really has defined the words and where Mussolini clearly defined what he called fascism

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 as the blending of state power with corporate power.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 That's exactly what is what's going on here right now being called free trade.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And the trade deals which are essentially allowing the biggest corporations to impose their political standards on the rest of the world in an empire.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 So free trade is really subjecting political rules in other countries to the international corporations benefit.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 The environment in Mexico, for example, has been deteriorating for several decades with the aquiladora industry along the border,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 but then the NAFTA started because corn can be grown industrially on a huge scale in the United States.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 The subsidized corn has to be freely admitted into Mexico for people using subsistence methods dependent for their livelihood on growing their own corn animals.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 And so this subsidized cheap corn displaced farmers and created the influx of immigrants who are wanted for cheap labor in the farms.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Probably eventually, if there are any factories left, they would be doing aquiladora type work in the US.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Okay, let me just give a number up for people that may have just tuned.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 You're listening to ask your doctor came to the government.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 91.1 FM from 730 to the end of the show.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 You're invited to call him with any questions related or unrelated to this month's kind of mixed topic of politics, authoritarianism, free speech, constitutional rights, alternatives.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 And obviously we're coming from a alternative medicine background.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Dr. Peat, our guest, PhD endocrinologist, who's been studying and researching many different aspects of longevity as well as hormones, etc.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 that we've normally talk about his very graciously joined us.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 I know you weren't feeling too well earlier, Dr. Peat.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 I was a little wondered whether we'd be doing this, but I appreciate your time coming here.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 You mentioned Mussolini. That's quite interesting, actually, because when I looked earlier and I hadn't even spoken to you all day here, I looked at the what I wanted to.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 I think I'll probably initially what I wanted to do was break down the different political ideologies and see the statements that these political ideologies flew their banner over in order to get a concept of each political mindset.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 And then I think that would probably be a good place to go.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 We have another we have a caller in now who's just decided to call, but let's we can take this caller and then let's move on to the kind of individual political topic banners that each party flies under.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 And let's explore the authoritarian stance amongst that.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 OK, call you on the airway from and what's your question?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Hi, I'd rather not say where I'm from.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 But anyway, I'm in the area.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Let's see. Two things. One, one thing that's been bothering me is we really don't have a good vocabulary that a word and we like to use the word fascism, for lack of a better word.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 But it might not be precisely accurate.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 You know, we need a word that that describes something people can think about that that combines the capitalism with the police state covert operation situation that we have with our media and the government and everything.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 So so I think would really help talking about it is that we had some words.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 We need to create them somehow combining, you know, what we the language we have.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Because when you when you say the corporate media is somebody who doesn't know the field really well, they have no idea what you're talking about.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 And so it's really needed a word that, you know, sort of self-explanatory.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Right. Another thing I want to talk about briefly.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And I hate to change the subject to health, but this is usually a health show.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Sure.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 I was wondering if I see the government is affecting our health.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 That's why we have to talk about it.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Oh, tell me about it. It's just ridiculous.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 Even if it's just on a stress level.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 My house recently to tell me that that I don't have legal electricity in my mobile.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 That just happened like the last month.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 This drunk shows up telling me that the police are telling her to tell me that I don't have legal electricity.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 So, yeah, that's what the politics are like in the little town I'm living in.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 But anyway, what was the second question?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 That did help.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 I was just wondering if it's not really relevant.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 You don't want to talk about it. I'll call back some other time.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 But I was wondering about how do you like sort of re-inoculate your stomach?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Like it seems like I've had problems maybe from sulfites that killed off like maybe some of the enzymes.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 They help me digest vegetables and stuff.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 And I'm wondering if you guys have any suggestions how I can how I can sort of re-establish those living organisms that I think made digestion easier when I was younger.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 I was thinking maybe like because I know dairy products.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 It seems like if I eat a lot of cheese and I eat a lot of yogurt, then I can drink milk.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Whereas if I haven't eaten cheese and yogurt in a while, I have a lot of problems digesting milk.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 And so I was thinking that might be the same situation with vegetables.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 And you might have some ideas maybe would fermented vegetables help or something.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 Do you have any ideas on that?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 If you don't want to talk about it tonight, then I'll call you back some other time.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 No problem.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 We announced questions related or unrelated to tonight's topic.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 So feel welcome to call in about health questions because that's really the most interesting to us anyways.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Okay.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 So no problem.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 I'll give the recolonization answer to you, Dr.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 P.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And then I'll cover the fascism because that's actually a bit could be the beginning of the explanation of a different party mindsets.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 And we can explore the authoritarian system.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 I think he mentioned sulfite as a problem.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 He thought that he might have the sulfites might have killed off some good bacteria.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 And I do know from being friends with a winemaker that sulfites are a preservative and they are antimicrobial and they are like a bleaching product.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Yeah, I think they might also help to initiate allergies that would maybe be interactive with the microbes that are also being damaged by the sulfites.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 The sulfites are reductants and the stress state is an exaggeratedly reduced state and things that promote good oxidative metabolism can help the intestine greatly keeping your thyroid in good condition.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 And sulfites are anti thyroid too, right?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 Yeah.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 And the slightly antiseptic foods such as cooked mushrooms, bamboo shoots, raw carrots and saturated fats.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 These help to keep down the potentially toxic bacteria.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 And saturated fats are like coconut oil is antimicrobial.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Yeah, and just keeping the digestive system stimulated and very active so that you tend to digest the germs rather than being digested by them.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Yeah, so keeping your bowel movements frequent.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 And also just another thing, the one probiotic that I found quite useful for me personally was Dr. Ron's Ultra Pure probiotic.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 And that was one I didn't have adverse reactions to and I have had adverse reactions to a lot of the probiotics sold over the counter.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 So that one is over the counter too.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 You can find it online, Dr. Ron's probiotics.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And yeah, the man mentioned that he was feeling better digesting milk when he had been eating cheese and yogurt.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 And you do get a lot of natural probiotics from eating cultured dairy.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Okay, so we have another caller. So let's take this other caller before we move on to the politics.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 I'm a local, Garberville.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Okay.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 And I have the word that the gentleman previously was searching for.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Which is fascism?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 No, it's a term that is used by the United States State Department.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And it's called Americanism.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Americanism.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 Americanization.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 We're trying to Americanize Vietnam.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 We were going to Americanize other countries in South America.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 We were going to Americanize Middle East.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Americanization.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 That's what we do.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 We know what we're doing.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 When we're doing it's an empire thing.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 And we do it.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Thank you.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 I wonder if he was old enough to remember when we had the Un-American Activities Commission committee.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 I was born in 1957, and I believe that's around the time that was very active.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Yeah, in 1960.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 The '60s sort of began when students had a protest in Washington against HUAC, House Un-American Activities Committee.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 And they were really the most un-American part of society, trying to suppress all free thought.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Absolutely.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 And, well, we're all kind of like singing the song to the choir here, in a way.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 I know.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 You know, locally, our Northern California people are a little bit ahead of the curve of understanding these issues than the rest of the country.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 And thank you for the show, because I know a lot of people from all over the country are listening.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Thank you so much.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Yeah, thank you for your call.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Now, the West Coast is definitely, I'm very pleased, very proud to be an American on the West Coast in California, and where it all started.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 And I'm sure there's going to be many more good things to come out of it, as long as we don't let political correctness take us over,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 because I think that's becoming a really bad problem.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 That can also be talked about.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 We're on the air now.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Ask your doctor, KMED Garfield, 91.1 FM, from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 You can call in if you're on the web.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 You want a toll-free number, 800-568-3723, or for those of our listeners in the area, toll-free.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 The 707 number is 923-2513.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Okay, so --

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Or 3911, 923-3911.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Beg your pardon.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Okay, 3911.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 I have another little comment on the question of language and what you call it.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 I did my thesis on William Blake, and in the late 1700s, he was -- well, he was tried for sedition in 1804,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 but he was writing things that were potentially disturbing to the ruling class all through the late 1700s.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 And what he was doing was showing the way language was used to deceive the people,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 and he would reverse -- use heaven and hell in opposite senses

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 to show how radically the establishment was misusing language to impose its own ideas on the people.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And the current public relations psychology, people working for political control,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 it has developed all during the 20th century, but they're doing exactly the opposite.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 They're doing studies to find which words are most manipulative, which mislead the people most effectively.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 And the categories of right-wing, left-wing, conservative, and so on are being manipulated deliberately.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Okay, good.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 We do have another caller, so let's get this caller taken, and we'll see where we go with this next question.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Caller, where are you from?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Yes, hello?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Hi.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 I hear a lot about political correctness, and I'm not sure what that means.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 What is political correctness?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Okay, as the way I understand political correctness, it's basically not having your own thoughts,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 not saying what you feel for fear of upsetting somebody.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 It's basically the opposite of freedom of speech.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Political correctness is essentially a tyranny, and we can get into that too because in England--

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 Well, it's so vague.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 I mean, I can understand not saying racial slurs.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 That doesn't sound very socially correct.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 I don't know about politically, but what cannot be said politically?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 Well, it's about the ruling class that are ruling that nation or that state and their ideologies

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 and what does or doesn't agree with their political agenda on whether or not they're going to get voted back in next time by you or me.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 So whatever the political correctness is, it's usually what the political ideals are and not to go against them.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 That's very much a suppression of freedom of speech in my--

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Well, I know Donald Trump loves to talk about he can't stand political correctness,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 but he says horribly slanderous things.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 He says completely opposite things.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 He's always changing his mind.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Well, you know, as far as I remember, that's nothing actually stopping that from happening.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 America has a freedom of expression mandate in its First Amendment, so there isn't actually anything wrong with that.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 I think the only thing that the United States actually guards against--

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 You think there's nothing wrong with him lying?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Oh, lying.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 He's changing his mind all the time and insulting a huge amount of people?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 That's very much down to the person who thinks that they have the truth and the person who feels they're being insulted,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 but what is very much frowned upon or in fact prohibited is actually physically harming someone.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 You can take your placard into the Garboville town center, for example, and you can start protesting whatever you want.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 That's freedom of speech, and as long as you're not hurting anybody, you can say what you want to.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 I think in terms of--

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Well, Donald Trump is actually advocating beating people up.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 I heard him say it myself.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 I saw a lot of it on television.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 I saw a lot of the things that he said, and he said some pretty outrageous things and some very contradictory things.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 The media are amplifying the things he says and ignoring similar things that Hillary Clinton does.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 She's a big name-caller, except she is more politically correct in the way she does it,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 and she does it to promote the possibility of war and the expansion of the empire.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 I haven't heard her say anything that sounds like that.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Yeah, she is called Putin.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 I've heard--what?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 She's called Putin a Hitler.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 She said similar things about North Korea and China.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Well, Putin doesn't allow homosexuality in his country.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 I mean, that's pretty rigid.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 You know, that's pretty intense.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 But Trump, you know, he talks about, you know, not letting any Muslims in.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 He said until they're properly--

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 How about we don't let any white people in?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 What about white American terrorists that are white people?

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 The Muslim reference was to being vetted before they come here,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 like anybody entering the United States should be going through a regular due process.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 You sound like you like Donald Trump.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 Say again?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 You sound like you like Donald Trump.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Yeah, I do like some of his policies, actually.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 I think from a free-thinking perspective of being in business

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 and generating income for the least amount of money,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 I think he could do great things for this country in terms of saving us money.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 Well, first of all, he says that he's going to bring back all the jobs from overseas

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 and make all these companies bring their jobs back to America.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Doesn't that sound good?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 And yet he himself has companies in China.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 So isn't that a bit hypocritical?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Maybe his will be the first to come back to the U.S.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 How can he demand that other people bring their--

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 I know. We can't digress too far here.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 Well, I'm just saying that the bottom line for a businessman is making a buck,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 and I don't think that he's going to bring back all his jobs from China

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 so that he can pay people enormously larger wages

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 and make a lot less money for his pocketbook.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Well, we're actually talking about the discussion here

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 in the world of politics of authoritarianism versus the Constitution

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 and especially the First Amendment, the freedom of speech and freedom of expression, etc.,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 freedom to congregate and have free speech.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 That's what we're doing now. We're having free speech.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Well, I think that he has the right to say whatever he wants,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 but I'm saying what he does say is very contradictory, very inflammatory.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 Well, they all do.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 In a free market, like anything else, in a free market,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 if you and I think the product's a good product, we're going to support it with our dollars.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 And so if he does get in, there will be more people supporting him

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 for what he is portraying than whoever is the other opposition.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 So it's a free society where we have this free expression,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 and we can say what we want, just like you're saying about Trump having business overseas,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 and that's actually a hypocritical statement.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 I can't validate what you're saying because I don't see the evidence in front of me,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 but I guess we can all take a look.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 But it's basically the free speech that allows all of the voices to be heard,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 and then everybody can make a joint agreement.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Because we do have freedom, you know, businessmen have freedom to go overseas

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 and have other people make their products much more cheaper than other countries.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 I think a lot of it actually is that these businesses have been forced out of the--

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 He cannot demand that they come back.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Most of these businesses have been forced out of the United States

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 by the current political strategies, basically.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 If you look at the real reason why all these corporations are moving overseas,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 it's because the climate in this country has been made so bad for them

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 because there's so many inside deals going on that are making money for these corporations.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 That is the real problem.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 It's not that they won't pay them enough or they think it's just better.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 I think if you look at the real facts of it--

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Well, I think they feel it's better if you can pay somebody $0.35 a day than $100 a day.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Well, you don't have to pay somebody $100.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 That's a kind of exaggeration, and paying someone $0.30 in a sweatshop in China is definitely not moral.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 I totally agree with that.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 I think what's more appropriate is that Americans here have work.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 They feel good about themselves contributing to the economy,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 contributing to their society, being an asset to their country,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 being in the asset column of America is what it should be all about,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 and however jobs are brought back here to give people dignity and to give people something to do--

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 But that's a fantasy. There's no way to actually do that.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 No, I don't think it's a fantasy at all.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 I think that's what we've been sold out, and I think that's what our politicians have sold us out on,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 and that's why the jobs have gone to China.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 But even the jobs that we have here, they won't even let minimum wage be a living wage.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Yeah.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 And that goes on right here in our country, not someplace in Malaysia or China.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 Things are worse for poor people here than they've ever been.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Yeah, and they've gotten worse in the last couple--

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 They've gotten worse, yeah, in the last 50 years.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Because of the big companies and billionaires and business people and corporations,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 corporations don't pay any taxes.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Even Donald Trump says he'd rather pay his little taxes to the poor.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Yeah, well, we're not opposed to that.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 That's not what we're saying, but I think the scope of what you're talking about

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 is probably going to take us too far down the road and not allow other callers in.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Well, I'll let other callers speak at this.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 Okay. All right.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 Some of those points were sounding like support for Bernie Sanders,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 which I think his domestic policies are very traditional

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 and actually conservative in one sense of the concept,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 conserving the standard of living, quality of life of working people, and so on.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 Okay. I think we have one or two more callers on the air.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Yeah, let's take this next caller.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Okay, hi. What's your question?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 I have a couple of health-related questions for Dr. Peat

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 because I've been experiencing really incredible results with my thyroid medication.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Okay, good.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Quick background, I'm a client of Dr. Murray's. Hi, Dr. Murray.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 Hi.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 He prescribed thyroid medication to me recently, so I've been on it for one week so far.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 My two questions are regarding some incredible results that I've experienced over this past week.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 The first one is specifically about my lips.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 I've noticed my lips are getting bigger.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 Shockingly, my skin cells on my upper lip, they're turning into lip skin cells,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 is the easiest way to put it.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 The color in these areas are turning pink,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 and the pores in these areas are shrinking to where you can't even see them,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 and it looks like smooth lips.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 The color hasn't fully gotten in there all the way, but I can tell that the skin is completely changing.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 So my question is, Dr. Peat, how is that physiologically happening?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 I'm just blown away.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 The circulation increases as the metabolic rate is increased under the influence of thyroid.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Cells start producing carbon dioxide, which opens up blood vessels,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 and it also accelerates all of the normalizing processes,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 creating replacement cells, for example, rather than scar tissue.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 With aging, there's a tendency to fill in with fibrotic,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 simply useless scar-like connective tissue in between where replacement stem cells haven't been able to develop,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 and a good supply of energy and oxygen can renew tissues.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 My own experience when I was experimenting with, among other things, DHEA and progesterone,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 but also thyroid, I found that in my 40s, I grew more than an inch while losing some belly fat,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 staying the same weight, but my muscles developed as the fat disappeared,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 and even at that age, my bones were elongating.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 So the repair and regeneration and anti-aging effects of thyroid used to be talked about in the 1920s and '30s,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 since the pharmaceutical industry started suppressing the idea of treating hypothyroidism with thyroid supplements.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 Since then, attention has been strongly directed away from those restorative effects of thyroid.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Wow, that is so neat. And my last question is, I've noticed that the very noticeable green veins in my legs,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 lower legs and upper legs, it's embarrassing that you can see them.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 I'm in my late 20s, but they're becoming less apparent as if they're going deeper into my legs,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 and so I'm wondering what is physiologically happening to you that's causing that?

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Many things, but high estrogen tends to be, both high cortisol and high estrogen make up for the metabolic deficiency in hypothyroidism.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 And there are several skin, blood vessel things that you see with high estrogen, high cortisol,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 little red dots of broken capillaries or just nests of overdeveloped capillaries and small arterioles

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 producing red spots of different sizes and shapes.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 And sometimes the big blueish things called vascular spiders,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 and then varicose veins that are very low energy state.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 Estrogen tends to weaken the basic muscle tone in the veins,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 and progesterone and thyroid restore the muscle tone so that the valves are on the walls of the big veins.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 And if the vein relaxes, the valves don't work as valves because the flaps can't reach each other.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 And so if you just contract the veins under the influence of progesterone and thyroid,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 the valve will begin working and restore the function of the vein.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Then the tissues are better oxygenated, so the hormones, vascular endothelial growth factor,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 for example, VEGF, is produced under the influence of high estrogen

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 and stress and inflammatory mediators and tends to be very much lower under the influence of thyroid.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 So you don't need those extra abnormal blood vessels when your thyroid is functioning well.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 But when you are taking a certain dose of thyroid, the thyroxine accumulates in your tissues with a half-life of two weeks.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 So you have to watch. People will usually feel great as they increase their dose at some point in the first week or two.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 But if you're taking more than you need, you'll reach a point where you find that you're taking more than enough.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 You'll get out of breath and your heart will pound or something.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 But then when it accumulates and levels off, then your body goes through further adjustments.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 So you have to keep watching over a period of a few months.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 And then you have to watch for seasonal effects because you don't need as much thyroid in the summer as you do in the winter.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 Wow, that's interesting. That makes sense. Dr. Murray just recently asked me to submit more readings, so I just did that.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 Thank you so much, Dr. Peat. I just want you to know you've absolutely changed my life and you're my hero.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 It's incredible what I'm experiencing.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Thank you for being brave enough to share your research and what you've found with the world.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Okay, I think we have another caller on the air. Let's see this next caller.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 Caller, where are you from? Okay, do we have that caller on the air?

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 Yeah, caller, you're on the air. Go ahead.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 Maybe not. Okay.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 No. Okay. Well, the number if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 This is a 707 area code. If you're outside the area, you want an 800 number, 800-568-3723.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is joining us.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 We're obviously taking questions about alternative medicine, but also opened up the forum here for a sort of pseudo-political debate based on authoritarianism.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to just go back to what it was you had mentioned off the cuff here about Mussolini.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 And that I was looking today and I haven't spoken to you all day and I definitely haven't arranged this.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 But in 1933, when Hitler was chancellor of Germany, I saw that he was actually, if you type in fascism, I think you come up with two names that come up more than anything else with Mussolini and Hitler.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 And ultimately Hitler in, I think it was February, February 28th, 1933, whether it was done by the fascists or whether it was done by the communists,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 they stated it was a communist, a communist crime that the Reichstag building, which was basically the houses of parliament type comparable in Germany, was burnt down.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 Well, the very next day, this edict was announced that basically prevented any political uprising.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 It was ultimately exactly the same thing that's been bandied about here in America. If we get any big terrorist attack that the president will announce a state of emergency, a suspension of the constitution and basically be able to do anything he wants, which is pretty scary no matter who it is.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 I'm not really taking sides here. There's things I like about Trump. There's things I don't like about Trump.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 There's things I definitely don't like about Hillary and there's things I don't like about the Bushes. And if it's for me, I'm a libertarian more than anything.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 But getting back to suspending the constitution and what happened in Germany in 1933, that ultimately gave Hitler the power to come, well, the death of course of Heidelberg, who was the VP then or the president at that point in time.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 His death ultimately allowed Hitler to succeed and led through various – within that year, 1933, Jews were basically persecuted, book burning was going on, the rise of Nazism was just going rampant because they suppressed the ability of anybody else to argue against it.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 And that was the most important thing that caught my attention was that freedom of speech is very, very important and that's why our First Amendment is so, so important to us and we have to protect it with our lives if necessary because founding fathers weren't stupid people.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 They'd escaped the country that I was born in. I've seen going down the toilet in the last 15 years since I've been here.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 And things that are happening in England now you would not believe and I'm not anti – I'm not racist. I think freedom of religion is just fine.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 But I think when you come to America, you're supposed to integrate with America.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 When I came here, I take on American – I drive on the side of the road the Americans drive on. I kind of follow the laws of the land and obey what's the law of the land, what everybody else does.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 And so fitting in is the most important thing and it's great.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 People from all over the world want to come to America and come here because of the values and the history and everything else and they feel like they have a chance to succeed.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 So you do that and you come here and you assimilate. But basically in '33 when Hitler took over, the freedom of expression was completely expunged and you were not allowed to argue it and that from '33 to '39 led to the Second World War with the invasion of Poland.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 So talking about fascism, it's basically the former government in which the country is considered more important than anyone or any one person.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:56.000
 And so that very much brings its – leading to totalitarianism and authoritarianism which doesn't allow you or I the freedom of expression to argue against it.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 So Dr. Peat, do you have anything else to say about fascism? I know we've got lots of other different political terms like socialism, like liberalism, conservatism.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 They all have different ideals and tenets. But in terms of fascism for what it is as an authoritarian dictatorial type stance, definitely not what we want to be under.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 You were mentioning the import of the German scientists after the war, Project Paperclip.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 A similar thing happened with the failure of the Hungarian uprising in 1956. These physicists who were imported had a very great inclination towards Nazism and fascism.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 Because John Foster and Alan Dulles were working closely with Prescott Bush, the father of George Herbert Walker Bush, in supporting Hitler in the 1920s and '30s.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 And the Dulles' not only wanted to bring in all of the scientists who they needed, for example, for their rocket science and weapons development and such.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 But they imported or continued their support for the role that Hitler had played in the world.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 A recent book by an Australian history professor has followed the role of the Dulles brothers in world history.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 The effects continue right down to the present, but this recent book shows how the Dulles' and European fascist involvement in Indonesia was a very important factor in Kennedy's assassination.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 Because Kennedy was within just a few weeks of changing policy in Indonesia, which would have ruined some of the investments that the Dulles' were involved in.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 And George Damoran Schilt, I think his name was, the guy who was closely connected to Lee Harvey Oswald, was one of Dulles' associates way back in the 1940s period.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Okay, well we've just got another caller that's just come in, so let's take this next caller call away from, and what's your question?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 I'm local, and my question, I really wanted to just add a fragment of information.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 During the late 40s, when the doctor was talking about them importing through various means German scientists,

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 we got the Galen Group, which was upper echelon SS, created false identities for them, and that was the work of Wild Bill Donovan, who was the director of the Secret Service.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 But at that same time, '46-'47, they also created the CIA. They were fascinated by the incredibly cold and calculated methodology of the genocide that they were creating.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 And the development of the weapons and things, they didn't understand and wanted that information to be able to create, you know, of course, the intelligence, if you want to call it that, forces that we have out there today.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 So they created false identities, and we got people that created the gas chamber, and these people were considered assets.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 So it's just an ongoing thing.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 Okay, well listen, I appreciate your call, but we have only five minutes, so let me just wrap up here with Dr. Peat, and thank everyone that's called in.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 Dr. Peat, thank you so much for your time. I do appreciate you joining us.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 Was there anything else you wanted to add to the show, Dr. Peat, before we finish, because it's five minutes, so we do have a little bit of time.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 The doctrine of eugenics actually went from the United States and England to Germany, and Hitler put it into practice, but it never left American biology.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 The Institute for Social...

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 He was used to implement it, basically, for the Americans.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 Yeah, the Americans have continued citing the work which was done scientifically to justify killing Jews and Slavs and black people, and anyone that Hitler considered politically inappropriate.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 These pseudo-scientific studies were essentially designed by Conrad Lorenz, who got a Nobel Prize, and our American geneticists have sort of worshipped these ideas of genetic determinism, including determinism even of political belief.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 Okay, well, let's leave it with that.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 Wow, that's all I can say is wow.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Okay, well, thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 Okay, thanks.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 Okay, so for those people who have tuned in, Dr. Raymond Peat, rayPeat.com, his website is full of articles that are all about pretty much physiological health articles.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 He's not a particularly political person, but I know he's got a background in academia that has certainly seen him come up against some professors who were very dogmatic in their belief and not able to see new ideas, just called too radical.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 But we're seeing all of that come to pass now, and 30, 40 years later, we're seeing the main importance here of saturated fats, as Dr. Peat's gone on for a long time about.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 We're seeing the importance of sugar.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 We're seeing the necessity of salt.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 All of these things have been previously plagued and dogmatized and even banned in some places, but I see these things coming around.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 Yeah, recently at a coffee shop, I was told that I might be charged extra if I wanted to put that many packets of sugar in my cup of coffee.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 So it is coming, folks.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 Beware, you will be charged extra for sugar.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 For those of you who are still listening, the main point of all of this, I think, is that I really wanted just to bring out this part of our constitution here, okay, that really encapsulates all of it.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 And, you know, we're all very flawed human beings.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 You know, we have emotions.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 Some people lose their temper easily.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 Some people are very calm.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Some people are honest.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 Some are dishonest, et cetera.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 You know, we're a mixed bag of cricks.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 But the part of the constitution that resonates with me most is the concept here of this self-evident truth, you know, that Martin Luther King talked about in his famous speech, Liberation, before he was assassinated.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 The part of the constitution that mentions that all men are created equal, that they're endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 So we live in a constitution, and the main thing is we've got to be fair.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 We've got to be, you know, we've got to be open to ideas, discussions.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 We have to talk about it.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 We don't want authoritarianism.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 It's good to have free speech.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 Don't let your First Amendment rights get suppressed.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 Don't let the government get tyrannical.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 This is a free speech radio station.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 And so thank you for this station.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 And thank you for those listening.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 Thank you for listening.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 Good night.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Good night.
