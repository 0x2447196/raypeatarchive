00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 and T5.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 And it might be a wonderful world for you if you listen to our guest, Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200
 Aloha, Dr. Peat.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
 How are you today?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hello.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 Very good.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 Good.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.040
 We're so thrilled to have you on our show.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.920
 All week long, Karen and I have been telling people in our store that you're going to be

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.040
 our guest, and everybody loves your books.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.640
 But I was kind of interested in your background, Dr. Peat.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.160
 I understand you started working with hormones and progesterone all the way back in 1968.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.880
 I'm kind of curious, what caused you to get into this field?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.560
 I had been teaching linguistics and painting, alternately, but I had been interested in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.920
 science from childhood.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:57.480
 I saw medical, so-called science, going off in very perverse directions through the 1950s.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:09.560
 And so I didn't think of going to the university graduate school in biology, because my dad's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:19.920
 experience in high school biology, very, very retarded textbooks and so on, made me think

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.080
 that there wasn't much science in the biological field.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.280
 But finally, I decided that I needed to use laboratory instruments that were too expensive

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 to get myself.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.000
 So I enrolled in graduate school and figured that just by not arguing with the teachers,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.120
 I could get through the program and get to use the labs, which I did.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.040
 Now, your insight always amazes me, because I'm one of those gullible believers.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.440
 When I'm told that I, for instance, should take estrogen because I'm aging, I believed.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.320
 In fact, I was writing a dissertation on the positive benefits of estrogen until I met

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.800
 you, and it blew all that stuff right out of the water.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.160
 And I look back at how gullible I was and how easily people are misled into believing

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.840
 what the pharmaceutical industries want them to believe.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 And so-

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 Advertising is very powerful.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:34.960
 A group of 13 estrogen companies got together in 1942 when it was already known that estrogen

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.120
 caused miscarriages, sterility, cancer, seizures, and so on.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.720
 But they had the product, and they wanted to sell it as the female hormone, even though

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.320
 it's also a male hormone.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.960
 But they got together, and with advertising and political pressure, they convinced the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.280
 FDA to approve the use of estrogen to prevent miscarriages, which it caused, actually.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:15.800
 And by advertising, they got the public interested in estrogen as an anti-aging hormone.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.160
 So it started really with a definite conspiracy of 13 companies in 1942.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.120
 And it's continued to this day, even with well-meaning individuals like Suzanne Somers,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.360
 who advocates the use of bioidentical hormones.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.640
 She always throws large amounts of estrogen into the equation, including the estriol.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.640
 So would you mind talking about that?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:49.920
 Yeah, the body has many protective systems for inactivating estrogen, the strong estrogen,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.520
 estradiol.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:04:02.960
 And so it has enzymes to oxidize in different ways this fairly reduced form of estrogen.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:13.200
 By oxidizing it to estriol or estrone, it reduces the estrogen-like activity.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.640
 It also has several other systems for destroying estrogen efficiently.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.440
 If your metabolism is working very well, estrogen should be totally eliminated after about 12

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.280
 hours, following ovulation and implantation.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.280
 And it should be disposed of thoroughly within a few days of ovulation.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.960
 I was going to say, Dr. Peat, I'm even amazed when we're talking about estrogen that, having

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.960
 worked in the natural foods industry now for 42 years, when I read my trade magazines,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.920
 I'm still seeing advertisements for estrogen-based products in all the natural food trade magazines.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.400
 It's still not only in the pharmaceutical industry, it's in the natural foods industry.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.400
 And I like it that you and Karen can straighten people out.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.120
 But it's not that estrogen is bad, right?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.280
 It's that it needs to be in a certain ratio.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:19.880
 I've been thinking of how common estrogen is throughout the universe.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:28.440
 Anytime an organism is injured, it produces estrogen, which stimulates growth and repair.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:37.000
 But an even more common biological material is ATP, the so-called energy molecule.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.120
 And anytime we're injured, or even when a cell is slightly stressed, it loses some of

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.880
 its ATP, which acts as a signal to other cells to repair the damage.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:05.360
 But when a lizard is attacked and drops its tail, it's probably a surge of ATP that cuts

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.360
 the tail off.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:18.280
 And ATP forms to make a blister, dissolving the tissue between the layers of skin so that

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.280
 fluid flows in.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:29.840
 ATP, our most life-supporting basic molecule, has these potentially deadly destructive effects,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.640
 cutting off dissolving tissue so that repair can take place.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.400
 Estrogen is just supposed to be biologically active.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.000
 It is an excitant at an early stage of injury.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.480
 Like it slightly inflames the uterus to cause the growth of cells, preparing a place for

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.840
 the embryo to implant.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:07.080
 But if the estrogen stays present too long, it kills the embryo by overexciting the surrounding

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.080
 cells.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:19.400
 In the 1950s, my thesis advisor, Soderwal, was demonstrating that by giving an estrogen

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:28.240
 supplement to a pregnant animal, the day that it becomes pregnant, you can prevent implantation

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.680
 by a small amount, such as is used in birth control pills.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.920
 And that's how they work, by a quick abortion, actually, rather than preventing conception,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.720
 they're preventing implantation.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:50.040
 And he found that on second, third, fourth days and so on, following implantation, if

00:07:50.040 --> 00:08:00.120
 you gave just slightly larger amounts of estrogen all the way up until delivery, staying on

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:08.600
 the same slope of increasing doses of estrogen, you could kill the embryo or the fetus just

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:17.640
 by adjusting the dose of estrogen to counteract the increasing progesterone, which is there

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.280
 to maintain pregnancy.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:27.760
 So at any stage, estrogen produces abortion when it is out of balance with progesterone.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.200
 And so if a woman is pregnant and the progesterone levels don't increase...

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:39.880
 Yeah, when a woman is either having a sluggish liver, low thyroid, so that her estrogen is

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:47.720
 chronically too high or her progesterone is chronically low, she will often bleed every

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:54.200
 month, several months into the pregnancy as if she were menstruating on cycle.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:01.520
 And during any of those cyclic surges of estrogen, that's when miscarriages are most likely to

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.520
 happen.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:08.120
 And then how would this affect the sexual persuasion of the child who, should that pregnancy

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.160
 make it all the way to the end, how would that affect the child being bathed in a more

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.440
 highly estrogenic environment?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:29.680
 It damages the sexual differentiation, but there is some research that stress prematally

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.560
 causes an intersexual differentiation.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.520
 And what does that mean exactly?

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.760
 Not definitely either one.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.920
 And how would that show up with sexual organs?

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.360
 Does that mean you would have like hermaphroditism?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:55.960
 Well, no, the main thing is that the male has smaller genitals and the distance between

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.800
 the genitals and the anus is decreased in proportion to the estrogen.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.920
 And would that affect a more transgender society?

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:17.520
 Yeah, they're seeing the distance that characterizes the estrogen exposure of male genitals decreasing

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.640
 in recent decades in polluted countries.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.520
 And so would you say that oftentimes when people say, "Hey, I was born this way," as

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.680
 in men who are gay, women who are lesbian, truly are born this way due to this?

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.440
 Sure, I think that's a big part of it.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:52.720
 You can see it in crocodiles and alligators and ocean otters and fish, frogs.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.720
 Everyone is affected by the estrogen pollution.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:01.080
 And it's amazing to me that you pointed out some things that no one like myself would

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:06.800
 ever even consider in their wildest imaginations would have an estrogenic effect, such as x-rays

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.120
 and radiation.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.200
 So being that, I'd like your feeling on the Fukushima radiation, whether you think that's

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.080
 gone away and is harmless or are those...

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.920
 Did you read about the mad cow, a dairy cow that turned out to be infected with so-called

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:29.840
 spongiform encephalopathy?

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.240
 I did, and I was curious what your take on that would be.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:42.720
 I suspect that it's exposure to the Japanese radiation of the animals in California, because

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:51.840
 the breakout of mad cow disease in England was in the area where Chernobyl radiation

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.560
 rained down on the pastures, and it followed in the years immediately following Chernobyl

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560
 exposure.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:07.360
 And who came up with the lies about the sheep awful and that stuff causing...

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:18.440
 The Pentagon was doing that in the 1940s following the atomic bomb, 1950s with the hydrogen bomb.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:31.080
 When the fallout from the hydrogen bomb drifted across the island, they sent Carlton Gajdicek,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.640
 I think his name was.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:46.200
 He was a pediatrician, but he was posing as a virologist, but he was sent by the military

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:52.760
 to an area that had been exposed to hydrogen bomb fallout to study what supposedly was

00:12:52.760 --> 00:13:03.960
 a traditional brain disease, Kuru, that he claimed had been passed on for generations

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:13.600
 by cannibalism, but actually it was never reported before the hydrogen bomb fallout.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:23.680
 And he was, in a miraculously short time, he identified what he claimed was a new slow

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.960
 virus and got the Nobel Prize for discovering a virus that probably doesn't exist.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.440
 But the whole thing was a military cover-up, basically.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.400
 He was not a virologist, didn't know anything about it, didn't do the kind of research that

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:50.560
 could have identified it, and the same symptoms can be produced by radiation.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.840
 So is there anything we can do to protect ourselves from this radiation, from Fukushima,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.840
 from x-rays?

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.560
 Because every time I go to the dentist, he insists that I must have an x-ray, which he

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.400
 of course says is like sitting in the sun, and now they have these new Panoramics.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.760
 You have all this bologna, and it's very difficult to talk them out of doing these x-rays, but

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.680
 you point out that they're estrogenic.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.520
 So is there anything that we can do to offset any damage from the x-rays?

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.920
 Yeah, two or three papers were published.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:34.360
 I discussed them in my radiation newsletter January of a year ago.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:45.120
 They showed that estrogen was synergistic with radiation in causing cancer, and that

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:52.280
 the same way that progesterone blocks cancer produced by estrogen, it also blocks cancer

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.200
 produced by radiation.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.120
 And so if someone knew that they had a history of a lot of diagnostic x-rays, one of the

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.880
 ways they could possibly prevent some long-term effects is to start using progesterone on

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.560
 a regular basis?

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:14.120
 Yeah, I think on the long term, that is protective.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:23.320
 They know that when they do the so-called gamma knife brain treatment, that the symptoms

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:32.920
 of nerve cell degeneration aren't seen for usually more than 18 months, sometimes several

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.600
 years later.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.600
 The cells stay in an inflamed condition.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:50.840
 Like they've seen blood serum 20 years after the Chernobyl, 50 years after the Japanese

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.080
 bomb exposures.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:59.920
 They've seen a chronically inflamed condition that shows up even in the blood serum decades

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.920
 after exposure.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:09.000
 And so I think that's the sort of thing that can be reversed even at a late date so that

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.120
 the chronic inflammatory state doesn't persist.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.120
 I hope that's true because I was a military kid who had a lot of diagnostic x-rays, which

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.400
 scares me when I think about them.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.200
 So what do you think about...

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:28.520
 Vitamin A works with progesterone as another protective thing, but it also happens to sensitize

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.920
 you to the radiation that the radiation breaks down the vitamin A in your tissue.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:44.080
 And so if you replace it after the injury, that helps counteract the estrogen-like effects.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:51.160
 And what would be a good dose of vitamin A on average for a 50-year-old adult woman?

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:59.760
 It's hard to say because being an unsaturated oily material, it can interfere with thyroid

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.760
 function.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:08.120
 So the amount you need corresponds exactly to the level of thyroid activity you have.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:16.400
 And a low thyroid person can get symptoms of vitamin A poisoning from just a very small

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:26.320
 amount like 5,000 units, where when I was in my teens and 20s, I found that I needed

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:35.760
 50 to 100,000 units to prevent having acne or even leukoplakia.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:43.040
 Following dental x-rays, I would get these white, spongy growths inside my cheeks that

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:50.520
 dentists said were either cancerous or precancerous, and I found that these big doses of vitamin

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.360
 A would clear it up completely in a week.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:02.480
 And that's a precancerous estrogen-stimulated condition that also appears on the cervix

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.480
 of the uterus.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:10.360
 And vitamin A and progesterone similarly will reverse that.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.800
 And so were you taking thyroid at the time also?

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:20.480
 No, I just happened to be a hyperthyroid person during that period.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.920
 And you mentioned that hyper and hypo are actually kind of the same thing.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:35.880
 No, doctors confuse hypothyroidism with hyper for various historical reasons.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:45.440
 But the basic thing that thyroid does is increase your oxidative metabolism.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:55.200
 And when the Synthroid product came on the market, only thyroxine rather than the complete

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:02.400
 combination of T3 and T4, when that came on the market, they wanted to say that thyroxine

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:09.840
 was the real thyroid hormone, and it happens that it doesn't stimulate oxidative metabolism

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.760
 until it's turned into T3.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:22.680
 And so for about 20 years, there was the doctrine that thyroid doesn't stimulate oxidative metabolism

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.080
 as its basic mechanism.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:37.160
 But in fact, the thyroxine interferes with the oxygen metabolism if it's out of balance.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:46.680
 And it's really the increased consumption of oxygen and production of defensive energy

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.280
 systems that makes thyroid valuable.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:59.560
 And for example, the oxidative energy is used to convert cholesterol into pregnenolone and

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:09.800
 progesterone, DHEA, male hormones, and so on, to counteract estrogen as part of the

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.080
 defense against estrogen.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.840
 And so if you have excess cholesterol, it's usually because your thyroid is deficient

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:26.400
 or your vitamin A is deficient, and you aren't converting it to the protective progesterone,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400
 testosterone hormones.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.800
 Well, if you're just tuning in, you're listening to the Source Nutritional Radio Show with

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.680
 our very special guest today, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.400
 And Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you, we have Dr. Lita Lee on our radio show probably about

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.600
 four times a year because she's one of our most interesting guests.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:51.440
 And I love the expression that she first coined and what is considered a pro-thyroid diet.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.400
 And she said you eat organic.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.440
 Do you agree with that, or could you elaborate on that?

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:04.240
 Well, lately everyone's been calling their stuff organic.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:10.800
 I was getting a kind of organic whipping cream for my coffee, and I saw they were putting

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.600
 carrageenan in it.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:23.160
 And when they can say that carrageenan is an organic food just because you get it out

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:32.120
 of the ocean, the ocean isn't such a great clean food source anymore.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.440
 And carrageenan is highly allergenic.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:44.840
 People have died by contact with it, and many people have very serious allergic reactions

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.560
 to it when they eat it.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.280
 And when it breaks down, it becomes carcinogenic.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:57.840
 But it's still allowed not only in the food supply, but it can be called organic.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:10.440
 And some of the nuclear industry factions were applying to the government to be able

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:17.440
 to call nuclear waste, fertilized food, organic.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.400
 Well, I have to say I do work as an organic farm inspector, and I remember when the USDA

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:29.120
 was coming up with the standards for organic, they were going to allow human sewage sludge

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.440
 to be used as a fertilizer, irradiated food to be labeled organic, and GMO food being

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440
 labeled organic.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.600
 And people like Karen and I petitioned the USDA, and I was very surprised because the

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.120
 federal government, the USDA, listened to our complaints, saying they would take away

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.880
 the integrity of the organic industry if they allow those three things to be labeled organic.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.360
 So I know it's a complicated world.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:23:00.560
 It's not always very black and white, but we have to work with some kind of a standard.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:08.920
 Yeah, carotene is the main problem with some of the foods called organic, but naturally

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.680
 it's best if you can get really clean organic foods.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.920
 Well, today you'd probably have to grow it yourself.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.760
 Dr. Bink, you mentioned pregnenolone.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.680
 That's one of my favorite supplements since you introduced us to it, and I wonder if you

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:30.360
 could elaborate a little bit on the benefit of pregnenolone and some of the scare tactics

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.520
 that are used, put on the labels saying this causes cancer.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:44.840
 Yeah, that stuff just seems to come out of thin air, the way when some of the drug companies

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.840
 in the '40s wanted to get natural progesterone off the market.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.640
 They said you can't take it orally because it's destroyed by the stomach acid.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.120
 But there was absolutely no source for that.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:05.800
 It was just inserted into an article and then multiplied until all the doctors in the country

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.320
 believed it.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:15.160
 And California, for reasons that I explain in one of the articles on my website about

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:25.040
 conflicts of interest, California decided to call progesterone a cause of cancer, even

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:35.320
 though the articles they cited to support that position, some of them were very strong

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.360
 arguments showing that it prevents cancer.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:45.160
 And their scientific support was really crazy.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:53.400
 But the fact that California got progesterone on their list of cancer agents, that seems

00:24:53.400 --> 00:25:00.360
 to have simply spread over to pregnenolone without any argument at all.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:06.960
 And so why do these companies acquiesce and put that warning on their label?

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:17.080
 Because California gave lawyers a law that lets them collect money for suing anyone that

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.400
 they want to.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:26.280
 There have been articles published calling it the "shakedown state" because lawyers were

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:33.880
 accusing people for having asphalt in their parking lot because asphalt is carcinogenic

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.880
 and so on.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.880
 Oh my goodness.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.600
 So what is your take on pregnenolone?

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.360
 What benefit will that have for people with dementia, for instance?

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:54.120
 If the pregnenolone is well made and pure, and in recent years everything on the market

00:25:54.120 --> 00:26:04.080
 does seem to be pure if the retailer isn't adding a lot of crazy excipients, but pure

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:14.400
 pregnenolone has, since the 1940s with experiments in rats, it's been known to have essentially

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.440
 no side effects at any dose.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:24.600
 They gave rats a 10-gram single dose by stomach tube, which would be like a person eating

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:33.240
 a pound of it, and the only effect was that the rats weren't hungry until their stomachs

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.840
 had emptied the stuff out.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:43.480
 And if any of the rats were under stress at the time of the experiment, their stress hormones

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.440
 went down to normal.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:51.680
 That was the only side effect that stopped abnormal stress reactions.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.200
 So we could presume that that would happen to people too, that it would bring stress

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.200
 hormones down?

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.620
 Is it what?

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.120
 Would it bring stress hormones down in people too?

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.120
 Oh yeah.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:11.080
 I just, after I read the rat experiment and saw that it had made people more efficient

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:20.120
 in studies of workers using it, I decided to take 3,000 milligrams to 4,000 milligrams

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:30.400
 every day for a year, and I felt like I had great resistance, felt no stress, no matter

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.640
 what was happening.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.920
 And were there any negative side effects at all?

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.560
 Not at all.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.520
 And do you take that much to this day?

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.040
 No, it was too expensive.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.120
 I haven't taken any for years now.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:54.600
 I stopped because for a while a lot of junk was on the market, and when I tried to import

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.840
 the pure stuff, the FDA kept getting in the way.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.840
 Wow.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.400
 Well, Dr. Peata, I know you lecture around the United States and in Mexico to many different

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.240
 universities, including the Natural College of Naturopathic Medicine, and I have a little

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.960
 curious, what kind of reaction do you get?

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.800
 Because you say a lot of things, and I have to say I agree with what you say, but you

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.200
 do say a lot of things that nobody else is saying.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:31.240
 Oh, I pretty much stopped lecturing about 20 years ago when the word got out, what I

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.720
 was saying about unsaturated fats.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:42.600
 The doctors stopped wanting to hear me when they knew what I would say about estrogen,

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:48.880
 and then the health food industry stopped wanting to hear me when they knew what I would

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:58.560
 say about corn oil and soy oil and the polyunsaturated oils, fish oil and so on, because those are

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:06.880
 so important to their business that they didn't want bad information put out about them.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.120
 And so what is it that you say about that that would be problematic for them?

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:26.000
 I see the polyunsaturated N-3 and N-6 oils as being behind all the inflammatory degenerative

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.120
 diseases, and basically all of the degenerative diseases involve an inflammatory component

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:43.720
 which is amplified by the N-3 and N-6 breakdown products.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.320
 And you think the cumulative value of those oils in the human body as they get packed

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.960
 away in the tissue have a metabolic suppressive action?

00:29:50.960 --> 00:30:00.360
 Yeah, the prostaglandins and various isoprostanes and free radical breakdown products and so

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.320
 on.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:14.400
 And those fats happen to inhibit the enzymes which make our natural N-9 polyunsaturated

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.080
 fats such as the mead acid.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:26.360
 And it's called an essential fatty acid deficiency when you can find the mead acid

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.640
 at minus 9 in the blood.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:43.920
 But it happens that that's a protective anti-inflammatory fat that gives great resistance to the animals

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:50.000
 that are so-called deficient in the essential fatty acids.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.160
 And so in other words it would be beneficial to us to avoid those polyunsaturated oils

00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:01.480
 such as corn, canola, safflower, sunflower, almond, all those oils we should avoid?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:10.040
 Yeah, I try to avoid those as far as possible, even avoiding pork and chicken that have been

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:11.040
 fed those foods.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.960
 Oh, it gets very complex.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.480
 Well I know in your free time Dr. Peat you're a terrific artist, you paint a lot don't

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480
 you?

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:28.400
 Yeah, I try to alternate studying and writing with painting or sculpting.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:29.400
 That's wonderful.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:36.920
 Can I ask you again about the Fukushima radiation because I vacillate, people come in and tell

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.600
 me oh you've got to be positive and stop dwelling on the negative and then by the same

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:46.680
 token because we're in Hawaii and kind of in the pathway of where that stuff is coming

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:53.440
 and has come, how do you not think about it in terms of people's health?

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.280
 We noticed within a week of the Fukushima radiation that our air purifier started making

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:05.360
 a pinging noise rather like an electrical fly trap and couldn't figure out what is this

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.040
 noise that this thing is making, is it defective?

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.520
 And then I think about after what, about a week and a half it stopped doing that, but

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.840
 could that have been from hot particles of radiation shortly after the fallout?

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:26.520
 I don't know how the purifier works but the particles do produce ionization that could

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.920
 affect electronic devices.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:41.640
 The nuclear industry like the estrogen industry and the oil industry has been very busy with

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:53.800
 propaganda ever since the 1940s convincing the public that nuclear power will be good

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.320
 for the public in many ways.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:06.360
 They've been selling radioactive potions since the 1920s.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:13.520
 People are still selling radioactive rocks as cures.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:21.600
 They used to sell it in bottles to cure impotence and arthritis and so on.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:29.960
 And you can get some quick relief from x-raying your knee, for example, for arthritis.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:38.120
 It kills the cells that produce inflammation but it creates a long-term systemic inflammation

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:44.240
 that is much worse for the short-term relief.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:51.400
 And that's the sort of thing that happens with the breakdown of fish oils.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:59.200
 You get short-term suppression of inflammation but long-term promotion of inflammation.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:09.800
 The propaganda covers the spectrum of every kind of radiation.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:18.240
 They say that the fallout in your food is equivalent to flying across the country on

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.520
 an airplane, for example.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.760
 There are several kinds of lies built into that.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:33.240
 Every person who repeats that is repeating layered lying propaganda.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:40.960
 For example, it's true that you can say there's a certain amount of radiation from cosmic

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:47.880
 rays coming through the airplane when you're at 35,000 feet.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:57.720
 But it happens that the biological effect of radiation, cosmic rays, at, say, 10,000

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:05.960
 feet altitude on the mountain or in an airplane, that has less biological effect by a great

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:13.360
 amount per unit of radiation than the same cosmic rays do at sea level.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:22.400
 And the cosmic rays at high altitude pass right through you doing very little.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:29.600
 However, on the way through the atmosphere, they run into air atoms causing secondary

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.920
 and tertiary breakdown nuclear fission.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:42.240
 And it's those fission products produced on the way down close to sea level that increase

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.960
 the environmental radiation.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:52.080
 And that's why a big part of the reason why cancer rates are much lower, heart disease

00:35:52.080 --> 00:36:01.360
 is much lower when you live from 5,000 to 10,000 feet elevation above sea level.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.160
 Closer to sea level, the cosmic rays are more intense.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:13.120
 So the nuclear industry is turning things upside down to say that eating a banana or

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:20.840
 a Fukushima oyster or whatever can be compared to cosmic rays.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.760
 They've got it exactly backwards.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:29.440
 But we live on an island and we like to go out in the sun and be exposed to those rays.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.400
 So should we be afraid that our cancer levels are going to increase because we're at sea

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.400
 level?

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:43.040
 Well, the ultraviolet produces effects in your skin that are very similar to what X-rays

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:49.920
 and cosmic rays and gamma rays produce throughout your tissues.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:37:00.000
 It's just that the toxic effect of ultraviolet is limited to two or three millimeters near

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.160
 the top of your skin.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:12.120
 And it happens that the red light of sunlight, the yellow, green, orange, red frequencies

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:21.360
 happen to be neutralizers of the damage done by radiation of the toxic kind.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:28.400
 And for example, experiments with frogs would give them a certain dose of gamma rays that

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.400
 would kill them very quickly.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:40.840
 But if they gave the dose and within the hour gave them some very bright red light following

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.320
 the gamma ray exposure, they recovered.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320
 They weren't sick.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.880
 So would that be a good thing for us to do is get one of those red lights and lay under

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.240
 it a little bit for protection from Fukushima radiation?

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.280
 Well, natural sunlight contains enough of that.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:01.200
 If you filter out that protective red and orange light, sunlight will even kill plants

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.600
 that normally grow all day in the sun.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:11.840
 The blue light and ultraviolet is toxic even to plants, but it's the red light that allows

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:16.760
 plants to stand the ultraviolet all day.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.440
 So would that be the far infrared light bulbs that we can buy?

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:27.640
 No, just the red, red, orange, and yellow are all protective.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:35.400
 You don't want too much of the ultraviolet because your blood does circulate up through

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:41.480
 the surface of your skin and your white blood cells will get killed every time you get sunburned.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.640
 So you don't want to get sunburned.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:53.040
 And having a tan, the melanin pigment catches the biggest part of the ultraviolet and protects

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:59.120
 your skin from that immune suppressing effect of UV.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.840
 So what's wrong with people who don't tan and they just burn?

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.280
 Sometimes the vitamin D deficiency is involved.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:15.000
 Your body knows that it needs more vitamin D and so it doesn't make the pigment allowing

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.200
 more ultraviolet to be absorbed.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:25.120
 I've seen people who couldn't tan suddenly tanning normally when they took some vitamin

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120
 D.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120
 Interesting.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:32.800
 Well, Dr. Peat, we only have about one minute left here and I know Karen and I would love

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.680
 to bring you on for next week's show also if you have the time for it.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.680
 Okay.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:39.680
 Oh, terrific.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.800
 And people can go to your website, which is terrific.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.800
 I love it.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:49.960
 It's RayPeyt.com.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.520
 I love your artwork, Dr. Peat.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:59.800
 I think all of us that work in this industry of trying to generate health, sometimes you

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800
 need to back away.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.320
 We all have to have some kind of a hobby or a release or something else to focus our time

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.360
 and attention on.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:15.080
 I love your blue book from PMS to Menopause and your Nutrition for Women and your yellow

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.080
 book.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.160
 We're going to talk about that all next week because I have a bunch more questions for

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160
 you, Dr. Peat.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.880
 I want to thank you for being our guest today, sharing your Saturday morning with us and

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.320
 we'll have you on again with us next week.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.320
 Okay.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320
 Very good.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.320
 Lovely.
