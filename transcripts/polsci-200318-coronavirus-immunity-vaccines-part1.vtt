WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 Alright, well you're listening to WMRW LP Warren and it's 5 o'clock and time for Politics

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.540
 and Science and Politics and Science is live today for a change and I'm very honored that

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:23.720
 I have Dr. Raymond Peat back on the line here in the studio and let me bring him up here.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 I'm going to use the same bio I had for you years ago, right, which is that you have a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.920
 PhD in biology from the University of Oregon and with a specialization in physiology and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.240
 I also consider you a science historian and ombudsman, I've added that.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.840
 If you want to correct that, please feel free.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 Okay.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.720
 Okay, no corrections then, huh?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720
 Alright.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.800
 Well, I've wanted to get you on again because you're interesting to hear on any subject

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.840
 and we particularly have this weird emergency going on here that I think has got everybody

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:17.440
 spinning and that's the so-called Corona 19 or what's it called, COVID-19 pandemic and

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.120
 I just wanted to get your take on that and then maybe we could talk about the science

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:33.160
 behind pandemics and viruses and all of that and maybe cover vaccines at the end.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.200
 So feel free to just jump in and what do you think is going on right now?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.640
 First of all, I'm not sure anything special is going on in the virus and infection world.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.760
 It's definitely happening in the media and politics.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 Mexico isn't getting excited and they've had I think 16 mild cases but the CDC for years

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:19.000
 has been reporting the annual respiratory or flu-like death rate as being in the tens

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:31.520
 of thousands of deaths per year in the United States and so 100 or 200, the average number

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:42.080
 of deaths from respiratory disease being say 30 or 40,000.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.240
 If you look at the historic percentage of those respiratory diseases, about a tenth,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:05.960
 10% of roughly from 5 to 15% are historically coronavirus infections and the others are

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:18.720
 things as simple as rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, things that range from mild

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:33.160
 sniffles up to serious pneumonia but historically about 10% are corona-type virus and so if

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.800
 30 or 40,000 people are expected to die from a flu-like respiratory disease, we would expect

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:51.640
 to have 3,000 or 4,000 deaths per year from a coronavirus respiratory infection.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:03.160
 So I don't see any evidence at all that anything is happening on the real biological level.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.160
 Are you there?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.160
 The line seems to have...

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.160
 Sorry, Ray.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160
 Sorry, that was my fault.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
 Do you hear me now?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160
 Yeah.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:18.200
 I was just saying that the official line is that the crisis actually hasn't happened yet

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.480
 but you're saying in a given year, we should still see 3,000 to 4,000 deaths from coronavirus

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.640
 in an average year.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.680
 That could still happen.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:39.480
 We could get up to the average mortality associated with coronaviruses but we're not approaching

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.440
 that by a long way so far.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:51.960
 So a lower than average year as far as the actual figures that exist indicate.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:00.560
 So just looking at the actual numbers, it looks like we're slightly deficient in cases

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.840
 and deaths of respiratory problems associated with that virus.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.560
 And that's looking at the historical data?

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.560
 Yeah.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560
 Yeah.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.560
 And if you look at...

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.160
 Have you checked out the Chinese or the Asian data at this point?

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.560
 Is the corona deaths up from their average?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.880
 Yeah.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.120
 They haven't talked about the average for corona.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:37.960
 They weren't gathering that data but they say this is just slightly more deadly than

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.040
 a typical influenza virus or the other things causing respiratory disease.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:52.160
 So it is somewhat, according to their figures, just slightly more deadly.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:06:01.800
 But the problem is Italy always has had about twice as many respiratory or flu-like deaths

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.080
 per year per capita as the United States.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.160
 So it isn't unusual for them to be especially hard hit.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.360
 But what makes the number go up is that they have been primarily testing sick people in

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.920
 hospitals.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.560
 And it's the same with cancer diagnosis.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:35.680
 If you go all out to look for cancer in a population of middle age and old age in the

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:45.280
 cancer range, you'll find 100% cancers if you're really, really thorough in your diagnosis.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:55.280
 And so the more you diagnose, the more you can find people die at the same rate unless

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.800
 you treat them.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.160
 If you increase your treatment for cancer, as you increase the diagnosis, the treatment

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.120
 is going to kill more and more.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:13.960
 But you can make your treatments look better by diagnosing more and more cases which are

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.360
 harmless.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.840
 Same with the flu or the coronavirus.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:27.280
 If you test everyone in the population, you'll get all of these people with very mild reactions.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:37.120
 And so it'll look like in South Korea, for example, 0.6% because they tested more people.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.120
 I see.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:49.200
 So the dying people become a smaller percentage when you test a more representative cross-section

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200
 of the population.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.200
 Yeah, I see.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.040
 So that's a bit of, maybe it's just an accident that because they're looking for the diseases

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.240
 and the most vulnerable, that they test the sickest people first.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.240
 Yeah.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:13.640
 And so that, if restricted to the people in the hospital on respirators, then you'll find

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:22.080
 that most of them have serious viruses, probably multiple respiratory viruses.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080
 I see.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:31.160
 When you're very sick, various viruses that have been carried harmlessly will pop to the

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.320
 surface and get measured.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.120
 I see, because your immune system is compromised.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.120
 Yeah.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.040
 Now, if we could back up a little bit, because I am confused and probably other people are

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.320
 too, exactly what's the difference between a virus and a bacteria?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:55.360
 And also, what is particular, I can't talk particular about the coronavirus?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:04.360
 Most all bacteria are free living in a sense, they can generally live outside of cells if

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:11.680
 you feed them the right stuff and give them the right temperature and other conditions.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.520
 They have the apparatus to reproduce their own genetic material and the virus depends

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:28.200
 on entering a cell, either a bacterium or a higher organism's cell and taking advantage

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:37.000
 of their machinery like ribosomes that can produce proteins from nucleic acids.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:47.920
 And so these viruses put in their bit of nucleic acid once they can get into the cell and that

00:09:47.920 --> 00:10:00.280
 is processed on our ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and proteins are added to the replicated

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:09.840
 nucleic acid and then it's excreted as a finished particle by our ordinary cell excretory system,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.720
 secretory system.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:19.560
 So in a healthy person, if you encounter a virus, even if it's a new virus that nobody's

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.600
 seen, do you think we're able to conquer that or at least isolate it so it doesn't do any

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600
 harm?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:34.200
 Yeah, for example, on the surface, the respiratory surface in our lungs and the tubes leading

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:43.760
 into the air sacs, the air sacs are lined with epithelial cells that can secrete.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:53.320
 There are cells around the air sac that secrete mucus that cover the epithelial cells and

00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:02.440
 to reduce the surface tension so that the air sac will stay open, there's a protein

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:19.320
 called surfactant protein that has an oily, oil loving lipophilic fraction so it acts

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.680
 like a soap.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:32.240
 The water loving part of the protein dissolves in this mucus layer on the cell lining the

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:42.040
 air sac and the oily surface reduces the surface tension so that the air sac can stay open

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.360
 without extreme tension.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:58.560
 And that surfactant protein contains groups that will collect the sugar like surfaces

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:09.040
 of the viral proteins or other, any pathogen possibility that hits that surfactant protein

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:17.200
 will get glued down by these binding particles.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.680
 So it's our first layer of defense.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:34.280
 And then in and around the epithelial layer, we have the reactive parts of the immune system.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:43.880
 The angiotensin converting enzyme is one of the early parts of our immune system that

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:53.360
 sets up an inflammatory reaction that will set in action a whole chain of events.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:13:07.400
 If the pathogen gets through and is actually a threat, then you activate this proteolytic

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:16.840
 protein that creates angiotensin which is like a transmitter of a panic reaction to

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.840
 the organism.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:30.360
 And it happens that this coronavirus is able to bind to one of these angiotensin converting

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.200
 enzymes.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:44.840
 There is one which is only pro-inflammatory and another one that backs that up which undoes,

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:53.240
 inhibits the inflammatory damage done by the first angiotensin producing enzyme.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:04.680
 This is called ACE2 and ACE2 happens to be attacked by this particular virus which binds

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:12.520
 to that enzyme and that's called the receptor.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.760
 It's a vulnerable point of the organism as far as this virus is concerned.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:33.520
 And binding to that ACE2 means that it leaves the ACE, first the ACE1 which produces angiotensin,

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:46.280
 it leaves that free to act and ACE2 is capable of inactivating angiotensin, breaking it down

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:52.400
 to the first seven amino acids.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:15:00.720
 They call it angiotensin 1 to 7 and this is a defensive anti-inflammatory peptide.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:11.600
 So if your ACE2 is knocked out, angiotensin has a free range to cause damage.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:22.720
 So the virus increases the inflammatory reaction by sticking to this defensive enzyme and that

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:35.840
 enzyme combined with the virus then acts to enter the cell by way of the angiotensin receptor

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.600
 which is called the AT1.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:50.800
 There are two known receptors by which angiotensin can do its damage.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:58.520
 Angiotensin 1 is strictly an inflammation producing system.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:06.360
 The angiotensin 2 produces some somewhat defensive reactions.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:20.640
 It happens that the virus enzyme combination enters the cell by way of angiotensin receptor

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:33.680
 1, AT1, and that turns on a whole range of destructive processes, nitric oxide and serotonin

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.680
 for example.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:43.240
 And so just looking at the effects, it's obvious that you could defend by anything

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.680
 that defends you against nitric oxide and serotonin.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.600
 I see.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.840
 Which are inflammatory mediators?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.200
 Yeah.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:58.520
 So anti-inflammatory things are the known treatment for this kind of virus.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:07.760
 The Chinese for years have been using cinanserin which is a serotonin blocker for other treatments

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.760
 and they find that it's helpful for people with the established respiratory corona infection.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.320
 And what was the name of that again, Ray?

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320
 The Chinese?

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320
 cinanserin, C-I-N-A-N-S-E-R-I-N.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320
 Okay.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:42.560
 And losartan which is a high blood pressure drug is the most well-known blocker of angiotensin

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:52.080
 receptor, candesartan and there are several others, but losartan is cheap and widely available.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080
 How do you spell that?

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.080
 L-O-S-A-R-T-A-N.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.640
 Ah, just like it sounds.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.120
 And what did you call that drug, Ray, is a certain type of?

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.640
 Angiotensin 1 receptor blocker.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.960
 Okay.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.320
 It's quite an action film you just painted for us there.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.200
 I couldn't follow it all, but it seemed pretty interesting.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:29.280
 Basically, the virus just activates an inflammatory process that many other things activate.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:38.920
 So things that would primarily activate nitric oxide production or serotonin production or

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:47.280
 histamine or prostaglandin production, any of these tend to end up in the same condition.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:57.880
 So I think without knowing more about the nature of the infection, I think people who

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:06.040
 are taking aspirin, for example, it has a wide range of antiviral properties.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:14.840
 It's already known to reduce infection from the standard influenza virus, hepatitis C

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:28.880
 virus, rhinovirus, half a dozen well-known viruses are blocked by common aspirin.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.840
 There was a study of HIV, even, in which they saw beneficial effects from aspirin.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:44.400
 Yeah, well, that's certainly available and very cheap, although much maligned.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:54.440
 And D happens to, one of its effects, like progesterone and aspirin, all of our known

00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:04.960
 protective pro-immune but anti-inflammatory things lower the expression of antidensin

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.640
 receptor 1.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:13.320
 So they predispose us to be less inflammable.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.720
 So it sounded like when you say that the, see if I can get my words correctly here,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:27.160
 when it enters your lungs, your cells put out a kind of a lipid of some kind?

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:36.840
 Well, naturally, just once we're born and start breathing, we depend on the production

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.640
 of this surfactant protein.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.640
 So it's everywhere normally.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:49.960
 And our intestines have similar layers of defenses right at the very surface.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:57.640
 Mucus will be a barrier against infection and then at the surface layers of cells and

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640
 so on.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:06.120
 And these viruses, the coronaviruses, don't just specialize on the lungs.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.960
 They can infect the mucus membranes in the nose and the intestine.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:23.280
 So the thing that some people have been saying that runny noses aren't connected as a precursor

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:32.320
 of the lung infection, but a Russian virologist says that looking at tens of thousands of

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:39.960
 patients, he saw that a runny nose was a typical precursor to the rest of the lung infection

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:47.360
 symptoms and that the intestine is just as prone to infection as the lungs.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.880
 So eating something could make you sick if you're feeling weak.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:57.600
 Now I don't know if that's true, but it's possible to eat the virus and it could attack

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 your intestines.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600
 Is that what you're saying?

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 Yeah.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.440
 If you get it in your mouth and swallow it, it could infect those as well.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.440
 I see.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:12.320
 So it's not your stomach acid you think would take care of it?

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.320
 Not necessarily.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:19.520
 The stomach acid doesn't break down the nucleic acid.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.520
 I see.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:27.040
 Now, if you're a healthy person, the mucus I understand is often a protective layer,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.040
 correct?

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.800
 Like I think you just said that.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:36.920
 And if your mucus is healthy and working correctly, would it be able to kill the virus or is this

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.920
 virus just too much for it?

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:45.720
 Yeah, the surface cells including the mucus have proteins analogous to the surfactant

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:54.840
 in the lung, proteins that collect the surface groups of a pathogen and bind them together.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.000
 So it's just like putting flypaper on them sort of.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Oh yeah.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 Right.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.840
 And I was thinking it sounded a little bit like soap.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840
 You said it was soap-like.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:19.360
 Yeah, the hydrophobic surface itself tends to disorganize some of the invaders.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.280
 For instance, they're telling us to wash our hands all the time.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.680
 And how does soap kill a virus?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.920
 Do you know?

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:34.960
 I'm taking the proteins, dissolving, making relatively insoluble things soluble because

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:43.960
 the soap has that hydrophobic fraction that sticks to hydrophobic insoluble parts of an

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.360
 organism and disassembles it.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.360
 I see.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.360
 Inside out.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.360
 Right.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.640
 So that's a good thing.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:01.920
 Now is the COVID-19, it sounds like it's a little better at breaking into our system,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:08.640
 so to speak, than a normal cold, which is also, I've heard a cold is also a coronavirus.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.640
 Is that true?

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.640
 No.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:17.920
 A cold can be caused by any of these.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:25.880
 If your immune system is good, like one study found that almost half of all of the respiratory

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:31.920
 infections, they couldn't identify a particular cause.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:37.000
 But the rhinovirus was the biggest at about 30%.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.560
 That's the most common cold virus that is identified, but there are lots of unknown

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.840
 things that cause those symptoms.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:56.560
 And then the coronavirus is in the range of somewhere between 5 and 15% of those respiratory

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560
 infections.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.560
 I see.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:08.440
 So do you think the reaction of the government at this point is over the top considering?

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:16.280
 Unless it was their purpose to create international chaos, for example, to try to finish off Iran

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:26.320
 by cutting off their medical supplies while they're having a pandemic.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320
 That's right.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.960
 The Trump administration is intensifying the sanctions at this point.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.960
 Yeah.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.760
 You would suppose that it would fit into their plans.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.960
 And if it's not really a threat, otherwise it becomes a threat when you do all of these

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.880
 insane things.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.320
 For example, I just learned that all of my favorite brands of milk have been discontinued

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.480
 for the duration of the panic.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480
 Really?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.520
 Why is that?

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.520
 I don't know.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.400
 I don't think they know.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.360
 Are they claiming milk as a carrier?

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.080
 No, no.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:11.360
 But I have noticed that over the last several weeks, the Lucerne brand that I normally get,

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:17.360
 they reduced it to one little row in the supermarket and weren't replenishing that.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.120
 But then today they said they were discontinuing it.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120
 Wow.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120
 That's annoying.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.000
 Well, worse than annoying because you don't have any milk.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 Yeah.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.320
 Well, yeah, I'm sort of puzzled by the reaction.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.400
 And everybody around here is, you know, trying to cope with it.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:48.080
 Yeah, the media, including the big science media like Nature, the international science

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:59.120
 magazine, they are getting kind of excited in denying that it was an intentionally created

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:04.240
 virus which was leaked either accidentally or intentionally.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:14.760
 Just, I think, yesterday published a paper explaining technically why it would be impossible

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.560
 for them to have done it.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:25.320
 But the fact that they're rushing so fast to deny that it could have been leaked accidentally

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.520
 out of a lab.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:33.040
 But when you look at the fact that normally they say that it takes over a year to produce

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:39.520
 a vaccine to a new respiratory infection.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:46.680
 But they're already now within weeks saying that they have a vaccine ready to test.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:58.720
 The purpose of CDC patenting the coronavirus 17 years ago was deliberately to create pathogens

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:08.080
 experimentally to enable them to anticipate a pathogen so that they could create, have

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.080
 a vaccine ready.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.120
 So their intention was to have a vaccine ready by creating a pathogen.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.760
 But now they're saying they couldn't possibly have created this, but they do happen to have

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.720
 a vaccine almost ready to use.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.920
 So by their own declarations it sounds very suspicious.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:36.280
 Yeah, I feel like there's a tremendous conflict of interest at the CDC.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.200
 I know we're supposed to respect them.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.920
 Yes, same as the World Health Organization.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:49.720
 The head of that on January 29th said it's not a pandemic.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.640
 And then the next day said it is a pandemic.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.440
 I think something happened to him politically.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440
 I see.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:02.960
 Yeah, it's, I mean, they haven't, a pandemic was supposed to reach a much higher bar as

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.120
 my understanding than we've reached at this point.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:13.800
 Well as I said, I don't see any evidence that it's anything different from last year or

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.280
 10 years ago.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.680
 Maybe you could explain the conflict of interest at the World Health Organization.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.000
 I'm not familiar with that.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.320
 People working there who have close connections to the vaccine industry.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:40.560
 I think Robert Kennedy Jr.'s website has information about the conflicts of interest.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.480
 Yeah, he's spoken quite eloquently about that.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.200
 And our own CDC, you mentioned that they have a patent on the coronavirus.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.200
 Why would they patent that?

00:29:53.200 --> 00:30:00.880
 Well, so that they can license a vaccine, I suppose.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:07.760
 I see that gives them the right, sole right to licensing a vaccine that would treat that.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:16.760
 Yeah, and now Trump's, I can't remember the name, I think his name is Foshee, Foshee, F-A-C.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.120
 I've heard him speak.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.360
 He actually seems like a fairly straightforward person.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.760
 And he was saying it would be at least a year and a half minimum to put out a vaccine.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.320
 Do you think he's just out of the loop?

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.600
 No, no, that's what they've been saying.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:44.960
 Virologists in general say it takes time to develop it and to do actual testing.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:53.560
 I think that's a very optimistic idea because if they really had to test it, you know, it

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.160
 would take a generation.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.600
 Because they tested on animals.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:08.880
 Yeah, and the way they have tested the safety of it, for example, is to, in the control

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:19.920
 group to use the same adjuvant, aluminum adjuvant, for example, which is the most dangerous component.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.800
 So they're using fraudulent safety tests.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.840
 You can't have a test without a control group.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.760
 I see, you mean the control group is being fed the same adjuvant, which is actually an

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.000
 a... explain what an adjuvant is, Ray, you'll do it much better than I will.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:50.200
 It creates a derangement of, in this case, the muscle is where they inject it.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:59.280
 And anything that you inject into the muscle is going to damage it and start an immune

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.600
 corrective process.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:10.600
 But they found that just pathogens, particles, weren't enough to really tear up the tissue

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.760
 to produce a violent immune reaction.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:23.160
 So they found that aluminum oxide particles created a terrific immunological storm that

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.600
 would sometimes create a little tumor or abscess at the site.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:31.480
 It was such an intense damage.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:42.840
 But that extreme inflammation at the point of injection activates a better, more systemic

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.640
 immune reaction.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:50.040
 It turns your whole body into an inflammatory system.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:57.560
 And so people very, very often have a fever for a couple of days after getting a shot.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.120
 So that's why some people, when they get a flu shot, they feel like they have a mild

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.120
 flu.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.320
 Yeah, it's the same thing.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:10.400
 It's a systemic inflammatory reaction, which is the whole purpose of the adjuvant.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:18.200
 It wouldn't be an adjuvant if it didn't damage your whole inflammatory system.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.760
 So you're saying when they do the testing, they don't have a controlled group that doesn't

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:23.760
 receive the adjuvant.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:32.440
 Yeah, in many of the studies, that isn't a universal situation, but several of the very

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.960
 important studies were completely fraudulent by not having a control group.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:46.800
 Yeah, I think that's considered standard in double-blind testing, isn't it?

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.080
 Yeah.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:53.800
 I have a number of questions here, but maybe talk a little bit more about vaccines.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:01.880
 They keep harking back to the so-called Spanish flu, I think it was in 1918, that took a tremendous

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.960
 toll on lives over, I think, a year or two period.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.520
 It was blamed on Spain, I think sort of like Trump is blaming it on China, but it turned

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.360
 out it actually came from a US Army base.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:24.600
 And I just read recently that that so-called flu that started on the Army base for these

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:31.400
 soldiers who had just been drafted and then were shipped over to Europe, that that might

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:39.840
 have been caused by a vaccine that the Rockefeller Center was testing on those soldiers who were

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.200
 basically draftees.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.360
 Have you heard anything about that?

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.880
 And I was wondering if you could talk about that.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:54.480
 I haven't heard any more than what you said, but do you know about the movie Vaxxed?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.720
 Yes, I do.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:05.920
 There's information in that about the Gulf War syndrome and the anthrax vaccine.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:12.320
 People were getting the Gulf War syndrome without leaving the US following their anthrax

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320
 vaccination.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320
 That's right.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.040
 I think there were a lot of complaints by veterans about those vaccines.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:27.760
 And also the nurses who were giving them who felt terrible about administrating them.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.680
 I'm just going to read a little thing here about this article I found at lewrockwell.com.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.240
 It's looking at research that was done about the Spanish flu.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:46.040
 And this scientist who looked into it, who looked back at the autopsies, they were all

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:57.080
 the people who died of the flu supposedly tested positive for bacterial pneumonia.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:02.640
 So for some reason, they all got bacterial pneumonia and that's what this person believes

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.680
 killed them.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.920
 And that's different than the flu?

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.160
 Oh, definitely.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:22.520
 But the CDC accounts pretty much that would fall into the unknown category of severe respiratory

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.840
 syndromes.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:39.120
 So to get their annual 40 or 50,000 deaths, they can scare people saying that flu gets

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.320
 your flu shot.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.680
 It obviously isn't the flu.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:52.360
 It's pneumonia from partly unknown causes and partly a variety of viruses that have

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.600
 nothing to do with the flu shot.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.520
 Yeah, and of course, veterans in that situation are in the worst environment because they're

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:06.120
 either packed into barracks or into ships being shipped to Europe or in trenches where

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.120
 it's very...

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:17.880
 Yeah, the conditions during the First World War were not healthful in general.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:24.600
 Much of the world was influenced by the war conditions.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:42.120
 So stress itself is the cause of epidemics.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.120
 A shortage of food will increase the incidence of infectious diseases.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.120
 Yeah, that's a really good point.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:50.640
 So, I mean, right now, if it's true that this is a pandemic, it seems to mean that people

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.880
 all around the world are under a tremendous amount of stress if they're succumbing to

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.880
 it.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:03.400
 Do you think that's possibly a cause if it actually is the case that we're succumbing?

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:14.720
 Yeah, if anything unusual is happening in the disease world, I think you can blame sanctions

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:22.240
 as one of the big causes that's dislocating the world economy.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.760
 And if you cause unemployment, you're going to increase infectious diseases.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.760
 I mean, poverty causes infectious diseases.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.760
 Yeah.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.100
 Yeah, causes ill health.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:44.560
 And somebody else was speculating that all the places where the hot points for this viral

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:54.520
 infection also coincide with sites of 5G deployment, the new telecommunications standard that involves

00:38:54.520 --> 00:39:00.200
 a lot more millimeter waves basically being everywhere in the environment.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.040
 So you can't escape these microwaves.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.240
 Do you think that could contribute to the declining immune system?

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240
 Yeah.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:17.960
 I saw a good tape, an hour-long lecture by Deborah Davis.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.800
 She did a good book on cancer, The Phony War on Cancer.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:34.840
 But this is a very good analysis of the electromagnetic damage.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:40.960
 Basically they're claiming that it's safe on the basis of absolutely no research, but

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.880
 the animal research that exists shows that there is a real danger.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.720
 That there is a degradation of the immune system from, like cell phones, for instance?

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.720
 Yeah.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:03.000
 For example, some studies, just the mild field from sitting at an electric sewing machine,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.080
 they found that people who had worked on an electric sewing machine for 20 years had a

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:12.360
 very high rate of dementia.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:18.520
 And anything that affects your nervous system is affecting your immune system.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520
 Right.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.360
 So another reason to go back to a treadle sewing machine and a bicycle.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.360
 Yeah.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.360
 That's right.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.400
 I'm going to switch and go to some questions here, Ray.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.440
 Some people have nicely sent in questions for you tonight, I think mostly about this

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440
 topic.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.440
 Okay.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.960
 So I'll proceed with that.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:41.040
 Here's Caleb from Ontario, Canada.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.360
 He would like to ask, Ray, how much of a role endotoxin plays in regards to a viral infection

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:52.960
 and if the effects of endotoxin are increased in the presence of a virus?

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:59.360
 And maybe you could quickly tell everybody what endotoxin is.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:10.760
 Endotoxin is a fatty acid with carbohydrate attached to it.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:19.840
 It's called lipopolysaccharide, but it's just part of the coating of a bacterium.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:25.640
 And so it's being produced in the living process of the bacteria.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:35.560
 And normally our intestine filters out most of it, but when you're under stress, more

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:42.880
 of it reaches your liver and your liver is always doing a fairly good job of detoxifying

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:50.080
 it, but some of it's always circulating and activating the immune system a little bit.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:59.320
 But when you're under stress, your liver gets overwhelmed with this bacterial material and

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:08.520
 lets it produce inflammation and stress, interfering with oxidative metabolism everywhere in your

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.760
 body.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:18.960
 And it's activating because it interferes with mitochondrial energy production.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:29.000
 It's overlapping with what the angiotensin system is doing anyway, but it activates the

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.400
 angiotensin system.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:39.160
 So the viral infection and anything stressing your intestine enough to make it permeable

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:48.720
 to bacterial materials will end up in the same place, making you have inflammatory symptoms,

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:55.800
 sometimes with bowel-centered symptoms, other times lung and head-centered symptoms.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.200
 Yeah, it's always amazed me.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.400
 I didn't believe you when, you know, years ago when I first hear you talk about the intestine

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.760
 being so connected to your other organs.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.720
 But I do believe you now.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.760
 And if you look at a map of the nerve system, your intestines are connected to all those.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:26.600
 Yeah, it's partly chemical leaking through and partly inflammatory substances like serotonin

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:32.560
 and histamine produced by the intestine itself getting into the bloodstream.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:43.360
 A tremendous flood of serotonin shows up and circulates in the platelets.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:55.200
 And the nerves directly can transmit signals such as secretion of mucus and production

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:02.040
 of histamine and serotonin and nitric oxide right up in your nose membranes and throat

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.040
 membranes.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:14.240
 And so you can treat the symptoms at the source by swallowing these things.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:26.000
 So that's why I recommend raw carrot because carrot being indigestible will help to wash

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.640
 out some of the bacteria that are producing the endotoxin.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:40.040
 But if you take anti-inflammatory things with it such as olive or coconut oil or aspirin

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:46.880
 or an antihistamine or antibiotic, the carrot will deliver that down all the way through

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:54.480
 your intestine offering protection and anti-inflammatory effect.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480
 So it's like...

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480
 Oh, go ahead.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:09.760
 An early US 20th century gastroenterologist demonstrated that canine distemper which was

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:18.120
 thought of as a lung and respiratory disease, he found that before any bacteria or any virus

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:25.400
 occurred in any of these respiratory membranes, there was already a well-established infection

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:35.000
 in the intestine and they would start drooling and sniveling because of a nervous or chemical

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.080
 signal from an inflamed intestine.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:47.920
 So no pathogen was present in these inflamed respiratory membranes.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.120
 It was all coming from the intestine.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:58.720
 I think that's very generally neglected in people treating respiratory sicknesses.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:06.240
 They let them go on eating things that are known to favor bacterial growth in the small

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.840
 intestine for example.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:15.640
 Yeah, and if anybody's, I mean, interested in an everyday sort of phenomenon, notice

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:22.360
 when you eat something, a lot of times your nose will start to get moist on the inside.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.940
 Maybe it's my age now, I'm almost 65, but when I eat something now, it doesn't always

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.360
 happen but I start to get a slightly runny nose.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:39.560
 Yeah, that was something I noticed about 60 some years ago when I worked in the woods.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:47.920
 I would come in to eat supper in a restaurant and I noticed day after day, I would see someone

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:54.560
 eating paella mode or a milkshake and by the time they got to the cash register, they would

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.560
 be sniffling.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:00.680
 Oh, just the thought of it.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.000
 Was it just the thought of it that did that?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:13.680
 No, I think it was loosening up mucus, producing sort of a therapeutic cleansing reaction when

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.200
 they got their blood sugar up.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:26.640
 The first stage of inflammation increases circulation but it can dry up the membranes

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:38.920
 and the mucus that they secrete becomes gummy and hardened and produces a dry cough but

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:44.840
 when you get your blood sugar up, the process can complete itself.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:52.840
 It seems to need enough energy to produce a good flow of blood and mucus production

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.640
 so it can wash away the histamine.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:02.200
 Okay, I'm going to move on to another question.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.080
 Running out of time here amazingly.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:11.920
 What about the theory that viruses are simply phages or somatids from bacteria and viral

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.080
 infections are really caused by occult intracellular bacteria?

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.960
 Luke Montenger, if I'm saying that right, probably not, for instance, insists that there

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:29.200
 must be an occult bacteria associated with HIV.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:37.640
 Those things do exist but I don't think he was right in that, blaming it all on occult

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.840
 bacteria.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:48.880
 We are loaded with potential viruses.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:58.000
 Several percent of our genome, some people have identified as potential viruses or retroviruses

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:12.640
 and these are DNA that has been built into our system by an exposure to the environment.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:23.920
 There's a lab in Germany that shows that you can identify beef DNA after you eat beef in

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:31.200
 a bloodstream and then you can find it integrated into our genome.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:41.080
 Whatever we eat that has DNA in it is likely to be able to enter cells and be integrated

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:47.360
 as a potential resource but when we're put under stress, it's something that Barbara

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:56.000
 McClintock was very unpopular for in the 1940s and 50s when she talked about the jumping

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:04.160
 genes but she showed that stress causes genes to come out of the chromosomes and move around

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.920
 to a different place.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:19.320
 Since we have these retroviruses, I think it's very almost certain that under stress

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:27.800
 we will express retroviruses that have been in us for generations and if you look for

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:33.840
 them, it will look like you have caught a viral infection from the outside.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:37.720
 That's what Peter Duesberg has been saying now for years.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:42.840
 It's very interesting but it's really just something coming out of you when you're getting

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:43.840
 disorganized.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:53.920
 Yeah, when the people with the tests for the HIV virus have looked at blood stored from

00:50:53.920 --> 00:51:04.960
 army recruits in the 1960s and 70s, every year the stored blood showed roughly a one-half

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:14.280
 percent HIV infection, every year the same and more recent tests have been in the same

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.040
 range of a general population.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.640
 If you look at sick people, you'll find a higher percentage so it looks like an epidemic.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:31.040
 You go to Africa where people are under stress and exposed to many infectious diseases, you'll

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:41.360
 find a very high infectious rate so-called of HIV virus but the standard healthy population

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:51.640
 historically has been one-half percent and if you stir up the organism and cause rearrangement

00:51:51.640 --> 00:52:00.880
 of the genes as McClintock showed, the stress induces the expression of what we can call

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:01.880
 viruses, retroviruses.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:06.080
 I see, I never understood what that meant before.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:13.440
 I'm going to move right along here because here's a pertinent question.

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.120
 This says, "I heard that immunity after an infection with a coronavirus is quite short-lived.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.960
 Unfortunately, I do not remember where I heard this.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:29.600
 Does Mr. Peate have any opinion on acquired immunity to coronaviruses?"

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:40.960
 No, not at all but one thing that is known is that after this kind of a severe respiratory

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:52.120
 infection, there is a great increase in the risk of pulmonary fibrosis just because inflammation

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:58.560
 leads to fibrosis and reduced lung function.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:09.720
 So apart from any future risk, I think the real thing to worry about is to stop the progression

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:20.880
 of that angiotensin-related inflammatory production of tissue fibrosis and stiffness.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.400
 I see and anti-inflammatories will do that.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.400
 Yeah.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:31.280
 I see and what's the best way of delivering an anti-inflammatory to the lung?

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.120
 I think through the mouth.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.120
 Okay.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:43.800
 So just eating it like Losartan is currently and the Chinese are recommending a variety

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.800
 of things.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:52.560
 They are including some virus-killing chemicals but I think their main recommendations are

00:53:52.560 --> 00:54:04.280
 Losartan and cinanserin, the anti-serotonin things being very broad-spectrum protective

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.280
 anti-inflammatory.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:14.680
 So I think Ciproheptadine is a good, safe, broad anti-inflammatory.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:22.360
 And a lot of people are recommending the old approach to viruses, the idea of killing the

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:35.760
 virus and in the 70s and 80s, antivirals based on the idea of nucleoside analogs to mutate

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:44.160
 the DNA of the virus, acyclovir and ribavirin for example.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:54.760
 And at that time, a lot of people were saying if you mutate the DNA or RNA of a virus, aren't

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:59.200
 you likely to be mutating the human DNA?

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:08.120
 And the FDA approved studies that said absolutely no, they're absolutely not going to mutate

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.800
 your gonadal DNA.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:19.360
 But in recent years, 40 some years later, the studies are saying yes, definitely they

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.880
 injure the gonads and mutate human DNA.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:33.720
 So people are now recommending widespread use protectively of nucleoside analog antivirals.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:43.240
 But I think widespread use of that is going to create genetic damage to the reproducing

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.240
 population.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:50.840
 Yeah, and we're already seeing a lot of sterility amongst the general population.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.800
 But we really don't have any more time.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:57.120
 So I apologize to everybody who sent in questions and we didn't get to them.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:03.120
 Maybe perhaps Dr. Peat, you'll come back sometime and we could cover some of these.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:08.760
 Perhaps at this point, with only four minutes left to go, we should just sum up what's the

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:14.440
 best course of action for people to protect themselves?

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:25.320
 My first recommendation was to eat well and make sure your vitamin D level is up to around

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:36.520
 50 to 60 nanograms per milliliter on a blood test, which often takes 5,000 units a day.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:42.960
 And to use a very safe antiviral such as aspirin.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:51.880
 But if there's a sign of an infection, then I think Losartan and the antiserotonin things

00:56:51.880 --> 00:57:00.040
 would be appropriate to limit the degree of inflammation and not to worry about killing

00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:10.200
 the virus or becoming immune to some future variant because your immune system is a lot

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:17.400
 better than the vaccines, but still the immune system doesn't necessarily keep up with a

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.160
 mutating virus.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.160
 Okay.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:29.760
 And the Losartan and cyproheptadine are good things to go to if aspirin isn't working?

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.760
 I think so.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.760
 The Chinese recommend cinanserin.

00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:35.680
 Oh, that's right.

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:40.400
 I don't know if it might be better than cyproheptadine.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.840
 Okay.

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.040
 And you can also get vitamin D from sunlight, right?

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.520
 If you're in some place where it's sunny enough.

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:50.520
 That's the best thing.

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.520
 Yeah.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.520
 All right.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.320
 Well, thanks for being on the air tonight, Ray.

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.760
 I really appreciate it.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.480
 And I think everybody else does too.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.000
 And if you don't mind sometime coming back, we'll get to these other questions.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.880
 Okay, any time.

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.720
 Okay, that's wonderful.

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.560
 So maybe we'll do it next week if you're up for it.

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:11.560
 Okay.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.560
 Great.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.440
 Well, thanks so much and I'm wishing you a good night and stay healthy.

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.440
 Okay, thanks.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.440
 Bye.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.440
 Okay, thanks, Ray.

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:20.440
 Bye-bye.

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440
 All right.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.320
 Thanks, everybody, for listening tonight.

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:25.480
 You heard Dr. Raymond Peate.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:30.960
 And if you want more of his information, he has many articles on his website, which is

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:35.480
 raypeat.com.

00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.960
 There is no charge.

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:44.960
 You can just go there and read a lot of good information and very interesting stuff too.

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:48.000
 So I hope you can avail yourself of that.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.420
 I've been your host for Politics and Science, John Barkhausen.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:57.600
 And it looks like next week we'll be back again with Dr. Raymond Peate to talk more

00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:03.200
 about the coronavirus and get to some of the questions that we didn't get to tonight.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.600
 And thanks to everybody who sent in questions.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:13.260
 They were excellent and we'll get to more of them next week, five o'clock Eastern Standard

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:18.520
 Time at wmrw.org.

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:23.520
 And now it's time to say this is WMRW LP Warren.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:29.440
 And we're going to Letters in Politics with Mitch Jeseritz.

00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.040
 Thanks for listening.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:40.040
