 [Music]

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 and we recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 So, this month we are going to have Dr. Pete on the show to talk about various different subjects.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Okay, I got a message for Kevin Peer.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Kevin Peer, call back in because your call has been dropped here somehow.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 So, we were going to bring Kevin Peer in who's studied hypnotherapy

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 and is going to open up a Lyme disease forum in Garboville and Humboldt area for people to contact him.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 So, we were going to get Kevin on the show here for the first 5, 10 minutes.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And then Dr. Pete was going to join us again.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 We're very lucky to have him back again.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 So, we're going to be talking about hair loss, folks.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 So, the guys out there who may or may not be bothered about hair loss, you know, it's pretty common.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 But there is some answer for it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So, Dr. Pete has got some good advice, good suggestions, backed up by science.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 It's very much a hormone-based approach.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 We're going to talk about inflammation, osteoporosis, amongst other things.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 So, after the discussion with Kevin on the Lyme forum happening in Humboldt County here,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Dr. Pete will be joining us here in 5, 10 minutes at the most.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 So, Kevin, do we have Kevin with us on the line?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 We don't have Kevin on the line.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Okay, well.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Kevin, please call in or hang up your phone because I'm trying to call you and your phone is busy.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Okay, well.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Perhaps if we don't get Kevin calling here in the next couple of seconds,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 we should get Dr. Pete straight in here and go through it with Dr. Pete.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 So, I know what we want to do.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Do we want to switch to Dr. Pete now or do we want to try to get Kevin?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 I think we're frantically working in the studio and I think they've got Kevin on the line.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 So, in a few seconds here, we'll switch over to Kevin and let Kevin talk about what he's doing.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 I think we have Kevin on the line.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Are you there, Kevin?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Kevin, are you there?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Well, I think he might have been there.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 I do hear a different humming sound now.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Yeah, the line looks like it's open.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 I'm not hearing anybody coming over.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Kevin, are you there?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 Here, I'll try him on this line.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Are you there now?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Well, Kevin, please try calling in again.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Something's not working.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Whoops, I'm sorry.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 Okay, well, for whatever â€“ oh, okay, I think maybe now we've finally done it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Hello?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 Hey, Kevin.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Okay, I'm sorry that for some reason there we managed to lose you.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Okay, so I've mentioned briefly what it is that you're doing.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Do I understand correctly that you are going to create a LIME support group?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 And I don't want to rush you, Kevin, but we're already seven minutes into the show.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 So you want to do a LIME support group; is that correct?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 That is correct.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 Okay, and that will be for Humboldt County or all around?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 It'll be for all around.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 It's going to take place at my office at the AEE building right across there from KMUD.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 Okay.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 So that's here in Redway?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 That's there in Redway.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 So what was the purpose of the LIME support group then, briefly?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Well, the purpose is to give people an opportunity to be able to meet with other people who are in the same boat,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 so to speak, who are dealing with LIME disease and dealing with the challenges and the mysteries of that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 One thing that I consistently hear from people, and I certainly experienced myself when I was really in the throes of LIME disease,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 is that a lot of people who don't have LIME disease don't really want to hear about it.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 They're kind of confused about it.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 They're not sure whether the person is being a hypochondriac or not

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 because a lot of the symptoms are very mysterious and very perplexing, and they change from day to day.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 And so one thing that I have consistently heard from people who know that I know something about LIME disease is,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 "God, it would be great to have a place where I can come and talk about this, and nobody's going to think I'm crazy."

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Okay. How are you going to advertise it?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Well, Christina Boust did a wonderful article in this week's issue of The Independent, our fine Garberville newspaper.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 It will be also advertised as an announcement through KMUD there.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And then this interview, it will be on the community calendar, KMUD, as it gets closer to the date,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 August 3rd, Wednesday, August 3rd, will be the first meeting.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And for people who are interested in taking part in this, they should give me a call

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 so that I can get a sense of what they're wanting to experience in the group and what their needs are.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Okay. Well, make sure, let people know now how best to contact you, and then what it is,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 just mention again what it is that you're going to do to advertise the fact so that people can, after today,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 either contact you or wait to hear other information from you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Yeah, well, my phone number is 986-7469.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 They can also contact me through my email, which is kevin@inneralliancecounseling.com.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 And that's inneralliancecounseling.com, all spelled properly.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Yes.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 In case our listeners couldn't hear that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 I wanted to ask, what can participants expect, besides what you've already mentioned in the fact of expressing

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 their different symptoms that they're experiencing,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 what other things can participants expect if they come to this LIME Support Group?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Yeah, well, it will be kind of a combination of, you know, just being a listening platform for people to share experiences.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 It will be a place where they can gain information.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Myself and other people, guest speakers, will be coming in to present information on some of the latest treatment

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 modalities for Lyme disease, both in the realm of conventional medicine and also alternative medicine.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 We'll be talking about things like just some of the other ways that Lyme disease affects, you know,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 various organ systems, hormones, what you need to be thinking of in terms of diet, you know,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 just basically how to untangle the puzzle that is really presented when Lyme disease really gets entrenched in your body.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 Will you be discussing how hypnotherapy can help Lyme disease?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Well, during the last 20 minutes or so of each meeting, I'm going to offer a kind of an in-depth,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 very relaxing guided healing meditation that will be geared around helping to activate the immune system so that,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 you know, you can be using your body, mind, spirit all together in dealing with the challenge of Lyme disease.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 I guess a very quick last question here. Are you going to be charging for this?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 There will be a nominal fee, probably like $5.00.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Nominal fee, nobody will be turned away for financial reasons.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 And the $5.00 will just be basically going towards, you know, helping to defray the cost of gas

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 because I'll be driving an hour each way, you know, to do the group.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Okay. So you said that you were going to do some public service announcements on this?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Yes. So basically whatever KMUD will allow me to do.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 So there will be some community calendar announcements.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 I'll be advertising through their classified section.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 You know, they'll be making classified ad announcements.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 No, not classified ad. What is it?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 With their community calendar.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Public service announcement, I think.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Well, public service announcement apparently is for non-profit organizations.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 So it won't be through that.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 But I'll be getting the word out.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 There will be also in the community calendar in the independent newspaper.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 That will be coming up, you know, the week beforehand as well.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Okay.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Okay. And just to reiterate your number, it's 9867469 for our listeners tonight.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 And that's Kevin Peer.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Yeah. Kevin@inneralliancecounseling.com.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Right. That's Kevin@inneralliancecounseling.com.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Well, thank you, Kevin, for your time tonight to discuss this and talk to us about this.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 Sorry, we got off to a slow start.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 Oh, that's okay. Thanks for having me on board here for a few minutes.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Yeah, no problem. Okay, Kevin. Thank you.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 All right. Bye-bye.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Okay. Well, we should have Dr. Pete on the line next.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 So, Dr. Pete, you with us?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 Yes.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Hi. Good evening.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Hi.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Again, there may be some people who have just tuned in this evening for the first time to this show

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 and the first time of hearing your name.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 So just for those people that are always around,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 would you please just let people know about your academic background?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Okay. I studied biology at the University of Oregon, specializing in physiology,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 especially reproductive physiology, and quite a bit of biochemistry.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 But I consider myself an old-fashioned biologist, pre-molecular biology in my way of thinking.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Okay. So mainly biology, because I know that you've spent quite a lot of time looking at hormones

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 as a mode of activating our own body's mechanisms.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Yeah, my dissertation was on the effects of hormones on oxidative metabolism

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 in relation to aging of the reproductive system.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Right. Okay. Good.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Well, I know that there are people that I've mentioned at the beginning of the show here.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 We've been talking about, amongst other things, hair loss and the mechanism behind hair loss.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 I think some of the guys that are listening to the show probably have more interest in this than the women.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 But that's not to say that some women may not have some -- is pricked at the sound of hair, hair growth, I think.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And that's also something that we're going to cover.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 I know that there is a small subsection of females who do develop what they call "hirsutism,"

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 and it's certainly hormone-driven.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 And we'll certainly be very keen to hear what your take on hair loss, perhaps, as a starting point for the guys would be,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 the kind of mechanism behind it.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 How do you understand hair loss?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Because I know they mention male pattern baldness and genetics, et cetera,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 as being entrenched in the impossible to deal with.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 And I know that the cosmetic surgery -- people do things like hair transplants for thousands and thousands.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 And I also know that the head of the dermatology department in Whips Cross Hospital in London,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 when we were training, he was completely convinced that male pattern baldness was caused by a sensitivity to testosterone,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 or the DHT, the more potent form of testosterone.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 So, Dr. Peat, how can you explain to our listeners and us tonight why males develop a male pattern baldness,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 and is it due to testosterone?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 I think the belief in testosterone as the cause is similar to the old belief that males got prostate cancer because of having testosterone.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 And sometimes males get a particular kind of baldness.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 It's easy to blame it on testosterone, but, in fact, there's no evidence showing that excess testosterone is responsible for it any more than excess testosterone causes prostate cancer.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 That's where the idea of increased sensitivity came in, because there was no evidence of too much of the hormone.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 He did say that when they measured the blood levels of men with lots of hair and men with no hair at all on their head,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 the levels of testosterone were not important, so the best they could come up with is that their cells had a sensitivity to testosterone.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Yeah, that sort of fills in for a lack of evidence.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 When you look at the actual hormone situation of people with lots of hair on their head and with not much,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 what you see is an excess of prolactin and cortisol in the people losing their hair, both men and women.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 When you look at the effect of testosterone on the growth of the hair shaft, the higher testosterone makes it grow thicker and faster,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 and prolactin tends to cause it to fall out.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 In chickens and other birds, it's known as the molting hormone.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 In humans, it's the milk-producing hormone, largely, but it also regulates practically every other cell in the body.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 It has that analogous function of terminating the growth cycle of the hair shaft.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Cortisol and prolactin both rise during stress.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 For a long time, people have been noticing the association of baldness with heart disease and also with a crease in the earlobe.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Both of those have been challenged repeatedly, but there is clear evidence that they are associated.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 What links those is also connected to prolactin and high cortisol,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 which is the low energy production, a thyroid deficiency tendency, letting the metabolism of cholesterol go down more towards increased cortisol

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 and less towards progesterone and testosterone and DHEA, things that do promote hair growth.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 If men who are suffering from baldness were to have their blood levels checked,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 do you think they would see a higher than normal level of prolactin in their blood?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Although, we don't need to talk about the levels of prolactin as far as the labs are concerned.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 It for sure wouldn't be likely to be higher than normal on the current lab standards for normal

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 because they've increased the upper edge probably because of so much exposure of the population to estrogen,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 which increases the production of prolactin.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Estrogen itself terminates the growth of hair.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 But didn't you say that when they did actual studies for prolactin or pituitary tumors or tumors in which prolactin was elevated,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 they found an ideal range for a female and a male?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Maybe we can discuss those.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Yeah.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Back in the '70s, after the wave of pituitary tumors resulting from the high estrogen birth control pills,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 they found that the healthy range for women on the standard scale of units was around 12,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 somewhere maybe as high as 15, and for men was about 4 to 7.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 And they've now raised the upper limit for men to -- sometimes they say it's as high as 20 and for women as high as 30.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 But all the men I've talked to who had close to 20, even though they were said to be normal,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 they all had developing breasts, gynecomastia.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 So they obviously had -- at 20, it might have been within the normal range that that laboratory stated,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 but if they're developing breasts, then they obviously have far too much prolactin for a man to have.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Yeah.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 And fertility is best when a man has 4 to 7.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 Just getting back to developing breasts, the term is gynecomastia, correct?

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 And in beer drinkers, excessive -- well, not excessive, but drinkers of beer that drink very hoppy beer,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 so beer that has an extreme fusion of hops, gynecomastia is not an uncommon sight.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 I know in some British pubs, maybe, where people are drinking lots of hoppy beer in the southeast,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 I know they grow hops still in quite large amounts.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 It's not only the phytoestrogens from the hops, but the yeast that all of the alcoholic drinks require.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 The yeast produces estradiol, the powerful human hormone, as their own reproductive hormone.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Interestingly enough, hop extract is the latest miticide for the bee industry.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 The brand-new thing is called HopGuard, and somehow it kills mites but not bees.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 I wonder if there's an anti-parasitic compound besides the estrogenic resin that's in hops.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Well, and also hops pickers are known -- are notoriously --

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 The female hop pickers.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Yeah, are notoriously known to stop menstruating because it's such a high level of hormone that they get exposed to through their skin,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 and that's a similar situation we have in Humboldt County with people being exposed to clipping

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 and having the resin go through their skin because hops and cannabis are in the same plant family.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And both of those hormones in beer and less in most of the wines but alcoholic drinks in general,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 with the estrogen from the yeast at least, will stimulate the adrenals to produce both estrogen and cortisol,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 and all kinds of estrogen increase the cortisol exposure.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 And so the cortisol makes the big belly, and the estrogens, among other things, contribute to breast growth.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Now, what about -- I know I'm diverging a little bit on some of the subjects I wanted to ask you questions about this evening,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 but it's coming from the same kind of route.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 What about the oral contraceptive pill and its massive exposure, if you like, to the public through urine

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 and regular drinking water, given that so many women eat on the OCP?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Do you think that that's a credible source of estrogens in the environment?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Oh, sure.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 You can identify the specific type of estrogen and progestin from the pills going right through the sewer processing plants,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 right into the rivers and causing fish, muskrats, anything that lives in the rivers getting the sewage from cities,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 they're being feminized.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Is there any type of filter that takes out those estrogenic compounds that could be coming from urine of females using the oral contraceptive pill?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 No, nothing practical that's in use.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
 So nothing like carbon, yeah.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Activated carbon?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Well, yeah, if you're going to drink the water, you should run it over activated carbon.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 But, I mean, wouldn't activated carbon be a fairly cheap way for sewage plants to process water?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 I guess maybe not.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 No.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 No, okay.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 The ozone is probably the cheapest, best thing because it breaks down chemicals like that.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 I think Paris has been doing that for 40 years or so.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 Okay.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 All right.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Well, let's let the listeners know what we're all about here.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 We've got Dr. Raymond Peat on the line with us, joining us live on this month's AskURib.com.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 The number here to call from about 730 onwards is 923-3911, or if you live outside the area, you want to call an 800 number.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 That's 800-568-3723.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 Dr. Peat, about the connection between hair loss and the hormones, you mentioned cortisol and prolactin being two hormones that would decrease hair growth.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And these are stress hormones, correct?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 Yeah, they go up with stress in different proportions.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 The classical stress hormone is cortisol, but prolactin responds to different kinds of stress.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 For example, anything that blocks your thyroid function and energy production tends to increase prolactin.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 At the same time, it increases the thyroid-stimulating hormone.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Those are both turned on by serotonin.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 I know I've heard you speak many times about the innate energy level within an organism being responsible for keeping it in a state of good health and cellular repair and regeneration.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 I know you mentioned a lot thyroid as being the body's natural hormone of energy and driving cellular respiration and repair, etc.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 The link between cortisol as a stress hormone and prolactin with hair loss and the opposing hormone, which I know you're also very well published about, is progesterone.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 When your thyroid is low or other factors such as cholesterol, if cholesterol is below average and if you're deficient in vitamin A, then you can't efficiently turn cholesterol into progesterone and the other anti-stress hormones.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 And the emergency anti-stress hormone is cortisol.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 So, if you lower your cholesterol with a drug, that's going to force you to increase reliance on cortisol.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 That will have all the degenerative effects including interference with hair growth.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 This is some of the reason why the lipid, the statin drugs, some of which have been recalled because of degenerative effects.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Yes. The thing that has got the most attention is breakdown of muscle tissue, causing bleeding in the urine and pain in the muscles.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 But when you poison the production of cholesterol, you're also poisoning the coenzyme Q10 and many other metabolic systems as well as cholesterol.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 I know you've mentioned a lot about cholesterol being the good guy and it's kind of counterintuitive or counterbrainwashing, I think, for some sections of society who want to tell us that our cholesterol should be a certain level.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 I know you're an advocate of having a reasonably good level of cholesterol because it's such an important building block for the steroid hormone production.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 Yes. The Framingham study at one point found that people over 50 who don't have at least 200 mg of cholesterol are much more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 It's brain protective to have over 200, if other things being equal.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 If you're over the age of 50, right?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Yes. And thyroid will lower cholesterol naturally, but it does by producing more of the protective hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone and DHEA.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 So it uses up the cholesterol to manufacture those hormones.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 So if you naturally have below 200 cholesterol because your thyroid is good and all of your nutrients are adequate, then that's fine.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 So can we talk about some practical applications of what some people could go buy at the health food store and rub on their head to help the hair grow back, Dr. Peet?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 Okay, here we go.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Vitamin D happens to be closely involved in hair development. Calcium, getting enough calcium in your diet.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 How does the vitamin D work, Dr. Peet?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Well, they call it the vitamin D receptor, but it's a regulatory material in practically every cell in the body, bones and hair both.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 The receptor itself, even without the vitamin D, is involved in regenerating, making stem cells that will produce new hairs.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 And a couple of groups have discovered that if you inhibit the parathyroid hormone, you can increase hair growth.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 The natural inhibitors of the parathyroid hormone are vitamin D and calcium are the main ones.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 Parathyroid is an inflammatory?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Yeah, it turns on, it interrupts the use of oxygen, so it's really kind of a paradigm of an antithyroid function.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 Thyroid makes you able to use oxygen and the parathyroid hormone can do some useful things,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 such as shocking your bones into producing more cartilage, stem cells and capillaries simply by interfering with oxygen production.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 For a moment, that shock of oxygen deprivation stimulates a regenerative process,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 but if you keep your parathyroid hormone up continuously, then you destroy the bone because it doesn't have enough energy to go ahead and build bone.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 So it's like a stress hormone for the immediate or the very short term, like cortisol, it uses, it mobilizes nutrients,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 it helps you get through that stressful period, but in the long term, it's very detrimental.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Yeah, it's the same principle where you get a shock of parathyroid hormone that starts up the bone growth.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 It's similar to what happens with an injury.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Sometimes people have a cut on their scalp and they'll get hair growing around the scar.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 Two or three years ago, an old man fell with his head in the fireplace and got a severe burn on his scalp and grew a whole head of hair.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 That's the result of the injury, but you don't want to rely on either injury or parathyroid hormone.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Okay, so people can make sure to be getting lots of calcium, up to 2,000 milligrams a day.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 Of course, dairy is quite high in calcium, but also to bring in some herbs here, nettle tea is high in a lot of different minerals,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 and vitamin D is freely available from the sunshine this time of year.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 So what else, Dr. Peet, would you recommend for male pattern, or let's not call it that, just regular male hair loss?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 Vitamin A intake is another thing that helps hold down parathyroid hormone and adequate thyroid,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 so you want to avoid everything that suppresses thyroid function, such as polyunsaturated fats.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 All the vegetable oils and get plenty of coconut oil.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 And vitamin A is found in liver, right?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 Liver and eggs.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 And there's beta carotene found in lots of vegetables, but that conversion process does rely on the liver,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 and if your thyroid is suboptimal, then that conversion process will probably not happen as ideally as you'd want it to.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 And in the last couple of years, some people have found that topical thyroid hormone, the active T3 part of it,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 applied to the skin stimulates regeneration and renewal.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 And caffeine, which has some overlapping effects with thyroid hormone,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 caffeine is now being added to lotions and ointments and such to renew hair growth,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 and it's a very cheap application.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 I think they still sell no-dose caffeine pills.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 I haven't seen them for years.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Well, would coffee or tea work just as well if you made an infusion of that and then dap that on your head?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 I suppose.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 You don't think so?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 I think we're talking about --

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Yeah, I'm sure the caffeine would work, but it's cleaner.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 And then also you had mentioned to us earlier about making an oil rub for your head with natural progesterone, DHEA, and olive oil.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 Yeah, those are things that regenerate many skin functions, including hair growth.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 So if you took a little bit of olive oil and 25 milligrams of DHEA and about 50 milligrams of natural progesterone

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 and you mix that all together, that would last you for about a week?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Yeah.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 I've seen several people do it.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 If you have some hair to start with that's kind of a sticky, oily mess,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 put it on your scalp every day, that's why caffeine is a neater thing because you can't see it or smell it or feel it.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Caffeine is freely available as a pharmaceutical, correct?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Yeah.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 And what's the dosage for the caffeine?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Yeah, what's the dosage for the caffeine?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Oh, I don't think anyone has really worked that out, but it isn't terribly soluble in water.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 So if you get too much, it itches.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 So it's just whatever is comfortable.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Okay.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 All right.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 Well, I think we have a caller on the line anyway, so let's take our first caller.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 You're on the air?

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Hi.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 So I guess my line would be I'm not going bald.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 I'm molting in preparation for my refreshed head of hair.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 There you go.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Are you going to try this out?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 Well, I'm just wondering on that.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 You know, you talk about estrogenics from plants, and I'm wondering if in nature's balance there are testosteronics in plants that would provide that.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 And related to that, the yohimbine plant, and yohimbine, if that's a hormone or how it works, it's actually recognized as the only aphrodisiac,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 yet the FDA says that it has no applicable uses, hence my definition of the FDA, which I can't say on the air.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 But if you could address the yohimbine and yohimbine and if there are any natural testosteroneics which may be useful or avoided in certain situations.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Thank you very much for the program.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 Okay.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 You're welcome.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Well, Dr. Peet, do you have anything to share on this?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 I don't know of any plants that have a testosterone-like action.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 There could be some, but I've never run into either progesterone or testosterone in a practical sense in plants.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 There are some chemicals that test like progesterone in plants, but I've never seen an actual biological effect from them.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 Do you think the mechanism of nettle root on --

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 But that's just lowering estrogen.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Yeah, but it's not specifically --

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 It's not specifically testosterone-ogenic, but I thought it had a -- yeah, maybe that's a blocking action.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 And sophametol, that's similar to pregnenolone, but it's not -- so, I mean, that would help with --

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 men notice an increase in their testosterone, but I think it's just because it's helping increase pregnenolone.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Yeah, and pregnenolone blocks the stress hormones, primarily turning off excess cortisol production.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 But when you block the stress reaction, you also prevent overproduction of estrogens.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 So, it can leave your own testosterone unopposed.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Do you have any experience with yoghim bean, perhaps, as a --

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 No, and I don't know much about it.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 Just I've read many articles, but I don't really understand it.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Okay, because as much as I just -- it's an alkaloid that's supposedly the aphrodisiac portion.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Anyway, we have another caller on the line, so let's take the caller.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Actually, they wanted me to do the question, and, you know, I'll do it if it's simple.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 But if it's not simple, then, I mean, you're always going to have better success asking Dr. Pete yourself.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 But -- so, we have a female, ex-bulimic, who got over bulimia about a year ago or so

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 and started experiencing hair loss as soon as she got over the bulimia

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 and would like some nutritional suggestions, and there's another call, so I've got to get to that.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 So, Dr. Pete, what's your take on bulimia and post-bulimic hair loss?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 I suspect it led to hypothyroidism.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 Okay.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 There's usually high prolactin and high serotonin during those appetite disturbances.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Right.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 So, it probably was starting because of hypothyroidism, but at a certain point,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 then your hair can start falling when your thyroid is really low and the stress hormones high.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Right, right, because the stress hormones are definitely going to be high in that kind of situation.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 Yeah.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 All right, well, I see the lights are flashing, so, okay, we don't -- the engineer is shaking his head.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Okay, so, all right.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 So, so far as the hair loss then is concerned, one of those suggestions was DHEA and progesterone

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 and/or caffeine as a USP, pharmaceutical-grade caffeine.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 Oh, he mentioned some caffeine pills.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 I've never heard of them that you can buy at the drugstore.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 It was Nodo's brand.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Nodo's brand, okay.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Okay, they still sell them, do they?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 Okay, maybe not.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 All right, and then --

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Aspirin is another thing that has some antistress pro-hair action.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 Well, I'd like to spend some time talking about female -- unwanted female hair growth --

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Right, that's the other --

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 -- and female hair loss, because it's slightly different, but it's some of the same hormones.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 So, Dr. Peet, when women have a lot of facial hair or mustache or even if it's on their chin or cheek,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 what's going on there with their hormones?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 The androgens usually are up, but prolactin excess, the difference seems to be whether the prolactin is steadily high

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 or whether it surges very high, but both hirsutism and hair loss are associated with high prolactin.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 And the thyroid supplement is a very reliable way to control prolactin in most women.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Vitamin A and calcium also help to inhibit excess prolactin.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 And from a herbal point of view, vitex blocks prolactin, vitex chase tree berry.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 And also progesterone would help with blocking some of those high androgens that are promoting the hair growth in women.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Yeah, and the thyroid will -- if you have enough cholesterol, the thyroid will increase your progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Okay. How about graying hair?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 You most commonly see that as a sign of aging, but not necessarily so, huh?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 Yeah, I've seen DHEA corrected pretty quickly, but the enzyme that creates the melanin pigment uses copper as a catalyst.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 And probably the best food for increasing your copper while decreasing the iron, which competes against the copper, is shellfish.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Shrimp, clam, lobster, crab, squid, all of those have a high copper content, not an excessive iron.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 And I think contrary to popular opinion about shellfish, they're actually lower on the food chain,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 so they're lower in heavy metals and other contaminants than fish are.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 And I just -- from a personal note, since I started eating a serving of shellfish once a week three years ago,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 I haven't noticed any new gray hair starting.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 The same ones that had already started, unfortunately, when I was 30, are still there.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 They haven't reversed, but I haven't noticed it continuing to spread.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 So it does work making sure you get your copper intake balanced, and if in the form of shellfish, it's quite balanced.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Since iron accumulates with aging, if a person is going to eat foods that are very high in iron, such as meat or liver,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 I think it's helpful in the long run to have some coffee right at the same time you're having the meat,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 so that you don't absorb all of the iron.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Iron is quite a damaging ion itself, isn't it?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 It's very pro-inflammatory and oxidative.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Yeah, it attacks -- interacts with the polyunsaturated fats, and it tends to increase your serotonin.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 Now, isn't that -- you've mentioned, is it lipofuscin?

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Oh, yeah, it's formed by the oxidation, chronically, of polyunsaturated fats interacting with iron and estrogen are the main --

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 And estrogen.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Yeah.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Right.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 And are there -- just for our vegetarian listeners, are there vegetables that are particularly high in copper or a vegetable source or --

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 None that I know of.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Right.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 What about any -- eggs?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 Do eggs have any copper in them?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Not enough to --

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 To count?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 To count for --

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 What about seaweed?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 Does it have any -- do you think seaweed would have any copper?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 I would -- I would think so.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 Yeah, but you would probably get a toxic amount of iodine if you were drinking that much seaweed.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Lead and heavy metals and too much of that?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 Yeah.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 The seaweed isn't very discriminatory.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 On what metals it picks up.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 Yeah.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 Okay, you're listening to "Ask Your Ob-Doctor" on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 And from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 to this month's subject of hair loss, hormones, oxidation.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 And we're going to talk a little bit about osteoporosis, I think, is probably one of the next subjects we want to just open up.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 So if you live outside the area, there's an 800 number.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 800-568-3723.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Or if you live in the area, it's 923-3911.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 923-3911.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 I'm rushing there.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 I'm sorry.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Yeah, so Dr. Peet, I'm just keen to ask you, Dr. Peet, about osteoporosis.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 I know we all hear about calcium and, you know, brittle bones and postmenopausal women being at risk of fracture.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 But what's your interpretation of the cause of osteoporosis?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 It's -- my current interest in it is that it's a good way to conceive the unified nature of aging processes

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 because everyone's bones get thinner with aging and it corresponds pretty well to the loss of muscle tissue with aging.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 Right.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 And generally, it corresponds to the calcification of soft tissues that shouldn't have calcium.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Right.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 And the excitatory processes of all of the inflammatory and nervous activity, muscle cramping and so on,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 all of these things are associated with the misapplication of calcium, failing to put it in the bones.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 And all of that is under the control of energy metabolism.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 So something going wrong with your thyroid and oxidative metabolism,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 the parathyroid lactic acid producing kind of metabolism tends to replace it and cause the stress, atrophy, shrinking of the tissues.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 Right.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 So it's more of an error of calcium metabolism.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 So in terms of correcting some -- because I know you're very big on natural sources of calcium

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 and the calcium recommendations that you've mentioned in the past may to some people perhaps seem high,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 but certainly prove very useful for people with conditions related to calcium decrease.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 So what kind of calcium intake do you think is reasonable for people,

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
 especially those people approaching an age where, you know, 50 or whatever their --

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 The Maasai people and other cattle raising people in Eastern Africa often get 5,000 milligrams of calcium a day for a long period of time.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
 Okay.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 And this is all from milk.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 Yeah.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 Yeah.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 There's been a lot of publicity in the last few months about calcium supplements not being very helpful.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 And the most popular form of calcium supplement medically has been either calcium gluconate or calcium --

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
 I guess gluconate is probably the most popular.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 Or citrate.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Citrate, yeah.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 Citric acid itself causes you to lose calcium in your urine.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 Lactate is another popular supplement.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 All of those have their anti-calcification effect, causing you to lose calcium or misplace it.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 And here they advertise that calcium citrate is the only absorbable form for menopausal women,

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 and you're saying that it actually inhibits some of the absorption of the calcium?

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 It activates the loss of calcium in urine, where carbonate isn't quite as soluble if you don't have a lot of acid,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 but eventually all the way down your intestine it has a chance to absorb.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 So it's a very effective but safe supplement because the carbonic acid, the carbon dioxide,

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 is the form that stimulates bone formation rather than breaking down the bone.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 And a really easy way to get an adequate level if you don't drink dairy or drink milk or eat cheese

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 is to do eggshell powder for calcium carbonate,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
 where a quart of milk has about 1,000 milligrams of calcium.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 Am I correct, Dr. Peet?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 Yeah, 1,000 to 1,200.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
 1,000 to 1,200.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 And if you have a quarter teaspoon of finely ground eggshell powder,

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 if you take that three times a day with your meals so that your acid level is adequate,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 that's providing around 2,000 milligrams of calcium.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 And that quarter teaspoon is smaller than most calcium pills you swallow.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 And there have been chemical analyses of comparing eggshells to the commercial calcium supplements,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 and they find that the lowest concentration of toxic heavy metals is in eggshells.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 Oyster shells are the next cleanest, but even they have slightly more of the toxic heavy metals.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 Because naturally as mammals we accumulate heavy metals and things we want out of our circulation in our bones,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 and so if you're taking a calcium supplement that's from an animal's bones,

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 then you could essentially be poisoning yourself.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 Is this correct, Dr. Peet?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 Yeah, old cows are sometimes used to make the bone meal, and their lead content is really high.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
 Okay. All right.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 So calcium in the form of eggshells is an excellent supplement for combating osteoporosis.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 For those people who don't want to drink milk,

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 because milk has the protein and the sugar that helps with bone production as well as the calcium.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:06.000
 And aspirin, people seldom talk about it, but aspirin improves calcium retention in bones,

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 and it isn't as profitable as an osteoporosis drug as bisphosphonates and such things,

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 but it's very safe as long as you take vitamin K along with it.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 And vitamin K, it happens to be a pretty expensive vitamin,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 but it is right at the center of the regulation of calcium.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 It protects your arteries from calcification, and it allows the bone to use carbon dioxide.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 It carboxylates the proteins that bind calcium into the bone.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 So you're protecting your arteries and building your bones when you have adequate vitamin K.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 And both aspirin and vitamin K are known practical bone-building supplements.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 Do you have any recommendations for food sources for vitamin K?

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 Kale is the vegetable that's richest in it, I think, and liver is a very rich source.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 Okay, so do you know, for example, how much kale someone would use to get the equivalent vitamin K

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 in order to be able to use aspirins safely?

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 Oh, I think every other day a serving of well-cooked kale will give enough vitamin K.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 But the Japanese have treated osteoporosis and hardening of the arteries

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 with doses of vitamin K that were 500 times the normal dietary requirement.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 It's safe even at those high levels.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
 Because I know you've mentioned vitamin K, a milligram of vitamin K is sufficient,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 which I know that I think Thorne Research produce a vitamin K that is one milligram per drop,

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 and that would be enough to use alongside one 325 milligram aspirin.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 And the other thing too is nettle tea has some vitamin K, besides the minerals.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 Good, okay, because calcification of the arteries is fairly common.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 We hear about it quite a lot, and this is due to aberrant calcium metabolism.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 And actually to use calcium is not the problem, because I know I hear people say,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 "Well, if I'm supposed to be doing something about my calcification,

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 then I don't want to be consuming calcium."

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 But it's actually counterintuitive, because consuming adequate amounts of calcium

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 will drive parathyroid hormone down.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:11.000
 And will deposit calcium in the correct location, not on the arterial wall.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 Dr. Peet, you still there?

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 Yes.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 Okay, I'm sorry.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 Several years ago, several people noticed that people taking psychoactive drugs

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 were getting osteoporosis.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 And the SSRI antidepressants that supposedly increase your serotonin,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 they don't reliably do that, but that's what they call them.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 We're seeing osteoporosis develop in people who had been on those for several years.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 And that led to some rethinking of bone metabolism.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 And they see that serotonin produced and coming mostly out of the intestine,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 reaching the bones as a result of inflammation in the intestine, for example,

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 or from taking a drug that increases serotonin,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 is interfering with bone metabolism and causing early quick development of osteoporosis.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 And so now a couple of groups are coming out with drugs to suppress the synthesis of serotonin

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 to cure osteoporosis.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 Excellent.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 Well, Dr. Peet, I'm going to have to cut you short there

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 and just make sure that people get your information in the next couple of minutes that we have left here.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 So thank you so much for joining us again.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 We really appreciate your time and your expertise.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 Okay, thank you.

 We appreciate your support.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 Okay, so Dr. Raymond Peet has a very good website with lots of reference,

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 published scientific articles and references for all the statements that he makes.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 So his website address is www.raypeat.com.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 So go there, have a look at his website, look at his articles, some very interesting articles,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 and some lots of perhaps counterintuitive for today,

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 but that's a good thing because what we know today is not necessarily the right thing.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 Thank you for all those people that have tuned in to the show.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:31.000
