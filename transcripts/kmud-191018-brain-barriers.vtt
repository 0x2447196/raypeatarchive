00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.880
 - Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Ab Doctor.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.480
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.480
 This is the October 2019 broadcast.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.840
 For the last 10 years,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.920
 I think it's actually been just over 10 years,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.960
 we've been doing our monthly, 7 till 8 p.m., call-in.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.640
 Given the loose topic of alternative holistic medicine

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.320
 with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.860
 Now, for those of you who've never heard him,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.640
 we'll be introducing Dr. Peat in a moment.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.240
 For those of you who do know him

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.720
 and have read his articles, his newsletters,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.920
 the books that he's written,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.480
 or if you've been fortunate enough to attend

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.100
 any of the lectures that he's given after graduating,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.520
 you'll understand that he is a pretty deep thinker.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.680
 Over the last 10 years, we've covered a wide range of topics

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.680
 on health, alternative health, biosciences,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.400
 and all those subjects around it.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.080
 And Dr. Peat has a pretty broad education,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 background understanding of physiological processes.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.360
 And we're very fortunate to have his input on the show.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 The lines are open, it's a live call-in show

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
 from 7.30 till 8.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.480
 People are invited to call in with any questions

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.320
 related to the continuing topic of false narratives,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.900
 misconceptions about things.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.320
 We're told are one way,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.640
 but actually when we look at the science,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 they're actually not.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 And a continuing part of Dr. Peat's writing

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.040
 were his newsletters on serotonin.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.360
 The number, if you'd like to call in after 7.30,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.360
 it's 707-923-3911.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.620
 Once again, 707-923-3911.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.260
 My background has been in herbal medicine.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.260
 I graduated in 1999 and have since practiced herbal medicine

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.420
 and researched and developed best methods.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.180
 And in the last 10 years,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.060
 I've been working with Dr. Peat,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.340
 getting his input on challenging cases

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.340
 and other cases that were largely not responding.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.300
 But I think in retrospect now,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.540
 certain elements of an approach to that

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.700
 were missing at the time.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 And myself, like many other people

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.580
 who did a mainstream medical herbal medicine education

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.220
 in England, pretty much got the facts

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.420
 presented to them erroneously.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.680
 And not all of it erroneously,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.500
 but a lot of fairly pivotal and foundational

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.200
 parts of physiology that are just not accurate.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.460
 So let's go ahead and introduce Dr. Peat.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.500
 Dr. Peat, you with us?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.740
 - Yes. - Hi.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.520
 Okay, thanks for joining us.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.620
 For those people who perhaps have not heard you

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.740
 or your work and your background, your life,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.740
 would you just give us a rundown

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.100
 of your academic and professional background

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.260
 before we get started?

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.420
 - My first teaching job happened to be in biology,

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.220
 but I had been studying linguistics and the humanities

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.780
 and mostly was teaching in those areas

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.660
 for about 10 years after getting my master's degree.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.220
 Then I went back to get a PhD in biology

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.220
 at University of Oregon, 1968 to '72 I was there.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.220
 And since then I've been following up on interests

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.820
 I had all through the 1960s in biology,

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.380
 brain function, and how social interaction

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.580
 and environmental influences affect our biology.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.140
 - Okay, thank you.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.980
 Just before we do get started,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.740
 can I ask the engineer if there's anything that can be done

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.060
 'cause I noticed last month,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.460
 and I think it's happened before now,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.420
 there's quite a hum on the line.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.340
 And when I listen to the audio archives,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.260
 that hum is very--

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.580
 - I can try calling them back

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.100
 and see if we get a different line.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.260
 Would you like me to try that?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.340
 - That hum's coming directly from that line

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.820
 that you're using, is it?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.660
 Yeah.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.900
 I don't know how much mileage there is in there.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.820
 I'm just wondering if there's any feedback in the studio.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.980
 - Oh, no, it's on that line.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.940
 - We'll keep going and then maybe sometime halfway through

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.620
 we can quickly swap over and see if it makes a difference.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.580
 - I can actually, do you have two lines on this number

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.420
 I'm calling, Dr. Peat?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.540
 'Cause I can try calling from one of the other studio lines

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.500
 where you're on.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.740
 Do you have call waiting?

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.060
 - No, I don't.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.700
 - Okay, well, if it gets unbearable,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.540
 we will try calling again and maybe from a different line.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.380
 - And it's also mainly with callers,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.220
 when the people call in,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.620
 it's sometimes very difficult to hear them

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.940
 'cause there's a lot of humming.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.700
 - Believe it or not, they have a harder time hearing you.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.940
 (laughing)

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.940
 - All right, well, without any further ado.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.060
 - Only the dedicated call in.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.300
 And there's a lot of them.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.220
 - Okay.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.980
 All right, well, once again, let's put that number out.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.620
 It's 707-923-3911.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.180
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, again, the kind of the misconceptions,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.260
 things that we're told are a certain way,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.900
 we find out they're not.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.940
 And it becomes ingrained in our minds and our psyche

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.260
 and people repeat it often.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.940
 The blood brain barrier.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.900
 When I was studying physiology,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.900
 I was told that the pia mater, the dura mater

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.460
 and the arachnoid mater formed those meninges

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.820
 and that the blood brain barrier existed

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.500
 to keep certain pathogens and toxins out.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.100
 Although I know things like cysts can get into the brain

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.220
 and there's certainly a pathogen.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.260
 What's your opinion?

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.580
 I know you have a very fluid,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.380
 very fluid understanding of the body and red blood cells

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.620
 and how they definitely move around a lot

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.060
 and how communication is just not the way you'd read it

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.260
 in a normal 21st century physiology text.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.500
 But how do you understand the blood brain barrier

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.420
 and its function?

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.900
 - It relates to the general idea

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.900
 of integrity of tissue and cells.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.460
 And when something goes wrong with a tissue,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.460
 an energy failure, for example,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.380
 any tissue loses its barrier function or integrity

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.140
 and things that are inside leak out,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.860
 things that are outside can get in.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.860
 And different tissues are composed of different degrees

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.340
 of fatty material and proteins,

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.340
 but every cell, when it's in a highly energized state,

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.060
 the whole cytoplasm has a fat loving property,

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.380
 a hydrophobic property.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:50.140
 The idea of a membrane barrier on the surface of a cell

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:57.620
 is really a myth.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.620
 Gilbert Ling spent 40, 50 years disproving that myth.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.300
 That it's really the structure of the cytoplasm

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.540
 that creates a barrier between any cells

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.180
 inside and that's outside.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.980
 And Russian researchers in the middle of the last century

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.460
 showed that the energy level of the cell

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.980
 is what governs its barrier function.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.980
 A high energy state, the cell has a lipid loving quality.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.820
 Takes up fat easily.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.060
 And when it's de-energized,

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.580
 a water soluble dye will leak in it.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.540
 That has been demonstrated for more than 100 years

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.380
 on simple organisms as well as tissue culture.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.340
 So it's really an old idea.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.340
 But about 50 years ago, someone demonstrated in rats

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.460
 that the lipid loving quality of the brain

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.540
 is what governs the so-called barrier function.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.540
 The brain has to live at a very high energy state.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.080
 And in that high energy state,

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.660
 it's more hydrophobic or fat loving.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.700
 These researchers put an emulsion of,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.700
 I think it was soy oil, into the carotid artery of a rat

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.420
 and then measured the content of the blood coming out

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.240
 of the vein draining the brain.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.140
 And they found that on a single pass through the brain,

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.780
 17% of this fat was taken up from the blood.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.460
 And if you imagine that when you're under stress,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.500
 your blood becomes loaded with unbound fatty acids,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:10.980
 free fatty acids that travel on the albumin in the blood.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:18.140
 And hormones as well as free fatty acids

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.780
 travel on the albumin.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.900
 And when you're under stress,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.900
 the increased free fatty acids will displace those hormones.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:34.300
 And the albumin delivers large amounts of free fatty acids

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:43.660
 or fat soluble hormones to the capillaries

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.080
 serving the brain.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.180
 And the fact that the fat solubility

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.820
 is what governs the entry,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.500
 that was well established,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.780
 but people still resisted the idea

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:10.500
 that hormones could freely get into the brain

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.500
 without having a special transporter.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.540
 But as long as they're able to be carried on albumin,

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.760
 albumin can deliver its burden right into the brain.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.980
 And the water solubility of tryptophan

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.420
 has been one of the arguments that people insist

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:41.340
 that the huge amount of tryptophan produced in your intestine

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.620
 and carried on your platelets can't get into the brain

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.140
 to influence your behavior.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.140
 Even though when people had a tumor,

00:11:52.140 --> 00:12:00.420
 the carcinoid tumor, I think it was called,

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:07.780
 that produces huge amounts of serotonin,

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:13.460
 they were characteristically having emotional turmoil.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.480
 There would be a surge of serotonin

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 and their skin would show vasoconstriction

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.360
 and vasodilation alternating,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.740
 and their emotions would have extremes of ups and downs

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.540
 that went with these surges of serotonin.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.560
 So there's a good medical history

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.700
 of the effect of intestinal serotonin

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.560
 getting into the brain.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.560
 And serotonin itself powerfully breaks down barriers,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:53.000
 including the blood-brain barrier, so-called.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.420
 The lungs and the brain happen to be the best equipped

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:05.160
 with enzymes that destroy serotonin.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.220
 Monoamine oxidase is very concentrated in these capillaries.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:17.180
 So normally when the blood passes through the lungs,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:22.960
 it happens that the surge of oxygen changes the pH

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.960
 and carbon dioxide content and causes serotonin

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.500
 to be released from the platelets,

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.500
 where it can be destroyed by these MAO enzymes

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.020
 in the lining of the lung.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.680
 And the same thing should happen in the brain.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:49.060
 The MAO should be detoxifying all the serotonin

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.580
 that reaches these capillaries in the brain.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:58.540
 But under the influence of a nutritional problem

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.380
 or too much stress where you're simply pouring out

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.160
 gigantic quantities of serotonin,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.460
 or when your other hormones are disturbed,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.300
 such as high estrogen, will inhibit the MAO

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:19.740
 and the capillaries fail to detoxify the serotonin.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.340
 So then the serotonin is free to enter the brain

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.940
 and disturb the brain function.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.980
 - Getting, that's a very rounded breakdown

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.380
 of all of the inherent activity

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.260
 and the problems surrounding that.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:45.100
 Does the bilipid membrane, does that exist?

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:48.100
 I mean, in terms of the hydrophobic

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.140
 and hydrophilic components of it lining up

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:57.000
 to form this kind of barrier to either water

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.060
 or fat soluble components, is that accurate?

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.460
 Or, I mean, it always kind of amazed me

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.860
 when I first started doing physiology and basic physiology

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.020
 and looking at cells and all the cells

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.040
 and the lipid membrane and looking at cholesterol.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.380
 Is that lipid membrane, is that a reality?

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:21.540
 Or is that, again, another very fluid relationship

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.960
 with the cell?

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:29.060
 - In an old medical book from the early 19th century,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.060
 I saw that the treatment for a burn or an ulcer

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:39.260
 to close up the weeping wound on the surface of the body,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.060
 they used osmic acid,

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:51.900
 osmium tetroxide solution.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.900
 And that was to create what they called a false membrane.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.420
 - Oh, like an eschar.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.500
 - Yeah, it's first use in medicine.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.340
 It was defined as to create a false membrane.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.780
 When the first electron microscopes

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.540
 started looking at cells,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.300
 they didn't find the membrane that they had theorized

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.260
 had to be there.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.380
 And meanwhile, Gilbert Ling was demonstrating

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:25.540
 the cell behaves electrically as it does

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.560
 without needing a membrane.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.780
 But within two or three years,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.220
 someone discovered that they could make use

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:41.220
 of this osmic acid false membrane creator.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.800
 And they did produce a membrane on cells.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.780
 Ever since then, they've been able to produce

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.620
 a membrane consistent with the current theories.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.660
 At first, the membrane was very thick

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.960
 to suit the theory of the time.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.960
 But as the tendency towards this lipid bilayer membrane

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:12.720
 took root, they had to adjust their membrane-making

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.260
 technology to suit this idea of a single bilayer.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.100
 - It's almost a religion.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.120
 - Yeah, when I was taking a course

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.120
 in electron microscopy, I tried out different stains,

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.200
 not just osmic tetraoxide,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.520
 and found that I could make a cell

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.440
 look like an onion membranes all the way through.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:44.320
 - Again, it's a little bit off the post here,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.520
 but talking about electron micrographs

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.720
 and just looking back in past shows that we've done,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.080
 in terms of viral inclusions,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.440
 that these things often have been shown

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.120
 to be completely fabricated,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.580
 not actually any part of any virion, for example,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.840
 when they're looking at virology,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.360
 and they show you these viruses

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.440
 that they are showing on a scanning

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.880
 electron micrograph, for example.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.440
 - Yeah, Harold Hillman, who died not long ago,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.080
 wrote some books showing how official biology

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.320
 is really all artifacts.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.480
 - Yeah, well, all right, let's stop there for a second.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.280
 Okay, so you're listening to AskUrb,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.680
 Dr. K. Mudigal, with 91.1 FM.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.080
 From 7.30 till 8 o'clock,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.360
 you're invited to call in with questions

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.120
 about this month's continuing subject of misconceptions

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.880
 and looking at serotonin inflammation

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.320
 and serotonin reuptake inhibitors

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.080
 and monoamine oxidase inhibitors,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.200
 and all of these things that we're told

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.520
 are good for you, like serotonin and melatonin,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.040
 and they're happy hormones,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.200
 and actually how the science that Dr. Peat's bringing out here,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.540
 which has been known for quite some time,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.160
 is actually showing exactly the opposite,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.720
 but it's such a deeply rooted investment

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.960
 in our consciousness that it's so difficult

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.240
 to break away from it.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.400
 Anyway, the number here, if you live in or outside

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.520
 the area, 707-923-3911.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.040
 Dr. Peat, getting back quickly to the blood-brain barrier,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.720
 you mentioned obviously that the brain

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.240
 is an extremely energy-hungry organ

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.880
 consuming a lot of glucose,

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.440
 and it's 90-something percent plus cholesterol,

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.880
 correct, of the white matter?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.760
 - I don't know what percentage,

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.600
 I was very high percent.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.840
 - Okay, what I was trying to get at, though,

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.240
 for the fact that it consumes a lot of energy,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.320
 it's lipid-rich, we've all been told,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.280
 at least in school when we're studying,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.000
 that this blood-brain barrier exists

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.320
 as some protective mechanism to keep the contents

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.040
 of the regular vascular system out of the brain.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.920
 But obviously, like I mentioned initially,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:01.120
 things like, you know, people, patients have had

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.120
 brain trepanning done to remove cystic formations

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.480
 in the brain from pigs, you know, producing,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.440
 a tapeworm, rather, producing these cysts.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.160
 Things do get by the blood-brain barrier quite regularly,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.160
 and it's not a strictly mechanical system

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.320
 that prevents the ingress or egress of certain substances.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.160
 It's actually quite fluid,

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.160
 and it very much depends on the energetic, gosh,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.320
 I don't know, the energetic reserves of the organism,

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.880
 how well-energized the cells are,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.200
 how much energy the organism has

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.440
 in terms of its ability to keep things coherent.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.400
 - And when the energy breaks down,

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.400
 you get diseases based on the excess permeability,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.320
 the breakdown of the so-called barrier.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.320
 - Right.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.840
 - Multiple sclerosis and--

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.560
 - This is when you talk about estrogen producing leakiness

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.080
 in leaking contents and excess edema,

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.560
 water, you know, uptake into cells.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.920
 - Yeah, this morning I got an email from a woman

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.920
 who experienced what the myth does to the medical practice.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:22.480
 She was found to have extremely high

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:30.280
 creatine phosphokinase, a CK or CPK enzyme in her blood,

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:37.440
 as well as a very high thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.880
 - Is that CPK, is that muscle breakdown byproduct, or?

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.880
 - Yeah, exactly, and the doctor assured her

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.640
 that the muscle leaking that large amount of enzyme

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.040
 couldn't have anything to do with hypothyroidism,

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.040
 that it must be a sign of autoimmune disease.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:05.040
 And autoimmunity is now a great medical business,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.920
 and fixing the thyroid function isn't of much interest.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.640
 But the knowledge that hypothyroidism

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:22.880
 causes muscle disease goes back 100 years easily.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.880
 It was a diagnostic basis for considering hypothyroidism

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:34.240
 if a person had swollen muscles.

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.720
 Old textbooks showed little kids

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.520
 with massively swollen muscles,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.760
 and then when they were given a thyroid hormone,

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.240
 muscles would go back to looking like little kids' muscles.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.960
 - And this would be through edema, water retention?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.760
 - Yeah, the swelling of the muscle.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.720
 And the amount of exertion that it takes

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.640
 to injure the muscle, like if you lift a barbell

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.800
 too many times, your muscle will get hot and swell up.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.280
 But if your thyroid is low, it gets hot and swells up

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.960
 with very little effort or no effort.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.360
 - That makes me think, again,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.840
 it's a little bit off the beaten track here

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.840
 for the purpose of the show's questions

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.800
 I wanted to get through to you,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.800
 but chronic wasting disease, that is an interesting

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.040
 definition of a process that they wanna say

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.840
 is prevalent in the animal population here in the States.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.280
 I know in England, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in cows,

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.440
 bovine spongiform encephalopathy,

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.920
 and that whole prion supposedly based disorder.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.600
 That again, in terms of chronic wasting,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.720
 that whole physiology there seems very much

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.800
 like a very energy wasting process.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.080
 - Yeah, the thyroid hormone is our basic anabolic hormone.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.680
 - Yeah, okay.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.960
 Okay, so do you think, I wasn't even gonna ask

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.520
 this question too, but in terms of chronic wasting disease,

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.160
 what do you think is probably the main deficit there?

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.000
 You think that's a deficit in energy production

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.760
 based on thyroid or?

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.760
 - Well, around 1960, Hans Selye was working on exactly that,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.600
 muscular dystrophy.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.600
 He could experimentally produce muscular dystrophy

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.440
 just by giving an animal serotonin.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:42.680
 And when thyroid function goes down, serotonin goes up.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:48.680
 And either removing the thyroid or giving serotonin

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.920
 or both will cause that energy failure that leads

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.120
 to a breakdown of the barrier function

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:02.120
 and leaking of substance and eventually atrophy.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.560
 - Wow, okay, well, I think we have one caller

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.140
 who's waiting in the, okay.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.960
 So it's 7.30 basically, but people listening,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.960
 if you want to call in from now to eight o'clock,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.080
 please do the number 707-923-3911.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.000
 We've got Dr. Raymond Peat joining us on the show

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.240
 and we're gonna keep covering the parts

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.720
 of his newsletter on serotonin

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.520
 and also tying this in with some of the misconceptions

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.320
 about what we've been told is positive

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.080
 and beneficial for us like serotonin and melatonin

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.400
 being happy hormones when actually they're very destructive

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.080
 and inflammatory hormones.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.160
 So yeah, number two call is 707-923-3911.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.520
 So let's get this first caller,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.600
 you're on the air call away from?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.560
 - I'm in Trinidad, California.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.120
 - Trinidad, California, welcome to the show.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.600
 What's your question?

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.800
 - My question is, is there any hope

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.320
 for getting off of the SSRI LetsaPro?

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.760
 I have been on it for 17 years.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.200
 I went on it in graduate school.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.200
 I've tried to get off it a number of times

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.240
 over four months weaning periods

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.480
 and it triggers a withdrawal, deep sadness

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.280
 that's pretty out of control.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.120
 And then most recently a symptom I've never experienced

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.760
 before which is almost like extreme highs and extreme lows.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.560
 - Yeah, Dr. Peat, okay, the lady withdrawing from SSRI

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.200
 is experiencing extreme sadness

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.160
 and the other mood related changes

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.680
 that SSRIs are supposedly indicated for in the first place.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.680
 - One of the chronic effects of serotonin promotion

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.920
 is to interfere with cellular respiration.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.400
 And that should be under the control of a thyroid

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.160
 but that gradually is depleted

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.160
 and glycolytic energy production tends to replace it.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.680
 So you have to get back to reactivate oxidative metabolism

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:19.680
 while suppressing the glycolysis and lactic acid production.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.480
 And carbon dioxide is a main regulator of metabolism.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:31.320
 It helps to keep serotonin under control,

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.760
 keep oxidation running

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.600
 and suppress the production of lactic acid.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.480
 And working on everything connected to the thyroid function

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:49.420
 will gradually wean you away from that,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.420
 that stimulation that comes from the SSRI.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.860
 - So do you think this particular person

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.540
 would be a good candidate to self-assess

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.940
 their metabolic rate, temperature and their pulses

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.340
 and then see from there whether or not

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.300
 they look like they are, excuse me,

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.980
 either low thyroid or not responding

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.340
 or the body's not responding as it would normally

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.380
 in a healthy individual from the stimuli of thyroid hormone?

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.020
 And then from there get to a place where they could

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.100
 slowly but surely use thyroid hormone

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.260
 along with adequate dietary sugars

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.100
 and withdrawal from polyunsaturates

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.700
 and all the other negative things

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.860
 that affect thyroid function to get to a place

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.820
 where they could regain their proper control

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:40.380
 of their metabolism and--

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.380
 - Yeah, vitamin D and calcium are usually helpful

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:49.100
 to get the thyroid going again.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.780
 - Okay, does that make any sense to you, Carla?

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:57.500
 - Yes, is that something that your office

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.220
 would also work with somebody on or is that--

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.900
 - Yeah, I could work with you on that for sure.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.900
 - Okay.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.580
 - You can always contact me any time, Monday through Friday.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.580
 I'll give out the information at the end of the show

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.540
 but I'm sure there's probably plenty

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.780
 that could be done for you if you've been

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.700
 struggling with this this long.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.900
 - Thank you so much, both of you.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.180
 I appreciate the time.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.620
 - I was curious about something you mentioned,

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.500
 carbon dioxide.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.660
 Could that be one reason why exercise

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.180
 improves people's mood and regular exercise

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.540
 helps because you're producing more carbon dioxide?

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.140
 - Well, you're probably producing less of it

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.060
 if you're working anaerobically exercising.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.700
 You're probably blowing off more CO2

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.420
 than you would if you didn't do that.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.340
 - Yeah, there's evidence that too much exercise

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.340
 when you get to the point of fatigue,

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.300
 serotonin is the signal that creates fatigue

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.300
 and it can lead to the chronic fatigue syndrome

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.060
 which tends to go with inflamed muscles

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.940
 and any other symptoms.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.660
 - It's probably the endorphins you're responding to

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.620
 when you say that exercise makes you feel good.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.540
 I think there's some of those endorphins

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.900
 that are naturally produced as a part of a stress response

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.740
 to exercise like that that probably dulls

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.140
 the pain of the exercise.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.700
 - And they have looked at the blood condition

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.700
 of intense, like a soccer players or marathon runners

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:34.580
 and find evidence of breakdown of the blood brain barrier

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:39.700
 in all of these very high stress athletics.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.940
 - All right, good.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:42.780
 There's two callers on the air.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.940
 So let's get these callers get going here.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.700
 So first caller, you're on the air,

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.740
 where are you from and what's your question?

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.740
 - Hi, is this me?

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.980
 - Yeah, yeah, where are you from?

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.260
 - I'm from Utah.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.580
 - Utah, okay, what's your question?

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.900
 - My question is, I've got a family member

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.580
 who has been taking prednisone,

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.180
 I think five milligrams for the past several years.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.420
 And at this point they'd like to get off of it,

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.220
 but it seems like they're reliant on it.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:18.940
 What would you suggest as a strategy to address that?

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.780
 - What were they using prednisone for?

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:28.260
 - For initially a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.540
 and pain in general.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.340
 - Dr. Peat, if somebody wants to withdraw from prednisone

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.780
 and its damaging effects, and they've been put on it

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:42.780
 because they've got either inflammatory damage or changes

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.340
 in the pain, et cetera, et cetera,

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.100
 for the reasons that they prescribe steroids,

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.660
 what would you suggest?

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.300
 - Behind the original diagnosis,

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.420
 there was probably something like a vitamin D deficiency

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.140
 or low thyroid function.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:03.140
 And so you wanna make sure that you're not forgetting

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:08.500
 what led to the original prescription of the drug.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.300
 - 'Cause the rheumatoid is just an inflammatory,

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.060
 an inflammatory arthritis.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.700
 So you'd characterize that inflammation

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.460
 as probably being related to things like serotonin,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.180
 related to just basic energy deficit.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.460
 - Serotonin is elevated in all of the autoimmune

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.940
 so-called diseases.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.700
 And so correcting the energy problem

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.700
 with calcium, vitamin D, and thyroid is usually the basis

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.700
 for getting the original symptoms corrected.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.980
 Then you can just taper off the prednisone.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.860
 - Okay, does that--

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.100
 - I see.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.860
 Is there any, how would you feel about addressing

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.140
 the prednisone use directly with something like

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.900
 pregnenolone or other hormones?

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:06.060
 - I've known several people who accidentally got addicted

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:10.220
 to a glucocorticoid such as prednisone

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.140
 who used either progesterone or pregnenolone

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.940
 to taper off and got off it in just a few weeks.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.180
 - There you go.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.340
 - Good to hear.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.180
 Thank you.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.420
 - Yeah, thank you for your call.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.500
 Okay, just to remind people here,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.540
 wanted to question Dr. Peat again

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.700
 and just bring out this whole selective serotonin

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.060
 reuptake inhibitor, just nightmare,

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.260
 poor information, bad information,

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:43.180
 very damaging in how the whole serotonin issue

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:48.180
 plays into cell inflammation and just basic destruction.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.540
 We've got another caller on the air,

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.140
 so let's get this next caller.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.460
 Caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.500
 What's your question?

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.100
 - I'm right here in Garboville,

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.220
 and I'll make this as quick as possible.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.060
 As far as I can tell what you guys are talking about,

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.220
 may key into what I'm going through.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.980
 I'm going under a lot of stress lately,

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:12.020
 and certain health things have been flaring up,

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.260
 aches and pains, various other things,

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.700
 and my mood has been pretty down.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.820
 My question is, though, is kind of anecdotal.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.580
 I've been craving a lot of milk.

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.260
 Like, middle of the night, I'll wake up feeling funky,

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.700
 and I want milk.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.900
 Or during the day, if I want something refreshing,

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.940
 I want milk.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.180
 I heard Dr. Peat say vitamin D and calcium

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:38.300
 are both essential to thyroid function,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.820
 so I'm wondering, is there a chance that

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.420
 my stressed-out state is depressing my thyroid,

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.820
 therefore my body is wanting more calcium and vitamin D?

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.660
 - Very much so, yeah.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:50.500
 Dr. Peat?

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.220
 - Yeah, almost.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:58.900
 Disregarding the cause of the stress,

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.420
 all of the stress hormones rise at night

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.940
 just because of the darkness,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.100
 but any particular stress you're having

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.340
 will just make it worse for all of the stress hormones.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:16.340
 And serotonin happens to activate every pituitary hormone,

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:22.100
 and those all rise during the night.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:29.020
 Calcium and sugar and thyroid are the three crucial things

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:36.300
 for minimizing that nocturnal rise of stress.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.820
 So basically, it sounds like my body's

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:41.940
 trying to tell me something.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.540
 - Yeah, but from a calcium and vitamin D perspective,

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.940
 the milk would definitely be a good idea.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:50.020
 And like Dr. Peat says, when your stress is rising

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.700
 during the nighttime due to the fast of not eating

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.980
 or drinking when you're asleep,

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.260
 milk's actually a very good,

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.660
 I mean, prior to bedtime, it's a very good idea

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.740
 to consume milk and/or sweet milk or custard

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.860
 or that kind of product because of the calcium content

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.220
 and in the milk, if it's fortified,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.860
 perhaps the vitamin D content in the milk.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.460
 But that's why it's so important to make sure

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.540
 you get a good source of vitamin D,

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.820
 either Carlson Labs do a 4,000 IU per drop vitamin D.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.860
 And vitamin D is just gaining more and more traction

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.340
 as a panacea for a lot of different inflammatory processes

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.100
 because of its utility in that.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.900
 - Excellent, thank you so much, guys.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.180
 - Yeah, you're welcome.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.580
 Okay, so it's 20 to eight.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.860
 The number, if you wanna call in,

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:44.860
 it's 707-923-3911, Dr. Peat expanding his understanding

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.900
 and information of things that we are all misinformed about

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:55.180
 and serotonin is his latest newsletter.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.940
 We mentioned last month, Dr. Peat,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.940
 the whole travesty surrounding the SSRIs,

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.060
 their prescription, their overprescription,

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.900
 the suicides resulting from it,

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.220
 and the complicit behavior of pharmaceutical companies,

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:13.580
 as well as political entities and government even,

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.900
 for allowing this kind of thing to go unchecked

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.460
 when actually the evidence is there

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.260
 to very much dam the product.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.700
 And how the whole misinterpretation of serotonin

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.980
 as a happy hormone, how this whole quip,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.060
 this cliche is just gripped hold of everybody.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.300
 And if you talk to anyone about serotonin or melatonin,

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.740
 they will tell you, "Oh, it improves your sleep,"

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.140
 or "It makes you feel good."

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.740
 And I found it so hard to find any information

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.660
 on the internet about serotonin being anything

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:45.060
 other than good for you that I was gonna get into it

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.740
 during this show about some of the things

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.260
 that are purported by various entities for serotonin

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.300
 and how it seems like there's absolutely nothing wrong

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.220
 with serotonin and serotonin has got the best kind

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.940
 of advertising going for it.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.180
 But we'll get into that after this next caller

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.700
 'cause we do have another caller who's called in.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.700
 So let's take this caller away from, what's your question?

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.780
 - From New York.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.620
 Can you hear me?

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.780
 - Yeah, could you speak up a little?

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.620
 I think you may be.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.540
 - Okay, I have a couple of questions.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.300
 First one, you talked about PUFA and how damaging it is,

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.780
 and particularly it accumulates with age.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.860
 And Dr. Peat, I was just wondering if it's mitigated

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.660
 by taking vitamin E since it's very hard

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.580
 to calculate how much PUFA you take in every day,

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.700
 why wouldn't you over time be taking these small amounts

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.060
 of vitamin E to further protect yourself?

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.220
 I'm just curious 'cause you don't take vitamin E, right?

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.300
 - I use it on my skin because it irritates

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.780
 my digestive system to take it orally,

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.600
 but I think it is good to take a little bit of it.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.860
 - Okay, so you're saying you do do that,

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.700
 but you do it more safely by not orally,

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.700
 but putting it on the skin.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.620
 Okay, so my concept, I got the right interpretation.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.220
 Okay, so you talked about CO2,

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.680
 I think the, somebody mentioned about running.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.780
 Couple things on that.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.620
 So when you run, assuming you're healthy,

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.220
 I think you do increase your CO2 at least initially,

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.940
 and I think you mentioned once you get to the point

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.340
 of fatigue and then you go over a level.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:30.020
 But do you agree that initially, if you don't overdo it

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.540
 and everybody's got their own limit in terms of their health

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.220
 and their capacity for exercise,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.540
 that you do increase your CO2 initially?

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.460
 Is that, do you agree with that?

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.460
 - Until you increase your lactic acid,

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.580
 and that's the first sign that you're damaging yourself.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.020
 - Okay, so I know someone who,

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.580
 the minute they finish running,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.420
 to take that risk into consideration,

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.420
 they go into a CO2 dry bath.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.420
 Does that help mitigate the risk and the damage

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.060
 that actually is underway if you push beyond the limit?

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:10.060
 - Yeah, a CO2 bath is good almost for any condition,

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:16.740
 especially if you're at the point of making lactic acid,

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.540
 it'll help to recover quickly.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.580
 - Right, okay.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.980
 And the other question I had relating to thyroid,

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.660
 you know, the test that Broterbarnes,

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.100
 I think the way Broterbarnes got into this business

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.420
 is because he had to pick a gland.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.020
 If I read his book correctly,

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.460
 and everybody else, the other glands were taken,

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.740
 so he did this.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.260
 And obviously his experience and the number of patients

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.500
 he had over time gave him a massive amount of information.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:43.780
 But there's, in my humble opinion,

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.780
 it's just an opinion, I've never met the man,

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.580
 but I think your knowledge, your depth and breadth

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:50.180
 of physiology and knowledge is just so much broader

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:54.340
 than his, and I'm just thinking that there must be

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:57.340
 a better way than the basic methods,

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.900
 that the knee and other reflexes and the temperature,

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.860
 which is kind of imperfect.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.740
 - Oh, the oxygen consumption is by far the best.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:07.740
 - Oh, sorry, which one?

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.220
 - Oxygen consumption.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:11.420
 - How do you get that one?

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:18.060
 - There might still be apparatus available on the internet,

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:22.180
 old used medical equipment for measuring the BMR.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.980
 They should cost about $200,

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.900
 because it's just an inverted tank

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.900
 and a measuring indicator for how far you make the tank sink

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:39.340
 as you breathe the oxygen out of the air

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.080
 that's holding the tank up in the water.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:48.620
 And that was used medically around the world

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.500
 for diagnosing hypothyroidism.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.460
 According to that, 30% of Americans

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.220
 were hypothyroid in 1940.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:05.220
 And if you use that apparatus now, it's more like 60%.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.860
 - I agree, and particularly if you do it by age group,

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.380
 it's even higher for old people like me.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.860
 The other question, sorry, is,

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:20.420
 if you, so the imperfect ways of diagnosing hypothyroidism,

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.960
 you know, you've gone through those pretty well,

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.180
 but, and you mentioned pulse,

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.020
 but you know, to me,

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.060
 pulse is correlated to blood pressure.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.260
 So what would you say about a person who,

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.120
 you know, you're not sure about whether they have it,

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.340
 but you know, the hypothyroid problem,

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.300
 or whether it's like minor,

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.220
 but their blood pressure is 120 over 80.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.700
 I'm just giving you, and it's always 120 over 80.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.620
 When they sit down, they measure it's 120.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.260
 You stand up, you're supposed to stand up

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.980
 to see whether it's really an accurate measurement.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.100
 And it stays around 120 over 80

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.820
 immediately after standing up.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.300
 That means the blood pressure is stable consistently.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.340
 Does that tell you anything that,

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:00.500
 since it's related to pulse,

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.740
 that might be, you know, also some information

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.020
 that would give you insight into whether or not

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.360
 someone's chronically hypothyroid?

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.740
 In my experience, that would mean very good nervous system

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:18.140
 energy regulating things.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:24.780
 But I've known a few people who can't increase their pulse,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.780
 even with exercise.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:28.820
 That's me.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.660
 I can't do that.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.480
 I can't do it.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.320
 You're right.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.140
 That's me.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.420
 I'm sorry, continue.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.260
 Well, that would be a good argument

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.740
 for measuring your oxygen consumption

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:44.740
 because you can't have any other explanation

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:50.460
 for low oxygen consumption than a need for more thyroid.

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.260
 Yeah, the reason I say this

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.700
 is 'cause I have a pulse around 60.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.420
 I can maybe get it up to 70 sometimes

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.460
 when I go to the doctor, but I'm always 120 over 80.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.100
 And I do the standup to double check it.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:00.940
 I'm always, they say,

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.260
 "Wow, your blood pressure's right on the money."

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:06.780
 Yeah, but my pulse, according, I tell this, seems low.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.580
 And they said, "No, you must be an athlete."

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.140
 It's typical.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.580
 Cholesterol is another pretty good indicator

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.420
 if you're cholesterol.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.340
 Actually, actually, one other quick story.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.000
 So the doctor told me I had like one,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.380
 no, 330 was my total cholesterol, right?

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:24.900
 I'm about 60, right?

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.300
 I go, "So I wanna put you on statins."

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.140
 I said, "Well, do you know that there's a guy

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.740
 "from Stanford who said that it's salt?"

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.060
 And I said, "No, I'm not gonna take 'em,

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.420
 "but I'll come back and see you."

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.980
 So then what I did, I took some thyroid,

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.500
 but I also increased my salt,

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.420
 and I did a lot of things that you suggest.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.300
 Came back, dropped like 100 over 150 points.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.700
 The guy was like, "Wow, that's incredible.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.180
 "Could I see you again?"

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.500
 And just to confirm it, he goes, "How did you do that?"

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.500
 (laughs)

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.420
 And literally, you've been saying this for 30 years,

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.340
 and no one wants to listen.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.080
 And I just did the basic things, nothing fancy.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.780
 And what you said is exactly correct.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.860
 Anyway, you're a legend.

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:04.620
 Thank you very much for answering my questions.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.620
 I appreciate your time.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.180
 - Okay, thank you for your call.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.780
 All right, so we got 10 minutes left here.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.300
 If you'd like to call in with questions related,

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:16.300
 or unrelated, but related to medical issues or questions,

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.380
 the number is 707-923-3911.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.700
 Dr. Raymond Peat will be with us

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.340
 for the next eight minutes or so.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.100
 So Dr. Peat, I've hardly covered anything

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.180
 that I had originally set out to ask you

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.900
 about some of these misconceptions,

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.340
 and I'm not saying that's a bad thing,

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.820
 because you've spent a long time elaborating

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.940
 on some of the answers for this,

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.540
 and we've had plenty of callers.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:42.620
 I did want to do another misconception,

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.060
 and I think next month, I'd like very much

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.480
 to carry on with the serotonin,

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:52.640
 yeah, the serotonin mistakes,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.580
 and just question you a little more

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:59.180
 about the whole tryptophan and its conversion to serotonin

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.820
 and how our diets are rich in tryptophan,

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:03.900
 whether we like it or not,

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.140
 unless we are very fastidious about it,

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.340
 and we don't produce our own tryptophan, per se,

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.700
 to be synthesized de novo.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.780
 But I'll leave that for the next month,

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.460
 'cause there's another question I wanted to ask you

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.380
 about things that we've heard,

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.860
 that it's just another example of how we get brainwashed

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.700
 into believing something that's not actually true,

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.340
 but we do actually have another caller who's called in here.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.300
 So let's take this next caller.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.380
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.580
 Where are you from, and what's your question?

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.580
 - Hi, this is a caller from Utah again.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.820
 Just had a question related to exercise.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:46.300
 So I enjoy certain types of exercise,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.220
 mostly things that you could consider as a game,

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.260
 like basketball or soccer or volleyball,

00:46:53.260 --> 00:47:00.220
 and I've noticed that those are way more fun

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.820
 than something like chess

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.820
 or something that doesn't involve exertion.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:10.300
 I'm wondering if you think that

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:14.180
 it would be probably more ideal

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.820
 if you could get that same sort of enjoyment

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.940
 from something that involves less energy expenditure,

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.700
 or if maybe the reliance on something like that

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:28.700
 is a symptom of something maybe unideal in the environment

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.420
 that kind of makes you turn to something like that?

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:35.340
 - Yeah, I think the experience of having fun

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.900
 or doing something meaningful

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.660
 powerfully overrides the toxic effects

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:45.420
 of lactic acid and serotonin

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.180
 and can push things back into shape

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:53.180
 just because that's how the organism builds itself,

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:57.740
 is doing meaningful things and having fun.

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.500
 - Gotcha, so, but on the surface,

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.820
 it doesn't really seem like a sport

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.700
 really has that much meaning to it,

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.540
 so do you think that it might be a sign

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.380
 that you should be looking for a more ideal environment

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.140
 if you do find yourself turning to things like that?

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:26.020
 - Work really should be a fun exercise,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.180
 but if you don't have experience

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.820
 in your ordinary working activities,

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:40.100
 I think it's good to have the game type of exercise.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.420
 - Okay, cool, yeah, that makes sense.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.260
 Thanks again, Dr. Peat.

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.780
 - Okay, I just wanted to interject there

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.420
 with something I read a little earlier on

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:54.420
 that mentioned that the whole learned helplessness concept,

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:58.340
 Dr. Peat talked about various animal models

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:01.220
 and the learned helplessness that they experience

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:04.660
 as a result of just giving up and it's just all too much.

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.420
 It's actually mediated by too much serotonin.

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.100
 What do you say to that, Dr. Peat?

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:14.620
 - Yeah, and it can be brought on by anything

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:19.620
 that overwhelms your self-regulation.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.500
 I think a diagnosis often creates

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:26.460
 a learned helplessness situation

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:31.460
 and the person lets their serotonin get out of control.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.180
 - Yeah, I think that's a very good point.

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.500
 I've long said for a long, long time now

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.740
 that a diagnosis is probably the worst thing

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.700
 that a person can get and I think--

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.700
 - Why do they call it a die diagnosis?

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:48.620
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:51.820
 But I often think that as organisms,

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.140
 as energetic spiritual beings that we are,

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.220
 when we get a diagnosis of something

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:59.820
 that is quote unquote terminal or just serious,

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.300
 I think it's the worst thing in the world to hear

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:07.300
 because I think energetically it just whacks you for six.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:11.420
 - And the diagnosis is almost certain to be wrong

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:16.420
 in some of its explanations and it makes you think

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:21.700
 of yourself as a machine that needs fixing.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:26.420
 - All right, well, we'll cover a little more of that

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.700
 maybe next month.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.940
 Like I said, next month I really want to,

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.540
 I want to play devil's advocate with you

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:35.940
 so far as serotonin's concerned and explore that link,

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.060
 go down the rabbit hole with serotonin

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.900
 or rather with tryptophan and its conversion into serotonin

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.940
 and how the whole industry got generated

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.500
 with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:51.100
 that prevent its breakdown to enable the serotonin

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.940
 in the membrane space there to last longer

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.820
 and to make you feel good and just to do all that good stuff

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.340
 when obviously there's a lot of research

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.020
 showing how dangerous it is.

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:03.580
 - It interacts with the antioxidant industry too.

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.820
 - Okay.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.660
 - They come together in very interesting ways.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.740
 - I bet they do, good, all right.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.220
 Well, I've got plenty more questions I want to ask you

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:12.660
 and we do still have about seven minutes.

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:15.300
 So talking about oxidants, antioxidants

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.220
 might be a good place to finish up

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.780
 questioning you this month,

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:21.700
 but to start that for next month

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.780
 and then get into the whole issue around tryptophan

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.260
 and how we can cut this out of our diet as best we can,

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.300
 but how obviously it's needed.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:34.180
 There's a certain amount of serotonin

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.580
 that is part and parcel of regulating our physiology

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.100
 because there are certain things

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:44.100
 that are implicated in serotonin's secretion

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.940
 that are quote unquote necessary.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.940
 But the other dogma then about oxidants and antioxidants,

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:56.340
 we're always told, oh, antioxidants are good for you.

00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:00.620
 They kind of mitigate the damage that oxidants cause

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.420
 and oxidation is a bad thing.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.740
 If you think about a cut apple,

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.420
 the surface of a cut apple turning brown,

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.140
 that's an oxidation reaction.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:14.180
 And so, oxidation is not a good thing, right?

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.620
 It's like rust, it's breakdown,

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:22.060
 it's a kind of a failure as it were.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:25.940
 So in terms of the antioxidant myth,

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:31.740
 have you got anything to say about oxidants and antioxidants

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:34.860
 that would better describe them

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.860
 and then maybe we might not feel quite so confused

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.860
 about the antioxidant myth that is surrounding

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:48.580
 taking antioxidants per se for health benefits?

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:53.100
 - One thing to keep in mind is that cancer cells

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:58.100
 have a very powerful intrinsic antioxidant system

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:03.500
 and what you want to do to restore health

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:08.500
 is to overcome that antioxidant system.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:13.660
 And the Down's syndrome involves probably

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:21.700
 the crucial genetic problem is a huge overdose

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:27.980
 of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase,

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.780
 a thing that is being sold in health stores.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:32.620
 - Right.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.980
 - But when you add this extra gene

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:40.980
 for the superoxide dismutase to animals or cells in culture,

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:47.100
 it creates accelerated aging as in the Down's syndrome

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:52.660
 or in Alzheimer's disease.

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:57.660
 And the normal function of superoxide,

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:05.740
 it's just an oxygen molecule with an extra electron

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:11.660
 and it seems to be the active agent

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:16.660
 in the monoamine oxidase enzyme for destroying serotonin.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:22.540
 And so the Down's syndrome platelet

00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:27.900
 is unable to destroy serotonin, unable to hold it even.

00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:33.260
 And so the person is saturated with free serotonin

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:38.700
 because the system isn't able to destroy it

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.340
 at a normal speed.

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.740
 - Interesting.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.620
 Now, they call Down's syndrome,

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.340
 it had the old name of trisomy 21, right?

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:53.260
 'Cause the gene, well, yeah, the chromosome 21,

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.620
 there was three copies and then they said,

00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:00.420
 okay, there's an extra 50% increase

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.900
 in the products derived from that chromosome

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.220
 of which the gene encoding for superoxide dismutase

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.300
 was part of it.

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.380
 But I did read, and again,

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.540
 it's kind of confused me a little bit

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:17.460
 because I also read some other kind of quote unquote,

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.300
 conflicting information about that,

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:23.540
 saying that the same chromosome also had the genes

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:28.220
 for coding beta amyloid precursors,

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:33.220
 which have been implicated in Parkinson's Alzheimer's

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:37.300
 in terms of the amyloid protein deposition there.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.540
 And also encoded for other oncogenes

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:45.100
 that cause these kind of negative metabolic processes

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.060
 in Down's patients.

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:47.900
 So--

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:52.900
 - But the amyloid protein accumulates in many conditions

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:57.380
 where you're simply hypothyroid, for example,

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.780
 or under stress.

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:03.860
 But it's possible that there are many other defects,

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:08.420
 but the spectacular one is the failure of the platelet

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:11.180
 to oxidize serotonin.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.780
 - Well, it's two minutes to,

00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:14.100
 I'm gonna have to cut you short there,

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.460
 but thanks for joining us again.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.540
 And next month we'll pick up where we left off.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.180
 I think we've got plenty to go on here

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.620
 and hopefully re-educate as we go on.

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:26.780
 So thanks so much for your time.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.260
 - Okay, thank you.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.060
 - Okay, so you've listened to Ask Your Ob Doctor,

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.020
 KMED Gallup 91.1 FM.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:36.460
 It's once a month from seven to 8 p.m.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.300
 And we take callers from 7.30 to eight.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.580
 Most people questioning Dr. P

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.700
 either about what he's talking about at the time

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.540
 or protocols they've been using,

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.220
 giving him positive feedback about that.

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.540
 As from tonight's person in New York,

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.700
 that was good to hear about his cholesterol.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.180
 Dr. Peat's been saying that for a long time

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.300
 about high cholesterol patients using thyroid

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.620
 to bring it down.

00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:00.860
 And it being a basic defect in high cholesterol

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.860
 is that most of it's due to hypothyroidism.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:08.860
 So Dr. Peat's information is found at www.raypeat.com.

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:11.940
 He's got lots of articles that he's been publishing here

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:13.860
 for several decades now.

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.140
 He's written several books

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.180
 and he's got a wealth of information.

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.340
 The shows, unfortunately,

00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:23.780
 I've got about two years worth of these shows

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:25.940
 to post on the internet on our website,

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.540
 which is westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:33.260
 I'm a graduated medical herbalist from England,

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.580
 producing herbal extracts,

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.300
 but Dr. Peat's wisdom has also guided my practice

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.740
 in seeing people.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.460
 So anyway, yeah, westernbotanicalmedicine.com,

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.660
 raypeat.com.

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:47.460
 I'll see you next month at seven o'clock,

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:48.660
 third Friday of next month.
