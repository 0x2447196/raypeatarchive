00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 It's a plant that's going to help you get rid of your stress.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 It's a plant that's going to help you get rid of your stress.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Well, welcome to this evening's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Excuse me for not having the audio track. Okay. Anyway, so thanks so much for joining us.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 As always, Dr. Peat is joining us on the show.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Tonight's subject is going to be a subject surrounding longevity and brain foods.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Dr. Peat's latest newsletter is on cognition. It's a continuing theme of his,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 and we want to bring out some of the new thoughts surrounding that.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 The number if you live in the area, there's a call-in show from 7.30 to 8 p.m.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 The number if you live in the area is 923-3911.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 If you're outside the area, there's an 800 number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Incidentally, it is also the pledge drive for the radio station.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 And just those people who are listening to the show now,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 I just want to reemphasize from my own personal perspective,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 that it's a very unique radio show which allows a very diverse range of topics.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And those topics are not always, not usually even, things that you're going to hear in the mainstream.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 So it's a very important radio show to support radio programming.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Station. Radio station.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Station to support. Thank you. And, yeah, very much appreciate any pledges that people would like to make

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 or sponsorship donations, etc.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 So we will be having a few brief interludes during the show and be talking about that.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Okay. So I think without any further delay, let's see if Dr. Peat's on the air.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Are you there with us, Dr. Peat?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 Yes. I'm here.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Oh, hi.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Just so that people who perhaps have never listened to the show or have never heard you,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 would you just give an outline of your academic and professional background before we get into tonight's subject?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 I studied humanities first largely at the University of Oregon, a year at Ohio State, some in Mexico and so on.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 But then I went to the University of Oregon for four years to study biology.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And I've been concentrating on biology now for 40 years or more.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 Okay. And I know that you're intimately involved in, for want of a better phrase, uncovering the truth behind various claims

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 and, yeah, propaganda almost from, I would think, some of the pharmaceutical and other corporations

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 with how they would market their product to us as consumers

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 and how that marketing is really not very scientific a lot of the times.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 And there is scientific evidence to show an argument to support most of what you,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 most if not all of what you write about in your newsletters.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 And just reminding people that listen to the show, Dr. Peat doesn't sell anything.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 He's very much into research.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And a lot of what you do, I know from our own experience and from people that have contacted you, is very altruistic.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 So tonight's show, like I said at the beginning here, is going to be surrounding longevity

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 and the popular sort of popularly recently exploded promulgation, if you like, of brain food, brain foods, supplements, etc.,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 nootrophics, I think they're commonly referred to now in the buzz circles.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 But looking at longevity first, we did a show a few months back and it was entitled "You Are What You Eat"

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 and I know we expanded on things that you consume can definitely affect your emotion and your psychology.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 With respect to longevity, you've written in your recent newsletter that the intestinal tract of parrots and ravens

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 contained only a few species of bacteria and this positively correlated with longevity in these species.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 The intestines being a major source of toxin and I was quite shocked when I saw it

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 because I know that ravens are carrion birds and you would think that dead and dying tissue and rotting flesh

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 would be a pretty good source of a wide range of bacteria.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 So in terms of bacterial toxins in the gut and the bacteria, what have you found about the intestinal population of bacteria?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Well, birds have a very high body temperature and so probably have extremely fast digestion

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 and ability to extract everything good from the food, taking it away from potential bacteria.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 So it's just so fast that bacteria don't have much of a chance at multiplying.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And incidentally, besides being very long-lived, those birds are extremely intelligent,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 can solve extremely complex problems very quickly.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 There's a lot of stuff on the internet, videos about birds solving problems.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 So I think the cognition and longevity go closely together.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 When you cause animals to live, to grow up their whole life free of bacteria,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 they have some advantage in stress resistance and have a somewhat increased average lifespan.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 High metabolic rate, a lot of the stuff produced by the bacteria ends up simply slowing metabolism.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 And the aging process itself right from earliest life is a process of slowing the metabolic rate.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 So things that retard that slowing should extend lifespan as well as good cognition.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 That actually reminds me of another phrase, the wear and tear.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 And the relationship between activity and running at a high metabolic rate and running out of energy and/or wearing out,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 being kind of the opposite of what we're saying here about highly increased metabolic rates

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 being actually productively beneficial for the organism in terms of clearing waste material

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 and/or processing reactions that would denature toxins or clear waste, etc.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 When I was in grade school and high school, it was common opinion that if you were very active,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 had a high metabolic rate, that you would die young.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 That always annoyed me that people had the image of a candle, the brighter it burns, the shorter its life expectancy.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Is this why a baby starts out with such a high pulse rate and is so warm and has a high metabolism

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 and then it's just aging that changes that?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Yeah, puberty especially.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 It gradually slows down. When a calf is born, for example, its fats all through its body,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 including its brain, are highly saturated because the mother has been saturating the fats from the food.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 And so it's protected from the environment.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 And as its tissues absorb the polyunsaturated fats, its metabolism slows down.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 And you can see it in the ruminants because they start life extremely free of polyunsaturates.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 But human babies are, according to some fat experts, everyone is born deficient in the essential fatty acids.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And so they advocate putting more of them in baby formula.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 But actually, those are major things in slowing metabolic rate.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 And they tend to accumulate in the brain with aging, slowing metabolism,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 especially the ability to metabolize glucose all the way to carbon dioxide so that the old or the amended brain

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 has a chronically high level of lactic acid because it has progressively lost the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 And a lot of polyunsaturated fats.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 I just find it strange that the placenta filters out the polyunsaturated fats.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Yeah, that's why babies are born with a so-called fatty acid deficiency.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 But that's a natural thing. The baby makes its brain fats out of the glucose or fructose that it's getting from the mother.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 I know it's just so strange that they say, oh, the baby has a deficiency when maybe that's how it's supposed to be.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 If that's the way it is, if the placenta filters it out, maybe the baby is not supposed to have them.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 So don't start giving your baby fish oil as soon as it's born.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Yeah, there have been experiments with rats and dogs and other animals in which the mother is given a high unsaturated fat diet or a PUFA-free diet.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 And the babies have a bigger brain and a better problem-solving ability when their mother was free of PUFA during gestation.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Okay, so the first thing then, the intestines being clean because of being a major source of toxins, definitely accumulates inflammatory degradative processes and contributes to a shorter lifespan.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 How about the manipulation of hormones then?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 And I know there was an experiment that I'd like you to bring out.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 I know we can't do it to human beings perhaps or people off the street, but a fellow called W.D. Denklas did an experiment removing the pituitary gland.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 And this was shown decisively to increase life and/or reduce the rate of aging and the hormones that are born by both the anterior and posterior pituitary.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Things that I know you've mentioned lots of in the past, things like LH, FSH, TSH, and oxytocin are also very responsible for a lot of inflammatory processes.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 He found that in general, the pituitary extract, if you injected it into an animal, slowed the ability to oxidize its glucose.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 And so he called the death hormone the oxygen blocking hormone.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 And he tried to extract a specific protein.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 It was closely related to prolactin or growth hormone, but he never did identify a single protein, probably because several pituitary hormones do have some oxygen blocking function.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Growth hormone is really an adequate model of what Denklas was looking for.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 He thought it was closer to prolactin, but that whole range of either prolactin or growth hormone can interfere with oxygen metabolism.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 And it's now widely recognized that the more growth hormone you have, the shorter your life expectancy.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 And I think doctors give patients growth hormone.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 Yeah. The famous Methuselah mouse is deficient, lacks the ability to produce growth hormone.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 And when they genetically modify mice so that they produce more than the normal amount, they're very short-lived.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 So it's just anything you can do. You don't have to do surgery on the pituitary. You can live in a way that reduces the activity of those hormones.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 For example, when you get hypoglycemia and then the stress tends to sharply decrease your blood sugar until you adapt.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 But simply an episode of hypoglycemia increases your growth hormone and that activates the whole process of changing your type of metabolism,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 blocking oxygen production, relatively the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 And it tends to increase phosphate, which is one of the things that happens under the influence of bowel toxins.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 And it's the ratio of phosphates to calcium that you've always mentioned as being important to get dietarily so that you get enough calcium in relation to phosphate

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 because the phosphate from meats, particularly muscle meats, etc., and nuts and things can be fairly damaging.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 I mean, yeah, it's now considered one of the most important toxins of kidney disease or uremic toxins.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Simply natural phosphate that everyone has circulating, but when it increases because of the hormonal metabolic problems,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 that is a typical strong sign of the aging process and the aging or anti-aging hormone or protein called classo is a very powerful regulator of the balance and handling of phosphate.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 Okay, let's hold it there for a moment, Dr. Peat, because we've got a couple of people in the studio here who've got something to share with us.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 So let's just take this next five minutes and go through this.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Thank you. This is Carrie and I'm here with Lauren, otherwise known as L-Dog.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 All right. Thanks, Lauren. And we're here to thank some people.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 We are in our pledge drive and we know a lot of people listen in from all over the place for this show.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 It's so much important health information. And KMUD to support these locally produced shows needs community support.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And if you're listening right now, you're part of the community.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 In fact, you can become a new member of KMUD and we really love that.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 We've got 20 new members this pledge drive. We're really excited about that.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Thank you, each and every one of you. And we've got some people to thank for their donations.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 And we'd like you to please consider making a pledge. You can pledge right online.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 There's a donate button right at KMUD.org where you can call 1-800-KMUD-RAD. That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Or you can call locally 707-923-3911.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 I'd like to thank Jeff over by Horse Mountain. He says thank you for the fire information.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 And Jeff, we know you've got smoke and fire really close by.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 So hope you're safe out there and thank you so much for listening to KMUD and listening for all the fire news.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 And thank you for your pledge.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 And we'd also like to thank Loris from Redway who says thanks for the fire reports and Tuesday is her favorite day.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Right. Yeah, we've got the people have favorite days here all the time.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 So thank you, Loris. And an anonymous donation. Thank you so much.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 And a friend of mine wants to do a shout out to people to please watch out for cyclists on the roads.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 We've got windy roads here and look out.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 And if you are a cyclist who needs bicycle repair, check out Humble Underground Bicycles.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 We will fix you up.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 And they're good. I bring my bike tires in there to get repaired.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 So, you know, if you make a pledge here and give us a call, you can give a shout out too.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 You hear what everyone has to say and their shout outs on KMUD.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 So thanks very much. And thanks for the show and all the important information.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 And Smoke and Moses from Myers Flat. And I'm sure Smoke and Moses knows to put your cigarette butts out.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 Don't just throw them outside because bad stuff happens.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 Right. Thank you. Smoke and Moses.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 And we have lots of thank you gifts for people.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 If you make a pledge tonight and and LDOG has a special one just this evening.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 What do you have to offer listeners tonight?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 It's perfect since it's the Herb Doctor Show.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 I have a St. John's Wort homebrew available for the next person who calls in and does the sustaining membership.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Love to hook them up. All right.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 You've got that St. John's Wort homebrew.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 It's delicious. Can I ask you how you made it?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 I made a mash and added some yeast and a little bit of magic, wand waving.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 I'm just kidding. Lots of love.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 Okay. Cool. Okay. Good. Did it change color? What color was it?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Bright red. I was wondering.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 But the St. John's Wort really brings out that red.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Yeah. Excellent. That's what you get when you infuse the flowers in a good quality saturated oil or a jojoba particularly.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Yeah. Excellent.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Great. Well, have a great rest of the show.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 We'll come back with more thank yous.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 I hope so. Please. We see the phone ringing.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 So we'll come back with more thank yous.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Absolutely. That's what it's all about.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Thanks so much for supporting the Mudd.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 Yeah. Thanks for keeping it all alive.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Okay. So carrying on with the topic of longevity and brain foods, I think actually before I start that up,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 I just wanted to mention that last month we did a little expose of two gifted young individuals who had an idea

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 and they just followed it up and did an interview with six leading alternative scientists.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 Dr. Peat was one of them.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 And they had a Kickstarter and they produced a documentary.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 And it was their goal to produce a full film all about all the some of the misleading thoughts in medicine

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 and how medicine and science has kind of gone off the straight and narrow and become fairly deranged in its beliefs.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 And Brad and Stuart, Brad and Jeremy, sorry, Jeremy, Stuart and Brad Adams,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 wanted to reach the goal of thirty five thousand dollars for their Kickstarter to enable them to get to post-production.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 And then at that point they would have a very viable and tangible film to bring to bear and would get further funding and produce it.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 Well, they smashed the thirty five thousand record and they got seventy six thousand dollars in their Kickstarter.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 So well, well done.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 OK, so Dr. Peat, I wanted to also ask now about the anti-aging effect of the proposition that diluting your blood serum or your lymph can actually increase your increase your lifespan because of removing toxins and how the kidneys themselves,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 when the kidneys fail, how they can damage bowel function.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 And I was I was wondering, is it possible that we could practically dialyze ourselves like, you know, patients go for dialysis when they're diabetic, etc.?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 What about blood letting?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Blood letting?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Aren't blood donors have an increased don't blood donors have an increased lifespan?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Well, they have a lower iron, don't they?

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 Yeah, at least a healthy lifespan.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 I'm not sure about the maximum, but they are relatively free of degenerative diseases and animal experiments have been done now for seventy five years.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 This is one of the simple dilution experiments where they took out a dog's blood, centrifuged it, threw away the liquid part, put a saline solution back into replace the red blood cells and did that repeatedly.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 So there were enough washings that the whole animals body fluids had been turned over and exchanged.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Wow.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 So a decrepit old dog, I think something close to 20 years, became frisky and really effectively rejuvenated.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 Wow. That's interesting. I mean, I guess then obviously there's no damage to the red blood cells from centrifuging them and or any other solid matter is not damaged by the G forces and it can it can be re suspended in a clean fluid.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Yeah.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Interesting.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 And the bowel toxins are always entering the blood and having to be removed by the kidneys.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 But they poison not only the kidneys, but the heart, the brain and the liver and the intestine in the process of being filtered out.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And so the blood contains some of these toxins, including the normal lactic acid and phosphate simply in excess, as well as the specific bacterial toxins.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 But also, as these toxins affect the various tissues and organs, the body produces defensive reactions and these defensive reactions, including pituitary hormones, become part of the toxic environment circulating in the fluids.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 And so the shift away from circulating renewal signals produced by the animal becomes gradually with age circulating stress signals rather than renewal signals.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 And so if you put young blood into an old animal, you're causing a slight shift back towards some of the renewal signals, but you aren't necessarily decreasing the age and stress signals.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 Wow.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 So.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 And that's very much like a bystander effect as well, right?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Yeah, it definitely is the same process that happens in the bystander effect when you injure a cell or a particular region, for example, with a beam of focused ionizing radiation x-raying your foot or hand or tooth or whatever.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 That tissue emits the signals which are the same as the aging and stress signals.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And so the radiation damage is very similar to the process of aging and the intrinsic regulatory processes. Instead of being increasing your ability to adapt, they start narrowing the way you're adapting.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 It creates a vicious circle, for example, in which something interferes with your oxidation and in reaction that leads to lactic acid production instead of carbon dioxide.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 And the lactic acid is one of the toxins that turns on the production of nitric oxide, which spreads inflammatory signals and blocks the ability to use oxygen.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 So you get a, in that case, it's a very quick feedback process in which it just gets worse and worse unless something intervenes to either stop the production of lactic acid or nitric oxide.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Okay, excellent.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 I think if you were to ask people on the streets whether nitric oxide was bad for you or good for you, I think most of them would say that it was good for you.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 It's so wrong.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 The September issue of Life Extension Magazine has an article mentioned on their cover how to increase your nitric oxide.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 And it gives a several page article describing their product that contains some very nice flavonoid compounds extracted from oranges or something.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Right.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 But the theory that they use to sell them is that they will increase your nitric oxide.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 They give two references saying that.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 And so I looked up that subject, what hesperidin does to.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Hesperidin.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Yeah.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Okay.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Nitric oxide.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 And I found, I don't know, I think it was probably 30 or 40 articles saying that these are anti-inflammatory because they block nitric oxide.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Right, right.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 So they got it.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 So people will feel better using them, but they're selling them as an increasing nitric oxide when in fact it's doing the opposite.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 Yeah.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Whoops.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 I wonder that the editor might appreciate the comment.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 Okay.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 I know someone should write to the editor of Life Extension Magazine.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Okay.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMED Galbraithville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions that are related or unrelated to this month's subject of longevity and brain foods.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 I think in the next half an hour here we'll get into some of the brain foods.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 People might have heard about them.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 People might have used them.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 I know Dr. Peat certainly knows what he's talking about and some of the sites that might support some of these brain foods, I know that he would have alternative information that I think people should be aware of.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Some of them are very innocuous.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 Some of them have a very good background.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 Some of them have a very less than scientific background.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 So brain foods I think is going to be the next thing that we'll get into.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 But if people have any questions about them or about longevity or how to approach that, 923-3911 or the 1-800 number is 1-800-KMED-RAD.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 So the subject of Neuotrophics being the word that's used to describe a product that would be an improving your cognitive ability, your mental prowess, your performance skills, etc.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 and your alertness and readiness.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 There's lots and lots out there and I'm not surprised that most people don't really understand it and probably bite the hook that's the shiniest and glossiest and fanciest hook.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 It looks like it must work because it's got such a good advertising campaign behind it.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 I wanted to explore then the subject of Neuotrophics with you Dr. Peat and ask whether you can support or refute the claims made by various manufacturers of performance and cognition improving substances as plausible or poor science.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 And I think I wanted to start with a widely known in the trade anyway compound called acetylcholine which is a neurotransmitter responsible for improving memory, learning, problem solving ability and general cognition.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 What are your thoughts on this substance?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 The current and the last 20 years popular medical approach to treating Alzheimer's disease is to try to increase the level or production or persistence of acetylcholine by blocking the enzyme that breaks it down.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 And they've demonstrated basically that it doesn't work.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And so they need a new fundamental theory but their theory is so mistaken that it's hard for them to get off onto a new line of drug treatment.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Because the acetylcholine is essential and part of our conscious regulating.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 It's needed for memory.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 All kinds of biological processes require just the right amount of acetylcholine.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 But it activates the enzyme that produces nitric oxide.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 And nitric oxide blocks energy production.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 And so the process of excitotoxicity which it made monosodium glutamate notorious because a little too much of that activates the production of a little too much acetylcholine.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 And that makes too much nitric oxide.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Nitric oxide poisons the ability to oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 So it increases lactic acid and the cell has less energy and is more excited by the acetylcholine.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 So basically it becomes susceptible to dying in proportion to the overstimulation of acetylcholine.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 And is it true that MSG can cross the blood brain barrier and cause that reaction in the brain?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 Oh sure.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 The amino acids all have to get into the brain to provide brain proteins and such.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 And it's just one of our normal amino acids but too much of it becomes toxic or too little of the other amino acids and a relative disproportion of glutamic acid.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 So arctic acid and cysteine are the other potential nerve toxins.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 So another good case in point of more is not better.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 In your opinion do you think most people have enough acetylcholine in their systems?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 Yeah actually I think the tendency with aging is to have too much.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 The shock reaction is for over a hundred years now there's been evidence that over activity of the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic nerve system produces shock.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 That it's the essential factor in shock.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And this is the system that acts primarily through acetylcholine producing nitric oxide.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Nitric oxide blocks oxygen metabolism.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 So in shock your blood stays red and full of oxygen but the tissue can't use it.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 And that happens with aging, heart failure, kidney failure, dementia, all the tissues relatively have a shock like metabolism that progresses with aging.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Do you think there's any medical benefit or interest in increasing the breakdown of acetylcholine?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Yeah there are lots of therapeutic uses of things that block the over activity of acetylcholine and accelerate its turnover.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 A rich environment increases the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 So the environmental enrichment then would encourage the breakdown of acetylcholine?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Yeah having a good life protects you against too much.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 Protects you against lots of aging problems right?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Oh what?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Having a good life protects you against lots of aging problems.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 Well you have to clarify the term good life we don't mean drinking and partying.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 No having lots of fun, reading interesting things, talking to interesting people.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Yeah and having an interesting job to do and interesting work and liking your job not because it pays you well but because you're fundamentally interested in it which is what you should always pursue in your life.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Yeah it might pay well too.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Well that's a benefit, that's a positive benefit, that's a blessing but it's not always.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 That's the opposite of learned helplessness or behavioral despair.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Most people treat their jobs with some learned helplessness.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 How can they do anything different?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 They spend all this time, well perhaps in some instances they spend all the time studying for a particular degree or whatever education and then they get into the work and find out how odious it is and decide that what can they do about it?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 I don't know.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Okay yeah learned helplessness another very interesting topic.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 I know you've spent quite a bit of time talking about learned helplessness and how that plays psychologically into physiology and how it can have definite effects on the organism in terms of decreasing its survival odds.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 That brings up another product line that is being pushed recently of the methylating agents because learned helplessness is a matter of imprinting, turning off the genes that should enliven you, increase your adaptability.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Too much methylation shuts things down, makes you helpless and that process happens progressively with aging.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Too much methylation turns off the genes of renewal.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 There are lots of products pushing the idea that we need more methylation.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 One of the main methyl donors is methionine, the amino acid and if you deprive animals of a major part, I forget the exact percentage but half or less of their normal methionine, they live 30 or 40 percent longer than they would otherwise.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 What's a common food source that's high in methionine?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 All of the high protein foods like meat.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Okay so this again another good reason to advocate the fact that muscle meats in isolation are not good for you and that balanced proteins from the whole animal with including the connective tissue and gelatin is the best way to consume a protein.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Yeah, gelatin is unique in being free of the pro-aging amino acids and another bad thing about meat is it's very high ratio of phosphate and calcium.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 And so is this similar to adventuresomeness?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 To what?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Adventuresomeness, it's a phrase that my dad's always using that he reads articles about people and cultures that have more adventuresomeness than others.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 More adventure.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 They're into adventure.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 Yeah, that's what an enriched environment gives you the opportunity to have adventure every day.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 Good, allows your brain to grow and to seek new opportunities and limitless potentials, that's what life should be all about.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Okay, there's a little one-liner I just wanted to mention here which kind of really supports the whole energy metabolism or the increased energy, increased metabolism being very pro-life.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 There's a little sentence here that was part of, I think it was part of your newsletter, Dr. Peat.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 He said that heart rate corresponding with academic standing in elderly patients improved when their pacemaker was turned up.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Yeah, they noticed that people with a faster heart rate had higher academic records and they thought maybe it was just a better brain circulation.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 People with a very slow heart rate weren't getting enough oxygen to their brain so they had patients with the adjustable pacemakers.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 And so they gave them mental tests when it was set at 70 beats per minute and then they turned up the rate to 85 beats per minute, gave them the same tests and they scored better in all types of brain function, memory, reasoning.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 And it's so popular in culture to believe that if you have a low pulse rate, you're healthy, you're fit, you're super athletic, you know, and like these people that have pulses of 50 beats a minute, they suddenly die of heart attacks.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 They're not long-lived at all and it's a complete brainwashing that low heart rate corresponds with longevity because it's the opposite.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 It's the bodybuilders that live a long time, not the long-distance runners.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 Well, maybe the bodybuilders might wear out their joints too.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Or take too many chemicals.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Or take too many chemicals.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 They're definitely the big bodybuilders you see that are all over the press and news.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Okay, so let's just, I just wanted to bring out a couple of new atrophics that are in the herb world and just see if there's any, well, I know there's a connection there, but just see the connection that there is.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Sage, believe it or not, I've always known sage to be a kind of cleansing purifier, mouthwash.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 It can be used for, you know, boggy gums that are not holding the teeth properly.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Definitely can be used for respiratory conditions.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 But sage apparently here now, there's fairly recent articles on PubMed that it has a cholinesterase inhibiting property.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 Now this is something that you mentioned earlier on with acetylcholine.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 So the enzyme that produces acetylcholine is acetylcholine esterase and salvia inhibits that.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.000
 Every plant, like every animal, has thousands of different chemicals.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 Right.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 And sage has, I'm not sure how it relates to other drug effects, but that is one of its components, actions, is to shift the balance to increased acetylcholine action.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 But two of its major terpene type chemicals are inhibitors of nitric oxide, salvia nolic acid, I think one is called.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 And the other Chinese or Japanese name, cationone, something like that.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 These are very effective inhibitors of nitric oxide.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 So they're anti-inflammatory and pro-respiratory.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 So is this why it probably has an action with reducing menopausal hot flashes?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 If it's reducing nitric oxide.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Nitric oxide does cause flushing and is connected with hot flashes.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 So I think probably the dominant effect is to lower nitric oxide for the cholinesterase inhibitors will tend to increase nitric oxide by stimulating the acetylcholine nerves.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 OK, I guess moving on to ginkgo.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Most people know ginkgo.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 It's been used for a long time in the Chinese traditional medicine system, more particularly for elderly people to improve cognitive function.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 They say that it improves blood flow to the brain, increases cerebral blood flow.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 And that would seem to be in keeping with turning up an elderly patient's pacemaker, increasing their heart rate and their cardiac output.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 But I think the vasodilating effects of the cerebral arteries is probably more the point with ginkgo.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 But I also wanted to bring out what, again, maybe miscommonly known as good when it's not, perhaps, is the link between a monoamine oxidase.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 And then ginkgo apparently decreases monoamine oxidase.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 And that increases dopamine.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 Now, I know they treat, well, unscientifically, perhaps, they might treat Alzheimer's patients with L-Dopa.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 And dopamine might be touted as a precursor here, as a product to do that with.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 But what are your thoughts on dopamine and monoamine oxidases?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 It definitely makes you feel good.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 It's sort of an upper to do anything that increases your dopamine, tends to increase adrenaline.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 Usually, and certain types of M.A.O. inhibitors will increase serotonin, too.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Those don't necessarily go with well-being.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 The brain circulation, for example, is decreased by serotonin.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 It tightens up the blood vessels, especially the veins leaving the brain.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 So if you have too much serotonin, you can get brain congestion and a migraine, for example, with the arteries opening up and the veins closing down.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 So there might be serotonin inhibitors in ginkgo.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 But I think the most important benefit of ginkgo is that it's a very good nitric oxide inhibitor.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 And also blocks platelet aggregating factor.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
 Right, it's a PF blocker, isn't it?

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 And mentioning that, it blocks prostaglandins pretty generally.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 And they're pro-inflammatory.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 Yeah.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 Yeah.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 Okay, it's 746 here on KMED Gallup 91.1 FM.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 From now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 If you have any questions about tonight's show on longevity and brain foods, numbers 9233911.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 Or if you live outside the area, there's a 1-800 toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 So to carry on with the subject of brain foods, I know we had this conversation earlier and got into a philosophical topic of the meaning or the usefulness of the determination of intelligence.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 When it comes to marketing of brain food as supposedly increasing your intelligence.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 But philosophically, in terms of what we as human beings are told by our peers and by media advertising, intelligence is not just intelligence.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 And that there's actually many different ways of looking at intelligence that can be useful if we don't believe the IQ is the only determinant.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 And if we can, you know, not do complicated mathematics in our head that if we can't do that, there's something wrong with us.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 Because intelligence itself can take on many different forms and perhaps our society just doesn't recognize or want to recognize some of those forms.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 The Wizard of Oz idea, maybe you can just go online and buy a diploma and become intelligent and qualified. It's starting to look like the mechanical idea of qualification.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 You learn certain techniques like computer programming. They can break it down into little credits and micro degrees and so on.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 And you accumulate your qualifications in terms of what the culture has to sell.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 But I think the whole idea of intelligence, it's sort of like the wear and tear idea of aging.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 It's an idea that there is a blueprint laid out for how the body develops.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 It's all determined ahead of time. And the intelligence, the IQ idea is that there are certain mental skills that an intelligent person has that you can define IQ by.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 One of the silliest kinds of IQ tests had questions that were simply stories that they had asked people at Oxford, I think it was, to interpret.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 And then they had uneducated people interpret the same story.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 The IQ test asks you to interpret these little short stories. And if you do it the way the Oxford graduate did, you have a high IQ.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 That is silly.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:10.000
 So a lot of products are being sold with the idea that if you take them, you'll become clever in these ways that will make you compete in the society.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 But if the society is set up in an irrational way, then it's not intelligent to succeed in terms that the society presents.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 That reminds me of the caste system in India.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 I read a BBC News article just the other day about a chap in India who had six degrees.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 He had a couple of master's degrees in various different subjects.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.000
 But unfortunately for him, he was of a certain caste.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:50.000
 He was of a caste that actually was, I forget the name they gave them now, but they were basically a caste that was relegated to cleaning up human waste.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 And no matter how many degrees this chap had, and he got time off to go to university and to study for his exams, etc.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 And he passed one after the other.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 And it started getting wise to him wanting all this time off and started to try to block him.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 And he actually just protested against it.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 And eventually he won and was given the time off to do these extra degrees.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 And they still wouldn't do anything about him in terms of his social standing because they'd already compartmentalized him.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 And that's very much the opposite of what we talk about with environmental enrichment and the kind of things that can bring to society as a whole and also to individuals that can then affect other individuals.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 It's pretty much a kind of brainwashing of systems of a certain type of belief.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
 Yeah.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 The nootropic people are really committed to the idea of intelligence as competition to gain status.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 But I think there's a more general idea of consciousness and intelligence that applies to life in general, that it's an appropriateness of the way you live, which is intelligent.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Not the skill you have to fit into whatever you might encounter in the society.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 It's the ability to decide whether you want to fit in or not.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 Yeah.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 And also the quotient here of fitting in in terms of feeling alive, alive and well, I think is very important.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 Obviously, we've talked at length in the past about various toxic insults in our food supply, in our environment, you know, what people consider normal in terms of their pastimes or their free time or their occupation or just in their thoughts.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 And, you know, you mentioned learned helplessness and the kind of inescapable stress and the kind of events that that promotes.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:21.000
 But just having an open and free outlook and or, like I said, a job that not necessarily pays well, but that you really enjoy is so much more important.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 And in terms of IQ, as you've mentioned, it's a really false in a lot of ways, a false system of determining intelligence and that society itself is very much molded, unfortunately, by the huge corporations that surround us selling whatever products they have to offer.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 And so when I started looking at nootrophics as a pretty endless sort of list and it's gone on from one to the next, the next.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 And I know that Life Extension magazine definitely promotes a lot of life promoting products.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 And so there are definitely some products, of course, like you mentioned, things like thyroid, things like pregnenolone, anti stress, basic anti stress chemicals, compounds that are naturally produced by the body to offset the toxic effects of stress and the inflammatory effects of stress.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 And vitamins are important.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 Yeah, I was going to mention B12. I know you mentioned B1 and then B12, fairly realistically important, you know, anti stress and thereby perhaps, you know, memory or cognition enhancing products.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 Niacinamide.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 And, you know, and caffeine, if it's used properly, but a lot of people are thinking of caffeine as a legal version of crack cocaine.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 It shouldn't be used as speed. It should be used as a food.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 It should decrease nitric oxide exposure and so it should have anti-aging properties. But if you take it on an empty stomach, it will drop your blood sugar, turn on nitric oxide, cause aging stress.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 So have caffeine after you've had a big meal.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Yeah, I just want to bring out one one particular herb just because it's kind of pertinent to the subject of neurotrophic cell performance enhancing.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 And it's actually under the umbrella of the general term adaptogenics, which was coined and by Russian research when they were looking at cheap alternatives to drugs that they perhaps couldn't produce in the 50s for their space program.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 They were very much into looking at plant sources and the ginsengs obviously are one of those kind of crowning products that you think about when you think about both longevity and enhancing mental performance, etc.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 But that resistance, that term adaptogen coined to describe a compound that improved the organism's resistance to stress.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 So the Korean ginseng, Panax ginseng is one of those things obviously that I think of along with Eleuthera cocus and several other ginseng species.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 OK, I cannot think that's coming towards the end of the show. I think we want to just do another shout out here.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 You want to come on in? Oh, somebody's on the phone.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 Well, we've got four minutes. I don't think we can. I don't think we can take it because it's going to push us over eight o'clock and there'll be unhappy, unhappy people.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 But perhaps if they want to call in, I'll take the call afterwards. Perhaps we can do that.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.000
 So thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peate. OK, thank you. I just want to thank you and good night, Dr. Peate.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 OK, so I just want to let people know in the next few minutes here a little bit more about Dr. Peate, how they can find out about him, read his work, look at some of the stuff that he's published.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 Get a feel for him from the shows. Hopefully at any moment soon, perhaps in the next month, the website that we have will be updated.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 And it is my intention to post all of the audios that we've done with Dr. Peate.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 I think there's getting on for 50 or at least of them and publish those for people to freely download and listen to.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 Dr. Peate's website, www.raypeat.com, is full of articles, fully referenced.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 All of it is his research, his own unique way of looking at all the pieces and bringing together a cohesive framework within which to understand what medicine so often tries to hit with a hammer,

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 with a single drug in large amounts or toxic drugs that have negative effects.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 So Dr. Peate has a very unique way of looking at things.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 And I know from personal experience a lot of what he has brought out to us and taught us has really helped a lot of people.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 So his website is a very good starting point to look at articles.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 And that's www.raypeat.com.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 And my name's Andrew Murray.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:24.000
 For anybody who wants to find out any more about us, we can be reached toll free on 1-888-WBMR Monday through Friday.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 And it's certainly becoming, on the drive in this evening, 10 to 7, I was looking at the trees and changing colors and trees dropping their leaves already.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 And I was thinking, wow, it's the 20th, 21st of August and it feels like the end of September.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 It's all a month early this year.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 It's all at least a month early.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 Anyway, we're on the third Friday of each month.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000
 And so until the third Friday of next month, I'll say good night.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 Good night.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Yes, and good night and good evening.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 And this is Carrie.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 And I just wanted to jump in here at the end of your show to say a few thank yous that just came in.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 Thank you to this anonymous who said, "Herb doctor info on the show is priceless."

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000
 So thank you very much.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000
 Thank you for that.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 Yes, and another thank you.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.000
 People who listen to KMUD need to pledge.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 That's what Karen from Branscombe says.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 Thank you so much, Karen.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 That's the only thing that keeps the show going, right, is pledges.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
 There's no state funding.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
 Well, the whole station is an independent station.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
 It's a community radio station.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:35.000
 I believe we get some funding, outside funding, but it's all from the -- I'm not sure.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000
 But it's mostly just community support, absolutely.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
 Which allows the radio show to be as unique as it is because perhaps there would be more outside control.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 Right, we're completely independent that way.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:54.000
 I mean, like federal money to support the community radio station.
