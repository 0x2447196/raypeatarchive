00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Obstructor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.700
 From the 7.30 until the end of the show,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.960
 callers are invited to call in

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.000
 with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 a kind of mixed topic really. It's a little bit of economics,

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.440
 a little bit of greed,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.800
 corporate greed, and idealism.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.280
 And a couple of characters from the mid-1850s

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.440
 who had some very visionary thoughts about such concepts as the biosphere

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.920
 and neurosphere are going to be woven into

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.480
 the discussion.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.480
 It's very much a point at this point in time

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.840
 where I think as a species we are

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 definitely getting more and more aware

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.840
 of our surroundings. The Internet has made it extremely easy

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.520
 to find out a lot of information about a lot of different things.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.880
 Sometimes some of it's erroneous, other times it's revelationary.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.960
 So there's plenty of data to support

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 lots of arguments on both sides of the coin. If someone wants to argue something

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.120
 you can get on the Internet and you can find a lot about it, sometimes

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.080
 erroneous, sometimes accurate, but the idea is that we

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 have got more freedom than ever. We're not confined

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.880
 as it were to libraries to sift and trawl through

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.120
 volumes. We've got the push of a button, the chance to

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.720
 find out all sorts of things that we would never have had access to and so

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.280
 therefore

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.120
 dissemination of knowledge has become much freer.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.560
 And unlike in times past when

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.600
 academia and education was reserved for those people who had

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 power, influence, money, hereditary

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.760
 money that would have kept them in the right position, anybody with

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.840
 a desire to know more or a passion

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.280
 to know more about a subject can get on the Internet

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.880
 and fairly quickly come to a fairly

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.080
 accurate opinion about a lot of things.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.680
 And like I said, sometimes information on the Internet is not accurate

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.960
 and can be misleading. I found in the past here with

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.040
 talking with Dr. Peat and looking at lots of research articles and clinical

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.080
 trial data and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.840
 all sorts of controlled double-blind studies and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.240
 placebo-controlled studies and randomized studies and even studies that

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.040
 are seemingly scientific can actually be misleading and erroneous.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.320
 Just look at all the data folks and look at it objectively

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.640
 and you can generally find

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.080
 the fault in some papers and you can more often than not

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.600
 if there's money involved, just follow the money and that will also lead you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.320
 to the direction that will reveal some of the truth about it that you may not

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.880
 have

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.680
 read or seen. So like I said, this much subject

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.080
 is going to be a medley

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.960
 of things but with economics and greed

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.680
 at the heart of it and as a species

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.080
 we are probably more so now than ever

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.520
 more relaxed if you like and

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.960
 there we have less, and I don't mean this from a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.160
 physiological perspective, but less stress on us to survive because things

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.760
 are available in convenience stores and we don't have to hunt them now,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.960
 we don't have to grow them, we don't have to have those skills,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.520
 we're becoming less physical as we become more cerebral perhaps

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.160
 and things are there, just like Amazon will deliver it,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.960
 not that I agree with Amazon, but Amazon will deliver it to your door

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.120
 you don't have to go out and get it anymore and as long as you're

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.960
 earning a wage, there is some disposable income at

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.440
 your disposal to do that. So that's part of this evening

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.520
 is the... I just want people that are listening to the show just to really sit back and

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.880
 think about what I'm going to say because

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.640
 I get my head into it a lot and it still strikes me as

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.840
 kind of mind-blowing when I read these things

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.160
 and get into it in more depth and truly expose myself to it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.560
 it just highlights to me how little most people probably know

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.840
 or understand about what I'm going to say

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.960
 and I think the largest

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.360
 excuse that you hear from people is

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.960
 "I'm too busy to get involved" and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.400
 that's true enough, you know, most folks here are working two jobs

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.000
 sometimes people working three part-time jobs just to make ends meet

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.480
 and the cost of everything is skyrocketed and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.400
 our attention is being captivated

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.240
 and by working so much so to make ends meet that we have

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 much less time now I think than in the past to get involved

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.040
 in politics and to organize and steer

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.280
 the government the way that we the people wanted to go

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.680
 and I think the opposite happens where we're completely

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.240
 blindsided by the economics of the day that we live in and the debt

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.280
 that most people live in that they just don't have the time

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.560
 or the want to get involved with politics

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.120
 not understanding that it's the root cause of the reason that we're in the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.080
 debt and the poverty that we're in

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.400
 so it's very much up to us to get involved and

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.880
 getting involved with local government is probably the easiest first step that

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.200
 people can do to try and make positive change in their area

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.560
 and that's why I'm so pleased really to be in Humboldt

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.920
 and this part of California anyway especially, there's a lot of

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.400
 grassroots movements

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.880
 there's a lot of independent free-thinking people and there's a lot of

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.040
 people with a lot of talents sometimes they

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.080
 don't get expressed as much as they could but

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.760
 ultimately there's a lot of people in this area largely

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.000
 that have a much more eclectic outlook

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.360
 and a much more free thinking

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.480
 and questioning and

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.040
 you know examining kind of spirit in them which I think is very important in

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.160
 order to keep

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.080
 open society as open society and not

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.120
 controlled by the ever-increasing government that we have

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.480
 so excuse me, Dr. Pete is on the line

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.160
 and I know that most people who've listened to the show certainly

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.280
 understand where Dr. Pete is coming from, he's a very

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.080
 open-minded free thinker who has spent most of his life

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.680
 in academia researching after doing his PhD

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.960
 researching subjects that are increasingly

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.080
 being brought to light to be showing us a very different way to live

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.640
 and a very different perspective that he has on many different subjects so I

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.680
 will be

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.720
 joined by Dr. Pete here in a moment I wanted to start with a

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.760
 a kind of monologue that I drew up during yesterday

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.040
 and today as a kind of basis for the show

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.400
 but always I will get Dr. Pete's perspective on it because

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.680
 it's very different from how you would normally think he would answer things

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.520
 so I'd be

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.720
 quite interested to hear how he's going to respond

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.040
 I never really plan this with him, we never really talk about how we're going

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.640
 to answer the questions or

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.920
 what I'm going to say, what he's going to say, he's always very ad-lib

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.560
 and extremely lucid, I think he's 81 or 82 now, maybe you'll

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.080
 correct me when he comes on but he is more lucid and with it than a lot

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.640
 of 20 or 30 year olds academics that I've known and know

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.400
 so anyway what I wanted to say was that

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.080
 from an economic perspective then let's just look at greed

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.480
 coupled with runaway inflation and the resulting decline in spending power of

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.240
 industrialized nations it fuels this chemically altered world

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.080
 that we live in now this economic uphill struggle to

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.600
 support sustainability and organically raised foods

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.840
 creates a sense of loss for an otherwise enhanced and healthy environment both

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.960
 psychologically and physically for us all

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.720
 so just bear with me on that for a second both psychologically and

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.400
 physically for us all so it's a holistic approach

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.240
 to this psychologically and physically now the cost of living

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.240
 in real terms from 1950 to the present time for three particular metrics I'm

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.880
 going to look at which are very standard in this day and age we can relate to it

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.600
 in the 1950s and we can relate to it today

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.280
 one's average family income the second is an average car cost and the third is

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.920
 an average median house price okay so the

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.040
 in 1950 the average family income was three thousand three hundred dollars

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.560
 and the average car cost fifteen hundred dollars

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.560
 and the median house price was about seven thousand three hundred

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.240
 so your average car cost would be half of your

00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.040
 average income and your average house price would be just over two times

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.840
 your family income that was back in 1950 now when you hear people talking you

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.480
 hear the 20 year olds or 30 year old millennials

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.360
 talking about price of living the cost of things and

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.880
 their parents saying well in our day it was a lot cheaper and their parents

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.480
 parents their grandparents saying it was even better in our day

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.680
 when America was great and I know it was it's not so great now unfortunately

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.720
 folks but that's that's another subject so from the

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.400
 30s to the 50s things were really doing very well for the

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.400
 states and from the 50s even to 70s things were going really well

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.720
 around about 1973 things started rapidly increasing in price and the

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.840
 average wealth of people started rapidly declining

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.040
 and it's funny when you look at the national debt

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.960
 that also took a rapid spike actually much more around the 90s but

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.360
 after the oil problems in the 70s and the price of gold

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.720
 being fairly high and then you'll find that things started shifting

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.200
 as various other products became this kind of leading market

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.000
 dominators so anyway those three costs the average income for the home

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.880
 sorry the average income 3,300 the average car was 1,500 and the average

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.720
 median sorry median house price was 7,300

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.640
 so now these important metrics allow relative comparisons across time now

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.440
 when we form ratios from them so the home price income against income is

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.400
 2.2 and the car cost against income was 0.45

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.200
 now in 2014 the US Census Bureau showed these following values the average

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.400
 family income was 51,000 the average car cost 31,000

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.240
 and the median home price was now 188,000

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.080
 so as a as a ratio here an index the home price

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:57.960
 to income has suddenly gone to 3.7 which is 1.68 times what it was in 1950

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.320
 so no wonder people can't get on the housing ladder and this was the same

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.240
 when I was I was young in the 80s I know that then

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.040
 people were just able to get onto the housing

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.720
 market ladder and by the 1990s it was becoming very

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.600
 obvious that it was getting very expensive to get your initial down

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.600
 payment from mortgage anyway in England that previously had been quite

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.400
 attainable by people 20 or 30 years ago

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.400
 okay the uh the engineer is telling me there's a caller on the line

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.320
 well uh let's let's just let's go with the caller as you see here but

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.360
 generally I wouldn't but let's take this call let's call away from and what's your

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.360
 question oh yeah greetings from San Francisco okay

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.160
 what's your question caller well a couple of different things I was

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:47.480
 gonna I heard you talking about the uh standard of living from 1973

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.120
 and that corresponds to a point when Richard Nixon took us off the gold

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.720
 standard and I'm wondering uh you I don't know if

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.400
 you've ever uh interviewed Frances Moore Lappe uh

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.560
 she wrote the book uh food first you know the myth of

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.680
 scarcity and there's a section in there where

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.720
 she describes that when Nixon took us off the gold standard

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.320
 all of a sudden the rich of the world figured out that

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.000
 uh they better invest in tangible things which would

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.800
 be uh hedges against inflation and so they started uh buying land

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.520
 and and specifically buying the highest quality land

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:36.280
 uh in order to have the highest uh hedge against inflation and so for

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:42.120
 example the starvation in Bangladesh was because the super rich of the world

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.520
 started buying uh the agricultural land at the foothills

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.280
 of the Himalayas and they drove millions of people off the

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.160
 land so that uh you know they I think uh they say that

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.520
 the erosion off the Himalayas is going to

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:04.040
 go on for another 10,000 years and so all of that uh erosion is going

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.720
 to turn into uh good topsoil with foot of the

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.160
 Himalayas and so that's going to be the best

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.280
 agricultural land in that region of the world

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.040
 and so uh to to feed the people out there they'd

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.560
 better buy that land and so the starvation in

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.640
 Bangladesh was because all of those farmers were driven down to the ocean

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.080
 where they were not familiar with with gaining

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:35.080
 lifestyle or anything like that so uh the that was specifically tied to

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.240
 the uh Nixon removing the U.S. dollar from

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.640
 the gold standard in I think that was 1972. There's another

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.720
 book that also gives some attribution to that and that's called the Making of the

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.160
 President series and uh that Making of the President

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.840
 series if you look for the one for 1972 that also talks about the re-election

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.320
 year of Richard Nixon and it if you look in the index under gold

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.560
 uh it uh it gives a very similar breakdown on

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:12.680
 uh on the economy and as it becomes basically uh very manipulated

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.120
 the other thing I was going to raise and my ears perked up when you were talking

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.000
 about um you know people having deliveries

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.840
 Amazon and whatnot uh if you read old books you know 100

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.040
 year old books 50 year old books uh you know biographies of the 30s or

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.360
 anything like that a whole lot of people especially kids

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.240
 orphaned kids uh were making money being like delivery boys

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.320
 uh they'd go down to the grocery store and deliver packages and groceries for

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.480
 the um you know the little old ladies or

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:49.000
 whatever they'd make uh you know decent little income for a teenage kid

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.640
 was being a delivery boy and uh the only trouble with Amazon doing

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:59.320
 that is they're doing it on a global uh in a global sense and so

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:06.280
 the the you know the new generation of kids are no longer able to

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.960
 make money on the side uh being delivery boys

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.560
 and what's even worse with Amazon is is that the payment is done

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:19.240
 electronically which means that uh every small town that gets delivery

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.520
 that money is sucked out of town right away it no longer stays in

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.440
 you know in uh Ukiah it no longer stays in

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.960
 in uh you know Shreveport Louisiana or anywhere else it that money gets sucked

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.400
 to the corporate headquarters of Amazon yeah and so the local economy is

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.480
 decimated uh where a delivery boy becomes a stable

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.480
 part of the local economy when Amazon takes over something as

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.560
 mundane as delivery driving uh that all of a sudden

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.720
 creates a colony economics yeah well i was going to get into the uh the

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.240
 whole point of uh wages in real terms and the

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.680
 importance of local supporting local economies because local

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.000
 economies are not controlled by central government and we have much

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.360
 more say in a local economy driven uh environment so uh thank

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.280
 you thank you for that call i don't generally take calls before 7 30 so

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.560
 i was kind of a little bit caught out but i don't normally like to turn people

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.720
 down so let me just um briefly say that the number to reach

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.520
 uh 7 30 on if you'd like to call is 9 2 3 3 9 1 1

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.280
 for the local area and as we always have found not just in California but

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.840
 from the west east coast people have called in before now and outside of

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.360
 the USA from Australia to Helsinki and Finland

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.040
 we've had callers but anyway there's an 800 number which is 1 800

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.120
 568 3723 and we can be reached on the web too

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.560
 so dr pete will be joining us fairly soon i just wanted to get through with

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.480
 what i started as an introduction here um i just wanted to get at the point

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.160
 that the cost of living has rapidly increased

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.000
 and one other thing in 1950 at the university of Pennsylvania

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.640
 annual tuition was 600 so the tuition to income ratio there was 0.18

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.640
 current tuition is 40 000 a year and the tuition to income ratio now

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.880
 is 0.79 it's 4.3 times and student loans

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:25.080
 are fueling all of that so this massive increase in student loans

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.320
 and debt amounts to about a trillion dollars at

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.040
 present which in in and of itself may show us

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.960
 as a crisis in time to come us total debt in 2001 was 28 trillion

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.440
 folks in 2012 it was 68 trillion

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:47.400
 with global debt now get this global debt is currently at 217 trillion or

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:54.920
 over 327 percent of global gdp so three times

00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.760
 three times the annual complete output would not pay for the debt

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.200
 um so according to the economic policy institute

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.480
 entry-level wages of male and female college graduates

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.520
 has remained the same since 1973 so if you had a college graduate

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.240
 you had a graduate degree in 73 you'd be entering the market at the same kind of

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.920
 wage as you'd be entering the market now with a 4.3 times increase in this cost

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.240
 to get your education but more disconcertingly the

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.640
 entry entry level wages for male and female high school graduates

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.360
 from 73 to 2011 has dropped dramatically from 16 an hour

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:44.920
 16 an hour in 73 to 12 an hour now so between that time from 73 to now

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.000
 it's dropped four dollars and in real terms everything is at least

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.560
 double if not more so why is this relevant then you might ask yourself or

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.040
 ask your doctor to have this as a subject but it's

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.040
 very relevant as a disposal income disposable income

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.720
 we have as employees or self-employed producers of goods or services

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.000
 is what we use to make lifestyle choices that ultimately

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.480
 has a ripple effect across the world now sustainable agriculture and animal

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.600
 farming practices using organic production methods

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.640
 should create the best product possible without a doubt hands down no equals

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.360
 it's only that this classification is now used as a trendy phrase for what was

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.640
 commonly done prior to the industrialization of foods

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.960
 and from the 1900s on has itself fallen in some cases victim

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.480
 to the greed and corruption plaguing non-organic production

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.240
 especially mass production of organic products including but not limited to

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.040
 milk production which is what i'll get into with dr p

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.760
 in just a minute so it has both a psychological and physical effect a

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.640
 truly holistic unifying theorem which for

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.080
 economics sake and greed is being reduced to the lowest

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.000
 common denominator a given form by massive corporate

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.440
 control of agribusiness and truly unimaginable scale production of

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.200
 corporate food globally from animal factory farming to mega

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.320
 arable farming none of which is organically produced and all of which

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:13.080
 is degrading the environment so dr p are you there with us

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.480
 yes hello hi thanks thanks for joining us well we had an early caller there and

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.440
 i was actually wanting to get your take on what he'd said i don't know if you

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.560
 heard his question and you don't have to answer it but um

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.800
 i guess first things first can i just get you to outline your

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.320
 academic and professional background and career for those people who perhaps have

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.800
 never heard you um yeah i did my undergraduate study

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:43.000
 at 1953 to 56 and i had a summer job where i made five hundred dollars

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.480
 and with a tuition scholarship that paid for my nine months of

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.400
 schooling every year wow and i looked at the prices

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.920
 recently and uh it was about at least 20 times more expensive

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.120
 i i couldn't afford to go to school currently

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:08.520
 or was something that uh real really um average and low income

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:13.320
 people could afford in the 1950s i wasn't going to ask you

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.760
 this but i mean i don't mean i don't mean it rudely in any way but how you

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.280
 are 81 or 81 yeah okay so now you would be a

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.480
 good candidate to ask this question because you've been around for 81 years

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.680
 right which is um which is pretty respectable in its own

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.520
 right now you've obviously seen uh yeah and i wasn't going to ask you this

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.680
 but we i'd love you to answer it because

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.840
 you've seen it and been through it but uh you've seen the economic change in

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.320
 america here over the last 80 years and the cost of things increase the way

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.960
 they have what do you think about um what i

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.720
 mentioned earlier in the show is the intro for the kind of median house price

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.560
 um the average car price and then the average wage

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.560
 and and what you think about um high school uh graduates

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.720
 losing four dollars an hour from 1973 to net now let alone

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.640
 getting any kind of increase to account for inflation and then graduate students

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.840
 are still on the same hourly wage from 73 as they are to now

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.040
 how do you feel about the economics and then we'll get into

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.800
 i think what i wanted to question you about

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:20.280
 a lot of popular culture has to do with keeping people from realizing that

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.560
 things are getting worse and worse good point good point

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:29.560
 um the for example you were mentioning the the average income those are

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:36.520
 actually the median income uh the actual per capita average

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.880
 income in the u.s for for one person is uh fifty eight or fifty nine thousand

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:47.160
 dollars a year for a family of 2.54

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:54.440
 people the average household size the average family income then is almost

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.560
 150 000 here but since newspapers and

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:04.200
 almost everyone refers to the average income

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:11.240
 actually using the median income which uh it neglects the the vast

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.200
 incomes that the upper one or two percent are making

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:21.320
 right yeah interesting and um since the the gold standard was thrown

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.240
 out uh the government has had to uh to to

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.360
 keep the illusion going uh they're increasingly hiding

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:37.160
 information they used to give out the uh figures for the money supply a few

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.760
 years ago they stopped giving out much of the

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:47.000
 information that had been routine so uh the reason the stock market

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.600
 seems to be going up it is really because the government is pumping money

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.120
 into it basically correct by printing the money yeah

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.640
 phony money this is by having central banks are basically

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.000
 able to print money without any of any any penalty basically the money's

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.640
 worthless and yet we're people are still buying it people are

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.600
 still buying us treasury bonds um still buying us debt and debt and the

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.000
 oil uh oil is still pegged the dollar which is

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.240
 why the whole petrodollar thing was coming under scrutiny it still

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.760
 is and that the chinese were perhaps trying to break away from it and i know

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.920
 that's in a lot of conspiracy circles at least the reason why

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:32.600
 muhammad gaddafi basically was wanting his population to be free and he was

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.680
 socializing them and the muslim population there was being very

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.000
 westernized and actually not at all radicalized and how

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.280
 he was going to use uh fairly large reserves of gold that he

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.640
 had um to go back to the gold standard and get into

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.480
 trading oil in libya uh with gold and actually

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.840
 i think starting to encourage the other arab nations to do the same and this is

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.760
 when he was taken out and this is the whole

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:01.000
 it was the same with saddam hussein he was trying to get off the

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.160
 yeah petrodollar and venezuela is doing the same exactly

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.520
 exactly and look at them they've all been either be taken over or their

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.160
 government's been supplanted or the country's been thrown into civil war

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.240
 yeah okay so i guess without getting too far off the topic

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.680
 um looking at looking at the cost of everything

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:26.600
 um as human beings you know i mean i i'd like to believe i'd like to believe that

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.120
 the bulk of people have got good intentions the bulk of people

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:34.520
 are not uh just warlike uh grab as much as they can

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.040
 evil despotic people who do anything to get above the next person

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.240
 and that we have probably more than ever um

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.400
 and a consciousness uh of the world that we live in which wants to try

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.880
 and level the playing field between the poor and the rich because it's such a

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.040
 huge gulf now with so few people earning so much and the

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.840
 rest of the population um basically being i think their cost of

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:05.080
 little the standard living being lowered in real terms um so looking at

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.280
 um i know i read your newsletter and you mentioned in part of it

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:14.920
 um fernandeski and um uh tayyar the shahdan

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:21.240
 starting the concepts of the noosphere and the biosphere and so as organisms as

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.600
 human beings you know we are living in this biosphere and um very

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.920
 much subject to the stresses uh that we get

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:35.640
 um you know that made known to us either through television or advertising or

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.880
 obviously debt and i think debt is at this point has the biggest chain around

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.600
 most people's necks that stops them looking sideways um

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:50.920
 relating to fernandeski he was um looking at the

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:59.160
 the planet as a metabolic system uh the biosphere was he saw the soil

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.600
 and the atmosphere and the solar energy being converted to

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:10.760
 uh to food and living substance um

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:18.920
 his concept really saw carbon dioxide as a promoter of life

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:23.800
 and increasing the uh the quality of living

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:30.600
 and the i i see the uh the current uh fear of carbon dioxide as partly a

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.680
 distraction from the actual pollution of deforestation

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:42.120
 it's uh one of the major uh causes of the carbon dioxide increase

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:49.880
 but uh it's actually doing much actually doing damage rather than uh

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.880
 the um carbon dioxide increase that they're talking about

00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:00.760
 it's uh degrading the rivers uh the uh the oceans are being degraded by

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.480
 the uh petroleum spills and chemical

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:10.920
 runoff from from the uh use of uh mass

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:18.440
 chemicals in agriculture but the um the propaganda machine for example

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:25.560
 the website political a big it's uh it was funded by

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:33.080
 the uh money from the biggest bank in washington dc and it represents the

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:39.400
 ruling class ideology an article that was came out on

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:45.080
 political a few weeks ago was written by a mathematician saying that

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:51.240
 he had demonstrated that the rising carbon dioxide was going to

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.560
 degrade the food supply by stimulating

00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.280
 the growth of plants and and his reasoning was that

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.600
 it was based on a complete upside down version

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.840
 of what happens when you shine light on plankton

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.360
 it stimulates the growth of the of the plant

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:19.560
 part the algae and uh absorbs carbon dioxide and uh

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.800
 suppresses the growth of the animal part of the plankton

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:29.560
 and he said that that was analogous to the stimulation of plant

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.680
 growth by carbon dioxide but what actually happens

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:42.040
 in in the uh the first part of his explanation the um the plant growth

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:48.280
 stimulation by carbon by the sunlight steals carbon dioxide that would make

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.520
 minerals available to the animals so it's the

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.560
 carbon dioxide deficiency that he started from to argue

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.840
 that a carbon dioxide excess would do the same thing

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:07.720
 so he was completely unbiological and and backwards in his reasoning but

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:14.520
 that went around many other media picked it up

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.840
 and argued that it's really degrading the food supply to stimulate

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:26.120
 growth with carbon dioxide but vernadsky was exactly right the carbon

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:30.600
 dioxide is part of the soil forming

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:36.680
 process the plants secrete acids from their roots to dissolve

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:41.480
 minerals but the carbon dioxide carried into the soil

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.120
 from the atmosphere is part of the process of

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:53.960
 making minerals more available to plant so the

00:30:53.960 --> 00:31:01.480
 the mass media are are still promoting myths to uh

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:09.880
 to confuse the uh the argument uh make people

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.400
 worry about a fault process and get them looking in your real

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.360
 pollution i think what you said captured that when

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.480
 you mentioned the uh the fact that it's in the american government's machine

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.480
 interest to uh steer people away from looking too

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:32.040
 hard in the right direction and not publishing a lot of figures that

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.560
 you mentioned in terms of financial fiscal figures

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.760
 especially to do with government debt well we hear about the government debt a

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.080
 lot but there's a lot of other features of banking and finance that we

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.840
 don't hear about these days that used to be published and i think

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.800
 i was thinking when that caller called in about nixon and the gold stand in 72

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.280
 that nixon got taken out not long after long after being involved

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.440
 in politics by that watergate scandal which is nothing compared to

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:03.800
 what's going on now what has happened in the last few years it would make

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.800
 watergate look like a complete tea party

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.920
 okay so you're listening to ask your doctor on uh 91.1 fm

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.720
 uh from now until the end of the show eight o'clock you're invited to call in

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:20.120
 the questions either related or unrelated to this month's mixed topic of

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.960
 economics organic production and uh holistic

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.320
 ways of being really in terms of uh finding out

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.720
 the information and making uh real proper life choices

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.280
 so if you're in the area 93 391 1 or as an 800 number which is 1 800

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:45.800
 568 3723 1 800 km ud rad as a doctor p i wanted to talk a little

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.240
 bit more about the economic side of it i was thinking

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:53.800
 earlier that in terms of real wages

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.800
 in terms of what is the disposable part of your income

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.880
 and what it is that we do as people with our disposable income

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:07.960
 and knowing that i think most people um maybe it's just maybe it's just me

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.080
 maybe i'm just coming from a single-sided perspective here but i

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.600
 would have thought most people would think that certified

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.000
 organic production is the better option over industrialized

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.520
 farming and that certified soil practices are better for the

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.560
 earth and that sustainable and local derived products

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.480
 are better for the environment in general and that with our disposable

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.600
 income we could put our money where our mouth is

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.280
 and buy those things and support those ideals and those products and boycott

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.160
 those mega corporations that we don't want to

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.520
 do business with but that the actual real cost of our

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.200
 disposable income has gone down so much and the government i think

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.280
 largely through not releasing these kind of figures to make it obvious to us

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.560
 have really kept their kept a lot of people in the dark and i

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.480
 think when so many people are burdened with student loans where

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.360
 they've gone through an education that's basically worthless

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.640
 and they spent thousands and thousands of dollars trying to

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.440
 study something that hopefully they had a passion for in the first place and

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.640
 they weren't just looking for a better wage from a higher power job

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.840
 but they suddenly find themselves in a marketplace with thousands of

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.800
 thousands of other qualified people all earning

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.840
 a vastly lower wage than they were in the 70s

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.440
 and with much greater debt than they ever had before

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.000
 so what do you what do you think of that?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.360
 Even the health statistics for example longevity

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:45.240
 and disease incidence these are being falsified. In the 90s

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.640
 the government declared that it had won the war on cancer

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:56.520
 and at the time 94 I pointed out that the secretary of

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:03.400
 health was using phony statistics and looking at the figures

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.880
 I predicted that they would have to change the rules by the end of the

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.280
 century because the way they were falsifying the

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.680
 statistics the arrival of the baby boom

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:23.080
 population bulge by the year 2000 the cancer rate

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.880
 of this huge population bulge was going to make it impossible to

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:33.240
 to keep up the illusion that longevity was increasing the cancer

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.480
 was decreasing and so on and exactly I think it was the year

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:42.920
 2000 the U.S. Bureau of Statistics

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.240
 changed the rules and stopped giving out the raw figures

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:54.520
 and have only age standardized figures on on health and longevity and

00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:01.000
 age-specific death rates and so on so so people are are really

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.480
 being put into a dream world in which nothing is real.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.680
 We do have a caller let's get this next caller before we continue that thread

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.400
 caller you're on the air where you from what's your question?

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.760
 Hello. Hi you're on the air what's your question away from?

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:22.440
 I'm from Bloxburg area. Okay what's your question?

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:27.160
 I just get lost. Can you hear me now? Hello.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.240
 Yeah go ahead what's your question? Yes I had a medical question it

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.600
 doesn't it somewhat pertains to what you're talking about but is that all

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.240
 right to ask a question? Sure go ahead. Hello. Yeah go ahead can you

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.560
 not hear me? Yes I had called back

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:49.240
 years ago and I had this lump on my neck and Dr. Peet suggested eating

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.680
 carrots and other things and not going to any kind of a CAT scan or

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.880
 anything like that so this went on for years and it ended up being a cancer

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.000
 tumor and I had it removed in Mexico and then

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.760
 and then came up here and went through chemo and radiation

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.840
 and my my medical question was is a year later now

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:14.600
 I was cutting a small amount of poison oak and I thought I had poison oak on me

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.760
 and all of a sudden this huge rash went over my shoulder and down around the

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.560
 area where the tumor was and fortunately my girlfriend had gone

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.600
 online and like you're mentioning the information online

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:32.440
 and saw that maybe it was shingles which I had no idea about right and I

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.920
 wonder if Dr. Peet could talk a little bit about

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.680
 about that and if that actually was related to

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.720
 the radiation treatment and chemo. Sure will lower your resistance for sure and

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:47.400
 shingles can be reactivated chickenpox at any point in a person's life

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.600
 especially if you're under stress. I wanted to ask you Cora first things

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.200
 first before going further what was the cancer that they

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.640
 identified? You know I'm so confused with names but

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.280
 it was some sort of a skin type cancer

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.280
 so it's unusual for this lump to be there and it took

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:15.080
 it took about 12 to 15 years to develop into this

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.960
 massive lump on my neck that was actually breaking out and coming out of

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.880
 out of my skin. So it was a benign cancer in some in some terms and it wasn't

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.240
 metastasizing it wasn't spreading it took 12 years to evolve and

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.880
 yes and then finally it got so bad that that local doctors wouldn't touch it or

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.160
 try to cut it cut it out so I had to go through chemo and all these different

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.280
 things but it's somewhat much better now a little

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.720
 swelling there okay and I was just wondering if that

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:47.080
 had something to do with the shingles or if I should go and consult a doctor

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:51.880
 it's going away now after about a week but it looks just like a bad case of

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.520
 poison oak. Okay was it extremely sensitive to the

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.040
 touch? Very sensitive but not very itchy like

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.640
 poison oak would have been. Was it in a defined I'll just jump in very

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.280
 quickly before I let Dr. Pete answer but I'm just kind of

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.720
 interested. Well Dr. Pete probably won't agree with

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.760
 this even I've always been taught that shingles is a defined dermatoma

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.840
 area that can along the length of the nerve erupt into vesicular outbreak but

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.200
 Dr. Pete let me let me ask you because I know you've got a probably a very

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.960
 different approach to what this gentleman was talking about.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:32.760
 Well just in case it's actually poison oak I had the experience

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.240
 in my teens of being extremely sensitive to poison oak

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.520
 I was working in the woods for the Bureau of

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.120
 Land Management and could hardly stand

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:52.840
 my sleep was interrupted by extreme poison oak and the word went around

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.800
 the camp that vitamin c which was new on the market

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:03.880
 it was just fairly expensive coming out in 50 milligram tablets

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.960
 the word went around that vitamin c protected against poison oak

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.720
 and so at the end of the week I bought a bottle

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:18.520
 took a few tablets 50 or 100 milligrams and suddenly the poison oak disappeared

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:21.880
 and I never had it again

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:28.280
 about 65 years later. Yeah I'm not I'm not really sensitive to poison oak

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.640
 I've been here for about 40 years I get it just

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:37.080
 just a little bit but it was like just a little bit and by a day or two

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.840
 later my whole shoulder and down my back

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.360
 turned into these huge bubbles these blackening bubbles

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.760
 and I've been familiar with poison oak usually it's blotchy and if you itch it

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.240
 gets worse and worse but this was like just a takeover of my skin and

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:59.160
 is that very uh I I had that form of a bubbly and crispy

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.160
 crust yeah yeah just tear all down my back and stuff

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.640
 but on one on one side of my body though it's not on any other place just

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.160
 all over the one side shoulder underneath my neck

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:15.000
 down my chest a bit and and now now it's getting better

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.080
 we've been I've been eating organically for years and years so

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.880
 I assumed that my diet really helped and then we put like witch hazel on there to

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:28.440
 to calm it down and some neem oil and other things so

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.160
 is it is it something that you should pay a lot of attention to later on

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.000
 or is will it go away and just be gone um

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.800
 if it's a poison oak it's possible that you'll never

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:49.000
 suffer from it again if it's a virus shingles yeah I think it is

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.960
 a good idea to have your vitamin d level checked vitamin d is a very

00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:01.000
 powerful antiviral it regulates

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:09.240
 all the levels of your immune system and uh your serum level should be

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:14.120
 in the middle of the range around 50 nanograms per milliliter

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:19.640
 okay okay well we do have two yeah you're very much I appreciate that yeah

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.200
 I appreciate your call caller we've got two more callers so

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.600
 let's take the next caller call away from what's your question

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.000
 hello yeah you're on the air where are you from and what's your question

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.640
 hi I'm from the New York City area okay and what's your question

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:42.440
 I was wondering uh if Dr. Pete had any advice on finding

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:49.480
 dentists to use the filling materials he recommends which from what I read was

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:56.520
 calcium oxide for root canals and soros and then for regular fillings

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:03.400
 and and how should I understand the importance of those materials

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.360
 Dr. Pete filling material for teeth what's your

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:12.120
 current for the root canal I think the calcium

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:21.080
 the it's antiseptic and anesthetic and uh it's a traditional but

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:30.200
 safer than than the gutta percha or metal fillings and I think the

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:37.640
 the composite fillings are now high enough in strength that they're

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.200
 good for even the chewing teeth

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.880
 okay do you have any advice on finding dentists to use those because I

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.880
 think I've emailed like dozens of people and haven't found much

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:58.680
 results of that um I've for about 50 years had all my

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:06.200
 industry done in Mexico because they emphasize skill dexterity

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:12.520
 and uh care rather than speed and profit

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.560
 so it could be worth it could be worth a trip to Mexico purely for dentistry I

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.640
 know lots of people do it for medical issues like surgeries but

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.920
 okay well we do have another caller on the air let's get this next caller

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.360
 so call hello yeah where are you from and what's your question yes

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.480
 I'm from Phillipsville and um more than a question I have a comment

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:36.040
 um the fellow that was talking about uh getting poison oak and then it

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.880
 turning into shingles but he talked about having cancer having

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.040
 this lump that uh that that grew and became very

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:48.440
 large um and he had to have all kinds of uh

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:52.440
 cancer therapies to get rid of it and you made a comment saying that it

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:57.480
 would because it hadn't metastasized you refer to it as a benign

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.920
 cancer that's an oxymoron there is no such

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.960
 thing as benign cancer there is a benign tumor but the but

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.040
 benign means it's not cancer self-contained

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:16.120
 and it's cancer they call it malignant if it's a lump that is been that is not

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.120
 cancer they call it benign so there's no such thing as benign cancer

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.520
 so what were you talking about okay well I don't need to go there with

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.240
 that I don't need to defend myself what was that

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.200
 I don't I don't think I need to defend myself with that

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.560
 thanks you don't think you need to explain why you referred to cancer as

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.520
 benign when there's no such thing well if you

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.920
 look at if you look at moles moles are cancers but they are benign

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:44.760
 uh when there's a pre-cancerous condition

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.640
 which hasn't developed into cancer but if it's cancer it's malignant it's not

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:57.160
 benign a lot of the language used medically in relation to cancer

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:06.520
 has been to promote the business of of the oncologist 50 or 60 years ago

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:12.680
 cancers were things that were definitely

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.080
 identified as benign the language was escalated

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:22.120
 so that something which formerly was not cancer was called

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:31.560
 pre-cancer and then cancer the if you use the language of 1940

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:38.040
 many cancers wouldn't exist that are now officially named as as a cancer

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.480
 and treatable does they refer to cancer as malignant

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:50.040
 and a tumor that's not cancer as benign um an article in jama about 40 years ago

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:57.240
 uh looked at the evidence of uh the pathology methods

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.040
 of analyzing the properties of the cytoplasm

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:08.840
 nucleus ratio and uh the the matter of disorganization and

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:17.480
 invasion and so on and in this article it was demonstrated that a healing wound

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.800
 if it's biopsied will show all of the properties

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:28.680
 that are used by the pathologist to identify cancer so

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:34.120
 that what is defined as cancer has become more inclusive and if you

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.440
 happen to have an injury that gets biopsied

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.040
 it'll be called cancer because it has the properties of

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:49.800
 of rapid growth uh invasive appearance and so on well then

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:55.320
 is that benign or malignant this this article was pointing out that

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.320
 you can't tell that the only way you can tell if

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.720
 something is going to be malignant is wait and see

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:08.120
 well this is telling you not to go to the doctor when his lump was small

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:12.040
 and he took your advice and it grew and grew and grew and became

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.840
 cancer and he had to have all kinds of of difficult therapy they couldn't even

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:20.120
 remove it he had to have chemotherapy to shrink it before they could even remove

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.360
 it why did you tell him not to go to a doctor

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:27.560
 when he first had it i don't remember uh saying that i don't think i ever

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.080
 tell people not to go to doctors i don't think he did either i

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:35.240
 think i misunderstood them because i thought he said he had spoken with you

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:39.000
 uh when he first got it and that you had told him not to go to a doctor

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.240
 i never tell people not to go to doctors but i tell them to

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.920
 think and question what the doctor tells them to do

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.840
 well all right well thanks thanks for the call it sounds like a

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.200
 more of a battle of words here okay we've got two more calls uh

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.280
 so let's say next call a call away from what's your question i'm in white thorn

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.720
 i have a comment and a question my first comment

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.920
 for the prior caller is the best dentist i have ever seen is james mattson and

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.240
 fort bragg okay james mattson and fort bragg

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:15.960
 dr matt okay all right laser super high tech very professional

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.680
 very soothing great great dentist best one i've ever seen

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:26.520
 okay my other question though is about sclerosing mesenteritis

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:32.840
 are there any herbs that might help you know dissolve the internal scar tissue

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.840
 dissolving internal scar tissue

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:43.160
 yeah a little difficult in terms of any tissue that's truly become fibrotic

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.760
 and has been organized that way to do that

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.680
 it's not that easy um i don't know dr p if you

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.200
 if you're looking at scar tissue i know there are some things that they

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.480
 have said in the past are good for dissolving scars but i think

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.600
 once tissue's gotten as organized as a proper scar

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.360
 with those fibrin and connectins i think they're fairly

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:12.200
 insoluble well what's i i may be something like progesterone might be

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.000
 useful in that case but yeah i've had experience

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.560
 with some uh fibrotic uh lumps and scars

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:26.840
 that um for example vitamin e i had a vaccination scar from the time i was

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:31.720
 18 until i was in my 40s it was bulgy and red

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:38.600
 and i put vitamin e on it and in a week it had essentially disappeared

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:45.960
 but a very hard lump sometimes takes six months or so of

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:53.640
 of anti-inflammatory vitamin e progesterone

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.880
 total nutrition improvement can accelerate the

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:03.160
 the vitamin e orally vitamin e topically dr p

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:09.800
 oh in the case of a scar in your skin yes oh no it's inside

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:13.480
 sclerosing this enteritis yeah so that would have to be taken internally but do

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.240
 you think dr p that vitamin e taken internally would

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.000
 really have any topical effect on that or do you think it

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:28.200
 no no but the um a lot of the sclerosing problems are

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:35.240
 calcification uh abnormal calcification and uh

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:42.200
 hence cellu pioneered the study of how to cause and regress

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:45.960
 calcified tissue various types of sclerosis

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:53.240
 and uh that's a good place to start but vitamin d by

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:57.000
 vitamin d and the high calcium intake to lower your

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.760
 parathyroid hormone is part of the process

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:07.640
 of reversing calcified tissue vitamin k is another

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:13.080
 anti-soft tissue calcification factor what was the name of the person you said

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:19.080
 it studied this can han cell yay s e l y e yes s e l y

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:23.080
 yeah yeah thank you okay you're welcome all right there's another caller so let's

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.960
 get this next caller caller where you from and what's your

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.640
 question hello hi you're on the air where you're

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:33.640
 from what's your question uh kansas city from kansas city kansas

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.080
 city i was just wondering i've been listening to a lot of your old podcasts

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:42.680
 and um and on the thyroid issue and i was i didn't hear this particular

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.280
 question and then i was um diagnosed with grave

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:48.680
 disease which is supposed to be hyperthyroid

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:54.360
 but i've never been hyperthyroid and um and i was wondering and the only way

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.400
 they diagnosed me excuse me was because i had the the eyes

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.080
 and the swelling in the feet and the legs so you had

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:08.840
 exophthalmos because they've you know i've known uh thyroid hormone for years

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.240
 and i still have issues and i was wondering

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.120
 is there would you treat that differently than

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:18.200
 someone that say had hashy motives because i've got all that i've still got

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:23.080
 elevated antibodies and all of that yeah so dr p

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:28.280
 um uh graves disease with uh exophthalmos i'm

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.160
 pretty sure it's kind of common presenting complaint and she said

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.720
 swollen feet um yeah i had the swelling on the tops of

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.120
 the feet in the front of the shins i still have

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:43.000
 some of the swelling but you see it was one the main present

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.120
 presenting complaint she said

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:53.480
 um pitting edema i think they call it um yeah i i think a more thorough

00:53:53.480 --> 00:54:00.520
 metabolic study would show something other than the

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:04.040
 antithyroid antibodies

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:11.720
 you would want to check out the steroid hormones progesterone

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:18.440
 uh cortisol vitamin d and the actual level of your

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:25.480
 uh thyroid hormones the t3 and t4 and reverse t3 lots of people

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.000
 did check all of those i have a new doctor and we checked all of those

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.120
 and the only thing that i was low on was testosterone

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.480
 and it wasn't that low it's just a little low so and i've been on vitamin

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:39.880
 d supplements for five years and it's in the normal i mean

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.800
 it's it's usually between 60 and 80 in that range

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.120
 but um i don't seem to be able to find anything that

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.360
 i can get a handle on have you changed uh

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:58.280
 your uh temperature or pulse rate in response to the thyroid

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.800
 no my my temperature is usually between 96

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.840
 6 and 97 when i wake up in the morning but then it goes up during the day like

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.520
 it might go up to 99 by the end of the day

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:16.840
 and um that that is uh really not not consistent with

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:21.640
 graves disease and most of the people i've only seen

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.320
 one person that i think really had hyperthyroid

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.400
 graves disease but i've talked to many people who had the

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.320
 diagnosis and some of their doctors said well

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.920
 actually they're both hypothyroid and hyperthyroid

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:41.160
 but they were yeah that's what they tell me they tell me i have hashimotos and

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:43.560
 graves now because i have all of the thyroid

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.720
 antibodies very high and i'm on i'm on a four and a

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:53.240
 third grain of of natural thyroid and and all of my

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:56.440
 numbers come back right but you know i just my temperature is

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.760
 all whacked out i still have some of the swelling

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:04.280
 i just don't know what to do next

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:10.440
 the um have have you uh changed the thyroid dose while watching your

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:14.360
 pulse rate and temperature and requirement for

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.840
 calories

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:22.600
 you mean you mean like taking something that's a fast-acting thyroid like p3

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.520
 um because the t4 doesn't act very fast i mean

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:33.240
 the t3 um acts within an hour and a half so if no one's ever given me a t3

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.880
 supplement like you mean like a cytomel or something

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:40.280
 yeah so so what what would how would you do that then you would take

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.520
 some cytomel and then you would watch for what do you divide your

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.640
 natural thyroid supplement and take it in

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:53.160
 fractions during the day no because they told me that the t4 part

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:56.680
 of it you had to take it four hours apart from

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.360
 any other medication and apart from food and everything so i take

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.200
 it first thing in the morning did they explain why why you should do

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:07.400
 that the the body said something about the

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.520
 minerals binding the t4 or something i don't i don't quite

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:14.520
 understand it since it takes a couple of days for

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.800
 anything to pass through the intestine normally

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.840
 sometimes longer there's plenty of time for the t4 to absorb

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:29.640
 and your body doesn't want it to absorb all in an hour or two when it

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.080
 does that it induces

00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:39.880
 enzymes in your liver which destroy it if the body if the liver perceives this

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:44.920
 huge unphysiological surge of t4 coming in

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:51.560
 in just an hour it's going to eliminate it 12 hours later

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:56.760
 so that you'll actually be hypothyroid in 12 hours after you take it

00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.040
 i'm going to have to stop you both there i'm afraid we're getting two minutes to

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.200
 the top of the hour and i've got to wrap up with some

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:06.200
 information to let people know more about you dr p and also

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:09.480
 just generally close out the rest of the show so thanks for those people that

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.680
 have joined us tonight thank you dr p for your time really appreciate it

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:16.280
 okay thanks for all the callers for anybody else who

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:20.360
 has listened to the show wants to know more about dr p he's got a

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:25.480
 website www.rayPeat.com he's not selling anything but he's got

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.600
 some very good scholarly articles that are fully

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.880
 referenced on lots of subjects that you've probably not even

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.640
 heard about and some of the reasons why what you think is good for you is not

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.160
 good for you and the science behind it so like you

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.000
 said at the beginning of the show there before

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.120
 i even talked to ask you about it the government want to keep a lot of this

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.400
 stuff quiet and they want to steer you in a general direction

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.560
 you're more manageable that way once you can be burdened with debt and you pay

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.600
 your taxes you don't have too much time to think about too much so you're quite

00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.160
 controllable anyway for those people that have

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.720
