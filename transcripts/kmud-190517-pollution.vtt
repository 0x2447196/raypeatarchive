00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Well, welcome to this month's May of 2019's edition of "Ask Your Rev. Doctor."

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.280
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.920
 For those of you who have perhaps never listened to the show, they run every third Friday of

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.280
 the month from 7 to 8 o'clock.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.600
 We also have a live call-in from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock where people

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:31.320
 can call in with questions either related or unrelated to the topic of the month.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 As always, it's become very appreciated and commonplace here with the "Ask Your Rev. Doctor"

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.560
 show for, gosh, 10 years or more now.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.640
 We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat's expertise on the show.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.560
 He has a wealth of wisdom and a wealth of knowledge.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.680
 I don't think there's many things I've ever asked him that he hasn't got a good answer

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 for.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 He'll be joining us, of course, and I'll be posing questions to him and getting his

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.480
 view and his understanding on some of those things that we'll be bringing up in tonight's

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.840
 discussion.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.360
 We can always be reached after the show, Monday through Friday, regular business hours, 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 This month's subject is a little clear up from last month to get one or two of the questions

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.400
 I never got a chance to ask Dr. Peat.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.080
 And then we're going to carry on with pollutants, particulates and waste creating havoc with

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.720
 biological life as we know it.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.520
 Increasingly we are armed with more and more information as time goes on.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.680
 As usual, I ask people to be moderate about their information and check their sources.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.600
 Obviously there's a wealth of information on the internet and there is quite a desire

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840
 to attract your attention.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.240
 So take a look at the studies, but look at the background of the studies.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.000
 I'm always questioning Dr. Peat when he'll come up with answers for certain things and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.360
 point me to a study.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.640
 And sometimes these studies are buried and you won't find them too easily.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:21.160
 What you'll find is the hype, the media sensationalized responses, the cliche answers, etc. or the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.040
 repeated dogma or even downright lies that are perpetuated in the name of science.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.600
 So always check your sources and make sure that your details are coming from not vested

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.100
 interests but honest research that's seeking to find the truth.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.840
 And good science will always be answerable and will always put itself in the right place

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.600
 when better science comes up with a better answer.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.640
 So science is a very good thing for science's sake.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.480
 Although it's very much a holistic thrust which I go through the show with, it's definitely

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.600
 grounded very much in science because it's a pretty true pathway through.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.200
 So Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us so much.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.840
 Just in case people have tuned into the show for the first time and maybe never heard your

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.060
 voice, would you please just go over your academic professional background before we

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.960
 get started?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:33.160
 I studied at the University of Oregon, biology specializing in reproductive physiology and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.800
 biochemistry as it related to that.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.000
 A PhD in 1972 and since then continuing related study.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Yeah.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Okay.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.760
 And you've spent a very large part of that time actively interacting with people and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.160
 trying to get them to change what they've been doing and what they do and kind of steering

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.240
 them in a better direction given the evidence and the science that you've found out and

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.720
 you've studied and you've recognized is a much better way forward than what we're normally

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.720
 told.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.720
 Yeah.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.640
 Around 1960 I decided that any knowledge should be useful.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:27.680
 So any time I find out anything interesting I try to connect it to practical reality.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 Yeah.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680
 Absolutely.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.480
 Well if we can just finish up with a couple of the things I never got a chance last month

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:42.200
 to question you about before we launch into the pollutant side of this month's talk.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:51.920
 I think the figures show a 25% increase over the 38 years that the study was done from

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.240
 1975 to 2012 in the prevalence of cancers in adolescents.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.840
 Now this does tie into this night's show anyway because the pollutant aspect of this evening's

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.000
 topic very much encompasses all of these things which could be perfectly responsible for a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.600
 lot of these cancers that have been shown in this study to be very much on the rise

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.040
 and scary reading it is too.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:26.120
 So I found that pathologies in adolescents are accelerating and it's not like a kind

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.240
 of very slow increase.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.520
 It's a kind of a rapid acceleration that they're seeing in the numbers of adolescents

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.000
 that are suffering from cancers that never were seen before.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.960
 And so what do you, I mean they have implicated obesity and I think the whole obesity linked

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:51.280
 to diet is probably a good and reasonable detail in the equation of why adolescents

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.880
 and/or cancers in general are just exploding.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.680
 What do you think about them from a biological and physiological perspective because I know

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.920
 you've done a lot of work on polyunsaturates and thyroid and those kind of things that

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.920
 are...

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:10.440
 Yeah, I think some of it is the present diet and the present polluted environment full

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.560
 of carcinogens and estrogens.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.920
 But I think it was actually starting a long time ago influencing prenatal conditions even

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:32.000
 so that their parents' exposure is transmitted affecting the way they develop in the utero

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.560
 and affects the whole maturing process.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:44.000
 So early childhood diseases have increased so much, colitis for example.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.560
 I don't think it is likely that it's all some change in the diet that is making them so

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.760
 allergic, so reactive to fairly ordinary things in the environment.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:08.160
 For example, it's known that the polyunsaturated content of the mother's diet increases the

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:18.840
 allergies of the babies and so colitis in young children is probably a reaction to the

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.600
 mother's diet, maybe from earlier exposures of the parents.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600
 Right.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.440
 Okay, so this would be like an inflammatory process occurring within the bowel and you

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:35.160
 always kind of use the bowel as the seat of health in terms of a good bowel pretty much

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.880
 will predispose you to good health and if there are changes that you need to make, your

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.720
 bowel will be the first place to look at.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:52.120
 So in terms of this kind of reactive allergic type condition, you've also mentioned, and

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.120
 I wanted to ask you this a little while back actually, why?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.040
 And I think just to get it on tape as it were, you know, tape is obsolete these days, but

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.720
 just to get it on audio for people to hear in future, the whole rationale behind mothers

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:18.000
 being prescribed fish oils, omega oils, and telling them that that is actually good for

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.320
 their child's health, and I know you've rebut this or rebutted it with studies showing that

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:33.960
 the child whilst maybe appearing more sedate and calm and relaxed when they're first birth

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.880
 is actually a sign of the kind of retardation in some ways and that actually there's a relationship

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:47.120
 between lower brain weight and function and intelligence associated with the same oils

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.080
 that you've mentioned here in terms of the mother's diet and the way that's changed in

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.080
 the last 30 or 40 years.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:09:00.720
 Yeah, last month I think I mentioned the French study that thought they were going to demonstrate

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:09.600
 improved prenatal brain function by giving these extremely unsaturated fats to the mother

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.840
 during pregnancy, and they showed just the opposite, that retarded development and retarded

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:27.240
 learning, but in the early 1970s they were already seeing that the polyunsaturated fats

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:35.560
 during pregnancy made animals develop smaller brains that learned more poorly.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.480
 Yeah, alright.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.200
 I think I wanted to go on with some of the cancers that were stated to be on the rise

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:53.440
 according to etiology and see if there's any link between the type of cancer and the environmental

00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:02.840
 effects, perhaps, of some of these chemicals in the environment with those particular organs.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:11.880
 I know the figures talk about non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and then thyroid cancer is the second

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:17.920
 one here, and then myeloid leukemia and testicular cancer.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.440
 And now these are things, I mean I'm looking at germ cell type cancers with testicular

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:30.160
 cancer and then in the myeloid cancers this is kind of, again, another, it's not germ

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.480
 cell in the terms of sex germ cells, but it's a kind of progenitor's type situation where

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:44.840
 the very fundamental cell that is being formed is subjected to this condition that it can't

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.600
 cope with and cancer arises as a result of disorganization.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.320
 And again with the lymphomas.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.080
 What they have in common is rapid growth.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:05.720
 The sperm is turning over constantly and the blood cells are in constant diffusion.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:16.960
 And irritants accelerate the growth and the polyunsaturated fats, for example, break down

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960
 the fish oil.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.920
 It is always oxidized by the time it gets into the bloodstream.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.120
 Very little of it reaches the tissues in its entire form.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:37.800
 So you get these oxidized fragments that are toxic through rapidly multiplying cells causing

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:48.400
 a deformity, atrophy in the sperm forming tissue and derangement of the development course of

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:54.440
 the blood cells leading to leukemia and lymphoma.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:00.600
 How long do you think it takes from exposure to, I mean, I'm sure it depends on how healthy

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.280
 a subject is to begin with, how much metabolic energy they are capable of producing, how

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.960
 poorly they are functioning will also be detrimental to them.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.520
 They'll probably go down quicker as it were.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.960
 But how long do you think these things might take before they start manifesting?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.440
 In these rapidly multiplying tissues, I think it's much faster than in the average cancer.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:34.040
 I think that's why leukemia has been seen so often in children just a few years old

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:42.560
 where the typical cancer, a brain cancer or a pancreas cancer, for example, usually takes

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:51.640
 20 years or more from the carcinogenic primary exposure to the appearance of the fully developed

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.840
 tumor, sometimes 40 years.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:04.760
 But you can definitely show that there's a cause connection to it, but it's long delayed.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:12.400
 And that has been useful to the polluting industries to claim that you can't show the

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.880
 cause and effect relationship.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:22.360
 But animal studies make it clear that although there is a delay, it's an absolutely causal

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.440
 process.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.040
 Do you think that younger people inherently have more resistance though to these kind

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.760
 of insults or do you think actually they're more susceptible?

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:43.320
 In some of those tissues, they're probably more susceptible because of their extreme

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.400
 speed of turning over.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:55.840
 A little deviation in the regulatory process can send them wildly off course.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:06.400
 But generally the extremely high metabolic rate and quick cell division lets young organisms

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:12.960
 bypass, they can find a way around the toxic problem and overcome it.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.960
 Okay.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.960
 All right, you're listening to Ask Urobiotic K. Medegarbovil, 91.1 FM.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.960
 From now until the end of the show, 8 o'clock, you are invited.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.320
 Well, no, from 7.30 to 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.280
 The show does stop at 8 o'clock, but if people would like to call in with any questions,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.280
 the number is 707-923-3911.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:41.080
 So Dr. Peat, I mentioned to you in talking last month about what hasn't actually surfaced

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.940
 again as another sensational headline unlike Ebola, which certainly seems to be grabbing

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.780
 the headlines along with the measles "epidemic".

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.080
 But what did you have to say about Candida auris?

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.860
 I don't think you were that impressed with some of the sensational headlines claiming

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:04.160
 it to be this superbug that's going to just become the be-all end-all of...

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.960
 The advertising I've seen connected with it strongly suggests that it's an advertising

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.960
 campaign for new drugs.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.000
 Okay, there you go.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.080
 All right.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:26.080
 So my last question related to antibiotics and when I was studying herbal medicine in

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:33.360
 1990 here, they were all talking about, you know, antibiotic resistance and superbugs

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:39.120
 and not having antibiotics to treat infections and we're all going to be in big trouble.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:44.640
 And yeah, I think to one extent or another, that's probably happening.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:52.760
 But what do you think in terms of the arsenal of antibiotics that we have to treat infections?

00:15:52.760 --> 00:16:00.480
 In Eastern Europe and Asia, long before penicillin was discovered, people were finding that there

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:10.600
 are bacteria-killing viruses, the bacteriophage, and that technology has really developed to

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.640
 a high degree that it's of no interest to the countries that have a highly developed

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.600
 pharmaceutical industry.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:27.440
 But these viruses infect only bacteria, kill certain species.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:33.440
 Bacteria never develop resistance to them and the viruses are perfectly harmless to

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.440
 mammals and people.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440
 All right.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.920
 So you think as far as you're concerned, there's enough phage research being done to produce

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:51.080
 phage is pretty much tailored for whatever organism it is that they are looking to eradicate

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.120
 or deal or treat that may have become resistant to antibiotics.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120
 You think that they are?

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120
 Yeah.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:03.160
 Some people have told their stories of being diagnosed as incurably infected with superbacteria

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.560
 going to Eastern Europe, getting totally cured quickly.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.560
 Interesting.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.560
 All right.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.440
 And again, I don't know if it's the Russians or some other Eastern...

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.400
 Yeah, Southeast, Bulgaria and Romania, I think, have a good tradition.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400
 India too.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.400
 Wow.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.840
 Yeah, I know the Indians are pretty smart people.

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.240
 I've got a lot of respect for them.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.280
 I think it's an underrated country, a lot of poor people, but some very brilliant people

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.840
 have come from there.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.840
 Okay.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:40.360
 So I wanted to talk about a subject that we did touch on a little bit last month, but

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:46.280
 I don't think we've really got into it at all, particulates and whether these particulates

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.400
 are from diesel engines.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.480
 It's been certainly mentioned in England a long time ago that the emissions from diesel

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.800
 engines were so fine that they posed a respiratory problem and something had to be done to make

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:05.200
 the engines more efficient or therefore the scrubbers and exhaust more efficient at pulling

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.880
 these things out.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:16.000
 But I read an article saying that pollution and air pollution in particular, although

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.200
 we talk about other pollution later on, but air pollution is essentially causing damage

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.520
 to every organ in the body.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:29.760
 This was a big article ran through from basically from the brain saying that this particular

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.120
 types of air pollution can be carried and transmitted up the olfactory nerve and into

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.120
 the brain.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:42.840
 Then I talked about thyroid and the lungs and in a reproductive organ saying that basically

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:50.080
 nothing was spared and that dementia and heart and lung disease were becoming increasingly

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.760
 prevalent and they're putting it down to air pollution and just saying that it's becoming

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.200
 a crisis that needs to be addressed.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.160
 Just a few months ago, the accepted number of deaths caused by air pollution was about

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:10.000
 4 million per year, but this recent World Health Organization study says it's over 8

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.280
 million, I think 8.8 million dying from air pollution.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:21.840
 I mean, certainly in developing countries, Asia I think in particular, you see pictures

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:29.520
 of the smog in China or in other capitals of the Asian world and it looks absolutely

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520
 dreadful.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.040
 It reminds me of what would have been smog in the early 1900s in England.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.160
 And obviously things like coal-fired power plants are on the increase in terms of generating

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.480
 energy to keep the economies going.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.040
 What do you think about what we're faced with?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.320
 And I've always wondered about the Redwood Coast here.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.800
 Supposedly California's got a really clean, I would imagine, I'd like to see the data,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.760
 real data for it, but after coming across thousands of miles of ocean, I would have

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.080
 imagined that the air would have been relatively clean compared to if we were on the East Coast

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.200
 and we're getting air from the West Coast and it's blowing across the whole of the States,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.080
 picking up and carrying with it.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:18.440
 We do get some smoke and dust from Chinese industry, but the West Coast is far cleaner

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.080
 than interior.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:28.320
 Coming across the ocean, it does rain out or settle out lots of material.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.040
 Okay, so from a respiratory point of view, before we get into any particular pollution,

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:40.920
 I've certainly, when I first came here in 2001, I never really thought too much about

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.840
 it, but it's kind of stayed with me for a while.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:51.520
 What they call here the Humboldt hack, and there was actually a noblest who was making

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.880
 a product that was called Humboldt Hack-A-Way, and it was pretty popular, I think, because

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.920
 there was so many people here in this area that had this persistent chronic clearing

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.240
 of the throat.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.200
 And I didn't think too much of it, but everywhere around me, I would hear people coughing and

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.080
 hacking, and lo and behold, probably four or five years ago, I started doing it myself,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:22.680
 and I'll tell you, I don't know whether or not it's a redwood allergy or if it's an allergy

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.000
 to some endemic species that lives in this area or mold.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.160
 People want to talk about the mold because of the fairly dense canopy of the forest here

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.760
 and how damp it is most of the winter, at least until the dryness of the summer comes.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:44.760
 But what do you think about that kind of respiratory allergy or a chronic infection even?

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.400
 I wonder that would be responsible for such a persistent cough.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.080
 It reminds me of something that doesn't probably end in a good way.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:02.040
 The foliage, big forests do emit quite a lot of organic material, including pollen, and

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.760
 probably is a cause of a lot of allergy.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:12.880
 I know there's a region in Texas famous for its cedar tree allergies.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:20.520
 I imagine conifer forests have people who are sensitive to their pollen.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.520
 Yeah.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.640
 Have you heard anything like that in Oregon?

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.120
 No, I haven't, surprisingly.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.960
 And when I've gone away, whenever I've gone back to England, it does generally clear up

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.280
 in the couple of three weeks that I have to go.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.520
 It certainly makes a difference.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.520
 And I'm like, wow, what is it that sensitized me to where I live?

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.000
 And I think there is something real about it.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.720
 Anyway, OK, so getting on to plastics.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.080
 I know that's another big topic.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.840
 And I saw it probably the first time about eight months ago, I think, or maybe a year

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840
 ago.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.280
 And I'd never really considered it before.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:06.600
 I think we all recognize just how ubiquitous plastic is and has been for quite some time

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.880
 now with the petrochemical companies producing it.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:20.400
 And the sea, the gyre, the one of five gyres in the world, the North Pacific gyre becoming

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.920
 this floating island of debris, bigger than Mexico.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.560
 It's probably half the size of the continent of the US.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:37.720
 And a dive was done down to the Marianas Trench, which hadn't been exceeded since the first

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.880
 dive in 1960.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.480
 Someone went down, oh, just a year ago, I think.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.840
 And lo and behold, they found down the very bottom of the Mariana Trench what appeared

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.600
 to be plastic debris.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:56.840
 And so this sparked a whole investigation into what's going on with plastics when they

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.560
 get into the environment.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:05.760
 And the breakdown of the fragmentation or defragmentation here of plastics into microplastics

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:11.360
 and how just about every animal species is becoming loaded with these microplastics.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:18.040
 I was wondering from an estrogenic perspective that these have got to be disrupting the endocrine

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:22.400
 system and being responsible for some part of the cancer makeup.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:28.400
 Yeah, plastics are in general very hydrophobic.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:35.840
 And so the things like the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are famous carcinogens,

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.560
 these concentrate on the surface of the particles.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:48.000
 And so even the particles that are macroscopic, when they're ingested, they deliver a very

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.400
 big dose, concentrated dose of these organic carcinogens that are bound to the surfaces.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:04.000
 But then there's the smaller particle is toxic in a directly structural way.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.480
 The extremely small nanoparticles pass right into the -- through the cells in the circulatory

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:16.800
 system and are taken up by cells all through the body.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:24.160
 And if you think of the scale, you know, they're extremely small compared to bacteria.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:30.760
 Compared to proteins inside the cells, they're relatively huge.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.720
 They're very foreign to the structure of the cytoplasm.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:41.320
 And so they're necessarily disruptive when they get in cells.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:50.280
 And that to the degree that their size interferes with the functions of the cytoplasm, they

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.320
 turn on alarm reactions of different kinds.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:03.760
 One kind of reaction is to make the cell leaky, giving up proteins like when the liver is

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.400
 irritated, it leaks its proteins and enzymes into the bloodstream.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:17.360
 But ATP itself leaks out when cells are structurally irritated by these particles.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:24.560
 And then the ATP is recognized as a danger signal by the environment.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.400
 And so it tends to be a self-perpetuating reaction.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.600
 Cell gets irritated, sends out ATP, which alarms other cells.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:44.880
 They leak ATP and you get a storm of cells losing their energy and creating excitement

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880
 in their environment.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.880
 Okay, even to ATP, huh?

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880
 Yeah.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.880
 Wow.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.880
 All right.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:59.360
 I looked at the bisphenol A and the other, what they call the persistent organic pollutants

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:06.680
 that were banned in the '70s, just because they recognized after they'd polluted everything

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.040
 massively that these things were so persistent in the environment that they needed to do

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.160
 something about it because not only would they just not break down and be persistent

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:21.680
 for a long time, they were taken up by the fat tissue of any animal that would consume

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:29.160
 it, and so pass up the food chain and ride up to us, obviously, as we talk about the

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:36.600
 oceans being contaminated with plastics and microplastics, the fish that we eat and the

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.680
 shellfish that we eat.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.640
 And I wanted to ask you about the shellfish.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.120
 I know you're a big advocate of shellfish for micronutrients and things that you won't

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.240
 typically get from terrestrial organisms, but I looked at an article talking about mussels

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.920
 in England and the people that would collect mussels and harvest them, and I think in Ireland

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:01.480
 also on the West Coast, it's a relatively good source of food that people can gather

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.040
 easily.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:09.640
 But these little crustaceans here, they can pick up the same microplastics as well as

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:19.080
 these other compounds, and I wonder at what point does the negative effect of any of that

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:24.280
 outweigh the beneficial effect of anything that's obtained from them rather than terrestrial

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280
 creatures?

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.160
 Because I've always, I guess I've always steered clear of fish for the last 15 years or so

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.280
 since I started finding out just how much pollution there was in the ocean in terms

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.480
 of heavy metals and other compounds.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:49.080
 Like the organic compounds, the plastic particles tend to be concentrated up the food chain

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.400
 since they aren't well detoxified.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.760
 Bigger older organisms are the ones that are most polluted and dangerous.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:08.280
 So years ago we stopped eating the large fish.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:15.160
 Orange ruffe and halibut, for example, live a very long time and accumulate huge amounts

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.160
 of toxins.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160
 Yeah, for sure.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:24.080
 I did a similar thing about two years ago once it started becoming just more and more

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080
 relevant.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.520
 I think for the longest time I wanted to go fishing and was, I don't know, it has never

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.820
 really happened.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.520
 And I think as time went on it just became more probably relevant that I shouldn't go

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.680
 fishing because actually the fish wasn't that good.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:43.440
 And so in the end I ran five, I think, different types of fish that were caught here locally

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.720
 on the West Coast just out in Shelter Cove where we live.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:54.040
 And I sent it to a lab in Washington that we run our herb material through ICP-MS, which

00:29:54.040 --> 00:30:01.040
 is an induction coupled mass spectrometry, and picking out specifically the California

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:06.760
 Prop 65 compounds that we need to closely watch and be in compliance with in terms of

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.640
 production of our medicinal herbs.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.180
 So arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury were the things that we were looking at in our herbs

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.600
 and I sent fish samples to the laboratory up in Washington to sample and I was staggered

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.480
 actually at what came back.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:27.680
 And there was definitely a correlation between the larger fish, so between tuna, salmon,

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.400
 cod and bottom fish.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.880
 They were in descending order loaded with mercury.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.440
 I wasn't able to speciate the mercury to see whether it was methylmercury or some other

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.560
 compound but they had the same thing with cadmium too in arsenic and way higher than

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:52.440
 any animal product that I sent to the same lab in terms of wild game that was hunted,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.440
 whether it was elk or deer locally.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.280
 That was very clean comparatively.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:04.440
 So it's always put me off eating fish even though it comes from California and California

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.800
 is supposedly really clean and we'd like to believe that our air is clean and the water's

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.800
 clean and we live actually in a very special place.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:17.680
 It's so unfortunate that there is a worldwide polluted ocean.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.640
 I don't think there's any real escape from it, is there?

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:30.840
 No, that information is part of why I'm an advocate of milk because you start with moderately

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:41.680
 polluted vegetation, a cow eats it and sends it to the rumen where bacteria and fungus,

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:48.840
 various microorganisms break it down and process it, eliminate many of the toxic materials

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.360
 on the microbial level.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:32:03.560
 Then it's filtered into the animal's bloodstream and filtered again into the mammary gland

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.640
 for levels of extremely efficient filtering.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:13.000
 So milk is probably the safest food by a wide margin.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.280
 All right, let me just ask the engineer, I guess I'd like to go on that but I still hear

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.800
 you and I still see him so I think we're all good even though the lights are going out.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.120
 I've seen the lights flashing there in the studio so I don't know if we have any callers

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.120
 on there or not.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.360
 Oh, the lights are coming back on.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:36.840
 We had a caller who was asking the doctor to speak to the ingredient in Roundup, the

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:37.840
 glycosylate, the glyphosate.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.840
 That's correct.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:43.440
 Well, let me just let people know, you're listening to Ask Your Obed Doctor, K.M.D.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.520
 Probable, 91.1 FM, from now to 8 o'clock, callers are invited to call in with any questions

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:57.680
 either related to plastics pollution, environmental pollution, cancer, etc., etc., caused by pollution

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.240
 and the rise in it and how to mitigate that.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.720
 I'll be asking Dr. Peat in a bit here some of the strategies that can be probably best

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.120
 employed.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:11.760
 And also, it doesn't really matter if the question is unrelated to this month's show

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.880
 but the number is 707-923-3911.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:21.040
 So Dr. Peat, I think that person who hung up was asking about glyphosate and I saw that

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:28.720
 there had been massive punitive damages awarded recently for that product by people that have

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.080
 gotten cancer, unfortunately.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:38.360
 30 or 40 years ago, I knew people who had studied biology at the Oregon State University,

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:46.760
 a land grant university which specializes in agriculture and really their education

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:53.560
 is highly guided by industry, by the pesticide and herbicide industry.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:34:01.160
 They were telling me that Roundup is specifically toxic to plants so it can't hurt animals.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:12.920
 They simply were taught that there are some kind of biological ultimate distinctions between

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:18.720
 plant cells and animal cells but really we have so much in common that it's not at all

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.120
 surprising that Roundup is extremely toxic to animals too.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:31.400
 It's funny, I just got a little one line here that I saw in an article that in Germany,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.480
 they say that the young men there have been found to produce only a third of the sperm

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.280
 that German men did 30 years ago.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:47.800
 What do you think about virility and spermatogenesis amongst men and that probably ties into pollution

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.840
 and just decreased energy?

00:34:50.840 --> 00:35:01.920
 Yeah, everything, many things are called phytoestrogens and pseudoestrogens and so on but anything

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:10.800
 injurious creates inflammation and the inflammation leads to the production of estrogen and so

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:19.840
 anything that is toxic is going to reduce a man's testosterone, sperm production and

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.160
 in general virility.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.280
 So let me ask you about phytoestrogens just for the record here because when I was studying

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:35.400
 herbal medicine, back then I was under the misguided belief that phytoestrogens were

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:41.520
 good for females with menopausal hot flashes and that they were beneficial and then I think

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.320
 you just said no.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.000
 So what are your thoughts on your take on phytoestrogens and how they interact in the

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.680
 body so women that maybe might have been using black cohosh or wild yam or other phytoestrogenic

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.960
 herbs are actually not doing what they should be doing because we all recognize now that

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.520
 progesterone is really what you need.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:10.320
 Some of the herbs are anti-prolactin rather than specifically anti-estrogen.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.160
 Right, that would be Vitex perhaps.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:21.920
 So that can be very protective and the official concept of what's estrogenic is what sticks

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:32.480
 to the so-called estrogen receptor but the estrogen receptor, even in the total absence

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:40.360
 of estrogen, if you injure the cell or cut off the oxygen supply, the estrogen receptor

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:50.680
 goes through its actions of acting like estrogen is present so that it's somewhat of a coincidence

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.680
 that a substance binds to the estrogen receptor.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:02.000
 It doesn't mean that it's going to activate estrogen-like processes.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.360
 It can inactivate the estrogen system depending on what it does to that protein.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:22.360
 So the estrogenic substances really, a lot of them have been called phytoestrogens but

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:30.960
 what they're doing is either decreasing or intensifying the cell's energy production.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:38.120
 Estrogen characteristically acts like the loss of oxygen and so if you have something

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.080
 that in effect suffocates the cell, that's estrogenic.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.720
 If you have a so-called phytoestrogen, it might stick to the estrogen receptor but if

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:55.440
 it is an oxidant and activates, catalyzes the oxidative processes, then it's acting as an

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.440
 anti-estrogen.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.200
 Okay, let's hold it there, Dr. Peat.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.240
 There's a couple of callers online that have been busy flashing away in the studio.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.360
 So let's see this first caller.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.360
 First caller, you're on the air.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.360
 Okay, I have a question.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:14.640
 We have not vaccinated our six-year-old and being in California now, it looks like we're

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:21.800
 going to have to even with the doctors exempt to be in school and I'm just curious if there's

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:27.040
 any kind of like herbal or any, like if we do decide to do something with the baby, is

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:33.120
 there any kind of like herbal or any kind of like any kind of like any kind of like

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:38.800
 I'm curious if there's any kind of like herbal or any like if we do decide to vaccinate,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:44.640
 I'm just curious if there's things you can do on the herbal medicine realm or boosting

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.680
 immune system or anything like that.

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:48.680
 Right, okay.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.880
 All right, well, it's definitely a controversial subject and one for which we're called anti-vaxxers

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.840
 because we have two children and they're both in the same situation.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:05.000
 We never did vaccinate and we don't intend to vaccinate and they're beautiful, healthy

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.880
 young children and hopefully they'll stay that way.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.680
 I think we've done shows in the past on vaccines and I know Dr. Peat will speak to it.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:23.240
 Having had some personal interactions with vaccine, stroke damage and mitigating the

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.240
 effects of the condition.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:32.680
 Dr. Peat, first, how do you feel about anti-vaxxers?

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:49.640
 Oh, I think many of them are far better informed than the doctors who ran against.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:58.360
 Suzanne Humphreys, for example, I think she was a kidney specialist who noticed that when

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:05.240
 your patients were vaccinated at admission, they got worse than the patients who weren't

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:12.560
 vaccinated and she asked the hospital to stop vaccinating her patients and had a fight with

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:21.400
 the hospital officials and decided to specialize studying what happens with vaccinations for

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.400
 several years.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.160
 So she's really well informed on it.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:34.160
 And the doctors I see ranting about the anti-vaxxers are generally either totally ignorant and

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.160
 incompetent or they're lying.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:46.400
 It's just a very simple question that there have been national waves like an epidemic

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:55.840
 of narcolepsy in Finland and another country following a big wave of vaccinations.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:04.760
 It's well established that the aluminum hydroxide, which is in more than 100 vaccines, is one

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.000
 of the systemically toxic pro-inflammatory particles.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.640
 It's added to the vaccine simply because it arouses a generalized systemic inflammation

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:26.560
 that makes the body react more intensely to whatever antigen related disease might be

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560
 present.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:36.000
 And that same generalized unfocused inflammatory reaction caused by the particles is exactly

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.040
 what turns on autoimmunity and other degenerative processes.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.040
 Okay.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:48.320
 I mean, it's not a short answer to your question, Cora.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.400
 In terms of, okay, so you asked what could be done early.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.360
 I think as appropriate as that is your nutrition.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:02.280
 Dr. Peat is a big advocate of getting very good whole nutrition.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.600
 So your diet is very important and obviously things that lower your metabolic energy like

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.440
 the polyunsaturates to be avoided.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.560
 You certainly want to be looking at keeping your bowel clean.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:19.720
 So you want to be avoiding bread, gluten, etc., those kinds of sources.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:26.240
 But from an energy point of view, things that support your thyroid, and I'm not just saying

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:32.280
 this is going to protect you against smallpox, you know, if smallpox starts suddenly reappearing.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:38.200
 But basically, I think the metabolic energy of our people has gotten to a point where

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.320
 we're on the edge of being sick.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.520
 And so I think the vitality of our civilization has definitely decreased with all the environmental

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:53.840
 toxins or pollutants, the rubbish in the food chain and the kind of lifestyles that we've

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.120
 engendered by not working like we used to.

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.080
 I think it all promotes a weaker organism.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:06.400
 So urbanly in that regard, there are certainly things that you can do that would be supportive

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.240
 of biological energy production.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:16.760
 I was going to ask Dr. Peat a question about the liver in terms of being responsible for

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.760
 metabolizing waste.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.560
 But I know there's another couple of callers on the line here.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:24.920
 So I want to make sure we get time for them and they can ask Dr. Peat the questions on

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:25.920
 that.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.520
 But in terms of being an anti-vacciner, I think one of the most important takeaways

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.760
 from the vaccination thing is it's not per se anti-vaccines.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.840
 There are definitely vaccines at work.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.500
 There's no doubt about it.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:48.080
 But I think what it is, it's just the prevalence and the increasing numbers given simultaneously

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.720
 which have really caused the problems.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:55.600
 And I think it's becoming a machine and very much a profit-driven machine which is actually

00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:04.160
 causing the problems, not the altruistic desire from humanitarian doctors to save children

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.160
 from disease.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.840
 I don't think anybody wants to avoid that for one second.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.320
 So it's a kind of hot topic and I think I'd probably better leave it there for right now

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.260
 because we do have a couple of other callers on the line.

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.680
 So next caller, can we get where you're from and what's your question?

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:27.840
 Well, one of the callers asked me to ask the doctor how he feels about flax versus fish

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840
 oil.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840
 Probably not much better.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.160
 It's probably not quite as bad.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.960
 Dr. Peat, flax oil versus?

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.080
 Much better in some ways.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.880
 But it is slightly more stable than fish oil.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:50.320
 The fish oil luckily is very quickly degraded.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:58.480
 The flax is a little more persistent and so it can be more toxic in the long run.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:03.080
 The other question we had was whether the doctor would recommend bentonite for clay

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.880
 for flushing toxins.

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:16.160
 You know, the clay is slightly soluble in stomach acid and releases at least a little

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:23.760
 aluminum and other toxins and the particles, being very fine particles, are susceptible

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:33.880
 to persorption when, especially if your intestine is irritated, the contraction can force these

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:42.600
 particles right into the bloodstream and the particle size can be as much as ten times

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:49.720
 the diameter of a red blood cell and so particles getting into the circulatory system can cause

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.160
 considerable microscopic damage.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.560
 Okay, thanks for that.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.880
 There is another caller on the air.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.240
 So let me just let people know that from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:05.440
 invited to call in with questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of pollution,

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.440
 environmental pollution, etc.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.440
 Number 707-923-3911.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:13.240
 Okay, so let's take this next caller.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.080
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.080
 Would that be me?

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.080
 Yes, that would be you.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.080
 What's your question and where are you from?

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.080
 Oh, nice.

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:26.640
 I'm in Phillipsville and I want to thank Dr. Peat for coming on and thank you for bringing

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.000
 this wisdom to us.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.800
 My question is about there's new research about highly sensitive personalities and excess

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:42.920
 cortisol in the bloodstream and I'm wondering what Dr. Peat thinks about people who live

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:48.880
 with, you know, gushers of cortisol day to day.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.320
 And yeah, thank you and I'll take that off the air.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.320
 Okay.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:58.280
 Dr. Peat, high cortisol exposure, what do you think is the outcome?

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:06.600
 There are lots of things you can do starting with oxidative metabolism, doing things that

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:14.080
 preserve your thyroid function and when your thyroid is functioning efficiently, you can

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:22.320
 turn your cholesterol fairly massively into pregnenolone, progesterone and DHEA, which

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:28.960
 are the main opponents of cortisol.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:35.840
 Cortisol stops inflammation but it activates a lot of degenerative breakdown processes

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:43.280
 when it isn't backed up by large amounts of these three anti-inflammatory stabilizing

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.440
 steroids.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:53.600
 And so thyroid and good nutrition, adequate protein, vitamin A, vitamin D, all of the

00:47:53.600 --> 00:48:03.320
 nutrients help you do the conversion to DHEA, progesterone and pregnenolone to block and

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.200
 neutralize and reverse the effects of the cortisol.

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200
 Okay.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.760
 All right, Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you personally what you think about a strategy

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:21.200
 to improve the liver's function to metabolize waste.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.960
 Do you think that's, I mean, from a herbal perspective, it's a no-brainer because, you

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.960
 know, they would talk about hepatorestoratives, liver supportive herbs, you know, that you

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.240
 can find studies just everywhere showing that either milk thistle is very helpful for the

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:41.440
 liver or schizandra or any number of bitters or other compounds that are shown to have

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.600
 either antioxidant or hepatoprotective effects.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:50.240
 But what do you think of the rationale of improving the liver's function, I mean, to

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.480
 metabolize waste and to clear it more efficiently from circulation?

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.520
 Do you think that's relevant?

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:04.400
 And all of the tissues apparently have taste receptors, especially for bitter.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:11.720
 And so the bitters are acting on these particular receptors to have a calming, stabilizing effect

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.480
 all through the body.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:21.600
 But the whole energy and protein synthesizing system is involved in detoxifying it.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:33.480
 It uses glucose or fructose, turning it into both vitamin C in most animals, but in humans

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:41.120
 only to glucuronic acid, which is then attached to toxins for excretion.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:49.960
 And if you're well nourished, have the B vitamins, adequate carbohydrate and protein, then your

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.880
 liver is pretty efficient.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:59.920
 It can catch toxic substances, especially hydrophobic materials.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:06.720
 It has proteins that can catch massive amounts of these things out of the circulation, holding

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:15.920
 them for as much as 24 hours while the enzymes degrade it, either break it down into other

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:26.080
 substances or attach glucuronic acid or sulfate to make it water soluble for excretion.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:34.760
 And polyunsaturated fatty acids can be processed and excreted in the same way to prevent the

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:37.120
 damage that oxidizing them does.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.120
 All right.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.400
 Now, you mentioned bitters and I just wanted to pick on that quickly because we have another

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.600
 caller here.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:47.640
 So these would be the kind of things that we would traditionally use in the herbal world

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:55.720
 for increasing stomach acid, for pepsin production, to increase digestion and assimilation.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.720
 And reduce inflammation.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.600
 Yeah, you're saying, OK, to reduce it, bitters to reduce inflammation.

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:04.680
 So tell me how you link those two.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:13.760
 There is a protein, the same that we have in our tongues, the stomach and liver tissue,

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:24.400
 various lungs, the whole respiratory system can detect the bitter substance.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.800
 And in doing so, it activates an anti-inflammatory process.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.800
 Interesting.

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.800
 All right.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800
 Let's get this next caller on the air.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.800
 Caller, where are you from?

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.800
 What's your question?

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.480
 I'm Mike from Connecticut.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.840
 And I have a question following up on that point.

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.840
 Go ahead.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:45.200
 I wanted to have Dr. Peat's view on the use of supplemental digestive enzymes like lipase,

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:51.720
 protease, or peptase to help break down the food and help absorb the nutrients before

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.560
 it gets to the gut, to the bacteria that prevent from feeding them.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.280
 Is that of any use?

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.280
 OK.

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.600
 Are you suffering with any malabsorption or that kind of thing that's got you interested

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.880
 in digestive enzymes?

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:10.320
 I have a weak digestion, so I usually have troubles in the upper stomach.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.760
 And usually warm, hot foods help.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.840
 Cold foods are a little harsher on my system.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.840
 OK.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.520
 Dr. Peat, I know you're a little skeptical on a wide range of supplements.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:27.360
 But how about digestive enzymes in terms of if there are any good digestive enzymes manufactured

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.600
 out there that are, I mean, obviously...

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:35.880
 The traditional thing was basically dehydrated animal pancreas tissue.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:41.660
 And those are so similar to our own enzymes that they really do work.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:49.640
 But you have to be cautious that because they're simply dehydrated, they are a potential source

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:50.640
 of infection.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:53:02.040
 But I'm skeptical about the enzymes derived from fungus because in the same way you can't

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.600
 absolutely purify them.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.400
 And so they're going to drag along some of the fungal antigens.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:15.440
 And you have to watch out for allergic reactions because if you're sensitive to the fungus

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.760
 antigens, you might react to their enzymes.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760
 OK.

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:24.360
 I know that we used to produce a product called...

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:28.040
 Well, actually we had two.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:35.520
 We had digestive bitters, which was an herb extract from about nine different herbs.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.360
 And this is for the corner.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:42.840
 That were based on the Swedish bitters.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.400
 And then, so they were mainly the bitters that we mentioned, Dr. Peat mentioned, that

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:54.080
 would stimulate stomach acid production, pepsin, lipase, you know, it get the stomach moving

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.800
 and other things to break down fats, etc., etc.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.920
 And I've got some very good feedback when we were producing this product.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:10.540
 So I think herbally, it's always the rationale there to use bitters, using the taste receptors

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:17.280
 as a physiological trigger to increase motility and production of enzymes.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.880
 And these would certainly be beneficial.

00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:27.240
 I find people, when I consult with them, have widely differing results with digestive enzymes.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:33.080
 But I do find a lot of the bitter herbs in the armament of herbal medicine actually very

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.680
 effective for poor digestion or fat malabsorption, etc.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.680
 Great.

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680
 I'll look into it.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680
 Thank you.

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.680
 Yeah.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:42.680
 Thank you for your call.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.680
 Okay.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.160
 So, Dr. Peat, I had a couple, let's do a quick question.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:52.400
 I wanted to know, okay, probably too big for the last couple of minutes we have.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:55:01.540
 But just looking at the political will of the governments to do the right thing in terms

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:09.400
 of, I saw that a figure that coal-fired power plants are actually on a decline, surprisingly,

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.760
 although I know the current administration had vowed to increase them from the previous

00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:16.800
 administration's will to reduce them.

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:23.120
 But that the developing countries like China and Asia and India especially are starting

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:28.520
 to produce lots of power stations to get their economies going because that's just the way

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.460
 it's been done traditionally.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.380
 What do you think about the political will to make the world a cleaner place?

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:37.720
 If you can answer that in one minute or so, that would be great.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:44.840
 I can mention a book that is very important on that issue called The Politics of Cancer

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:52.680
 by Samuel Epstein, written in 1978 with publication date.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:56:02.920
 And he shows that the knowledge of how to prevent most cancer has been around for almost

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:11.240
 a hundred years, but the corporations that pollute run the government agencies.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:18.000
 And the agencies that you would think should be protecting the public, American Cancer

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:26.880
 Society, National Cancer Institute, many research organizations and universities are funded

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:33.920
 so generously by the polluting industries that they are working against the public,

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:40.840
 even though the public pays them, pays the government and these foundations supposedly

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:50.240
 for their protection, actually, that they're simply perpetuating the polluting.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240
 Depressing.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.240
 Depressing.

00:56:52.240 --> 00:57:00.280
 Well, let's, on that note, let's let everyone be reminded, The Politics of Cancer, if I've

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:05.720
 got that right, by Samuel Epstein, could be well worth looking at on the internet.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.000
 Maybe get a copy of it and read it.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.280
 Probably really educate yourself about what Dr. Peat's just mentioned about the mechanism

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.280
 of it all.

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.280
 Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:16.640
 Okay, thank you.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.000
 Okay, so for those people that have listened to the show and want to find out more about

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:30.280
 Dr. Peat's papers, his research, his written works, etc., www.rayPeat.com.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.240
 And for people who want to find out more about myself and our business, it's Western Botanical

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.240
 Medicine.

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:41.720
 I want to make people aware that there's going to be an Instagram page launched here, hopefully

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:48.120
 within the next six weeks to two months at the most, about Dr. Peat's work and put it

00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:53.400
 in audio clips that we have produced since 2007 so that it's actually the words he's

00:57:53.400 --> 00:58:00.160
 saying because I find a lot of misconstrued information on other, supposedly, Dr. Peat

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.400
 advocating sites.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:05.740
 So I want to set the record straight and that will be on an Instagram page called Western

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:08.600
 Botanical Medicine, I think, at this point.

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:10.000
 And thanks so much for listening.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.040
 Until the third Friday of next month, good night.
