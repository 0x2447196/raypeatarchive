00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.360
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.800
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.400
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.100
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.260
 We manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts, which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.600
 or which are sourced from other certified organic suppliers.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.400
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.500
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.400
 either related or unrelated to this month's continuing topic on the thyroid, its role in health,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.900
 and the use of coconut oil as a means of weight loss and improved thyroid function.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.400
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.000
 Or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD, which is 568 3723.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.400
 So we can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for further questions during normal business hours, Monday through Friday.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:21.700
 So to carry on from last month's expose on the polyunsaturated versus saturated fat controversy that's raging right now,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.400
 I wanted to mention right from the get-go that some of this material has been copied from Dr. Ray Peet,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.400
 and that this material is not something that we have produced, although in between the other excerpts, the material is ours.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:46.200
 So I wanted to carry on, like I said, from last month and just carry on this expose of a fairly startling turnaround,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.700
 for some people at least, in the belief that polyunsaturated fats are good and that saturated fats are bad.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 And actually, it's seemingly very much the other way around,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.200
 and that our ancestors and our grandparents had it right the first time around,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.700
 eating lots of saturated fat, animal fats, eating butter, milk, cream, dairy products,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:19.700
 were very healthy and actually had very, very low incidences of cancer, diabetes and obesity, things which have shot up since the 1920s.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.700
 So a lot of things that we're going to say for some people will be cheeringly applauded by those people perhaps who are in their 50s and 60s,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.700
 or a little older even, who used to eat just the same kind of things that we're going to be covering and talking about,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.700
 and to another group of people, might be very shocking.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.700
 I don't mean to shock people, but I just want to make these other viewpoints known,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 so that those people who do find some thread of truth in it can actually hold on to it and find out more.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.200
 Most of this information is freely available on the web, and the web is increasing in popularity as time goes on,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.700
 as a source of material for all different viewpoints, and the truth is out there.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.700
 If you just want to search for it, you will find it.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.700
 So I wanted to carry on. The whole end of the war, the Second World War,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.700
 essentially the seed oil industry was in a crisis point, and the traditional use of seed oils,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.700
 such as flax seed oil in paints and plastics, was being displaced by new compounds made from petroleum,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.700
 and the industry itself needed new markets.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.700
 It was discovered that ways to convince the public that seed oils were better than animal fats were introduced,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.700
 and they called their seed oils "heart protective",

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.700
 even though human studies soon showed the same results that the animal studies had,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.700
 namely that they were toxic to the heart and increased the incidence of cancer.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.700
 This all came about from the 1920s and 1930s experiments with animals on feedlots

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.700
 that were basically put there for the last six or eight weeks of their life to increase their weight,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.700
 become more saleable and more valuable by having an increased portion of fat on their bodies.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.700
 Essentially they started using coconut oil,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.700
 which was basically a fairly cheap imported tropical oil that was a saturated fat,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.700
 that they believed would be a pretty good feed source for cattle and other ruminant animals

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.700
 to increase their weight gain prior to slaughter, and that would help the industry,

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.700
 and would help the farmers, and everyone would get more money, and that the product would be appreciated.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.700
 So they started feeding these animals coconut oil, a saturated fat,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.700
 and lo and behold, rather than gaining weight, the animals actually lost weight.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.700
 Anyway, so they soon changed their plans there from coconut oil,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.700
 they suddenly switched to corn oil and soy oil.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.700
 Now when they did that, lo and behold, the animals started gaining weight,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.700
 so they suddenly thought, "Okay, well this was a good idea."

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.700
 Soy and corn did the trick, put lots of weight on animals,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.700
 even though these animals would never be eating it, like coconut oil, they'd never be eating that either,

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.700
 but as a foodstuff it was certainly a hit in terms of gaining weight on the animals.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.700
 But essentially the long-term effects of these fats and oils were pretty toxic,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.700
 and the animals themselves were certainly unable to continue eating this for more than seven or eight weeks

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.700
 before they started getting very serious inflammatory disorders that were eventually life-threatening and would kill them.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.700
 So eight weeks was about as much as they could feed these animals

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.700
 before they started dying of gastrointestinal disorders from eating these products

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.700
 that they should never be eating in the first place, so that doesn't surprise anybody.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.700
 So ultimately the coconut oil was thrown out, and a huge campaign was started to alert the American public

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.700
 that these cheap tropical imported oils were not very good for you, they were toxic,

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.700
 and actually that they should be kicked out, and that the alternatives would be USA-grown corn and soy.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.700
 And lo and behold with the chemical and pharmaceutical industry behind this,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:11.700
 fairly big players in pharmaceutical production, was that the corn and the soy were there again,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.700
 other very important crops to be genetically engineered, and the seeds to be owned,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.700
 so that they were a product that could be sold and owned independently,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.700
 rather than a wild product, a wild seed that no one had the rights to and that people could get freely.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.700
 So soy and corn soon became rapidly two very big US crops,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.700
 and rapidly the information was disseminated that soy and corn were very good for you,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.700
 they were polyunsaturated, they were good for your heart, they were good for cholesterol,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.700
 they were good for lots of things and everyone should be eating lots of it.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:49.700
 And the propaganda was promoted by a lot of money, and soon it became very commonplace

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.700
 that these oils were good for you and that everyone should be eating it,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.700
 and so obviously the natural production of these two crops rapidly increased,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.700
 as did the awareness, or the false awareness that these things were good for you.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.700
 So getting on to the point that the animals were fed these things and they gained weight,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.700
 despite the widespread acceptance that the lipid hypothesis which would cover this

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.700
 has never really been proven, an oil researcher, Mary Enig, PhD, and Sally Fallon,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.700
 founder and director of the Western A. Price Foundation,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.700
 point out in their article called "The Secrets of the Edible Oil Industry"

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:35.700
 that the lipid theory was first proposed by David Kritschepsky, a Russian researcher,

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.700
 who in 1954 published a paper describing the effects of feeding cholesterol to rabbits.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.700
 Now by showing that polyunsaturated oils from vegetable sources

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.700
 lowered serum cholesterol at least temporarily in humans, says Enig,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.700
 Kritschepsky appeared to show that the findings from the animal trials

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.700
 were relevant to the coronary heart disease problem,

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.700
 that the lipid hypothesis was a valid explanation for the new epidemic of heart disease,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.700
 and that by reducing animal products in their diets, Americans could avoid heart disease.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.700
 So soon the United States was on an anti-cholesterol campaign.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:18.700
 In 1956, an American Heart Association fundraiser was shown on all three major TV networks.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:24.700
 Panelists presented the lipid hypothesis as the cause of America's heart disease epidemic

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.700
 and recommended a prudent diet in which corn oil, margarine, and chicken

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.700
 replaced butter, lard, beef, and eggs.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.700
 But the panel was not unanimous.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:42.700
 Dudley White, MD, Dr. Dudley White, disagreed with his AHA colleagues

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.700
 by noting that heart disease in the form of myocardial infarction, MI,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:55.700
 was nonexistent in 1900, when egg consumption was three times what it was in 1956,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.700
 and when corn oil was completely unavailable.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.700
 I mean, who would have ever thought of making oil from corn anyways?

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:09.700
 How much corn would you have to squeeze or process or do what to to get a teaspoon of oil?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.700
 When pressed to support the prudent diet, Dr. White replied,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:23.700
 "See here, I began my practice as a cardiologist in 1921, and I never saw an MI patient until 1928.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
 Back in the MI-free days before 1920, the fats were butter and lard,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.700
 and I think we would all benefit from the kind of diet we had at that time,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.700
 when no one had ever heard the words 'corn oil.'"

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.700
 But unfortunately, his observations fell on deaf ears,

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:44.700
 and ads in the Journal of the American Medical Association described Wesson oil.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.700
 I'm sure a lot of people have heard of Wesson oil.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.700
 It's a famous corn oil manufacturer.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:56.700
 So the AMA described Wesson oil as a "cholesterol depressant."

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.700
 Mazola, another large corn oil company,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.700
 advertisements claimed that "science finds corn oil important to your health,"

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:11.700
 and medical journal ads recommended Fleischmann's unsalted margarine for patients with high blood pressure.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.700
 Dr. Frederick Stare, head of Harvard University's Nutrition Department,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.700
 wrote a syndicated column in which he encouraged the consumption of up to a cup of corn oil per day.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.700
 Great.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:29.700
 Meanwhile, experimenters found that feeding a diet that totally lacked the essential fatty acids

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.700
 produced animals with remarkable properties.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:40.700
 "They consumed oxygen and calories at a very high rate," says Dr. Rapey.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.700
 "Their mitochondria were unusually tough and stable.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.700
 Their tissues could be transplanted into other animals without provoking immunological rejection,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.700
 and they were very hard to kill by trauma and a wide variety of toxins

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:00.700
 that easily provoked lethal shock in animals on the usual polyunsaturated oil diet."

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.700
 As German researchers had seen in 1927,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.700
 they had a low susceptibility to cancer,

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.700
 and new studies showed that they weren't susceptible to various fibrotic conditions,

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.700
 including alcoholic liver cirrhosis.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.700
 Dr. Mary Eneg points out that other researchers conducted population studies

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.700
 that showed that the animal model used by Krzyzewski,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.700
 especially one that used vegetarian animals,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:31.700
 was not a valid approach to the problem of heart disease in human omnivores.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:38.700
 She cites studies conducted in the 1950s showing that the presence of arterial plaque,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.700
 which is considered a symptom of heart disease,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.700
 is a natural process that has nothing to do with diet.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:53.700
 American soldiers killed during the Korean War had similar amounts of severity of plaque, 75%,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:58.700
 as Japanese natives whose diet was lower in animal products, at 65%.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.700
 And the largely vegetarian Bantu in South Africa had just as much occlusions

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.700
 or plaque buildup in their arteries as other races in South Africa who ate more meat.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.700
 In 1957, Dr. Norman Jolliffe,

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.700
 director of the Nutritional Bureau of the New York Health Department,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.700
 launched an anti-coronary club for businessmen aged 40 to 59.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.700
 All were placed on the previously mentioned prudent diet,

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:32.700
 and results were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1966.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.700
 Those on the prudent diet of corn oil, margarine, fish, chicken, and cold cereal

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:43.700
 had an average serum cholesterol 30 points lower than the meat and potatoes control group,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.700
 but the more important statistics were the heart disease deaths of eight prudent diet followers,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.700
 while none of those who ate meat three times a day died.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.700
 Jolliffe himself died in 1961 from a vascular thrombosis,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:02.700
 although his obituaries listed the cause of death as complications from diabetes.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.700
 Larger follow-up studies produced the same results,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.700
 and an ambitious million-man diet heart study was abandoned for reasons of cost

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.700
 when its chairman died of a heart attack.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.700
 In the 1960s, interest in organ transplantation led to the discovery

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:24.700
 that polyunsaturated fats prolonged graft survival by suppressing the immune system.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.700
 Immunosuppression was considered to have a role

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.700
 in the carcinogenicity of the essential fatty acids, says Dr. Peet.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.700
 So just to reiterate that, the polyunsaturated fatty acids suppress the immune system.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.700
 That's the crux of that last sentence, isn't it?

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:48.700
 Yes, so in the 1960s, they found that if people who had just recently had an organ transplant,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.700
 if they were taking in a lot of polyunsaturated fats in their diet,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:59.700
 their immune system was suppressed and they didn't reject the transplant.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.700
 At around the same time, there were studies showing that unsaturated fats

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.700
 retarded brain development and produced obesity.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.700
 In addition, the age-related glycation products that are usually blamed on sugar

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.700
 are largely the result of peroxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.700
 Okay, that's one of the other important things about the polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:25.700
 is because they are polyunsaturated, they're very susceptible to lipid peroxidation,

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.700
 which is oxidation of the molecule, because they're not stable.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.700
 Unlike saturated fats, they're completely saturated,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.700
 their bonds are saturated, and they're very stable oils.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.700
 And they don't go rancid very quickly.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.700
 I mean, coconut oil has a very long shelf life.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.700
 Through the 1970s, information about the harmful effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.700
 was slowly being assimilated.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.700
 And by 1980, it looked as though reasonable researchers would see the promotion of cancer,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.700
 heart disease, mitochondrial damage, hypothyroidism, and immune suppression

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.700
 caused by these polyunsaturated fats as their most important feature,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.700
 and they would see that there had never been a basis for believing that these were essential fats.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.700
 But then, without acknowledging that there had ever been a problem with the doctrine of essentiality,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.700
 fat researchers just started changing the subject,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.700
 shifting public discourse to safer, more profitable topics.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.700
 As a result, the old discredited theories about polyunsaturated fats are alive and well

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:33.700
 for the past 68 years, and so are the inaccurate health claims that replace them.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.700
 Most of us are so used to hearing that saturated fats harm health,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.700
 while polyunsaturated fats improve it,

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:46.700
 but the recommendations of experts like Dr. Mary Enig, Dr. Ray Peet, and Dr. Bruce Fife

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.700
 require mental adjustments.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.700
 Get acquainted with pasture-fed butter, lard, and tallow products,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.700
 and other traditionally saturated fats like coconut oil.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.700
 Throw away the canola, corn, sunflower, safflower, sesame, soy.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.700
 Stay away from anything that contains polyunsaturated fats.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.700
 Kiss tofu goodbye and forget soy milk, soy yogurt, soy cheese, soy protein, and soy lecithin.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.700
 For good measure, says Dr. Peet, stay away from commercially raised chicken.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.700
 Animals that eat polyunsaturated fats don't produce saturated fat.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.700
 Dr. Peet explains, when you eat their meat, you're eating polyunsaturated fat

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.700
 with all of the adverse effects of soy and corn oil.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.700
 Because polyunsaturated fats are perceived as healthful,

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.700
 the meat, milk, and egg industries are working on ways to promote these products,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.700
 which are incredibly harmful, as desired.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.700
 The beef industry is doing so, he says, by treating soy oil

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.700
 so that it won't be broken down in the cattle's rumen.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.700
 I think that's a factor in causing scrapie and mad cow disease, he says,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.700
 since it was already established that the equivalent disease in chickens,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.700
 called crazy chick syndrome, is caused by too much polyunsaturated fat in the diet.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:01.700
 Chickens don't have a rumen, so they are much more susceptible to these oils than cows and sheep.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.700
 Okay, it's 7.18 now. You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED 91.1.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.700
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.700
 with any questions, either related or unrelated, to this month's topic,

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.700
 which is a continuation on the thyroid gland, its role in the health and maintenance of the human body,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:26.700
 and coconut oil as a means to lose weight and improve your thyroid function.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:35.700
 Okay, so in 1995, researchers studied 25,862 participants

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.700
 at the Colorado Statewide Health Fair.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.700
 They discovered that among patients not taking thyroid medication,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:51.700
 9% were hypothyroid, had an underactive thyroid, and 1% were hyperthyroid, with an overactive thyroid.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.700
 Now, this indicates that 10% clearly of the population had a thyroid problem

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.700
 that had most likely gone unrecognized.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:04.700
 Now, these figures suggest that nationally, there may be as many as 13 million Americans

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.700
 with an undiagnosed thyroid problem.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.700
 In her book, Living Well with Hypothyroidism, What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:17.700
 that you need to know, Mary Shamon quotes endocrinologist Kenneth Blanchard,

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.700
 MD of Lower Newton Falls, Massachusetts, as saying,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.700
 "The key thing is doctors are always told that thyroid stimulating hormone

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.700
 is a test that gives us a yes or no answer."

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.700
 And in fact, I think that's fundamentally wrong.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.700
 That's commonly called TSH.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.700
 Right, the TSH test.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.700
 Okay, so what they were saying that it's commonly wrong.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.700
 Now, in fact, I think that's wrong, very much so.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:49.700
 The pituitary TSH is controlled not just by how much T4 and T3 is in circulation,

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.700
 but T4 is getting converted to T3 at the pituitary level.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:00.700
 Now, excess T3 generated at the pituitary level can falsely suppress TSH.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.700
 Hence, many people who have simply tested for TSH are found to be within normal,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.700
 in parentheses, normal range.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.700
 They are, in fact, suffering from thyroid problems that are going undetected.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.700
 Now, consequently, reader R.M., MD, Associate Professor of Medicine

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.700
 in the Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Bayer College of Medicine, agrees.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:28.700
 He says that hypothyroidism may exist despite normal TSH levels.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.700
 In his book, "The Thyroid Solution," he says,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.700
 "Many people may be suffering from minute imbalances

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.700
 that have not yet resulted in abnormal blood tests.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.700
 If we included people with low-grade hypothyroidism whose blood tests are normal,

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.700
 the frequency of hypothyroidism would no doubt exceed 10% of the population.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.700
 Now, what is of special concern, though,

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.700
 is that many people whose test results are dismissed as normal

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.700
 could continue to have symptoms of an underactive thyroid.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.700
 Their mood, emotion, and overall well-being are affected by this imbalance,

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.700
 yet they are not receiving the care they need to get to the root of their problems.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.700
 Even if the TSH level is in the lower segment of normal,

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.700
 a person may still be suffering from low-grade hypothyroidism.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.700
 Thus, if we were to include those who may be suffering from low-grade hypothyroidism,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.700
 the number could well be double the 13 million estimate from the Colorado study."

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.700
 Now, while more research needs to be done,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.700
 it is generally accepted that diet plays a major role in thyroid health.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.700
 For decades, we've known that low iodine's intake

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.700
 leads to low thyroid function and eventually to goiter.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.700
 Now, the goiter is the large swelling around the thyroid cartilage

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:54.700
 as the thyroid swells in response to a decrease in thyroxine and other thyroid hormones.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:01.700
 Now, iodized salt was intended to solve this problem, but it's not been the answer.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.700
 There are a number of foods known as goitrogens that block iodine.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.700
 Two goitrogens are quite prevalent in the American diet.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.700
 One is peanuts and peanut butter, and soybeans,

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:19.700
 used most often in prepared foods as textured vegetable protein, known as TBP,

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.700
 which is a refined soy food and soybean oil.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:30.700
 Now, we mentioned the growing, the widespread growing of soy and corn in the 1930s

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:36.700
 and the subsequent GMO control of this by big multinational companies.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:43.700
 The rise of industrialization, corporate farming, and mass production of food

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.700
 has drastically changed our food supply from what our ancestors ate.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:53.700
 Many studies now show the detrimental effects of refined sugars and grains on our health.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.700
 These foods are very taxing on the thyroid gland, and we consume them in large quantities.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:04.700
 Environmental stress, such as chemical pollutants, pesticides, mercury, and fluoride,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.700
 are also tough on the thyroid.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.700
 A growing body of evidence suggests that fluoride,

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.700
 which is prevalent in toothpaste and water treatment,

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.700
 may inhibit the functioning of the thyroid gland.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.700
 Additionally, mercury may diminish thyroid function

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.700
 because it displaces the trace mineral selenium,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:27.700
 and selenium is involved in the conversion of thyroid hormones T4 to T3.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:35.700
 OK, so that's certainly food for thought in terms of the effects of modern farming

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:41.700
 and modern industrialization, and how these things have certainly become the norm

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:47.700
 and how the prevalence of the diseases, obesity, cancer, and diabetes,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.700
 have shot through the roof, as it were,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.700
 and pretty much so connected to the ingestion of these food groups,

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:01.700
 as these food groups are very specifically thyroid or thyrotoxic in many ways.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.700
 They slow the thyroid function down or stop it altogether in some cases.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:12.700
 I think it's true enough to say that people that have fairly,

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.700
 what you would call normal thyroid function tests,

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.700
 that are on the border of being hypothyroid,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.700
 there are several different things that can be done,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.700
 even in your home, without any complicated chemical analysis,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.700
 that pretty much confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.700
 So, Sarah, perhaps you want to talk about some of the things

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.700
 that would be useful for people they can try out themselves,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.700
 and if any of the signs or symptoms are present,

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.700
 then these people may well do themselves a lot of good

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.700
 to find out more information on the internet or from other sources

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.700
 to see, in fact, whether a thyroid replacement,

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.700
 either a glandular or a prescription, would be useful for them.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.700
 Well, I think the best place to start is always with your diet,

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.700
 and everyone could benefit from taking coconut oil.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.700
 From eating coconut oil internally, it will help your skin externally.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.700
 From applying it externally, it will help your skin externally.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:16.700
 It helps your thyroid gland, helps improve your metabolism.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.700
 It's very beneficial for everybody to eat coconut oil.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.700
 What are some of the main benefits of coconut oil?

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.700
 I just mentioned a few of them,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.700
 that it can help as an emollient for your skin,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.700
 it helps improve your metabolism.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:37.700
 All of our body has--well, we store a lot of saturated fat in our body,

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.700
 and that helps to maintain a healthy level of fat.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.700
 I think a real low-fat diet can be very detrimental.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.700
 You won't gain weight eating coconut oil.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.700
 But something you could do in your home to assess your thyroid function

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.700
 would be to take your temperature.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.700
 People should have a fairly normal body temperature from 98 to 98.6.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.700
 That's normal.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.700
 You can buy a thermometer,

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.700
 especially useful is a basal body thermometer from any pharmacy.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.700
 And you can take your temperature before and after you eat breakfast,

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.700
 and before and after you eat lunch, as well as your pulse.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.700
 Your pulse should be around normal, which is 70 to 85.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.700
 And those are some things that you can assess with low thyroid.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.700
 It's not definitive,

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.700
 so don't think that just because you might have a slightly lowered temperature

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.700
 or a slightly lowered pulse that that's it, you're hypothyroid.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.700
 It's, of course, always best to work with a practitioner

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.700
 in assessing your symptoms and to read your temperature and your pulse

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:52.700
 to come up with a proper diagnosis of exactly what's going on with your system.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.700
 Can I just quickly read out a couple of sample questions

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.700
 that people maybe would be able to answer?

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:05.700
 These would all be things that for the greater number of yes to these questions,

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:09.700
 there would be more of a basis for wanting to find out more information

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:14.700
 about your own self in terms of your thyroid health.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.700
 So some of these questions would be things like,

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.700
 have you experienced infertility or miscarriage?

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.700
 Especially if this is for women.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.700
 Are you feeling like you're getting every infection that goes around,

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.700
 or is it taking longer for you to recuperate from infections?

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:34.700
 Do you regularly eat significant amounts of uncooked goitrogenic foods

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:42.700
 such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, rutabaga, turnips, radishes, cauliflower and millet?

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.700
 Okay, and cabbage and kale, again, are two other goitrogenic foods.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.700
 And then are you experiencing changes in your menstrual cycle,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.700
 as in the cycle is too short or long,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.700
 or your period has become very heavy or very light?

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:05.700
 Now there is actually, I think it's a 2 or 3 to 1 ratio in gender of female to male.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.700
 Certainly more females seem to get hypothyroidism than males.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.700
 And that's because females have higher estrogen levels,

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.700
 and estrogen is a very powerful thyroid suppressant.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.700
 But in healthy women, your estrogen should be in balance with your progesterone,

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.700
 which is a powerful thyroid stimulant and supportive to your thyroid.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.700
 And I just want to mention one thing there, Andrew, about the goitrogenic foods.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:36.700
 Plants in the brassica family, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cabbage,

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.700
 those are all meant to be cooked.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.700
 I mean, everybody knows if they eat these vegetables raw, they have terrible gas,

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.700
 terrible indigestion.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.700
 But if you cook them until they're soft and they don't cause any gas,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:56.700
 then you've taken away the potential for them to cause a goiter and to suppress your thyroid.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.700
 So the person who wrote these questions out isn't suggesting that you don't eat them.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.700
 They just said to not eat them raw.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.700
 Okay, do you want to carry on?

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.700
 Do you have any more questions you want to--

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:16.700
 Well, there's lots of questions here, but they were some of the more obvious ones.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:24.700
 So many of these dietary unsaturated fatty acids, dietary polyunsaturated oils,

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.700
 can negatively affect the thyroid health.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.700
 We cook them almost every day, and they're plentiful in commercially prepared foods.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.700
 Expeller-pressed or solvent-extracted oils only became a major part of the American diet

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.700
 in the last century.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.700
 It is possible they are among the worst offenders when it comes to the thyroid.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.700
 They are known as vegetable oils or polyunsaturated oils.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:50.700
 The most common source of these oils used in commercially prepared foods is the soybean.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.700
 And I don't mean that you have to eat a lot of these oils in order to suppress your thyroid.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.700
 Yes, the more you eat, the more suppressed it will be,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.700
 but it can even be as much as one teaspoon a day.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.700
 That's quite a scary thought.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:09.700
 Large-scale cultivation of soybeans in the United States began after World War II

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.700
 and quickly increased to 140 billion pounds per year.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.700
 Most of the crops are produced for animal feed and soy oil for hydrogenated fats

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.700
 such as margarine and shortening.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.700
 Very poor quality fats, very cheap and expensive fats are produced.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.700
 Roundup ready corn and roundup ready soy.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.700
 When we traveled across the Midwest, we saw so many fields of roundup ready corn

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.700
 and roundup ready soy, and these are--

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.700
 The food staple of America.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:48.700
 This is what's being made into oil, and of course we all know that the oils of animals and plants suppress--

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:55.700
 I mean, it contains the toxic compounds of whatever has been applied to them,

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.700
 the pesticides, the herbicides.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:03.700
 It's in the oil, and here most of America is eating corn and soy oil in products,

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.700
 and those two plants are grown with a huge amount of chemicals.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:14.700
 Michael Moore's expose on the burger diet, when he was just--

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.700
 He had a 30-day-- He was just eating McDonald's, and he was just eating--

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.700
 He was always encouraged to get the supersized version,

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.700
 and how he was suddenly gone-- His blood pressure was going through the roof.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.700
 His pulse was going up. He'd gained all this weight, and he was--

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.700
 His liver enzymes.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.700
 His doctor was trying to pull him off it because he was worried that he was going to--

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.700
 I don't think that was a Michael Moore, though.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.700
 I thought it was Michael Moore.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.700
 I don't know. I think that was--

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.700
 You know the one I'm talking about.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.700
 Yeah.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.700
 Supersize me, I think it's called.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.700
 Supersize.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.700
 And then there was the other thing, the other expose on corn.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.700
 The high-fructose corn syrup that's prevalent in the population of America.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.700
 Almost every processed food.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.700
 Almost everything that you see on a store, if you pick up the package and look at it,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.700
 has high-fructose corn syrup in it.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.700
 It's become the common sweeter.

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.700
 No longer is sugar or honey used because, of course, it's too expensive,

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.700
 but the high-fructose corn syrup is readily available,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:13.700
 and they grow it massive, widespread, thousands of hectares, roundup ready.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.700
 Okay, great.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.700
 Okay, I think there's a caller on the line.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.700
 Hello.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.700
 Hello.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.700
 That's why I make a distinction in my life, and I've started talking to people about it.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.700
 There's a difference between food and food-like products.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.700
 Yes.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.700
 Exactly.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.700
 And when I'm out and about with people, I just do those little bits of education, you know,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.700
 steering away from the food-like products.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.700
 Because education is what it's all about.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:40.700
 People need to be educated as to what's happening because most of it is a common misconception that,

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.700
 "Oh, this is okay," or, "This is acceptable because it's on sale."

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.700
 It doesn't mean that at all.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.700
 Yes, and also, especially when they ask me if I want ketchup or jam at a restaurant,

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.700
 I say, "Do you know that stuff has high-fructose corn syrup and that has E. coli in it?"

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.700
 So just those little spots of education here and there.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.700
 Thank you.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.700
 Well done.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.700
 Thank you.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.700
 Keep up the good work.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.700
 Thank you.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:03.700
 Thank you.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.700
 Anything on the line?

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.700
 Hello?

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:06.700
 Hi.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.700
 Hello?

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.700
 Hello?

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.700
 Hi.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.700
 You're on the air.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.700
 Okay.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.700
 You guys have neglected to discuss the issue regarding the omega-6 and omega-3 fats and the ratios,

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.700
 and I wanted to recommend a book called The Omega Diet.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:21.700
 It's a long Greek name.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:34.700
 It's Artemis P. Simopoulos and Joe Robinson, and I wanted your feedback on that.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:42.700
 As I understand it, there's actually amounts of evidence coming out now that show that having a higher ratio,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:49.700
 I think it's the omega-6 fats, makes a big difference for health issues of many variety,

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.700
 and the most affordable oil that's high in omega-6 is canola,

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.700
 but also I think flax and walnut oil are the other ones.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.700
 I think that's right.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:06.700
 But anyway, I wanted your feedback on that because you haven't discussed that at all on this show or the last show.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.700
 Thanks a lot.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.700
 Okay.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.700
 Thank you.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.700
 So a question and answer, what about essential fatty acids?

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:19.700
 Aren't some polyunsaturated fatty acids essential as we all believe?

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.700
 They happen and we're taught.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:29.700
 During the last 30 years, Dr. Ray Peet has asked prominent oil researchers for evidence that there is such a thing as an essential fatty acid.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:37.700
 One professor cited a single publication about a single patient who recovered from an illness after taking unsaturated fat.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:43.700
 If he had known of any better evidence, wouldn't he have mentioned it, asked Dr. Peet?

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:51.700
 The others, if they had answered at all, cited Burr and Burr, 1929, a study that tested rats.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:58.700
 The surprising thing about that question is that these people would consider any research from 1929 to be definitive.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:05.700
 That's like quoting the 1929 opinion of a physicist regarding the procedure for making a hydrogen bomb.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:13.700
 What was known about nutrition in 1929, most of the B vitamins weren't even suspected to exist.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:20.700
 Burr had no way of understanding what deficiencies or toxicities were present in his experimental diet.

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:30.700
 Two years before Burr's experiment, says Dr. Peet, German researchers found that a fat-free diet prevented almost all spontaneous cancers in rats.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:35.700
 Later work showed that polyunsaturated fats both promote and initiate cancer.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:43.700
 With that knowledge, he says, the people who kept claiming that linoleic, linoleic, and maybe arachidonic acid are essential fatty acids,

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:50.700
 should have devoted some effort to finding out about how much of that essential nutrient was enough,

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.700
 so that people could minimize their consumption of the carcinogenic stuff.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:04.700
 And the way I'd like to logically look at this situation with polyunsaturated fats is that how did we get to where we are today?

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.700
 What did our ancestors eat?

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.700
 Did they eat bottles of essential fatty acids, canola oil?

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.700
 Did they make oil from canola, from sunflowers?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.700
 They might have eaten sunflowers, but they wouldn't have made oil from sunflowers necessarily,

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.700
 because it was much easier to make oil from olive and coconut and butter.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.700
 And how much fish were they eating?

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.700
 Well...

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.700
 Probably not that much fish.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.700
 Well, it depends where they lived. I mean, of course, some people ate fish.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.700
 But did they eat sea fish? I mean, what were they doing, were they...

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:39.700
 Right, they wouldn't have eaten as much tuna, and only salmon when they could catch it from the shore, or close to the shore.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.700
 They wouldn't have traveled 40 miles out in the ocean.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.700
 I mean, maybe in some areas where the ocean's calmer, but definitely not in our Pacific Ocean,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.700
 where it could be very scary 40 miles out in a paddle boat.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.700
 That's why I logically like to look at it.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:36:01.700
 Let's get back to basics and say, "What is it that we used to eat? How did we get to where we are today?"

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.700
 Okay, there's a caller on the line.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.700
 Hello?

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.700
 Hello?

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.700
 Hi, you're on the air.

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.700
 Yes, thanks for your show. It's been really interesting for me,

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.700
 because I've heard all my life how good polyunsaturated oils are.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.700
 Most of us have, yeah.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.700
 I...

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.700
 Hello?

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:21.700
 Uh-oh.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:26.700
 I'm sorry, I think we had a little bit of interruption between the last 20 seconds or so,

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.700
 so just reiterate what you were saying.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:34.700
 Okay, I have a basal temperature of 96.8 consistently in the morning,

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.700
 and then I eat and it stays the same.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:38.700
 Right.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:44.700
 And I have a number of symptoms, like three or four symptoms of hypothyroidism,

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.700
 and I've painted iodine on me and it's disappeared within 12 hours.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:55.700
 So I'm wondering, do you think I should get a prescription for the Armour thyroid, or what do you think?

00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:01.700
 Well, the best thing to do would be to go talk to a doctor who is open-minded and knows a lot about thyroid.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.700
 One of those doctors was Connie Bash.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.700
 Unfortunately, she's moved to San Francisco.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:14.700
 Another doctor is Beverly Copeland, and she's also open to alternative methods for testing thyroid,

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:20.700
 alternative being taking your temperature and having symptoms that match a hypothyroidism picture.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:27.700
 Alternatively, you can buy glandular thyroid extracts from health food stores and online.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.700
 Most of them are bovine, but I think there are some porcine available.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.700
 But I always recommend it's better for people to see a practitioner and work with a practitioner,

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.700
 because you don't want to take too much thyroid.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.700
 It's definitely not safe.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.700
 And besides that, something like the diet would be the first place to start.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.700
 Okay.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:50.700
 And not eating those thyroid-suppressive foods that we've mentioned.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.700
 Which I have eaten in the past, and I'll avoid the polysaccharide oils,

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:59.700
 and possibly I'm thinking eat some seaweed for the thyroid.

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.700
 Well, the thing with iodine is, yes, you can have a deficiency of iodine,

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:10.700
 and that can lead to hypothyroidism, but also too much iodine can lead to hypothyroidism.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:16.700
 So it's a really delicate balance, and maybe you just want to eat some very occasionally.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.700
 Okay. Thanks for your help.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.700
 You're welcome.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.700
 There's one more caller.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.700
 Hello, you're on the line.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.700
 Hello?

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:24.700
 Hello.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.700
 Oh, good.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.700
 Hi. Thanks for the show.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.700
 I got a call from my sister yesterday.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.700
 Her cholesterol is 280.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.700
 Okay.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:38.700
 And she asked me, and I love getting this call, "What can I do naturally?"

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.700
 So the first thing I said to her is you have to start eating the right oils.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.700
 Right.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:47.700
 And I wondered if you could distill some more advice for her,

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:52.700
 some steps she can take towards lowering the cholesterol.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.700
 Well, cholesterol is often raised because of too much sugar and carbohydrates in the diet.

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:05.700
 So when you say good oils, I mean, if heart attacks, myocardial infarctions were unknown before 1920,

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.700
 what were the oils--what were people eating?

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.700
 How did we get to where we are?

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.700
 Well, they ate coconut if they lived in tropical climates.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:17.700
 If they lived in Europe, they ate butter and lard, animal fat.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:23.700
 Animal fat in this day and age is not something you want to be eating because the animals are fed so many horrible things

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.700
 and given so many antibiotics.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:31.700
 But butter, organic butter, organic coconut oil, a small amount of olive oil,

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.700
 those are some good oils to start.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:42.700
 And decreased grains and sugars would be a healthy place to start in her diet, in my opinion.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:50.700
 Yeah, this is the first I heard that corn oil and polyunsaturates in general could be so harmful.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:54.700
 I don't know if they're directly related to cholesterol,

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.700
 but high fructose corn syrup is something I presume she should avoid.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.700
 Definitely.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:07.700
 And, you know, there's--just instead of eating so many carbohydrates and sugar foods that get converted to fat and cholesterol,

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:13.700
 to eat instead more protein and even for vegetarians, fruit has a lot of protein in it.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.700
 Potatoes have a very good quality protein and that would be one carbohydrate she could eat.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.700
 I don't know if she's vegetarian or not.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.700
 If she was a meat eater--

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.700
 You're saying sugars get converted into cholesterol?

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:29.700
 Sugars get converted into fat, yes, and they can also raise your cholesterol levels.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.700
 You have to start with some kind of lipid structure to make--

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.700
 Well, cholesterol--your body makes cholesterol on its own.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.700
 People who have a fat-free diet, they can still have cholesterol levels off the chart.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:47.700
 But the other thing I want to say about cholesterol is that a recent research that was either Harvard or Stanford

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:55.700
 came out saying that people who had a cholesterol of around 230 over the age of 50

00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:03.700
 were less likely to die of heart attacks, cancer, and degenerative diseases than those who had a cholesterol below 200.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:12.700
 And we all know that--well, maybe we don't all know, but the average number that they say you should have your cholesterol under is under 200.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.700
 Right.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:19.700
 And now they're coming out with these results saying, "Well, look, the study of these people was a 10-year study.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.700
 These people that were in their 70s versus people that had high and lower cholesterol,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.700
 the people that had higher cholesterol--

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:28.700
 Live longer.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:31.700
 Live longer, because cholesterol is a protective function in the body.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.700
 It's a natural protective function.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:37.700
 Every one of our cells in the body, in our body, has a cholesterol membrane.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.700
 Right.

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.700
 And it can also--

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:42.700
 But what about plaque buildup in the arteries?

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.700
 That's supposed to be the big concern with it.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:48.700
 Well, that's what they're saying is a lot more contributed--

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:58.700
 coming from an increase of sugars in the diet and also these polyunsaturated oils because they're trans fatty acids and they're an odd-shaped molecule.

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:04.700
 Just think, before the Industrial Revolution, we would have never tried to make oil from corn.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.700
 Who would think of it?

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.700
 Yeah, maybe we'd eat corn and eating corn in small amounts.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:15.700
 I don't think there's anything wrong with that, especially the way it traditionally is used is like masa harina.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.700
 It's fermented and soaked and much more digestible.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:26.700
 But corn in large quantities in the form of oil has been shown to suppress the immune system.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.700
 There's lots of information on the Internet.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.700
 All you need to do is just Google it.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.700
 Yeah, I wonder--Michael Pollan's new book is about corn.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.700
 We're always called corn-fed and stuff.

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.700
 Right.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:37.700
 Oh, my.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.700
 We're way too corny.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.700
 All right, well, thanks a lot.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:41.700
 Okay, you're very welcome.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.700
 Thanks for your call.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.700
 Bye.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:44.700
 Thank you.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.700
 I think you were--okay, you're going to carry on.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.700
 All right.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:56.700
 So large-scale cultivation of soybeans in the United States began after World War II

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.700
 and quickly increased to 140 billion pounds per year.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.700
 So that's, you know, mid-1940s.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:09.700
 Most of the crops are produced for animal feed and soy oil for hydrogenated fats such as margarine and shortening.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:14.700
 Today it is nearly impossible, absolutely impossible, to eat at restaurants

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.700
 or buy packaged foods that don't have soy oil in the ingredients,

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.700
 often labeled simply "state vegetable oil."

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:27.700
 That reminds me of the caller who called in and said, "Food and food-like products."

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.700
 Most Americans eat food-like products.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:36.700
 Even bread has dough conditioners in it, iodine bromate, yeast--bread made with yeast,

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.700
 which is highly indigestible.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.700
 Iodine bromate is enough.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.700
 If Americans are eating bread every day, it has enough iodine bromate in it to suppress your thyroid.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.700
 Okay, I think there's another caller or two on the line.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.700
 Yeah, hi there.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:51.700
 Am I with you?

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.700
 Yes, you're on the air.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:59.700
 Yeah, I have two kids, and I'm pretty careful about, you know, what I buy,

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:03.700
 and I don't buy any high-purchase corn syrup or anything like that.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:08.700
 And I was hearing you guys say that soy milk and tofu

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:12.700
 and all of those products also have polyunsaturated fat in them,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:17.700
 so I was wondering if you could maybe clarify about the other soy products

00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.700
 other than just the oil factor.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.700
 Well, the soy has a goitrogenic effect.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:31.700
 It's the soy flavonoid in there that is also thyroid suppressive,

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.700
 and that's why you don't want to eat soy products.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:40.700
 They might not have a lot of soy oil in them, but they have a lot of a goitrogenic effect.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.700
 And it has been shown that 11 ounces--a study that was done a couple years ago--

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.700
 11 ounces of soy milk a day in a healthy individual,

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:54.700
 not someone who already has disease and isn't healthy, is enough to suppress thyroid function.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.700
 Okay, wow.

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.700
 This has just been a really enlightening show.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.700
 You guys have--I've heard so many things I've never heard before.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.700
 So I really appreciate you guys being on the air.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.700
 Well, you're very welcome.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:11.700
 And the best advice I have to feed your children is the least processed foods, whole foods.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:16.700
 I give him tons of chocolate soy milk because he eats so much dairy, cottage cheese,

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.700
 and butter, and everything else.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:23.700
 I was just trying to balance out his diet a bit so that he's not eating quite so much dairy products.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.700
 And he just loves the chocolate soy milk, so I give him quite a bit of that every single day.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.700
 Well, maybe you just want to replace it with--make your own chocolate milk.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:38.700
 Yeah, I have Dutch cocoa, and, you know, we still have milk in our house too, so I could totally do that.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.700
 And just to make sure to include plenty of fruit.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:42.700
 Children need lots of fruit.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:46.700
 Soft fruits are the best, soft, ripe fruits.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:52.700
 Bananas, if they're very ripe, otherwise they can have a latex-like allergy, banana allergy.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:58.700
 Yeah, I found that my 2-year-old actually really prefers eating stuff straight from my garden too,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.700
 like food that he won't eat necessarily if I buy it at the store.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.700
 He loves picking it right off the vine, and he'll eat it like that for some reason.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.700
 That's exactly the same--

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.700
 I just find it amazing. It's wonderful.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.700
 It's wonderful. That's the same as with my 4-year-old niece.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.700
 She loves everything out of the garden.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.700
 Yeah, it's been really amazing since we had the garden how much his diet has improved

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:26.700
 just because he's so much more open to the new experience of picking it himself and just eating it right there.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.700
 Well, that's how it's supposed to be. That's the way it always used to be.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.700
 Yeah, I really appreciate your show. This has just been really great. It's been awesome information.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.700
 Well, thank you for your call.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.700
 Have a good one.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.700
 You too.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.700
 Okay, I think there's another call on the line.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.700
 Hello.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.700
 Hello.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.700
 Listen, thank you so much for the program, and I did not catch your show last week

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:50.700
 and don't want to take up a lot of your time because you have a lot of valuable information you're giving out.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:58.700
 I'm actually someone who was diagnosed 4 weeks ago with hypothyroid and just started the medication 3 weeks ago.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700
 Okay. Are you on--

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.700
 I'm on a very small dose, 25 milligrams of Lavoxel.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.700
 Okay.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:10.700
 And I eat a really clean diet. I'm blessed. I live in Arcata, so I can go to the farmer's market.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:18.700
 And 95% of my diet is home-cooked, fresh food from the farmer's market.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:24.700
 But what I'm wanting is additional information about dietary do's and don'ts.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:33.700
 I read up on the soy and used to take a lot of soy until I realized that it's not good because I have breast cancer

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.700
 happening with a sibling a year older than I am and lots of cancer in the family.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.700
 So I try to stay away from the soy.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:45.700
 But I do drink a lot of almond milk, and I like peanut butter, and I like almond butter.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.700
 Bad, bad, bad.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.700
 Bad, bad, bad.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.700
 Sorry. You should cut it out of your diet now.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.700
 If you want, you can take our toll-free number and call us and give us your email,

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.700
 and I can email you a do and don't diet sheet for your thyroid.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:03.700
 That's the best thing you can do. Call us on our toll-free number, and we'll email you the diet sheet.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.700
 Okay. What's your toll-free number?

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700
 Okay.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:07.700
 Go ahead.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:12.700
 888-926-4372.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.700
 4372. Thank you so much.

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:19.700
 I just have one more thing I want to tell you, and that is whoever your prescribing doctor is,

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:26.700
 since you called in, I want to tell you my advice, and that is to switch to Armor Throid or Nature Throid

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:34.700
 or West Throid, one of the natural glandulars because it has both T3 and T4, whereas Lovoxil is just T4.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:39.700
 And then that relies on your liver to do the conversion into the active form, which is T3.

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:46.700
 And it's a much better alternative for people than taking Synthroid or Lovoxil.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.700
 Okay. So Armor Throid, and what were the other two?

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.700
 They're all the same. They're a porcine raw glandular, a thyroid glandular.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.700
 So it's Armor Throid, Nature Throid, or West Throid.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.700
 Thank you.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.700
 You're very welcome.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.700
 Okay. Bye-bye.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:01.700
 Okay. Have a good night.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.700
 Okay. There's another caller.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:04.700
 Hello.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:05.700
 Hi. You're on the air.

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.700
 I have a question concerning soy products.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.700
 What do you think of tempeh, fermented soy product?

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.700
 Do you think it's as harmful as other soy products?

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.700
 I don't think it's as harmful.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:22.700
 I think if grains and beans were eaten in a little bit more traditional way, they're a little bit better.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.700
 But for someone who is hypothyroid or has some hypothyroid symptoms,

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:31.700
 my advice is do not eat anything that could possibly stress your thyroid.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:40.700
 Okay. And also I'd like to make a comment that I started eating coconut oil probably about three or four years ago,

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.700
 and I lost about 20 pounds after I started eating it.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.700
 So it's very good for weight loss.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.700
 Absolutely.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:49.700
 It's very good for weight loss.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.700
 It's what they call a thermogenic product.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:56.700
 So it increases your body's metabolism and your oxygen consumption.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:02.700
 It improves the function of your thyroid, and your thyroid governs every metabolic process in your body.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:07.700
 So that involves heat production, muscle activity, sympathetic drive.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.700
 So, yeah, that's what we said in the beginning.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:16.700
 The whole coconut thing is essentially a very good saturated fat that supports your thyroid, feeds it,

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.700
 and allows you to lose fat while eating fat.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.700
 And in the 1940s when they were experimenting with animals, they found they lost weight.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.700
 I don't know if you heard that part earlier in the show.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.700
 I did. That's just about when I turned it on.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:38.700
 But the thing is, is that they didn't want -- the American Soy Association at that time did not want all these imported coconut oils to come in.

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.700
 They wanted to sell their soy and corn oil.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:46.700
 And so they boycotted all these coconut oils, and that's why we haven't until just recently, say in the last 10 years,

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:50.700
 heard all this research that was done in the 1940s.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.700
 For crying out loud, it's 2008.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.700
 Why haven't we heard this?

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.700
 Why is it only just coming out in the past five to 10 years?

00:50:56.700 --> 00:51:03.700
 Well, all I know is I lost weight on it, and I'm sure others could too, and it also tastes good and I like it.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.700
 So that's all I have, and thanks a lot for the show.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:07.700
 Thank you for your call.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.700
 Thank you for your call.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.700
 Okay, so do you want to carry on?

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.700
 Yeah.

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.700
 Well, we have a couple more minutes here.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.700
 I have a couple more questions.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.700
 Yeah, we've got six minutes.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:23.700
 So off today, it is nearly impossible to eat at restaurants or buy packaged foods that don't have soy oil in the ingredients,

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.700
 often labels simply state vegetable oil.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:34.700
 Dr. Ray Peat, Ph.D., physiologist who has worked with progesterone and related hormones since 1968,

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:42.700
 I think he's in his 70s now, says that the sudden surge of polyunsaturated oils into the food chain post-World War II

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.700
 has caused many changes in hormones.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:55.700
 He writes, "The polyunsaturated oils' best understood effect is the interference with the function of the thyroid gland.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:01.700
 Unsaturated oils block thyroid hormone secretion, its movement in the circulatory system,

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.700
 and the response of tissue to the hormone.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:10.700
 When the thyroid hormone is deficient, the body is generally exposed to increased levels of estrogen."

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:16.700
 And another small point I want to make is sometimes people might eat a perfect thyroid-promoting diet,

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:23.700
 which is very rare because there's so much corn and soy in our diet and in our meat that we eat or our vegetables,

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:34.700
 but there's environmental toxins Andrew mentioned earlier, high levels of mercury suppress thyroid, pesticides, herbicides,

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:41.700
 fungicides, a lot of these chemicals interfere with estrogen and further suppress the thyroid.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:47.700
 "The thyroid hormone is essential for making the protective hormones progesterone and pregnenolone,

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:51.700
 so these hormones are lowered when anything interferes with the function of the thyroid.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.700
 The thyroid hormone is required for using and eliminating cholesterol,

00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:03.700
 so cholesterol is likely to be excessively raised by anything which blocks the thyroid function."

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:08.700
 There is a growing body of research concerning soy's detrimental effect on the thyroid gland.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:14.700
 Much of this research centers on the phytoestrogens, the phyto means plant, that are found in soy.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:21.700
 In the 1960s, when soy was introduced into infant formulas, it was shown that soy was goitrogenic, caused goiters,

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.700
 and the babies started developing goiters.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:27.700
 When iodine was supplemented, the incidence of goiter dramatically reduced.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:37.700
 However, a retrospective epidemiological study by Fort et al. showed that teenage children with a diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:45.700
 were significantly more likely to have received soy formula as infants, 18 out of 59 children, 31%,

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:52.700
 when compared to their healthy siblings, which was only at 9 out of 76, 12%,

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.700
 or control group, which was 7 out of 54, 13%.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:03.700
 So it was 31% of the children who developed, teenage children who developed autoimmune thyroid disease,

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.700
 had received soy formula as an infant.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:13.700
 When healthy individuals without any previous thyroid disease were fed 30 grams of pickled soybeans per day for one month,

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:18.700
 Ishizuki et al. reported goiter and elevated individual thyroid-simulating hormone levels,

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:24.700
 although still within the normal range in 37 healthy iodine-sufficient adults.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:30.700
 One month after stopping soybean consumption, individual TSH values decreased to the original levels,

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.700
 and goiters were reduced in size.

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:40.700
 And as I stated earlier, 11 ounces, which is, you know, a cup and a half of soy milk, is enough to suppress someone's thyroid.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:47.700
 Traditionally, polyunsaturated oils such as soybean oil have been used for livestock feed because they cause animals to gain weight.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:53.700
 These oils are made up of what is known as long-chain fatty acids, the kind of fatty acids that promote weight gain.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:55:00.700
 In the North Carolina State University's Extension Swine Husbandry, 1998-2000,

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:09.700
 departmental report, for example, was a study entitled "Effect of Dietary Fat Source, Level and Feeding Interval on Pork Fatty Acid Composition."

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:15.700
 Ironically, since the market in its low-fat dogma of recent years is demanding leaner meats,

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:24.700
 this study showed that one could produce leaner meat and reduce the weight on pigs by reducing their intake of soy oil

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:28.700
 and instead substituting it with saturated animal fat.

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:34.700
 According to Dr. Ray Peet, the fattening effect of these polyunsaturated oils, primarily soy and corn,

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:42.700
 is due to the presence of the "essential fatty acids, linoleic and linoleic, long-chain fatty acids which have an antithyroid effect."

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:50.700
 Dr. Peet says, "Linoleic and linoleic acids, the essential fatty acids, and other polyunsaturated fatty acids,

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:54.700
 which are now fed to pigs to fatten them in the form of corn and soybeans,

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:59.700
 cause the animal's fat to be chemically equivalent to the vegetable oil.

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:07.700
 In the late 1940s, chemical toxins were used to suppress the thyroid function of pigs to make them get fatter while consuming less food.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:13.700
 When that was found to be carcinogenic, it was then found that corn and soybeans had the same antithyroid effect,

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.700
 causing the animals to be fattened at low cost.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:23.700
 The animal's fat becomes chemically similar to the fats in their food, causing it to be equally toxic and equally fattening."

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:32.700
 So there you go. Well, it's 7.58, so we're going to begin to wrap it up now, but I think next month we will continue.

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:42.700
 Although there's not too much left, I think there's certainly more information that we can find to help make people aware of the changes that are in the winds.

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:47.700
 So you've been listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD 91.1.

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.700
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.700
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you for listening.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:59.700
 Until the same time, the third Friday from 7 to 8 p.m. in September, we'll see you then. Take care.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.700
 Good night.
