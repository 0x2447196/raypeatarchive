00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, broadcasting worldwide, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Well, a very pleasant good morning to you. It's a little bit, well, whatever it is. It's

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 December 20 is what it is. You don't care what time it is. You have a clock on the wall

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 if you want to see that. This is Patrick Timpone. Good morning, and it's great to be here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 The third Monday of each month, following Richard Massey, we have one of our fave guys,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 and a fellow that I have so much respect for, is Dr. Ray Peat, PhD in biology, long ago,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 University of Oregon, where he still lives today, in Eugene. Spent a lot of time way

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 down in Mexico. He did quite a bit of research long ago on progesterone, hormones, and how

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 progesterone and hormones are related. This was way back in '68 when I started in radio.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The key idea was that energy and structure are independent in every level. He talked

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 about how progesterone protects the body's structure and energy against the harmful effects

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen. Certainly a lot of things that we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 have today, and we have a lot of fun talking to him. I need some water, excuse me.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Whoops. Let me grab it here. Let me grab it here. A little water.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 It's been very dry here. Cold and dry, which is kind of nice, like 40 degrees at night

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 and 75 in the afternoon. So it's been really a beautiful time to be here in Central Texas.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 What I was about to say, while I was so rudely interrupted by my dry throat, is that if you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 care to ask a question of Dr. Pete, we already have a lot of great ones. We'll try to get

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 to all of them. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. After Dr. Pete,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 I'm going to come on and do another little segment. This is the last show we're going

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 to do between now and January 3. I'm going to take some time off and work on the screenplay

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 and whip it into shape, continue to rewrite and rewrite. I thought it'd be fun to kind

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 of connect with you one-to-one before we go off on a little vacay. So right after Dr.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Pete's show, we'll come back on and talk about some of the news and play around a little

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 bit before we go on our vacation. Dr. Ray Pete is, as I said, in Oregon. We're going

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 to now say hi to him. Dr. Pete, good morning to you, sir. Thanks for coming on.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Dr. Pete Good morning.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Patrick Well, here we are. Man, we made another year, Doc. I don't know how we did it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 Dr. Pete Yep.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Patrick It's really been something, isn't it, the last couple of years with this whole

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 virus thing? Pretty interesting, isn't it?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Dr. Pete Yeah. I think the population is sort of deciding what they believe and not going

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 to learn much more. It looks like about half and half, even people who got vaccinated,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 are realizing that what the government says is seldom true. And the other half knew all

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 along that you can't trust the government.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Patrick So interesting, isn't it, Dr. Pete, of how is it possible that we could really

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 trust the science when they just keep making things up?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 Dr. Pete Fauci's principle is, "I am science. Trust me."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Patrick That's right.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Dr. Pete And that's exactly what science isn't. Science is a matter of questioning

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 science. It isn't science if it isn't questionable.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Patrick And the idea that there is such a thing as a consensus. I mean, how does it

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 work? How do you scientists really figure out? Do you just come to your own conclusion

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 of what's true?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Dr. Pete Oh, the consensus. I had an interesting exchange with a researcher a few years ago

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 and doubted something that she had said and asked for a copy of the paper. And I read

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 the paper through three or four times and couldn't find a trace of what the title said

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 it was about. And so I mentioned it to her and she, three or four times, said, "You

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 didn't read it carefully." And finally, I said, "That title claim is absolutely not

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 represented anywhere in the paper." And she said, "But that's the consensus."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 Patrick Oh, that's the consensus.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Dr. Pete Oh, that's what people believe. So she doesn't have to support it in any way

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 and have consensus. The Fauci thing is a very clear example. He has some power over government

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 officials that keep him in his office, despite conflicts of interest, going back to his very

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 beginning in the office. But for some reason, the politicians are powerless to fire him.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 And so that power he has is where the consensus comes from. And in the society in a bigger

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 sense, going back 70 or 80 years, we can see the government directly getting involved in

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 all of the major scientific questions, biological, physical, sociological, and so on. The government

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 intervened with its grant power. The science was turning away from individual researchers

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 with a little self-financed lab. It wasn't acceptable science if it didn't have financing.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And so government and the huge corporations controlled financing to direct science to

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 go the way they wanted it. And just before the Second World War, when the giant corporations

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 were essentially taking over government regulation and financing of science research and directing

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 how the science journals would publish, how the universities would teach, they wouldn't

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 support grants to the universities if they taught the wrong things. And so the corporations

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 working with and through the government have created a consensus of power, the beliefs

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 corporations wanted to instill that were acceptable to the government. So the combination of government

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 and big corporations are the consensus. And if you dissent, you don't get any funding.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Do you remember Peter Gershberg and the AIDS controversy? I heard the story that at the

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 height of his rejection by the establishment, a high official phoned him and said he wanted

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 to talk to him personally. So he flew across the country and invited Duisburg to dinner.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 After they ate, he pulled out a paper, an article saying that HIV causes AIDS. And it

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 was written supposedly by Peter Duisburg. And the guy said, if he signed on to that

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 and let him publish it under his name, that he would no longer be an outcast. He would

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 get his grants again and be invited to the scientific meetings and so on. Naturally,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Duisburg refused and stayed an outcast. Wow. Do you think it's through the whole

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Fauci connection and these drugs that were killing this gay community with an HIV thing

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 that really never existed? Is that true? That's my belief and that's Peter Gershberg's.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 I've gone through everything Duisburg has published on the subject and talked to him.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 One of the crucial things that I had read about that he said was an unavoidable consideration

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 was that the military recruits in the 1960s, blood samples were taken and frozen from all

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 of the potential draftees. And going back in the age of HIV and AIDS, those blood samples

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 were tested. And it was found that over the years of freezing, all of the 18-year-old

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 men in the country were given a blood sample in those years. Every year, the blood tested

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 about, and I don't remember whether it was 0.4 or 0.5 percent positive for HIV. So the

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 whole population 30 years before AIDS was known showed exactly the same proportion of

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 the population as being HIV positive as exists at present. It's a resident component of our

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 makeup, of about 0.4 or 0.5 percent of the people with this inert antigen of the HIV

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 virus.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 So we all, that's why Rich, actually my good friend and biological dentist, Dr. Stuart

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Stanley, they have found this HIV thing in root canals.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Yeah, it's going to be in half percent of everyone you test.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Wow.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 If you, Duesberg points out that our liver is full of probably thousands of these remnant

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 viruses, not even sure that they were ever functioning as a virus, but they have the

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 structure of a virus that could be pollen you inhaled.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Who knows? Like this exosome idea, Dr. Pete?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Yeah. Anyway, they are resident in our tissues just as part of, they call it the dark DNA.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 It only takes a very small percentage of our genome DNA to describe a person, something

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 like 97 percent of it is mysterious, so-called dark DNA.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Dark DNA.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 In that, there are thousands of these inert virus remnants so that if you're sick, your

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 tissues are stirred up, the genome is activated and disturbed and lets out a relatively broad

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 spectrum of this dark DNA.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 Duesberg suggests that HIV is just one of these, but it would account for sick people

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 testing positive more than healthy people.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 In the general population, it's about a half percent test positive.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 With sick, then we can also argue that that really could be the healing process as well.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Yeah. The labor is putting out sort of hypotheses about what might help to repair the stress.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 So it's an explosion of variability.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 If you test for that variability, you see things that are associated with people being

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 sick, but it doesn't mean that they have anything.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 This is why the famous videos are out there that we've streamed, Dr. Pete, on our show,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 on our network from Kerry Mullis, the Nobel Prize winner for the PCR test.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 He very clearly says if you spin this thing high enough, you can come up with thousands

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 of things it'll find.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Yeah, and the government instructions right from the start.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 It's 45, right?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 Yeah, twice as many as you knew would produce false positives.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 So what they did was create an epidemic of tests.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 The more tests they did exactly corresponding to the increase in the number of tests, the

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 increase in the number of so-called cases increased.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 The cases were simply a reflection of how many people you tested.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 And so this whole thing was run on false data that nobody has talked about except alternative

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 places like here.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 You know, other people have, but just a handful compared to media.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 And suddenly when the virus, when the vaccine came on the market, the government said, "Okay,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 now you can run it to normal 30 or 35 cycles and that'll make it look like we're curing

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 the disease because there will be fewer positives."

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 So they can change the spins.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 Yeah.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 They probably do that with an email or a telegram, whatever, the connection with the PCR test

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 company.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Well, when they did the whole AIDS thing in the late '70s and around '80, was it a similar,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 do you know, Doc, a PCR type test where they came up with some kind of identification of

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 this molecule, HIV?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 No, I don't think that came until later.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 So what did they use?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 The antigen, I think, was the main specific identifier.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 The antigen.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Antibody, antigen reactions.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 Which is part and parcel of the molecules at the release.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 The liver just kind of throws out when things are going on?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 For many years, the antibody, you would put some of the sample in an animal and elicit

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 antibodies to it and then concentrate those antibodies and use it to identify the substance.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 You can still make a microscopic image of something by applying the right type of antibody

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 to the microscope slide and the specific antibody will be labeled with either a dye or radioactive

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 isotope so that you can make a picture of specific types of protein antigens.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 So there's many views, of course, on the idea of this isolation and you're on record saying,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 well it doesn't really need to be isolated to maybe cause or affect people and be shared

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 and that's fair enough.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 But if there, whatever this original COVID thing is or isn't or out of a lab or natural,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 could this entity, if it exists, actually mutate into another thing called Delta or Omicron?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Is that even possible?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 You can engineer, you can start with a bat virus or any kind of a known transmissible

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 virus-like agent and then using the DNA engineering techniques that have developed over the last

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 50 or 60 years, you can change individual amino acids or you can take out a block and

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 put in a new block that has a known function.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 So you can write your own virus program essentially.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 That's what Ralph Berrick and his lab at the University of North Carolina and the Port

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Detrick Germ Warfare Lab, what they specialize in is creating gain-of-function viruses where

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 you make a harmless animal virus able to infect a human being and then to make it more or

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 less virulent by adding a stretch of DNA that increases certain activities.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 And Dr. Peete, if one did that, how would they distribute that to people?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 During World War II, the Germans and Japanese were leaders in germ warfare, but the U.S.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 government recruited their germ warfare experts instead of hanging them.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 They came to work for the U.S. government.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 At that time, the Port Detrick Lab was just one of two or three major germ warfare experimental

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 labs.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 The author of the best-selling medical physiology textbook, Arthur Guyton, was working for the

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 germ warfare lab right at the end of the Second World War.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 His specialty was to make aerosols out of germs such as polio virus to make it survivable

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 and transmissible through the air.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 The government was experimenting.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 They would use a marker bacterium as something that was easy to find when it infected people.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 They sprayed San Francisco, for example, with an aerosol of a bacterium that produced a

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 very visible response in the individual without especially making them sick.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 So they were testing it on innocent American populations.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 In the process of making aerosols from the polio germs, Arthur Guyton became very famous

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 with polio and retired to teach medical physiology at the University of Mississippi and write

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 his famous but very stupid textbook.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 But, you know, there are people that are really arguing that the polio thing was really never

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 about a "virus" more about DDT and chemical poison.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Yeah, but the government believed in the potential of the virus.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Oh, they believed in it?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Yeah.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Hmm.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Hmm.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Wow.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 Fascinating.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Fascinating.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Dr. Ray Peet is with us.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 We have lots of questions, Doc.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 We'd like to get to as many as we can so we don't use up too much of your time because

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 I know you've got to go Christmas shopping.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 So we're going to take a quick little break here and we'll be right back and get your

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 get your emails.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 So here we go.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 This conversation goes back seven years with Dr. Patrick Flanagan.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Listen.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 And then I discovered that HUNZA water also contained negative ionized hydrogen, which

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 is a source of biological electrons.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 When we're young, we have enzymes in our body called dehydrogenase.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 And the purpose of dehydrogenase is to lift off hydrogen ions from the foods we eat.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 And their purpose is to create NADH, which is a chemical that acts as a shuttle in the

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 mitochondria for producing all the energy in our body, adenosine triphosphate.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 And when people take this, it causes DNA repair.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 It heals the body from all kinds of oxygen-free radicals.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 It also helps the body recover from damage from radiation.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Well, we certainly want some of this stuff, right?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Check out our AquaCure machine.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 AquaCure machine on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Lifetime warranty.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 And along with the lifetime warranty, a one-year, no questions asked, money-back guarantee.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 If you don't like your results, breathe the gas, bubble the water.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Listen to what Dr. Flanagan has to say about this and others.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 We love ours. I think you'll enjoy it.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 I do it a lot.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Drink the water, more breathing the gas.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 And I got myself a 25-foot cannula.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 And you can just-- and it's Brown's gas.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And you can go on MolecularHydrogenInstitute.com and look at some of the many, many peer-reviewed studies.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 A lot of work has been done with hydrogen breathing this.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 And just the hydrogen.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 Our machine does Brown's gas hydrogen, which is a level up, where it's working with the water structure,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 like Gerald Pollack talks about, to make more of these little good guys in your body.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 So it's actually better than molecular hydrogen, Brown's gas.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 But you can go on MolecularHydrogenInstitute.com.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Look at the studies. They've been doing a lot of work with people that have had strokes to help them heal.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Breathing the Brown's gas-- just breathing the molecular hydrogen.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Again, not to get too redundant, but our machine, AquaCure, does Brown's gas, which is a higher level with the water.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 There's a fancy name for it, but it doesn't matter.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 The Gerald Pollack work with the fourth phase of water.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 So it's cool. Check it out.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:41.000

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 When's the last time you heard of somebody having a machine that does that?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 I mean, you could have this thing for 10 months and say, "George, I don't want it. Give me my money back."

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 You're not going to do it, because you'll like it.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 That's my opinion, but you have that option on 1radionetwork.com.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 I spend a lot of time in the outdoors, but I do live in the temperate zone.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 Wintertime means that we're just not getting adequate sunlight to produce enough vitamin D.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 Even if we went outside and exposed ourselves to the sun, there's just not enough UV because of the angle the sun is at.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 A lot of people live in urban environments where buildings effectively act like canyons, blocking sunlight.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 We wear a lot more clothing than ever before.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 And now with things like lockdowns, people are simply not spending as much time outside getting exposure to sun.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 So if you're not getting adequate vitamin D, you can end up with chronically low levels, just like almost half of the American population.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 And that's pretty scary, because vitamin D3 deficiency has been implicated in many forms of cancer and negative outcomes from things like flu and COVID.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 So it's really crucial that we keep our dietary vitamin D3 up.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 And because a lot of the traditional foods, like liver and other organ meats that we used to eat, that were rich in vitamin D3, are no longer really represented in our diet,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 we need some kind of high quality vitamin D3 supplement.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 That's why I love D3K2, Sir Thrival's Daylight Concentrate.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 It's naturally sourced vitamin D3 from sheep's lanolin and K2 from Japanese natto.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 That's the most natural supplement you're going to find anywhere.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 And at 270 doses per bottle, this is an incredibly good value.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Easy to take, just two drops a day.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 Get one for you, get one for your family members.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 This is on any Sir Thrival link and you'll find the colostrum there, the elk velvet antler, pine pollen, the digestive bitters, also the shaga and the reishi, everything in myron glass.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 Very high quality.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 We think you'll enjoy your experience with any Sir Thrival product on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 One of my good friends is Brandon Amelani, who used to work with Daniel.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Brandon has a company called Shen Blossom and he has very high quality, all kind of tied in with Chinese medicine, some very ancient formulas.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 He has a 50 year old ginseng.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Also he does shaga, reishi, some digestive bitters as well and also some digestive powders that you can use.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 I like his detox formulas.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 Wonderful, wonderful products.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 Again, everything in myron glass is like Daniel does.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 Check it out.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 We think you'll enjoy getting something for over the holidays.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Just all kinds of things.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 Very high quality on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Shen Blossom.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 And before we go back to Dr. Pete, remember we have what we think is one of the best portable saunas ever.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 It's a portable sauna, $1,295, far infrared sauna, incredibly low EMFs, there's no radio frequencies, little bit of magnetic energy from the floor to the bottom of the chair.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And your head is sticking out as you can see if you see the video.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 And you can sweat as long as you're getting your water and your little aminos you'll be fine.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 And I do it every day of my life, not that what I do matters, but we think you'll enjoy this puppy.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 It's right on the front page of OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 Well, just click, I'm sorry, the only way you get this baby is to email me, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com for a price that we're not allowed to kind of put in print.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 But just email me, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com and we'll give you the good price.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 We're with PhD Dr. Ray Peet. His website is RayPeet.com. I think it's RayPeet, right? Yeah, RayPeet.com.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And also you can get his newsletter by emailing RayPeetsNewsletter, plural, at gmail.com and it's very affordable.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 And Doc, when that comes out, what, every few months, couple months?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Yeah, I'm going to go from every other month to quarterly this coming year.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Oh, good for you. Yeah, good for you. I think that's the right thing to do.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 So the next one will come out...

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Every three months.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Uh-huh. So it'll be April or March, something like that?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 I'm not sure what the first one will be.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 This is a good question to start with, and we get this a lot.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 What does Dr. Peet think the reason why people feel better when they take ivermectin?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 I mean, because I don't even know if there is a virus and...

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Well, that's what they're saying. It's a long email, but it is a good question.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 Why would people feel better taking ivermectin?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 They believe they have this COVID virus, so they take ivermectin and they feel better.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 I've heard that it does at least 20 different chemical effects in the body,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 but the essential thing, I think, for feeling better as well as recovering more quickly is its anti-inflammatory action.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 And just about any substance or process that is anti-inflammatory is also going to be anti-coagulant to some extent

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 and protect you against the clotting and bleeding syndromes that are associated with COVID.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 I see. And isn't that interesting?

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 I mean, essentially, is ivermectin, isn't it a kind of a parasite for horses kind of thing?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Yeah, it's a bacterial antibiotic substance, a very complex, fairly big molecule.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 It's been used around the world for parasite treatment, billions of doses given to humans to cure intestinal parasites.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 I guess it could be argued that many people do have parasites, so they feel better if they go?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 No, I think the reason they feel better is it has so many good effects related to reducing inflammation.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 I see. How relevant is it for people when they take something like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or something in their belief,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 the placebo, that they are going to feel better? How do you feel about that?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 Oh, the placebo effect is extremely powerful.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 The quinine derivatives, there are two synthetic quinine-like drugs that are, for some reason, prescribed, I guess, cheapness or profitability.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Quinine is the basic thing that has a very broad spectrum of therapeutic value, but just taking a bitter potion is going to have a fairly powerful placebo effect,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 just because you know it has potency if it tastes so bad and bitter.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Interesting. If it tastes yucky, right, it's got to be good for it.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Yeah, like we found a pill which is bright red is a more effective placebo than some neutral colored pill.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 Isn't it interesting? Wow.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 Would you please ask Dr. P, we'll get in the emails here, another one, about the safety of consuming animal brain to raise cholesterol?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Eating eggs and very high sugar diet has moved mine. Perhaps there is another alternative. Karen wants to get her cholesterol number up.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 In a medical school about 50 years ago, someone wondered how effective dietary cholesterol really is at raising the blood level of cholesterol because of all of the fear of eating high cholesterol foods.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 So they had medical students eat every day a different quantity of eggs and up to about 20 eggs per day, they didn't get a cholesterol increase in the blood.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Is that right?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 In the healthy people, but if they were very sick, they could get a cholesterol rise in the blood from a smaller amount.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 But on average, I think it took the healthy medical students about 22 eggs per day to get a rise in their circulating cholesterol.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Well, what does that tell us about the healthy and the...

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 We powerfully regulate the amount of circulating cholesterol because it's an essential factor in our health.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 And the reason cholesterol rises is that it's a defensive substance.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 If you increase the amount of blood and just look at the ovaries production of progesterone, the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary exactly corresponds to the amount of progesterone coming out of the ovary on the other side.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 And that means that when the blood level of cholesterol rises, your body is increasing it so that the defensive protective hormones including DHEA, progesterone, and pregnenolone and so on, these will be increased protectively.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 So that's one of the arguments why folks try to get that cholesterol number up?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 Yeah.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 And usually the most common reason for low cholesterol down around 140 milligrams per cent, or it should be around 200, 160 to 220 or so.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 The thyroid level is what's responsible for converting the cholesterol into the defensive substances.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 But if your liver and intestine are very seriously damaged by poisons coming out of your intestine, then you can't make enough cholesterol to circulate and turn into the protective steroids.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 So the first thing to make sure your liver is able to produce the cholesterol you need for the glands and brain and other tissues to produce the defensive progesterone, the first thing you have to do is stop poisoning your liver by improving your digestion.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 The thyroid and the protective hormones do protect your liver and intestine, but they can't do the job alone if you're eating stuff that's very hard to digest and full of toxins.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 For example, just eating a very big green salad every day, if a person is in perfect health, it'll go right through them quickly, acting as a fiber.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 But if they're already having sluggish digestion, that raw lettuce or spinach or whatever the leaves are will sit in place being warm and exposed to bacteria so that it rots horribly before it gets out of your system.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 And the toxins produced from something seemingly as innocuous as a green salad can very powerfully limit your ability, your intestines and liver's ability to keep up your cholesterol production.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 Wow. So there's times, depending on when salads are not the best choice, you'd be better to cook the greens.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Yeah, that allows your actual digestive enzymes to extract something by breaking down the cellulose that leaves only the bacteria to act on the raw leaves.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 So what's going on in the digestion that is not allowing the raw salad to be a good thing? What's happening? What are we lacking there?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Quick peristalsis.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Quick peristalsis. Yeah. So that's the colon doing its thing to move things through.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Yeah, starting at your stomach. Your stomach has to produce the digestive enzymes quickly, move it on quickly, get your pancreas to excrete more of the digestive enzymes, get it to move on as soon as the body has extracted what it can, then move the residue on quickly and eliminate it.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 And the quicker it goes through, the cleaner your intestine is producing the less lower amount of toxins.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 And how do we ensure that we have these digestive enzymes? I've heard that if you take digestive enzymes, it actually can teach your body not to make them.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 No, I don't think that teaches, but you have to remember that the enzymes can't be cooked to sterilize them. And so when you're eating a so-called enzyme, you're eating a raw animal organ.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 Not good.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 And so you have to be ultra careful that they don't contain bacteria or other infective material.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 Wow. Have you ever found any that are okay to do digestive enzymes?

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 I think it's a matter of trial and error.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 See what works.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 But if you have a good thyroid function as well as all of the essential nutrients, that's the main thing for quick stomach emptying, quick pancreatic secretions, quick peristalsis, and quick elimination.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 So that's why over the years you've focused so much on the thyroid and become really good at understanding it, because if you get this little guy working, then everybody can play along nicely.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Yeah, and there are some foods that can be therapeutic while waiting for your thyroid health to be normalized.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 And what are those?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 My first experience was with the raw carrot every day.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 Oh, that's right. Yeah, raw carrot.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 I stopped having migraines as long as I ate raw carrot every day.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 But then I found that taking thyroid, I was no longer so absolutely dependent on the daily carrot. And there are several other fibers that are just about as safe as carrot.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 The carrot contains some toxins, as plant materials in general do, but the high fiber content of the raw carrot prevents almost all of the toxins from being absorbed.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 You don't even get much carotene if you're, for example, if you just chew your carrot or if you shred it lengthwise so it doesn't produce a lot of juice.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 You don't want to put a carrot through a blender because that releases most of the carotene to be absorbed.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 So you like to shred it like you do it on a cheese shredder kind of thing?

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 Yeah, there are food processors that will make a nice, fine shreddy.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 And don't you put something on it too, if I recall?

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 Olive oil tastes very good, and vinegar. And it happens that both the oil, olive oil, and vinegar, which is a saturated fatty acid, that these are antiseptics.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 And the fiber of the carrot distributes the vinegar and oil all along your intestine.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 So if you just drank the oil and vinegar, it would be gone.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 That's great. And what are some of these other than carrots that do similar things with the high fiber?

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Very well cooked mushrooms are pretty effective. Very well cooked bamboo shoots and the traditional oat bran.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Oat bran?

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 Yeah, the bran has some of the same effects. It has a very low calorie content.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 It makes a very pleasant breakfast cereal to make a porridge out of the oat bran.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 What about steel cut oats? Are they good? Do they work?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 What?

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 Steel cut oats.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 Yeah, I think any oatmeal is--

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 Got some good stuff.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Yeah, it could be rolled oats, or just the grain is fibrous enough that it has a good effect.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 I think the drawback that scares some people away from it is that experiments have found that the oatmeal, as usually consumed, contains, I think it's fatty acid that binds the minerals.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 I'm not sure it's fatty acid, but anyway, something that binds the magnesium and calcium.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 So that according to those experiments, the more oatmeal you eat, the less calcium and magnesium your body can absorb.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 If you're going to eat oatmeal, you have to make sure to get extra milk.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 Milk, yeah, good old milk.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 Here's an email for Dr. Ray Peet, Patrick Timpone.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 Dr. Peet is here on the third Monday.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 We're going to stay around after we let Dr. Peet go and hang out and talk a little bit before we take a couple weeks off for vacation.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 My wife has been diagnosed, writes an email, or with my-- you know what I'm saying, myasthenia gravis.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 How do you say that first word, Doc?

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 Myasthenia.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 Myasthenia gravis.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 Does Dr. Peet have any suggestions that what could be the cause and the help with this condition?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 I've seen improvement just by correcting the thyroid function.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Really? Wow.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 Just the thyroid function.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 And again, you kind of focus in, if I understand, on the TSH, right?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 You want this guy down there to, what did you say, .2?

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Yeah, below 0.4.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 I'm sorry, 0.4.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 It's fairly safe, but it's fine to be even lower than that.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Wow.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 And the body temperature is the other thing.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 The combination of a low TSH with a good warm body temperature that stays around 98.6 for the bulk of the daytime.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 And in the morning, at least 98 or so to when you wake up?

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Yeah, 97.8.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 It's okay if you warm up after breakfast.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 So say if you had your thyroid kind of low under 1 and your temperature is still colder, you'd want to increase the thyroid stuff, the PIG.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 Yeah, generally it could be other hormones lacking, so you want to make sure your whole nutritional intake has all of the essential minerals and vitamins and quantity of protein and carbohydrate.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 All the good stuff.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 Could you please ask Dr. Pete another email?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 Excuse me.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 What he thinks of astaxanthin. It's touted to me in many benefits.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Thanks for having on the show every week.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
 Do you know that one, astaxanthin?

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 It's in the same family as keratin.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 It's an antioxidant, but I'm not too enthusiastic about that general family.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
 Too much of it can interfere with your thyroid function.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 In that family, what family is that?

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 The keratin family. I think that's where this...

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 Astaxanthin, isn't it in the family of like greens or like coloella, spirulina? Maybe not.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 Yeah, my impression is that it's related to the keratin.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 Keratin. What family is that? What are some other keratin family?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.000
 They are precursors or related to vitamin A.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 The other mostly yellow and orange pigments are the flavonoids.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 The bulk of them, there are thousands of different flavonoids,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 but the largest number of them are very protective anti-inflammatory things

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 where the carotenoids can even associate with increased cancer,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 increased damage to the skin from sunburn and so on.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 Does Dr. Ray Peep think it's a good idea to take supplemental iodine for thyroid function?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 No, almost never.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 There are several dozen studies of the iodine intake around the world

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 that increased when they started iodizing salt and found that even...

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 I think it's somewhere around, well, half a milligram a day

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 associates strongly with damage to the thyroid gland and eventually loss of thyroid function.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 Do you think this could be the reason when they start doing the iodized salt thing?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 Could this have been a reason why people have thyroid issues?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 I think that's part of it.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
 Wow, fascinating.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 When did the iodized salt thing happen?

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:52.000
 It did cure a lot of the goiters and hypothyroid, some regions.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 I think parts of China and South America are still very iodine deficient,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 but outside of those areas, the supplemental iodine is more likely to cause damage over the years.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 So that's why we're kind of fans of, say, like the pickling and canning, just pure salt.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 And then that's one of the reasons why you're not a big proponent of these expensive sea salts,

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 because they got a lot of other stuff in there?

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 Yeah, if they aren't purified, that means that at best it'll be some of the clay and mud from the beach where it's collected.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Probably don't need that, right?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 It's hard to predict what kind of harmful minerals might be in that clay.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 The pink salt is very high in iron, so I don't think it's good to use regularly.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 They charge you extra for the pink salt, Doc, you know that.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
 Here's a question for Dr. Pete from Mike.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 If Dr. Pete was elected to replace Dr. Fauci as the chief medical advisor,

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 what recommendations would he make to the American people with regard to the COVID pandemic?

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 Interesting question.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 First, I would look at all of the data, any data that had ever been claimed to be a basis for saying that there is a pandemic.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 Make that public.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:43.000
 Instead of stonewalling when someone sues the government public health agency,

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 instead of keeping the basis for the pandemic existing, instead of keeping it secret,

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 the first thing would be to look at the data that they claimed was confirming the existence of such a thing as a pandemic.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 So far, no such evidence has been found.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 What they did was subsidize people to make up horrible possibilities, imaginary scenarios of what might happen.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 And then that was presented as the science rather than a government-supported hypothesis about the horrible possibilities.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 Yeah. Yeah. Stefan Leinke and these other folks, as you know, they claim that there was the original thing was some kind of snot from somebody,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 and the whole thing was a computer-generated model.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 Yeah. And one of the most under-discussed facts that is right open to everyone is that right after the pandemic was declared,

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 up to that point through history, there had been thousands of people dying seasonally from influenza,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 ordinary flu, and varieties of pneumonia.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 But the week, the second week of April 2020, when there was this horrible spike in deaths, so-called from COVID,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.000
 that week flu went out of existence around the world.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 You don't have influenza committing suicide just so that the same amount of deaths could be blamed on COVID.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 It was simply a renaming of deaths that were happening anyway.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 Yes, sir. Wow.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 Let me just do this email from George.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 What does Dr. Peete make of the videos that I've seen of these football players?

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:33.000
 It's called soccer over there. Up to 100 have already had my cardio infarctions, heart attacks.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 Was that following a vaccine?

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 Yes. Yes.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 Yeah, the figures are clear that the vaccine is pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulation, and with excess coagulation, the risk of bleeding, internal bleeding.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
 So it's a series of very closely related things.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Inflammation causes coagulation, coagulation depletes the defense, and you can end up with a bleeding stroke.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 Go ahead. I'm sorry.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Well, the number of heart attacks is very, very clearly connected to the vaccination.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 And what do we know what the result of any of these extra boosters is?

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 You know, Mr. Fauci, now they're talking about there's going to be two or three or maybe once a year.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 Is there any idea this is or is this so new that we have no idea what these boosters could do to people?

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 I think so far they've just been the same thing over and over.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 Is it just the same thing?

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 More of the same.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 You can't, even with the phony so-called vaccine principle of the RNA, you can't keep up with the changes in the virus.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 So you can't fight an epidemic in process with vaccines.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 It's never been rational.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:30.000
 It's simply a fraudulent scheme to keep people under control.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 Do you think the truth of this, Dr. Ray Peat, on this December 20 day will ever come out?

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000
 What's your theory?

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 Do you think it will ever come out?

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
 The truth is out.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 Of course, it's out.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 It's a matter of whether or not I look at it.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 The people who are convinced that it's a crime not to be vaccinated are never going to look at the evidence.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 You don't think they will?

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 No.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:03.000
 They're actually locking people down in Sweden and other places like that who haven't been vaccinated.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 Locking them down.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
 Putting them in prison camps.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000
 Yes, sir.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 Here's an email from a lady, the fellow that I live with, who I love, is being forced.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 Well, he doesn't have to, but he thinks he's being forced to get a booster shot.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:27.000
 And I'm wondering if I need to refrain from kissing and sex for some time after he gets it.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 Yeah, the shedding, the phenomenon of shedding was known long before the vaccine.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:54.000
 People are always putting out in their sweat, urine, body fluids, and even breath, the proteins and pieces of DNA and RNA that are circulating in their blood.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000
 They come right out of the person into the air and surroundings.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
 That's established.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:18.000
 So if you have a new circulating material in the body, the vaccine, they simply asserted that it wouldn't get away from your arm lymph nodes.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
 It wouldn't get into your general circulation.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:31.000
 But it was shown to circulate in the bloodstream, concentrated in the gonads and other tissues.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 They're still saying, even though now it's acknowledged to circulate to all of the organs to some extent,

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:51.000
 they're saying it can't get into the breastfeeding woman's milk for the same reason that it couldn't get into the bloodstream.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:04.000
 So if it can't get into the milk, naturally the vaccine can't make the baby sick, except there's no fact to support their claims.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 We had a virologist on, Dr. Janci Lindsey, very well respected lady who's testified in court cases and all this.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 And she laid out a pretty eloquent argument with science and peer reviews and from people all over the world,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000
 that these things are going all over the body, just as you just said, everywhere, everywhere.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:41.000
 And since the vaccine has its course from the arm through your bloodstream to various organs,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 it settles out into those organs and gradually disappears from the bloodstream.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:58.000
 So it's thought that the maximum shedding is going to be while it's circulating through your bloodstream,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
 getting into your breath and sweat and so on.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:11.000
 And naturally, if it gets into your sweat, it's able to get into the breast milk.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:23.000
 So is that an argument that for this emailer to after some time, she wouldn't have to be concerned with her significant other?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 Yeah, possibly up to a month, but usually the first two weeks after vaccination is when you're most likely to be shedding.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000
 So if I understand though, what I heard you say, correct me if I'm wrong, that we are always shedding or sharing,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.000
 whatever you want to call them, exosomes or virus with everybody, aren't we? All the time?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 Yeah, everything that circulates in the blood, surprisingly, even long strips of bare nucleic acids,

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:10.000
 it doesn't have to be encapsulated in the lipid to go through blood vessels and so on.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 As controlled as they've injected bare DNA and found that it went right through so-called cell membranes, got inside cells.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000
 And so that stuff circulating in the blood is always, some of it blows out through your lungs.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 So if you put a cold object under your nose that allows condensation on the cold and then analyze that,

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:51.000
 you'll find proteins, fats, RNA, DNA, bits of everything.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:00.000
 It's just the way it works. What's your theory of why it's been set up like this from God or whichever belief system one has?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
 Why would it be like this?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.000
 The exosomes actually come out in your breath and body fluids.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:24.000
 So spreading through the urine, the sweat and the breath, these are sharing our genetic discoveries with all of our colleagues.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:34.000
 Everyone is sharing the patterns that are a part of their life.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:45.000
 It turns out that like bacteria share the particles that make them immune to antibiotics.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:57.000
 They'll pass them on not only to related bacteria but even to stranger bacteria across species or types of bacteria.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
 So as a species we're essentially trying to help one another get healthier in a way, right?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:16.000
 Yeah, in the case of bacteria, it's very clear but the same process happens among plants and animals of all sorts.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:25.000
 But we think in terms almost, which may be incorrect, is bacteria being bad that we don't want any.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:36.000
 Yeah, sometimes the bacteria will shed things that we don't want, that are poisonous to us.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
 But also the bacteria has been said to be a healing process too.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
 Yeah, on balance.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:56.000
 We've done pretty well with the bacteria environment. The bulk effect has been good.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 So if Dr. Pete or Patrick or our listeners allow, say maybe a strep throat to happen, let the bacteria heal the tissues as many argue, rather than get an antibiotic,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000
 that bacteria then can be shared with others so they can do the same thing?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 No, your throat shouldn't let the bacteria reach that point.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.000
 A healthy person can have the same germs present but they aren't hurting anything.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:37.000
 So there's a failure in the ground substance that you can't blame entirely on the bacteria.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
 But so are you advocating then if somebody has strep throat to get an antibiotic?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:55.000
 Yeah, once it has reached the point of pain, getting rid of it is quick and then figuring out why you've allowed that bacteria to go crazy.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
 But doesn't when we take an antibiotic, Dr. Pete, kind of mess a lot of things up?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:10.000
 Yeah, but you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not to try to kill everything.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:20.000
 Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:32.000
 Since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakening your mitochondria.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.000
 You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
 So if they give you 20 and the pain goes away in two days, you can stop there?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.000
 Yeah, give it maybe half a day of tapering off just to make sure it's gone.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
 But don't do the whole thing.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
 They always tell you to do the whole thing though, don't they?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 Yeah, they don't want to have to pay attention or think about it.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:17.000
 Rachel writes in, "Could you please ask Dr. Pete, to what causes the body to attack itself as in an autoimmune disease?

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:24.000
 I have an autoimmune disease in which my body is supposedly attacking my muscles and causing muscle weakness.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
 What would be the best diet and supplement for something like this?"

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 My current newsletter has a little bit about that.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:44.000
 The histamine, for example, activated by estrogen and many other things,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:09:02.000
 but histamine and estrogen and endotoxin, each of those tends to make your tissues take up water, get inflamed,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:09.000
 start producing more histamine or analogous things,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000
 release endotoxin from your intestine to circulate through your bloodstream.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
 Endotoxin makes things more inflamed, leakier.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:33.000
 The histamine effect in cells is causing a local uptick of water,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:48.000
 a change of the protein relation to the surrounding water, and activation of the cell excitation shift to inefficient metabolism towards lactic acid production, for example.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:10:03.000
 These transmitters that change the metabolism are changing the antigenic properties of the cell.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:09.000
 It doesn't take a powerful chemical reaction.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:23.000
 Just a stretching or excess bending or swelling of a tissue can change the protein confirmation enough that it becomes antigenic.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 Your immune system sees what looks like a foreign antigen because of these intrinsic pro-inflammatory signals.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 The cell is swelling up and getting deranged.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000
 To the immune system, at an extreme, that looks like a foreign material.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:57.000
 The immune system comes in and tries to clean up the damage the way it would with a bacteria or fungal infection.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:07.000
 It kills the cells and carries away the debris as far as possible.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:32.000
 Although these same components, histamine and estrogen, for example, will shift your immune system, knocking out the brain of your immune system, the thymus cells, suppressing them and releasing the antibody-forming B cells,

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:59.000
 and at the same time activating an enzyme that creates actual genetic change, a genomic destabilization enzyme, they call it AID, that produces novel antibodies.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:08.000
 You're generating more and more antibodies under the influence of estrogen and histamine.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:27.000
 The immune system seems to be going a little crazy, but what it's doing is revving up and trying to clear away the tissue damage, which has been the basic problem.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000
 I think of it as the tissue damage as being primary.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:51.000
 If you stop the inflammation, restore oxidative metabolism and energy production, you restore a lot of those proteins to their natural conformation so they are no longer energetic,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:59.000
 then your immune system will be able to quiet down and stop attacking.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:09.000
 So, the autoimmune model that we've heard about, it literally does attack tissues that it shouldn't be because it's confused?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:22.000
 Yes. Once you've activated the B cells to produce more and more antibodies, then they're less discriminant.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:41.000
 They'll start trying to remove too many cells and make the inflammation worse, but you've got to turn off the inflammation first and worry about getting rid of the antibodies.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:52.000
 When you're hypothyroid, your thyroid tissue is under stress and you'll form antibodies to those stressed thyroid cells.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:08.000
 All you have to do is supplement the needed amount of thyroid hormone and nutrients and allow the TSH to stop overdriving and stressing your thyroid gland.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:16.000
 Gradually, over a period of six months to a year, those antithyroid antibodies will fade away.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:28.000
 Fascinating. We came across a website that might be of interest. If they're accurate, it seems that they would be.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:35.000
 They're very professional, the whole thing. It's called Let's Get Checked.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:45.000
 For a very small amount, you can get a test kit and do a blood thing and you can test your TSH just at home.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
 That would be convenient.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:58.000
 Yeah. I did mine and that's how I found out mine was where it was. I suspect it's accurate. You'd have no way of knowing, but it seems like they know what they're doing.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:07.000
 It's called Let's Get Checked. It might be interesting for people. You could just do your TSH. I think it was like $75 or something.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:18.000
 Having a lot of friends writes an email asking how to detox from the vaccine. Does Dr. Peete have some ideas about this?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:36.000
 I think treating it exactly the way you would treat the COVID infection because the spike protein is what causes the inflammatory coagulation damage.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:57.000
 The spike protein occurs from the vaccine just as much as from the virus itself. So taking the same anti-inflammatory things, that would be aspirin, antihistamines,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:10.000
 even glucocorticoids or progesterone will help to reduce the inflammation.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:36.000
 Getting enough carbohydrate in your diet to restrain histamine production is part of it. Don't fast or eat a pure protein diet. That would tend to increase the inflammation and coagulation.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:45.000
 So on the histamine thing, you want to get adequate carbohydrates for that not to get up, right?

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:54.000
 Can you ask Dr. Peete about ways of protecting yourself from vaccine shedding? Maybe the same kind of answer?

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:18.000
 Not being around crowds that are likely to be shedding. I think things like a sudden burst of nosebleeds or untimely menstruation and so on,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:29.000
 I think those are likely effects of crowd-induced shedding poisoning.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:40.000
 It's December 20, 2021. Patrick Timpone. We're going to stick around after we let Dr. Peete go and spend some time with you before we take a couple weeks off.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:48.000
 Erin writes in, "I have a toothache and the gum around the tooth is inflamed. Does Dr. Peete have any suggestions what I can do?"

01:17:48.000 --> 01:18:16.000
 Very often that starts with something you ate. I had that experience for many years. An incipient tooth abscess or abscess below a tooth would flare up as soon as I ate potatoes or tomatoes.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:28.000
 It was a way of training me to stop eating the foods that were affecting my mouth as well as my intestine.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:46.000
 Fascinating. Here's an email. "I want to take a liquid supplement orally that has DMSO as a solvent. If I'm not allergic to DMSO, is 200 mg of DMSO orally a safe amount to take every day in the long term?"

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
 Using it as a solvent for what?

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.000
 They're asking about a liquid supplement that has a little bit of DMSO in there. I've never heard of that.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000
 I think not a good thing to take every day.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
 Why would you take DMSO internally?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:28.000
 They have found that it has an anti-inflammatory effect. It helps the same way progesterone and anti-inflammatory things do to let the cell give up some of the water it shouldn't have.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:49.000
 But there are so many safer ways to reduce inflammation in cells. You can't always count on the DMSO being as pure as it should be. It can carry trace allergens into your tissues.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:20:07.000
 Here's an interesting question for you, "Doc, any ideas of why my long brown hair is thinning so much it breaks off at the shaft right where the follicle enters the scalp and comes out with the slightest pull?"

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 That's most often an effect of low thyroid. In animal studies, they find that, for example, a woman who was using estrogen cream found that her fuzzy dogs were going bald just from being so thin.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:52.000
 Just from being in contact with her skin, estrogen cream, the estrogen tends to end the cycle of the fascia right here.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:08.000
 Low thyroid slows the growth and thins the shaft diameter so it gets weaker and weaker as your thyroid is lower and the estrogen higher.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:26.000
 That's just an incredible thing when you think about it. The TSH, you're talking about 0.4 for thyroid function. That's so much lower than what is generally believed to be the right TSH level.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:45.000
 Oh yeah, just lately I've heard from several people with a 4.something TSH and they're obviously sick and their symptoms are all traceable to an excess of TSH.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:22:09.000
 TSH itself is pro-inflammatory and just lowering it is going to improve your symptoms but increasing the metabolic rate by supplementing thyroid with the anti-inflammatory effect of getting rid of excess TSH.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:27.000
 If you're experimenting with your thyroid, whether it be Piggy or whatever it is, Doc, how long would you want to be on it before you could reliably say, "Well, I'm going to do another quick TSH maybe with this company to see where it is."

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
 How long would you want to be on it before it would be relevant?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:59.000
 Since it's very hard to predict what dose you need, it's important to monitor your daily reaction by checking your pulse rate and temperature at waking and middle of the day and to gradually increase the dose until you're at an optimal body temperature and pulse rate.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:14.000
 Only at that point should you bother to check the TSH again because the temperature and pulse rate are going to be changing as you're adapting to the dose.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.000
 How do we know what would be just the right pulse rate for us, for you and I and our listeners?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:29.000
 Whatever works for you to some extent.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:58.000
 When you look at both healthy populations versus sick populations or if you look at people in a given state of health who happen to have a heart pacemaker, for example, they've given mental acuity tests to people with different heart rates or with a pacemaker installed.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:16.000
 If they run the heart at 70 beats and have a certain quality of memory and reasonability, then they turn it up to 80 beats per minute and give them the test again.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:25.000
 All of their mental faculties have improved just by increasing the heart rate a little above 70.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
 Same with very healthy, very alert people.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
 They tend to have faster heart rates.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.000
 And females too have faster heart rates in general, don't they?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
 Yeah.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:51.000
 Women have smaller hearts than men and like kids have much faster pulse rates because their heart is smaller and their metabolic rate is higher.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000
 But women generally have a slower metabolic rate than men.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:14.000
 But with a smaller heart, you have to consider their body temperature and body size and so on to judge what each one means.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:28.000
 But again, then in the afternoon, say 1 or 2 o'clock, if you're just hanging around the house, you want to really try to be at 98.6 and that's a good indication of what your TSH is doing?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
 Very, very close in the long run.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
 Wow. Fascinating.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:41.000
 An emailer says, "Doesn't orange juice spike your insulin? I try to keep my carbs under 50 grams per day."

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
 Oh, why do you want to keep it there?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
 I don't know. That's what she said.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
 What would you make up the calorie difference with?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:06.000
 Too much protein can be pro-inflammatory and anti-metabolic, slowing your thyroid function and lowering your temperature.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:20.000
 Carbohydrates are really the most adjustable because sugar tends to increase your heat production and metabolic rate.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:31.000
 Calcium and vitamin D are other things that increase your ability to oxidize calories.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:43.000
 I think anything up to over 200 grams a day is fine as long as your calorie intake is in balance and your heat production is good.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
 Is there any way to protect oneself from airplane radiation while traveling?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:27:03.000
 The cosmic radiation, the scare about high-altitude radiation was invented by the nuclear industry.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:20.000
 People at high altitudes have much lower incidence of cancer despite the higher cosmic ray intensity.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:34.000
 The cosmic rays per unit of radiation are less harmful than the lower energy.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000
 It's a matter of what they call linear energy transfer.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 It means that low-energy x-ray is more toxic than high-energy x-ray.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:59.000
 Gamma rays are higher energy than x-rays and they're less toxic because they transfer less energy to the tissues.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:15.000
 Particle radiation is ordinarily far more toxic than the electromagnetic x-rays, ultraviolet or gamma rays

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:23.000
 because the particle slows down and gives up all of its energy to the tissue.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:38.000
 But in the case of cosmic rays, they are so extremely fast-moving that they give up a much smaller amount of energy to harm the tissue.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.000
 This is anecdotal, but I have a good friend of mine who is over 80.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
 He's one of the healthiest guys I know and he was a pilot his whole life.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:57.000
 If that whole pilot thing or flying, he wouldn't even be around. It was so dangerous.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:04.000
 Yeah, insurance companies have known for more than 100 years that living at very high altitudes,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
 you have less cancer and heart disease mortality.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:13.000
 Now his hair is totally white and he said it's been white most of his life. That's interesting.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
 I don't know how that happened, but you know.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
 Here's Lydia, a couple more then we'll let you go, Doc.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
 Our salt has not been iodized for so long now.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:34.000
 People are deficient. See Dr. Brownstein's work on this, especially with regard to bromine-iodine relationship.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:43.000
 Yeah, Brownstein was a follower of Guy Abraham.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:53.000
 I think there's a lot of assertion, almost no science behind those claims.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:08.000
 It's only these two or three people descended mentally from Abraham the pro-iodine.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.000
 He sold an iodine product.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
 You're not talking about like Abraham, biblical Abraham, somebody else?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000
 No, no. Dr. Abraham.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
 A fellow that sold an iodine product and that's where this all came from?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
 Yeah, his website.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:40.000
 Although he worked in the same lab before I did, doing hamster aging research.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000
 After that, I think his whole thing was to sell his products.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:54.000
 His website had totally insane stuff about radiation and iodine.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.000
 After I ridiculed it, the worst of it disappeared.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:10.000
 Didn't Edgar Cayce claim that he helped the body cure from some, what was it with iodine?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:15.000
 Was it some kind of plague thing? Do you know what I mean?

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:31.000
 Yeah, it was used to, scrofula was the original thing, but it was a traditional anti-inflammatory antiseptic drug.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:48.000
 Generally, what Edgar Cayce said was pretty well founded, but I think you have to interpret the iodine stuff very carefully.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
 Oh, sorry, I didn't quite get that.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:32:00.000
 So, he was on to something with the iodine? What disease was he thinking of that he used it for?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
 It was somebody in India. Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:17.000
 It's been successfully used for a lot of things. Heart disease, hardening of the arteries, breast tumors even.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
 But we don't need it now, you argue.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:25.000
 No, we've been over-supplied with dietary iodine now.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:42.000
 For example, bread and baked goods, for a long time we were using iodine dough conditioner to make the dough produce lighter bread.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
 Just using for a physical effect an iodine compound.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:56.000
 And that alone was giving the American population for decades a toxic overdose of iodine.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000
 Do we get iodine when we eat fresh fish as well?

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:12.000
 Yeah, having a serving of fish from the ocean once a week will pretty much guarantee our adequate iodine.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
 And any seaweed kind of stuff too would give us plenty of iodine, right?

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:24.000
 Yeah, but you can overdose. A lot of people overdose by using an iodine-rich seaweed.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
 And what would the symptoms be of an overdose?

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:36.000
 I think it contributes to the high incidence of nearsightedness in the Japanese.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
 Really?

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 And antithyroid effect can show up as nearsightedness.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
 Wow, interesting.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.000
 Final one, this is a good question.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:59.000
 Somebody just wrote in here, our friend Adam Bergstrom, Dr. Pete, he said Guy E. Abraham.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:05.000
 Yeah, I'm not sure how you pronounce his first name, but French would be Guy.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
 Guy E. Abraham, that's who you're talking about in this iodine thing.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.000
 Yeah.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:21.000
 Wow. Final one, so Dr. Pete just said that the thyroid has to do a lot with hair follicles and calling it a low thyroid TSH reading.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000
 Would increasing my dosage help with the hair falling out as I am on two-grain natural thyroid?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
 And would it raise my heart rate if I increased it?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:37.000
 So she's right now on two grains, which is what, 120 milligrams?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.000
 Yeah, that was the average dose for decades, using a thyroid.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
 And would that, do you think the average dose is higher now for any reason?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
 No, it's probably around 120.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:03.000
 And again, if somebody wasn't sure, they can either do the test or work with the body temperature and the pulse.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
 Yeah, you definitely don't want to start right out with two grains.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
 No.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:28.000
 Even if that's what you're going to end up with in six months, as the starting dose, it could easily cause heart pains or it will imbalance your nutrients to go at it too suddenly.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:41.000
 Oh, finally, do you think even the best of food grade or food source vitamins are reasonable to take?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
 What was the last phrase?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000
 Food source, like all from food and organic foods, some kind of vitamin supplement.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
 They have good liquid ones that appear to be good.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000
 Do you think it's reasonable to play with those?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:06.000
 No, if they're supposed to be extracted from foods, they're going to be far more expensive than the food would be.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
 Right, yes.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:19.000
 And in the process of extracting them, very often extraneous materials get in and you lose some of the active ingredients.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:29.000
 Yeah, well Dr. Pete, such an honor to have you on and thanks so much for coming on here once a month.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
 We really, really appreciate it.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
 Oh, okay, it's always fun.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
 Yeah, well I'm glad you have a good time and glad you keep coming.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
 So we'll see you next year, huh? Have fun.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
 Santa Claus coming around your house, do you think?

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
 Probably.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
 Oh, well good, well that's great.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:51.000
 Sir, thank you, I love you and you let us know if we can help and we'll see you third week in January.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
 Oh, okay, thank you.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:59.000
 Thank you, sir. Dr. Ray Pete, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
 He's the bomb, huh?

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
 Yep, yep, I tell you what, I like his stuff.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:14.000
 Well, you know what we're going to do here, just because it's my kind of last day with you before I go on a little vacay.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
 What do you say I just go to the little boys room?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
 That's probably more information than what you need.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:25.000
 And then we'll just come back in about five minutes and hang out for a little bit.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
 We'll go through some of the news.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:31.000
 If you want to call in, 888-663-6386.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000
 And we'll just play around for a little bit before we kind of wrap up our 2021 year with you.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
 As we're going to take some time off and come back on the third with Adam Bergstrom.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
 I think it's the third of January.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
 So stay right there.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
 Thank you. Pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
 If you'd like to look at our videos, they're on BitChute.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
 The link is right on the top front of OneRadioNetwork.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
 Sign up for Telegram.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
 We have quite a nice group we're developing there.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
 The Telegram link, it's a social media network platform that doesn't censor anybody.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.000
 And, you know, we're back on Facebook now after being in jail for 30 days.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
 But I'm pretty feisty, so I don't know how long that's going to last.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 But email me if I can help with anything.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
 Our website will be here all year round.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
 I mean, all the rest of the last two weeks.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000
 So if you need something, don't be shy about ordering up from all of our fine people you see on the front page.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
 We've got some really, really nice products.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.000
 No matter what it is, Sulphur, Sona, we'll get, you know, we'll take care of it.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
 You'll get things shipped out before the end of the year.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
 You know, I'll still be around the computer.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
 So whatever you want to order, if I can help you with anything, let me know.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
 And we'll hang out for a little bit before we go.
