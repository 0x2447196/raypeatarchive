00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, broadcasting worldwide, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Well, a very pleasant good morning to you. It's a little bit, well, whatever it is. It's

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 December 20 is what it is. You don't care what time it is. You have a clock on the wall

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 if you want to see that. This is Patrick Timpone. Good morning, and it's great to be here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 It's the third Monday of each month following Richard Massey. We have one of our fave guys,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 and a fellow that I have so much respect for is Dr. Ray Peat, PhD in biology long ago,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 University of Oregon, where he still lives today in Eugene. Spent a lot of time way down

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 in Mexico. He did quite a bit of research long ago on progesterone, hormones, and how

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 progesterone and hormones are related. This was way back in '68 when I started in radio.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 The key idea was that energy and structure are independent in every level. He talked

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 about how progesterone projects the body's structure and energy against the harmful effects

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 of estrogen, radiation, stress, and lack of oxygen. Certainly a lot of things that we

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 have today, and we have a lot of fun talking to him. I need some water. Excuse me. Whoops.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Let me grab it here. Let me grab it here. A little water. It's been very dry here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Cold and dry, which is kind of nice, like 40 degrees at night and 75 in the afternoon.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 So it's been really a beautiful time to be here in Central Texas. What I was about to

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 say, while I was so rudely interrupted by my dry throat, is that if you care to ask

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 a question of Dr. Peat, we already have a lot of great ones, and we'll try to get to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 all of them. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. After Dr. Peat,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 I'm going to come on and do another little segment. This is the last show we're going

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 to do between now and January 3. I'm going to take some time off and work on the screenplay

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 and whip it into shape, continue to rewrite and rewrite. I thought it'd be fun to kind

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 of connect with you one-to-one before we go off on a little vacay. So right after Dr.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Peat's show, we'll come back on and talk about some of the news and play around a little

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 bit before we go on our vacation. Dr. Ray Peat is, as I said, in Oregon, and we're going

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 to say hi to him. Dr. Peat, good morning to you, sir. Thanks for coming on.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Dr. Peat>> Good morning.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Patrick>> Well, here we are. Man, we made another year, Doc. I don't know how we did

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Dr. Peat>> Yep.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Patrick>> It's really been something, isn't it, the last couple of years with this whole

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 virus thing? Pretty interesting, isn't it?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Dr. Peat>> Yeah. I think the population is sort of deciding what they believe and not

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 going to learn much more. It looks like about half and half, even people who got vaccinated,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 are realizing that what the government says is seldom true.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Patrick>> Yeah.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Dr. Peat>> And the other half knew all along that you can't trust the government.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Patrick>> So interesting, isn't it, Dr. Peat, of how is it possible that we could really

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 trust the science when they just keep making things up?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Dr. Peat>> Yeah. Fauci's principle is, "I am science. Trust me."

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Patrick>> That's right.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Dr. Peat>> And that's exactly what science isn't. Science is a matter of questioning

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 science. It isn't science if it isn't questionable.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 Patrick>> And the idea that there... Is there such a thing as a consensus? I mean, how does

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 it work? How do you scientists really figure out... Do you just come to your own conclusion

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 of what's true?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Dr. Peat>> Oh, the consensus. I had an interesting exchange with a researcher a few years ago

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 and doubted something that she had said and asked for a copy of the paper. And I read

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 the paper through three or four times and couldn't find a trace of what the title said

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 it was about. And so I mentioned it to her and she, three or four times, said, "You didn't

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 read it carefully." And finally I said, "That title claim is absolutely not represented

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 any more in the paper." And she said, "But that's the consensus."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Patrick>> Oh, that's the consensus.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Dr. Peat>> That's what people believe. So she doesn't have to support it in any way.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 And how consensus... The Tao Chi thing is a very clear example. He has some power over

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 government officials that keep him in his office, despite conflicts of interest, going

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 back to his very beginning in the office. But for some reason, the politicians are powerless

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 to fire him. And so that power he has is where the consensus comes from. And in the society

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 in a bigger sense, going back 70 or 80 years, we can see the government directly getting

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 involved in all of the major scientific questions, biological, physical, sociological, and so

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 on. The government intervened with its grant power. Science was turning away from individual

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 researchers with a little self-financed lab. It wasn't acceptable science if it didn't

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 have financing. And so government and the huge corporations controlled financing to

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 direct science to go the way they wanted it. And just before the Second World War was when

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 the giant corporations were essentially taking over government regulation and financing of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 science research and directing how the science journals would publish, how the universities

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 would teach. They wouldn't support grants to the universities if they taught the wrong

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 things. And so the corporations working with and through the government have created a

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 consensus of power, the beliefs the corporations wanted to instill that were acceptable to

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 the government. So the combination of government and big corporations are the consensus. And

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 if you dissent, you don't get any funding. Do you remember Peter Griesberg and the AIDS

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 controversy? I heard the story that at the height of his rejection by the establishment,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 a high official phoned him and said he wanted to talk to him personally. So he flew across

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 the country and invited Griesberg to dinner. And after they ate, he pulled out a paper,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 an article saying that HIV causes AIDS. And it was written supposedly by Peter Griesberg.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 And the guy said, if he signed on to that, and let him publish it under his name, that

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 he would no longer be an outcast. He would get his grants again and be invited to the

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 scientific meetings and so on. And naturally, Griesberg refused and stayed an outcast.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Do you think it's to the whole Fauci connection and these drugs that were killing this gay

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 community with an HIV thing that really never existed? Is that true?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 That's my belief and that's Peter Griesberg's. And I've gone through everything Griesberg

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 has published on the subject and talked to him. One of the crucial things that I had

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 read about that he said was an unavoidable consideration was that the military recruits

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 in 1960s, blood samples were taken and frozen from all of the potential draftees. And going

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 back in the age of HIV and AIDS, those blood samples were tested. And it was found that

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 over the years of freezing, all of the 18 year old men in the country were given a blood

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 sample in those years. Every year, the blood tested about, and I don't remember whether

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 it was 0.4 or 0.5 percent positive for HIV. So the whole population, 30 years before AIDS

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 was known, showed exactly the same proportion of the population as being HIV positive as

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 exists at present. It's a resonant component of our makeup of about 0.4 or 0.5 percent

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 of the people with this inert antigen of the HIV virus.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 So we all, that's why Rich, actually my good friend and biological dentist, Dr. Stuart

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 and Lindley, they have found this HIV thing in root canals.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Yeah, it's going to be in half percent of everyone you test. If you, Duesberg points

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 out that our liver is full of probably thousands of these remnant viruses. Not even sure that

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 they were ever functioning as a virus, but they have the structure of a virus. They could

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 be pollen you inhaled.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Who knows. Like this exosome idea, Dr. Peat?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 Yeah. Anyway, they are resonant in our tissues just as part of, they call it the dark DNA.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 It only takes a very small percentage of our genome DNA to make, to describe a person.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 Something like 97 percent of it is mysterious, so-called dark DNA.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Dark DNA.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 In that, there are thousands of these inert virus remnants. So that if you're sick, your

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 tissues are stirred up, the genome is activated and disturbed and lets out a relatively broad

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 spectrum of this dark DNA. Duesberg suggests that HIV is just one of these, but it would

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 account for sick people testing positive more than healthy people. But in the general population,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 it's about a half percent test positive.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 So with sick, then we can also argue that that's really could be the healing process

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 as well.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Yeah. The liver is putting out sort of hypotheses about what might help to repair the stress.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 So it's an explosion of variability. And if you test for that variability, you see things

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 that are associated with people being sick, but it doesn't mean that they have anything.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 They have anything. So then this is why the famous videos are out there that we've streamed,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Dr. Peat, on our show, on our network from Kerry Mullis, the Nobel Prize winner for the

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 PCR test. And he very clearly says, if you spin this thing high enough, you can come

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 up with thousands of things it'll find.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 Yeah. And the government instructions right from the start-

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 It's 45, right?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Yeah. Twice as many as you knew would produce false positives. So what they did was create

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 an epidemic of tests. The more tests they did, exactly corresponding to the increase

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 in the number of tests, the increase in the number of so-called cases increased.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Yes.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 And so the cases were simply a reflection of how many people you tested.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 And so this whole thing was run on false data that nobody's talked about except alternative

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 places like here. And other people have, but just a handful compared to media.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And suddenly when the virus, when the vaccine came on the market, the government said, "Okay,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 now you can run it to normal 30 or 35 cycles and that'll make it look like we're curing

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 the disease because there'll be fewer positives."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Oh, so they can change the spins.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Yeah.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 They probably do that with an email or a telegram, whatever, the connection with the PCR test

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 company. Well, when they did the whole AIDS thing in the late '70s and around '80,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 was it a similar, do you know, Doc, PCR type test where they came up with some kind of

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 identification of this molecule, HIV?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 No, I don't think that came until later.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 So what did they use?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 The antigen, I think, was the main specific identifier.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 The antigen.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Antibody, antigen reactions.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Which is part and parcel of the molecules at the release. The liver just kind of throws

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 out when things are going on?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 Yeah. For many years, the antibody, you would put some of the sample in an animal and elicit

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 antibodies to it and then concentrate those antibodies and use it to identify the substance.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 You can still make a microscopic image of something by applying the right type of antibody

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 to the microscope slide and the specific antibody will be labeled with either a dye or radioactive

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 isotope so that you can make a picture of specific types of protein antigens.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 So there's many views, of course, on the idea of this isolation and you're on record saying,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 well, it doesn't really need to be isolated to maybe to cause or affect people and be

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 shared, and that's fair enough.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 But if there, whatever this original COVID thing is or isn't or out of a lab or natural,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 could this entity, if it exists, actually mutate into another thing called Delta or

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Omicron? Is that even possible?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Oh, yeah. You can engineer, you can start with a bat virus or any kind of a known transmissible

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 virus-like agent and then using the DNA engineering techniques that have developed over the last

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 50 or 60 years, you can change individual amino acids or you can take out a block and

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 put in a new block that has a known function.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 So you can write your own virus program, essentially. That's what Ralph Berrick and his lab at the

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 University of North Carolina and the Port Dietrich Germ Warfare Lab, what they specialize

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 in is creating gain-of-function viruses where you make a harmless animal virus able to infect

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 a human being and then to make it more or less virulent by adding a stretch of DNA that

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 increases certain activities.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 And Dr. Peat, if one did that, how would they distribute that to people?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 During World War II, the Germans and Japanese were leaders in germ warfare, but the U.S.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 recruited their germ warfare experts instead of hanging them. They came to work for the

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 U.S. government and at that time, the Fort Dietrich Lab was just one of two or three

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 major germ warfare experimental labs.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 The author of the best-selling medical physiology textbook, Arthur Guyton, was working for the

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Germ Warfare Lab right at the end of World War II, and his specialty was to make aerosols

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 out of germs such as a polio virus to make it survivable and transmissible through the

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 air. The government was experimenting. They would use a marker bacterium as something

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 that was easy to find when it infected people. They sprayed San Francisco, for example, with

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 an aerosol of a bacterium that produced a very visible response in the individual without

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 especially making them sick. So they were testing it on innocent American populations.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 In the process of making aerosols from the polio germs, Arthur Guyton became a polio

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 doctor and retired to teach medical physiology at the University of Mississippi and write

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 his famous but very stupid textbook.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 But, you know, there are people that are really arguing that the polio thing was really never

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 about a "virus" and more about DDT and chemical poison.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Yeah, but the government believed in the potential of the virus.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 Oh, they believed in it?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 Yeah.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Wow, fascinating.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com. We have lots of questions,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Doc. We'd like to get to as many as we can so we don't use up too much of your time because

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 I know you've got to go Christmas shopping. So we're going to take a quick little break

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 here, and we'll be right back and get your e-mails. So here we go.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 This conversation goes back seven years with Dr. Patrick Flanagan. Listen.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 And then I discovered that HUNZO water also contained negative ionized hydrogen, which

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 is a source of biological electrons. When we're young, we have enzymes in our body called

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 dehydrogenase, and the purpose of dehydrogenase is to lift off hydrogen ions from the foods

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 we eat, and their purpose is to create NADH, which is a chemical that acts as a shuttle

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 in the mitochondria for producing all the energy in our body, adenosine triphosphate.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 And when people take this, it causes DNA repair. It heals the body from all kinds of oxygen-free

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 radicals. It also helps the body recover from damage from radiation.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 Well, we certainly want some of this stuff, right? Check out our AquaCure machine. AquaCure

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.000

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 I think you'll enjoy it. I do it a lot. Drink the water, more breathing the gas. And I got

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 myself a 25-foot cannula. And it's Brown's gas. And you can go on molecularhydrogeninstitute.com

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 and look at some of the many, many peer-reviewed studies. A lot of work has been done with

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 hydrogen breathing this. And just the hydrogen. Our machine does Brown's gas hydrogen, which

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 is a level up where it's working with the water structure like Gerald Pollack talks

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 about to make more of these little good guys in your body. So it's actually better than

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 molecular hydrogen, Brown's gas. But you can go on molecularhydrogeninstitute.com,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 look at the studies. They've been doing a lot of work with people that have had strokes

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 to help them heal. Just breathing the molecular hydrogen. Again, not to get too redundant,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 but our machine, AquaCure, does Brown's gas, which is a higher level with the water.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 There's a fancy name for it, but it doesn't matter. The Gerald Pollack work with the fourth

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 level water. So it's cool. Check it out. Use promo code OneRadio, 10% discount, a lifetime

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 warranty, and a one-year no-questions-asked money-back warranty. When's the last time

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 you heard of somebody having a machine that does that? I mean, you could have this thing

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 for 10 months and say, "George, I don't want it. Give me my money back." You're not going

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 to do it because you'll like it. That's my opinion, but you have that option on

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 I spend a lot of time in the outdoors, but I do live in the temperate zone. Wintertime

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 means that we're just not getting adequate sunlight to produce enough vitamin D. Even

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 if we went outside and exposed ourselves to the sun, there's just not enough UV because

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 of the angle the sun is at. A lot of people live in urban environments where buildings

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 effectively act like canyons, blocking sunlight. We wear a lot more clothing than ever before.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 And now with things like lockdowns, people are simply not spending as much time outside

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 getting exposure to sun. So if you're not getting adequate vitamin D, you can end up

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 with chronically low levels, just like almost half of the American population. And that's

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 pretty scary because vitamin D3 deficiency has been implicated in many forms of cancer

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 and negative outcomes from things like flu and COVID. So it's really crucial that we

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 keep our dietary vitamin D3 up. And because a lot of the traditional foods like liver

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 and other organ meats that we used to eat that were rich in vitamin D3 are no longer

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 really represented in our diet, we need some kind of high quality vitamin D3 supplement.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 That's why I love D3K2, Sir Thrival's Daylight Concentrate. It's naturally sourced vitamin

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 D3 from sheep's lanolin and K2 from Japanese natto. That's the most natural supplement

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 you're going to find anywhere. And at 270 doses per bottle, this is an incredibly good

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 value. Easy to take, just two drops a day. Get one for you, get one for your family members.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 This is on any Sir Thrival link and you'll find the colostrum there, the elk velvet antler,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 pine pollen, the digestive bitters, also the shaga and the reishi, everything in myron

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 glass, very high quality. We think you'll enjoy your experience with any Sir Thrival

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 product on OneRadioNetwork.com. One of my good friends is Brandon Amelani, used to work

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 with Daniel. Brandon has a company called Shen Blossom and he has very high quality,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 all kind of tied in with Chinese medicine, some very ancient formulas. He has a 50 year

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 old ginseng, also he does shaga, reishi, some digestive bitters as well and also some digestive

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 powders that you can use. I like his detox formulas. Wonderful, wonderful products. Again,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 everything in myron glass is like Daniel does. Check it out. We think you'll enjoy getting

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 something for over the holidays. Just all kinds of things. Very high quality on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Shen Blossom. And before we go back to Dr. Peat, remember we have what we think is one

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 of the best saunas ever. It's a portable sauna, $1,295, far infrared sauna, incredibly

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 low EMFs, there's no radio frequencies, little bit of magnetic energy from the floor

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 to the bottom of the chair and your head is sticking out as you can see if you see the

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 video. And you can sweat as long as you're getting your water and your little aminos,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 you'll be fine. And I do it every day of my life, not that what I do matters, but we

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 think you'll enjoy this puppy. It's right on the front page of OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 Well, just click, I'm sorry, the only way you get this baby is to email me, Patrick

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 at OneRadioNetwork.com for a price that we're not allowed to kind of put in print, but just

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 to email me, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com and we'll give you the good price.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 We're with PhD Dr. Ray Peat. His website is RayPeat.com. I think it's Ray Peat, right?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Yeah, RayPeat.com. And also you can get his newsletter by emailing RayPeatsNewsletter,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 plural, at gmail.com and it's very affordable. And Doc, when that comes out, what, every

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 few months, couple months? Yeah, I'm going to go from every other month

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 to quarterly this coming year. Oh, good for you. Yeah, good for you. I think

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 that's the right thing to do. So the next one will come out?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Every three months. Uh-huh. So it'll be April or March, something

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 like that? I'm not sure what the first one will be.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 Yeah, this is a good question to start with and we get this a lot. What does Dr. Peat

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 think the reason why people feel better when they take ivermectin? I mean, because I don't

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 even know if there is a virus and, well, that's what they're saying. It's a long email, but

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 it is a good question. Why would people feel better taking ivermectin?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 They believe they have this COVID virus, so they take ivermectin and they feel better.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 I've heard that it does at least 20 different chemical effects in the body, but the essential

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 thing, I think, for feeling better as well as recovering more quickly is its anti-inflammatory

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 action. Just about any substance or process that is anti-inflammatory is also going to

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 be anti-coagulant to some extent and protect you against the clotting and bleeding syndromes

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 that are associated with COVID. I see. Isn't that interesting? I mean, essentially

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 it's ivermectin. Isn't it a kind of a parasite for horses kind of thing?

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Yeah, it's a bacterial antibiotic substance, a very complex, fairly big molecule. It's

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 been used around the world for parasite treatment, billions of doses given to humans to cure

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 intestinal parasites. I guess it could be argued that many people

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 do have parasites, so they feel better if they go?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 No, no. I think the reason they feel better is it has so many good effects related to

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 reducing inflammation. I see. How relevant is it for people when they

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 take something like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or something in their belief, the placebo,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 that they are going to feel better? How do you feel about that?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 Oh, the placebo effect is extremely powerful. The quinine derivatives, there are two synthetic

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 quinine-like drugs that are, for some reason, prescribed, I guess, cheapness or profitability.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Quinine is the basic thing that has a very broad spectrum of therapeutic value, but just

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 taking a bitter potion is going to have a fairly powerful placebo effect just because

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 you know it has potency if it tastes so bad and bitter.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Interesting. If it tastes yucky, right, it's got to be good for it.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Yeah, like we found a pill which is bright red is a more effective placebo than some

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 neutral colored pill. Isn't it interesting? Wow.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Would you please ask Dr. Peat, we'll get in the emails here, another one, about the

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 safety of consuming animal brain to raise cholesterol? Eating eggs and very high sugar

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 diet hasn't moved mine. Perhaps there is another alternative. Karen wants to get her

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 cholesterol number up.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 In a medical school about 50 years ago, someone wondered how effective dietary cholesterol

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 really is at raising the blood level of cholesterol because of all of the fear of eating high

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 cholesterol food. So they had medical students eat every day a different quantity of eggs

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 and up to about 20 eggs per day, they didn't get a cholesterol increase in the blood.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Is that right?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 In healthy people, but if they were very sick, they could get a cholesterol rise in the blood

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 from a smaller amount. But on average, I think it took the healthy medical students about

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 22 eggs per day to get a rise in their circulating cholesterol.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 Well, what does that tell us about the healthy and the...

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 We powerfully regulate the amount of circulating cholesterol because it's an essential factor

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 in our health. And the reason cholesterol rises is that it's a defensive substance.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 If you increase the amount of blood and just look at the ovaries' production of progesterone,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary exactly corresponds to the

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 amount of progesterone coming out of the ovary on the other side.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Oh.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 And that means that when the blood level of cholesterol rises, your body is increasing

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 it so that the defensive protective hormones, including DHEA, progesterone, and pregnenolone

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 that these will be increased protectively.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 So that's one of the arguments why folks try to get that cholesterol number up?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Yeah. And usually the most common reason for low cholesterol down around 140 milligrams

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 per cent, or it should be around 200, 160 to 220 or so. The thyroid level is what's

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 responsible for converting the cholesterol into the defensive substances. But if your

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 liver and intestine are very seriously damaged by poisons coming out of your intestine, then

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 you can't make enough cholesterol to circulate and turn into the protective steroids.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 So the first thing to make sure your liver is able to produce the cholesterol you need

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 for the glands and brain and other tissues to produce the defensive progesterone, the

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 first thing you have to do is stop poisoning your liver by improving your digestion. The

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 thyroid and the protective hormones do protect your liver and intestine, but they can't

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 do the job alone if you're eating stuff that's very hard to digest and full of toxins.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 For example, just eating a very big green salad every day. If a person is in perfect

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 health, it'll go right through them quickly, acting as a fiber. But if they're already

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 having sluggish digestion, that raw lettuce or spinach or whatever the leaves are will

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 sit in place being warm and exposed to bacteria so that it rots horribly before it gets out

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 of your system. And the toxins produced from something seemingly as innocuous as a green

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 salad can very powerfully limit your ability, your intestines and liver's ability to keep

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 up your cholesterol production.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 Wow. So there's times depending on when salads are not the best choice, you'd be better to

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 cook the greens.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Yeah. That allows your actual digestive enzymes to extract something by breaking down the

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 cellulose that leaves only the bacteria to act on the raw leaves.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 So what's going on in the digestion that is not allowing the raw salad to be a good thing?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 What's happening? What are we lacking there?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Quick peristalsis.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Quick peristalsis. Yeah. So that's the colon making it, doing its thing to move things

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 through.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Yeah. Starting at your stomach, your stomach has to produce the digestive enzymes quickly,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 move it on quickly, get your pancreas to excrete more of the digestive enzymes, get it to move

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 on as soon as the body has extracted what it can, then move the residue on quickly and

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 eliminate it. And the quicker it goes through, the cleaner your intestine is producing the

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 less lower amount of toxins.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 And how do we ensure that we have these digestive enzymes? I've heard that if you take digestive

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 enzymes, it actually can teach your body not to make them.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 No, I don't think that teaches, but you have to remember that the enzymes can't be cooked

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 to sterilize them. And so when you're eating a so-called enzyme, you're eating a raw animal

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 organ.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 Not good.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 And so you have to be ultra careful that they don't contain bacteria or other infective

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 material.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 Wow. Have you ever found any that are okay to do digestive enzymes?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 I think it's a matter of trial and error.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 See what works.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 But if you have a good thyroid function, as well as all of the essential nutrients, that's

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 the main thing for quick stomach emptying, quick pancreatic secretions, quick peristalsis

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 and quick elimination.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 So that's why over the years you've focused so much on the thyroid and become really good

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 at understanding it, because if you get this little guy working, then everybody can play

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 along nicely.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Yeah, and there are some foods that can be therapeutic while waiting for your thyroid

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 health to be normalized.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And what are those?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 My first experience was with a raw carrot every day.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Oh, that's right. Yeah, raw carrot.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 I stopped having migraines as long as I ate a raw carrot every day.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 But then I found that taking thyroid, I was no longer so absolutely dependent on the daily

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 carrot.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 And there are several other fibers that are just about as safe as carrot.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 The carrot contains some toxins, but plant materials in general do.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 The high fiber content of the raw carrot prevents almost all of the toxins from being absorbed.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 You don't even get much carotene.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 For example, if you just chew your carrot or if you shred it lengthwise so it doesn't

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 produce a lot of juice, you don't want to put a carrot through a blender because that

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 releases most of the carotene to be absorbed.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 So you like to shred it like you do it on a cheese shredder kind of thing?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 Yeah, there are food processors that will make a nice, fine shreddy.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 And don't you put something on it too, if I recall?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Olive oil tastes really good, salt and vinegar.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 And it happens that both the oil, olive oil and vinegar, which is a saturated fatty acid,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 that these are antiseptics.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 And the fiber of the carrot distributes the vinegar and oil all along your intestine.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 If you just drank the oil and vinegar, it would be gone.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 That's great.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 And what are some of these other than carrots that do similar things with the high fiber?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 Very well cooked mushrooms are pretty effective.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 Very well cooked bamboo shoots and the traditional oat bran.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 Oat bran.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 Yeah, the bran has some of the same effects.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 It has a very low calorie content.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 It makes a very pleasant breakfast cereal to make a porridge out of the oat bran.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Just oat bran.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 What about steel cut oats?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 Are they good?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 Do they work?

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 The what?

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 Steel cut oats.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Oh, yeah, I think any oatmeal is--

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Got some good stuff.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Yeah.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 It could be rolled oats or just the grain is fibrous enough that it has a good effect.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 I think the drawback that scares some people away from it is that experiments have found

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 that the oatmeal as usually consumed contains, I think it's phytic acid that binds the minerals.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 I'm not sure it's phytic acid, but anyway, something that binds the magnesium and calcium

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 so that according to those experiments, the more oatmeal you eat, the less calcium and

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 magnesium your body can absorb.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 If you're going to eat oatmeal, you have to make sure to get extra milk.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 Milk, yeah, good old milk.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Here's an email for Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 Dr. Peat is here on the third Monday.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 We're going to stay around after we let Dr. Peat go and hang out and talk a little bit

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 before we take a couple weeks off for vacation.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 My wife has been diagnosed, writes an email, or with my-- you know what I'm saying, myasthenia

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 gravis.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 How do you say that first word, doc?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
 Myasthenia.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Myasthenia gravis.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Does Dr. Peat have any suggestions that what could be the cause and the help with this

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 condition?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 I've seen improvement just by correcting the thyroid function.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Really?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Wow.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 Just the thyroid function.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 And again, you kind of focus in, if I understand, on the TSH, right?

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 And you want this guy down there to, what'd you say, .2?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Yeah, below 0.4.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 I'm sorry, 0.4.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 It's fairly safe, but it's fine to be even lower than that.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 Wow.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 And the body temperature is the other thing.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 The combination of a low TSH with a good warm body temperature that stays around 98.6 for

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 the bulk of the daytime.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 And in the morning, at least 98 or so to when you wake up?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 Yeah, 97.8 is okay if you warm up after breakfast.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 So, say if you had your thyroid kind of low under 1 and your temperature is still colder,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 you'd want to increase the thyroid stuff, the PIG.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Yeah, generally it could be other hormones lacking.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 So, you want to make sure your whole nutritional intake has all of the essential minerals and

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 vitamins and quantity of protein and carbohydrate.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 All the good stuff.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat another email?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 Excuse me.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 What he thinks of astaxanthin.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 It's touted to me in many benefits.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Thanks for having on the show every week.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 Do you know that one, astaxanthin?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 It's in the same family as keratin.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 It's an antioxidant, but I'm not too enthusiastic about that general family.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 Too much of it can interfere with your thyroid function.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 In that family, what family is that?

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 The keratin family.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 I think that's where this...

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 Astaxanthin, isn't it in the family of like greens or like coloella, spirulina?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 Maybe not.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 Maybe not.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Yeah.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 My impression is that it's related to the keratin.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 Keratin.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 What family is that?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 What are some other keratin family things?

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 They are precursors or related to vitamin A.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 Ah, vitamin A.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 The other mostly yellow and orange pigments are the flavonoids.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 The bulk of them, there are thousands of different flavonoids, but the largest number of them

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 are very protective anti-inflammatory things where the carotenoids can even associate with

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 increased cancer, increased damage to the skin from sunburn and so on.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 Does Dr. Ray Peat think it's a good idea to take supplemental iodine for thyroid function?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 No, almost never.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 There are several dozen studies of the iodine intake around the world that increased when

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 they started iodizing salt and found that even I think it's somewhere around, well,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 half a milligram a day associates strongly with damage to the thyroid gland and eventually

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 loss of thyroid function.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Do you think this could be the reason when they started doing the iodized salt thing?

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Could this have been a reason why people have thyroid issues?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 I think that's part of it.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 Wow, fascinating.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 When did the iodized salt thing happen?

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 It did cure a lot of the goiters and hypothyroid, some regions.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 I think parts of China and South America are still very iodine deficient, but outside of

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 those areas, the supplemental iodine is more likely to cause damage over the years.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 That's why we're kind of fans of, say, like the pickling and canning, just pure salt.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 Then that's one of the reasons why you're not a big proponent of these expensive sea

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
 salts because they got a lot of other stuff in there?

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 Yeah, if they aren't purified, that means that at best it will be some of the clay and

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
 mud from the beach where it's collected.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 Probably don't need that, right?

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 It's hard to predict what kind of harmful minerals might be in that clay.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 The pink salt is very high in iron, so I don't think it's good to use regularly.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 They charge you extra for the pink salt, Doc.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 You know that.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 That's right.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 Here's a question for Dr. Peat from Mike.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 If Dr. Peat was elected to replace Dr. Fauci as the chief medical advisor, what recommendations

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 would he make to the American people with regard to the COVID pandemic?

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 Interesting question.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 First, I would look at all of the data, any data that had ever been claimed to be a basis

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 for saying that there is a pandemic.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 Make that public.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 Instead of stonewalling when someone sues the government public health agency, instead

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 of keeping the basis for the pandemic existing, instead of keeping it secret, the first thing

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 would be to look at the data that they claimed was confirming the existence of such a thing

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 as a pandemic.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 So far, no such evidence has been found.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 What they did was subsidize people to make up horrible possibilities, imaginary scenarios

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 of what might happen, and then that was presented as the science rather than a government-supported

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 hypothesis about the horrible possibilities.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
 Yeah, yeah, Stefan Leinke and these other folks, as you know, they claim that there

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 was the original thing was some kind of snot from somebody and the whole thing was a computer-generated

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 model.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 Yeah, and one of the most under-discussed facts that is right open to everyone is that

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 right after the pandemic was declared, up to that point through history, there had been

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 thousands of people dying seasonally from influenza, ordinary flu, and varieties of

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 pneumonia.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 But the week, the second week of April 2020, when there was this horrible spike in deaths

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 so-called from COVID, that week flu went out of existence around the world.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 You don't have influenza committing suicide just so that the same amount of deaths could

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
 be blamed on COVID.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
 It was simply a renaming of deaths that were happening anyway.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 Yes, sir.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 Well, let me just do this email from George.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 "What does Dr. Peat make of the videos that I've seen of these football players?"

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 It's called soccer over there.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 "Up to 100 have already had myocardial infarctions, heart attacks."

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 Was that following a vaccine?

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 Yes.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 Yes.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Yeah, the figures are clear that the vaccine is pro-inflammatory, pro-coagulation, and

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 with excess coagulation, the risk of bleeding, internal bleeding.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 So it's a series of very closely related things.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 Inflammation causes coagulation, coagulation depletes the defense, and you can end up with

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
 a bleeding stroke.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Go ahead.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 I'm sorry.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 Go ahead.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 The number of heart attacks is very, very clearly connected to the vaccination.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 And do we know what the result of any of these extra boosters is?

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 You know, Mr. Fauci, now they're talking about there's going to be two or three or maybe

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 once a year.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 Is there any idea, or is this so new that we have no idea what these boosters could

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 do to people?

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 I think so far they've just been the same thing over and over.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 Is it just the same thing?

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 More of the same.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 You can't, even with the phony so-called vaccine principle of the RNA, you can't keep up with

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 the changes in the virus.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 You can't fight an epidemic in process with vaccines.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 It's never been rational.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 It's simply a fraudulent scheme to keep people under control.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Do you think the truth of this, Dr. Ray Peat, on this December 20 day will ever come out?

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 What's your theory?

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 Do you think it will ever come out?

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 It's out.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Of course, it's out.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 It's a matter of whether you want to look at it.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 The people who are convinced that it's a crime not to be vaccinated are never going to look

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 at the evidence.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 You don't think they will?

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
 No.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 They're actually locking people down in Sweden and other places like that who haven't been

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 vaccinated.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 Locking them down.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 Putting them in prison camps.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 Yes, sir.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 Here's an email from a lady, the fellow that I live with, who I love, is being forced,

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 well, he doesn't have to, but he thinks he's being forced to get a booster shot.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 I'm wondering if I need to refrain from kissing and sex for some time after he gets it.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Yeah, the shedding, the phenomenon of shedding was known long before the vaccine.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 People are always putting out in their sweat, urine, body fluids, and even breath, the proteins

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 and pieces of DNA and RNA that are circulating in their blood.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 They come right out of the person into the air and surroundings.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
 That's established.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 If you have a new circulating material in the body, the vaccine, they simply asserted

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 that it wouldn't get away from your arm lymph nodes, that it wouldn't get into your general

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 circulation.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 It was shown to circulate in the bloodstream, concentrated in the gonads and the spleen

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 and other tissues.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:28.000
 They're still saying, even though now it's acknowledged to circulate to all of the organs

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 to some extent, they're saying it can't get into the breastfeeding woman's milk for the

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 same reason that it couldn't get into the bloodstream.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.000
 So if it can't get into the milk, naturally the vaccine can't make the baby sick, except

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 there's no fact to support their claims.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 We had a virologist on, Dr. Janci Lindsay, a very well-respected lady who's testified

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 in court cases and all this.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 She laid out a pretty eloquent argument with science and peer reviews and from people all

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 over the world that these things are going all over the body, just as you just said.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 Everywhere.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 Everywhere.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 All the organs.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 Since the vaccine has its course from the arm through your bloodstream to the various

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 organs, it settles out into those organs and gradually disappears from the bloodstream.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 So it's thought that the maximum shedding is going to be while it's circulating through

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 your bloodstream, getting into your breath and sweat and so on.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 Naturally, if it gets into your sweat, it's able to get into the breast milk.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000
 So is that an argument that for this emailer to after some time, she wouldn't have to

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 be concerned with her significant other?

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:17.000
 Yeah, possibly up to a month, but usually the first two weeks after vaccination is when

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000
 you're most likely to be shedding.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 So if I understand though, what I heard you say, correct me if I'm wrong, that we are

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000
 always shedding or sharing whatever you want to call them, exosomes or virus, with everybody,

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
 aren't we?

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000
 All the time?

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:42.000
 Yeah, everything that circulates in the blood, surprisingly, even long strips of bare nucleic

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:50.000
 acids, it doesn't have to be encapsulated in the lipid to go through blood vessels and

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000
 so on.

00:59:51.000 --> 01:00:01.000
 As controls, they've injected bare DNA and found that it went right through so-called

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
 cell membranes, got inside cells.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.000
 And so that stuff circulating in the blood is always, some of it blows out through your

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
 lungs.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:23.000
 So if you put a cold object under your nose that allows condensation on the cold and then

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:32.000
 analyze that, you'll find proteins, fats, RNA, DNA, bits of everything.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
 It's just the way it works.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 What's your theory of why it's been set up like this from God or whichever belief system

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
 one has?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
 Why would it be like this?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
 The exosomes actually come out in your breath and body fluids.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:00.000
 And so spreading through the urine, the sweat, and the breath, these are sharing our genetic

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000
 discoveries with all of our colleagues.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.000
 Everyone is sharing the patterns that are a part of their life.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 And it turns out that like bacteria share the particles that make them immune to antibiotics.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 They'll pass them on not only to related bacteria but even to stranger bacteria across

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 species or types of bacteria.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.000
 So as a species, we're essentially trying to help one another get healthier in a way,

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
 right?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
 Yeah.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
 In the case of bacteria, it's very clear.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000
 The same process happens among plants and animals of all sorts.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
 But we think in terms almost which may be incorrect as bacteria being bad that we don't

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
 want any.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
 Yeah.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:13.000
 Sometimes the bacteria will shed things that we don't want that are poisonous to us.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
 But also the bacteria has been said to be a healing process too.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 Yeah, on balance, we've done pretty well with the bacteria environment.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
 The bulk effect has been good.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000
 So if Dr. Peat or Patrick or our listeners allow a, say maybe a strep throat to happen,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:46.000
 let the bacteria heal the tissues as many argue rather than get an antibiotic, that

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
 bacteria then can be shared with others so they can do the same thing?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 No, your throat shouldn't let the bacteria reach that point.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
 Oh.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 A healthy person can have the same germs present but they aren't hurting anything.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:11.000
 So there's a failure in the ground substance that you can't blame entirely on the bacteria.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000
 But so, are you advocating then if somebody has strep throat to get an antibiotic?

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000
 Yeah, once it has reached the point of pain, getting rid of it is quick and then figuring

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
 out why you've allowed that bacteria to go crazy.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
 But doesn't when we take an antibiotic, Dr. Peat, kind of mess a lot of things up?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 Yeah, but you only should take it to get rid of the problem, not try to kill everything.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
 Right.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:52.000
 Lots of people get carried away and kill off all of the bacteria in their intestine and

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:02.000
 then that lets, since the antibiotic is harming your own host cells, it's weakening your mitocytes.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
 It's weakening your mitochondria.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000
 You only want to take the minimum that will shift the balance in your favor.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
 So if they give you 20 and the pain goes away in two days, you can stop there?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000
 Yeah, give it maybe half a day of tapering off just to make sure it's gone.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
 Wow.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
 But don't do the whole two things.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
 They always tell you to do the whole thing though, don't they?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
 Yeah, they don't want to have to pay attention or think about it.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
 Okay, I love them.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
 Rachel writes in, "Could you please ask Dr. Peat to what causes the body to attack

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
 itself as in an autoimmune disease?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000
 I have an autoimmune disease in which my body is supposedly attacking my muscles and causing

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 muscle weakness.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
 What would be the best diet and supplement for something like this?"

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
 My current newsletter has a little bit about that.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:17.000
 The histamine, for example, activated by estrogen and many other things, but histamine and estrogen

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:31.000
 and endotoxin, each of those tends to make your tissues take up water, get inflamed,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:40.200
 start producing more histamine or analogous things, release endotoxin from your intestine

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:48.680
 to circulate through your bloodstream.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:06:02.000
 The histamine effect in cells is causing a local uptake of water, a change of the protein

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:10.680
 relation to the surrounding water and activation of the cell excitation shift to inefficient

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:20.640
 metabolism towards lactic acid production, for example.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:29.000
 These transmitters that change the metabolism are changing the antigenic properties of the

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
 cell.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
 It doesn't take a powerful chemical reaction.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:46.000
 Just a stretching or excess bending or swelling of a tissue can change the protein confirmation

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.680
 enough that it becomes antigenic.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:59.520
 Your immune system sees what looks like a foreign antigen because of these intrinsic

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.360
 pro-inflammatory signals.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.800
 The cell is swelling up and getting deranged.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:11.680
 To the immune system, at an extreme, that looks like a foreign material.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:19.560
 The immune system comes in and tries to clean up the damage the way it would with a bacteria

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.400
 or fungal infection.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:34.640
 It kills the cells and carries away the debris as far as possible.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:41.440
 Although these same components, histamine and estrogen, for example, will shift your

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:48.240
 immune system, knocking out the brain of your immune system, the thymus cells, suppressing

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:55.440
 them and releasing the antibody-forming B cells.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:11.000
 At the same time, activating an enzyme that creates actual genetic change, a genomic destabilization

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:21.200
 enzyme, they call it AID, that produces novel antibodies.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:31.040
 We're generating more and more antibodies under the influence of estrogen and histamine.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:42.360
 The immune system seems to be going a little crazy, but what it's doing is revving up and

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:48.920
 trying to clear away the tissue damage, which is the basic problem.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:54.960
 I think of it as the tissue damage as being primary.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:04.760
 If you stop the inflammation, restore oxidative metabolism and energy production, you restore

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:13.000
 a lot of those proteins to their natural conformation so they are no longer anagenic, then your

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.880
 immune system will be able to quiet down and stop attacking.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:26.000
 So the autoimmune model that we've heard about, it literally does attack tissues that it shouldn't

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
 be because it's confused?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.880
 Yeah.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:40.760
 Once you've activated the B cells to produce more and more antibodies, they're less discriminant

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:50.840
 and so they'll start trying to remove too many cells and make the inflammation worse.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:57.200
 But you've got to turn off the inflammation first and then worry about getting rid of

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.200
 the antibodies.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:07.440
 When you're hypothyroid, your thyroid tissue is under stress and you'll form antibodies

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:15.880
 to those stressed thyroid cells, but all you have to do is supplement the needed amount

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:24.200
 of thyroid hormone and nutrients and allow the TSH to stop overdriving and stressing

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:25.920
 your thyroid gland.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:32.120
 Gradually over a period of six months to a year, those antithyroid antibodies will fade

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.120
 away.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.360
 Fascinating.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:42.120
 We came across a website that might be of interest, if they're accurate.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.840
 It seems that they would be.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.040
 They're very professional, the whole thing.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.160
 It's called Let's Get Checked.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.200
 For a very small amount, you can get a test kit and do a blood thing and you can test

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.240
 your TSH just at home.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.840
 Oh, that would be convenient.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.840
 Yeah.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.160
 I did mine and that's how I found out mine was where it was.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.520
 I suspect it's accurate.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.280
 You'd have no way of knowing, but it seems like they know what they're doing.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.480
 It's called Let's Get Checked.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:14.520
 It might be interesting for people.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.520
 You could just do your TSH.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.200
 I think it was like $75 or something.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:27.200
 Having a lot of friends writes an email asking how to detox from the vaccine.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.200
 Can Dr. Peat, does he have some ideas about this?

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:37.000
 Yeah, I think treating it exactly the way you would treat the COVID infection because

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:50.840
 the spike protein is what causes the inflammatory coagulation damage and the spike protein occurs

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:57.480
 from the vaccine just as much as from the virus itself.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:03.240
 Doing the same anti-inflammatory things.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:16.800
 That would be aspirin, antihistamines, even glucocorticoids or progesterone will help

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.560
 to reduce the inflammation.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:30.400
 Having enough carbohydrate in your diet to restrain histamine production as part of it.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:36.600
 Don't fast or eat a pure protein diet.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:46.400
 That would tend to increase the inflammation and coagulation.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:53.040
 On the histamine thing, you want to get adequate carbohydrates for that not to get up, right?

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.480
 Can you ask Dr. Peat about ways of protecting yourself from vaccine shedding?

01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:08.160
 Maybe the same kind of answer?

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.800
 Not being around crowds that are likely to be shedding.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:22.680
 I think things like a sudden burst of nosebleeds or untimely menstruation and so on.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:34.480
 I think those are likely effects of crowd-induced shedding poisoning.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:37.480
 It's December 20, 2021.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.160
 Patrick Timpone, we're going to stick around after we let Dr. Peat go and spend some time

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.840
 with you before we take a couple weeks off.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.760
 Aaron writes in, "I have a toothache and the gum around the tooth is inflamed.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:54.160
 Does Dr. Peat have any suggestions what I can do?"

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.560
 Very often that starts with something you ate.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.160
 I had that experience for many years.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:14.920
 An incipient tooth abscess or abscess below a tooth would flare up as soon as I ate potatoes

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:15.920
 or tomatoes.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:27.000
 It was a way of training me to stop eating the foods that were affecting my mouth as

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
 well as my intestine.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
 Fascinating.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
 Wow.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 Here's an email.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.400
 "I want to take a liquid supplement orally that has DMSO as a solvent.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:45.120
 If I'm not allergic to DMSO, is 200 mg of DMSO orally a safe amount to take every day

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.120
 in the long term?"

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:52.160
 Using it as a solvent for what?

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.760
 They're asking about a liquid supplement that has a little bit of DMSO in there.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:00.680
 I've never heard of that.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.880
 I think not a good thing to take every day.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.880
 Why would you take DMSO internally?

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:15.240
 They have found that it has an anti-inflammatory effect.

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:23.600
 It helps the same way progesterone and anti-inflammatory things do to let the cell give up some of

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.200
 the water it shouldn't have.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:34.360
 But there are so many safer ways to reduce inflammation in cells.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:42.040
 You can't always count on the DMSO being as pure as it should be.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.720
 It can carry trace allergens into your tissues.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:53.060
 Here's an interesting question for you, "Doc, any ideas of why my long brown hair is thinning

01:15:53.060 --> 01:16:00.000
 so much it breaks off at the shaft right where the follicle enters the scalp comes out with

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.800
 the slightest pull?"

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:07.920
 That's most often an effect of low thyroid.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:16.240
 In animal studies, they find that, for example, a woman who was using estrogen cream found

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:29.960
 that her fuzzy dogs were going bald just from being in contact with her skin.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:37.200
 The estrogen tends to end the cycle of the fascia right here.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:43.800
 Low thyroid slows the growth and thins the shaft diameter.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:49.320
 It gets weaker and weaker as your thyroid is lower and the estrogen higher.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:53.680
 Boy, that's just an incredible thing when you think about it.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:59.720
 The TSH, you're talking about 0.4 for thyroid function.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:06.280
 That's so much lower than what is generally believed to be the right TSH level.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.520
 Oh yeah.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:17.320
 Just lately, I've heard from several people with a 4.something TSH and they're obviously

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:25.400
 sick and their symptoms are all traceable to an excess of TSH.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:36.840
 TSH itself is pro-inflammatory and just lowering it is going to improve your symptoms, but

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:45.360
 increasing the metabolic rate by supplementing thyroid with the anti-inflammatory effect

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.960
 of getting rid of excess TSH.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:55.240
 If you're experimenting with your thyroid, whether it be PIGGY or whatever it is, Doc,

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:01.040
 how long would you want to be on it before you could reliably say, "Well, I'm going

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:05.960
 to do another quick TSH maybe with this company to see where it is."

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.840
 How long would you want to be on it before it would be relevant?

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:18.240
 Since it's very hard to predict what dose you need, it's important to monitor your daily

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:29.680
 reaction by checking your pulse rate and temperature at waking and middle of the day and to gradually

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:39.000
 increase the dose until you're at an optimal body temperature and pulse rate.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:46.800
 Only at that point should you bother to check the TSH again because the temperature and

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:52.280
 pulse rate are going to be changing as you're adapting to the dose.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:59.440
 How do we know what would be just the right pulse rate for us, for you and I and our listeners?

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:10.120
 Whatever works for you to some extent, but when you look at both healthy populations

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:19.160
 versus sick populations or if you look at people in a given state of health who happen

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:29.040
 to have a heart pacemaker, for example, they've given mental acuity tests to people with a

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:34.640
 different heart rate or with a pacemaker installed.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:45.840
 If they run the heart at 70 beats and have a certain quality of memory and reasonability,

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:51.880
 then they turn it up to 80 beats per minute and give them the test again.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:58.360
 All of their mental faculties have improved just by increasing the heart rate a little

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.760
 above 70.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:05.200
 Same with very healthy, very alert people.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:10.120
 They tend to have faster heart rates.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.680
 Females too have faster heart rates in general, don't they?

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.680
 Yeah.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:21.800
 Women have smaller hearts than men and like kids have much faster pulse rates because

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:27.400
 their heart is smaller and their metabolic rate is higher.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:36.760
 Women generally have a slower metabolic rate than men, but with a smaller heart, you have

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:48.360
 to consider their body temperature and body size and so on to judge what each one means.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:53.040
 But again, then in the afternoon, say one or two o'clock, if you're just hanging around

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.360
 the house, you want to really try to be at 98.6 and that's a good indication of what

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.160
 your TSH is doing?

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:04.680
 Very close in the long run.

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.620
 Wow, fascinating.

01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.840
 An emailer says, "Doesn't orange juice spike your insulin?

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.600
 I try to keep my carbs under 50 grams per day."

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.920
 Oh, why do you want to keep it there?

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.920
 I don't know.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:20.480
 That's what she said.

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:31.000
 How would you make up the calorie difference with too much protein can be pro-inflammatory

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:39.400
 and anti-metabolic, slowing your thyroid function and lowering your temperature.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:47.680
 Carbohydrates are really the most adjustable because sugar tends to increase your heat

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:52.040
 production and metabolic rate.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:22:02.600
 Calcium and vitamin D are other things that increase your ability to oxidize calories.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:10.320
 I think anything up to over 200 grams a day is fine as long as your calorie intake is

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.960
 in balance and your heat production is good.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:19.040
 Is there any way to protect oneself from airplane radiation while traveling?

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:28.920
 The cosmic radiation, the scare about high altitude radiation was invented by the nuclear

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.040
 industry.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:49.240
 People at high altitudes have much lower incidence of cancer despite the higher cosmic ray intensity.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:59.240
 The cosmic rays per unit of radiation are less harmful than the lower energy.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:07.200
 It's a matter of what they call linear energy transfer.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:15.440
 It means that low energy x-ray is more toxic than high energy x-ray.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:23.400
 Gamma rays are higher energy than x-rays and they're less toxic because they transfer less

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.800
 energy to the tissues.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:38.400
 Particle radiation is ordinarily far more toxic than the electromagnetic x-rays, ultraviolet

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:49.520
 or gamma rays because the particle slows down and gives up all of its energy to the tissue.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:59.760
 But in the case of cosmic rays, they are so extremely fast moving that they give up a

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:05.240
 much smaller amount of energy to harm the tissue.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:10.960
 This is anecdotal, but I have a good friend of mine who is over 80.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.720
 He's one of the healthiest guys I know and he was a pilot his whole life.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:19.800
 If that whole pilot thing or flying, he wouldn't even be around.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:20.800
 It was so dangerous.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:29.040
 Yeah, insurance companies have known for more than 100 years that living at very high altitudes,

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.280
 you have less cancer and heart disease mortality.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.240
 Now his hair is totally white and he said it's been white most of his life.

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.240
 That's interesting.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:41.000
 I don't know how that happened.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 Here's Lydia.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.560
 A couple more then we'll let you go, Doc.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.600
 Your salt has not been iodized for so long now.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.840
 Most people are deficient.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:56.440
 See Dr. Brownstein's work on this especially with regard to bromine-iodine relationship.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:06.080
 Yeah, Brownstein was a follower of Guy Abraham.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:16.040
 I think there's a lot of assertion, almost no science behind those claims.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:30.320
 It's only these two or three people descended mentally from Abraham, the pro-iodine.

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.920
 He sold an iodine product.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:37.080
 Now you're not talking about like Abraham, biblical Abraham, somebody else?

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.080
 No, no.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080
 Dr. Abraham.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:45.240
 I mean a fellow that sold an iodine product and that's where this all came from?

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.680
 Yeah, his website.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:59.000
 Although he worked in the same lab before I did doing hamster aging research.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:07.360
 After that, I think his whole thing was to sell his products.

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:13.840
 His website had totally insane stuff about radiation and iodine.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:21.320
 After I ridiculed it, the worst of it disappeared.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:28.480
 Didn't Edgar Cayce, wasn't he claimed that he helped the body cure from some, what was

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.560
 it with iodine?

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:34.680
 Was it some kind of plague thing or do you know what I mean?

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:46.120
 Yeah, it was used to, scrofula was the original thing, but it was a traditional anti-inflammatory

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:50.920
 antiseptic drug.

01:26:50.920 --> 01:27:04.400
 And generally, Edgar Cayce said was pretty well founded, but I think you have to interpret

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.400
 the iodine stuff very carefully.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:08.280
 Oh, so I didn't quite get that.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:15.280
 So he was on to something with the iodine?

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.880
 What disease was I'm thinking of that he used it for?

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880
 It was somebody in India.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.760
 Do you know what I'm talking about?

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.200
 It has been successfully used for a lot of things.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:34.320
 Heart disease, hardening of the arteries, breast tumors even.

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.920
 But we don't need it now, you argue.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:43.200
 No, we've been oversupplied with dietary iodine now.

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:53.040
 For example, bread and baked goods, for a long time were using an iodine dough conditioner

01:27:53.040 --> 01:28:05.600
 to make the dough produce lighter bread, just using for a physical effect an iodine compound.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:14.280
 That alone was giving the American population for decades a toxic overdose of iodine.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:18.920
 Do we get iodine when we eat fresh fish as well?

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:28.200
 Yeah, having a serving of fish from the ocean once a week will pretty much guarantee our

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.720
 adequate iodine.

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.160
 And any seaweed kind of stuff too would give us plenty of iodine, right?

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.960
 Yeah, but you can overdose.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:41.440
 A lot of people overdose by using iodine-rich seaweed.

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:46.920
 And what would the symptoms be of an overdose?

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:55.560
 I think it contributes to the high incidence of nearsightedness in the Japanese.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:59.520
 And antithyroid effect can show up as nearsightedness.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.600
 Wow, interesting.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.800
 Final one, this is a good question.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:14.360
 Somebody just wrote in here, our friend Adam Bergstrom, Dr. Peat, he said Guy E. Abraham.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.440
 I'm not sure how you pronounce his first name, but French would be Guy.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:22.840
 Guy E. Abraham, that's who you're talking about in this iodine thing.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840
 Yeah.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.840
 Wow.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:30.480
 Final one, so Dr. Peat just said that the thyroid has to do a lot with hair follicles

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.080
 and calling it a low thyroid TSH reading.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:40.720
 Would increasing my dosage help with the hair falling out as I am on two-grain natural thyroid

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.160
 and would it raise my heart rate if I increased it?

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.320
 So she's right now on two grains, which is what, 120 milligrams?

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:54.400
 Yeah, that was the average dose for decades, using farmer's thyroid.

01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:59.520
 And would that, do you think the average dose is higher now for any reason?

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.480
 No, it's probably around 120.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:10.560
 And again, if somebody wasn't sure, they can either do the test or work with the body temperature

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.560
 and the pulse.

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:16.720
 Yeah, you definitely don't want to start right out with two grains.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:23.040
 Even if that's what you're going to end up with in six months as a starting dose, it

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:35.600
 could easily cause heart pains or it will imbalance your nutrients to go at it too suddenly.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:46.440
 Oh, finally, do you think even the best of food grade or food source vitamins are reasonable

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:47.440
 to take?

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.720
 What was the last trait?

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:54.760
 Food source, like all from food and organic foods, some kind of vitamin supplement, they

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.040
 have good liquid ones that appear to be good.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:00.160
 Do you think it's reasonable to play with those?

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160
 No.

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:09.200
 If they're supposed to be extracted from foods, they're going to be far more expensive than

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.200
 the food would be.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:11.200
 Right, yes.

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:19.920
, and in the process of extracting them, very often extraneous materials get in and

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:23.560
 you lose some of the active ingredients.

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:32.000
 Yeah, well, Dr. Peat, such an honor to have you on and thanks so much for coming on here

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.560
 once a month.

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.320
 We really, really appreciate it.

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.320
 God love you.

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.320
 Okay, it's always fun.

01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:40.640
 Yeah, well, I'm glad you have a good time and glad you keep coming.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.040
 So we'll see you next year, huh?

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.040
 Have fun.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.240
 Santa Claus coming around your house, do you think?

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.240
 Probably.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.240
 Oh, well, good.

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.240
 Well, that's great.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.240
 Sir, thank you.

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.960
 I love you and you let us know if we can help and we'll see you third week in January.

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:54.960
 Oh, okay.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:55.960
 Thank you.

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.960
 Thank you, sir.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:01.800
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:02.800
 He's the bomb, huh?

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:03.800
 Yep.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:04.800
 Yep.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.800
 I tell you what, I like his stuff.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:12.240
 Well, you know what we're going to do here just because it's my kind of last day with

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:13.720
 you before I go on a little vacay.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:18.280
 What do you say I just go to a little boys room?

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.800
 That's probably more information than what you need.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.160
 And then we'll just come back in about five minutes and hang out for a little bit.

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.120
 We'll go through some of the news.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:31.480
 If you want to call in, 888-663-6386.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:37.240
 And we'll just play around for a little bit before we kind of wrap up our 2021 year with

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:43.080
 you as we're going to take some time off and come back on the third with Adam Bergstrom.

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:44.560
 I think it's the third of January.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.120
 So stay right there.

01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.120
 Thank you.

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.920
 Pass on these links to everyone that you care about.

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:53.160
 If you'd like to look at our videos, they're on BitChute.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.960
 The link is right on the top front of OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:57.960
 Sign up for Telegram.

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:01.000
 We have quite a nice group we're developing there.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.560
 The Telegram link, it's a social media network platform that doesn't censor anybody.

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:13.560
 And we're back on Facebook now after being in jail for 30 days, but I'm pretty feisty

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.920
 so I don't know how long that's going to last.

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:19.600
 But email me if I can help with anything.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.720
 Our website will be here all year round.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.600
 I mean all the rest of the last two weeks.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:29.480
 So if you need something, don't be shy about ordering up from all of our fine people you

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.480
 see on the front page.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.120
 We've got some really, really nice products.

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.120
 No matter what it is, Sulphur, Sana, we'll take care of it.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.360
 You'll get things shipped out before the end of the year.

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.880
 I'll still be around the computer.

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:48.560
 So whatever you want to order, if I can help you with anything, let me know.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.320
 Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.320
 I love you all very much.

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:56.440
 We'll see you in about five minutes and we'll hang out for a little bit before we go.

01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:02.200
