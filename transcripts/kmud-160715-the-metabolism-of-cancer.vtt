WEBVTT

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.720
 - Well, once again, welcome to this month's

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.000
 third Friday of the month radio show,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.680
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.300
 - My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.560
 - For those of you who perhaps have never listened

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.900
 to the shows, they run every third Friday of the month

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.960
 from seven to late p.m.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.280
 We're both licensed medical herbalists

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.800
 who trained in England, graduated there

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.720
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.620
 with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.640
 and recommend dietary supplements, nutritional counseling,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.840
 and a alternative approach to the management

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.720
 of various different conditions.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.720
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.000
 on KMUD Garboville, 91.1 FM,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.120
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at eight o'clock,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.480
 you're invited to call in either with questions related to

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.540
 or unrelated to tonight's topic

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.880
 of the metabolism of cancer.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.300
 We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.580
 with us once more, and this month's topic

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.180
 is actually based on his newsletter.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.300
 The newsletter he brought out back in May,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.060
 was another introduction to cancer metabolism,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 but if I remember rightly,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 the paranoia versus trust-anoia was a interesting concept

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.240
 where most people trust mainstream medicine

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.320
 to do them right.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.680
 Choose wisely and find your information out

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440
 from alternative sources.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.600
 I think that alternative word is another very good

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.560
 starting point for tonight's show.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 It is the drive that the radio show is having

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.240
 to basically keep running.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.320
 Free speech radio and independent radio stations

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.780
 are really not very common in America anymore.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.680
 Radio shows are generally getting taken over,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.720
 becoming more and more mainstream,

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.000
 but obviously free speech is still alive,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.800
 and again, that's our constitutional First Amendment right.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.240
 So it's a very precious thing to have free speech

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.240
 aired on the airwaves, whether it's locally here

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.320
 or brought across the nation on the internet

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.120
 or other radio stations that would carry this show.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.480
 It's a very precious commodity.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 So you know that when free speech

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.440
 starts to become suppressed,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.840
 you know the government are really not

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.600
 what you want in power.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.160
 I will say no more about that,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.440
 but the constitutional amendment, First Amendment,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 is a very strong and fundamental right

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.900
 that we all have as American citizens

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.440
 to be able to freely choose what it is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.360
 rather than be told that this is what you're gonna get.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.280
 So the Ask Your Ab Doctor show

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.800
 is definitely one of those radio programs

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.720
 that brings you an alternative to the mainstream narrative,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.520
 what you're gonna hear from mainstream science and doctors,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.320
 and Dr. Raymond P., fortunately,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.080
 is a wealth of information, very alternative,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.880
 definitely outside the box thinking

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.960
 like so many of the great scientists

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.780
 that he quotes during his work from St. Georgie

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.200
 to Gilbert Ling to May Wan Ho,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.440
 many, many others that we've mentioned over several years now

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.780
 probably going on eight years

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.760
 that we've been delighted to have Dr. Peat

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.600
 sharing his wisdom with us.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.120
 - And if you listen to commercial radio now and then,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.160
 you know what media consolidation means.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.280
 It's cookie cutter programming.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.340
 And 15 to 20 minutes of every hour,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.100
 they're hounding you to buy stuff.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.680
 KMET is different, completely different.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.520
 And you know why?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.160
 Because it's independent, community-based community radio

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.440
 funded by the community.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.640
 And our only responsibility is to you, the listener.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.900
 So please support KMET.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.280
 - Okay, Dr. Peat, is Dr. Peat with us?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.040
 - Yes. - Oh, hi, Dr. Peat.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.560
 Well, thanks so much for joining us.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.440
 I think what I wanted to do

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.800
 was just basically describe an outline

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.060
 of what has happened in science

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.680
 and which has very much derailed

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.040
 some very good research that was done

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.520
 that perhaps didn't go along

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.520
 with the corporate collectivistic background controllers,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.440
 if you like, from the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.120
 I know a couple of months back, we had the subject

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.640
 and very much what was brought out was that

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.140
 the institution has institutionalized medicine

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.820
 to the point where good science

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.900
 becomes largely ignored or demonized.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.140
 I think that's very true to say,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.100
 and it's not just scare tactics.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.820
 It's very much true that alternative medical doctors

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.900
 get hounded out of medicine.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.900
 They have to leave the country, go abroad,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.340
 where they can continue to practice

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.900
 because in this country,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.900
 there is quite a powerful suppression of alternative ideas.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.760
 So I think without me probably carrying on too much more,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.180
 I think just starting with Otto Warburg,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.500
 if you would outline perhaps the history

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.400
 of oxidative metabolism, which William Koch,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.520
 Frederick Koch, through Otto Warburg

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.880
 and Albert St. Georgi elucidated

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.080
 and how that really should have been

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.960
 the direction that medicine,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.120
 if it really wanted to help people with cancer,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.200
 should have gone in,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.440
 but which through various powerful lobbying groups

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.100
 and the estrogen industry, et cetera, have derailed it.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.080
 And it's become very much a dogmatic,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.720
 destructive, sidel type approach

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.840
 like bactericides or viricides.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.400
 It's a kind of cancer recidal approach

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.040
 to killing cancer cells with chemotherapy, radiotherapy,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.520
 and all the other targeted programs

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.480
 that basically destroy the organism rather than help it.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.520
 So would you be able to give an outline of metabolism

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.960
 as seen through the eyes of these great scientists

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.820
 who really were onto something?

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.480
 - Yeah, starting in 1900,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.520
 the idea of electrons in molecules

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.560
 was really just being explored.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.920
 It was about 1930, '35,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.960
 when mainstream chemists started accepting

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.920
 that there was such a thing as a free radical.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.920
 But in 1900, Moses Gomberg at the University of Michigan

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.960
 had produced a stable free radical,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.920
 which with a free,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.480
 but fairly unreactive electron,

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.920
 produced a deep purple color

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.680
 with a very small amount of the molecule in solution.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.120
 And this started other chemists thinking about

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.320
 what produces color in molecules.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.600
 And over the next four or five years,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.600
 several chemists were theorizing about mobile electrons

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.360
 in molecules like benzoquinone.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.200
 And these were really at the center of mainstream chemistry,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.400
 but even the average university chemist

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.120
 wasn't up to date on the theories of electrons.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.320
 It was only in 1916 that Gilbert Lewis

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.840
 gave his theory of electron bonding.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.840
 And then Niels Bohr, I think it was 1921,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.520
 described his picture of how electrons

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.520
 orbit around molecules.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.920
 And then several years later,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.840
 Leibniz-Pauling gave a more detailed description

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.720
 of how electrons work in chemical bonds.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.240
 So the very best biochemists

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.760
 were just getting started around 1935

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.520
 thinking about electrons.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.400
 And biologists and medical doctors

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.800
 couldn't imagine how electrons could have anything to do

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.960
 with the life process.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:55.080
 So the process that is involved in oxidation,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.440
 it's the movement of electrons from a fuel

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.320
 such as sugar or fat to oxygen.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.880
 And in the process,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:11.320
 there's a lot of extractable energy in some form.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.320
 And when the biologists finally admitted

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.000
 that electrons had to be explained somehow,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.040
 they wanted to compartmentalize

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.080
 how the energy is used in moving

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.160
 from glucose or fat down to oxygen.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.480
 And so they invented little machines

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.480
 that would take sort of a quantum of energy

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.320
 out of that moving electron

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.800
 and attach it to various little machines,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.240
 which they called pumps or motors and so on,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.640
 and explained muscle contraction and secretion

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.640
 and all processes in this very primitive concept

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.840
 of biological energy,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.840
 where the actual process is a flow, a streaming process.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:16.000
 There's no standing still for the electron.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.280
 The cell dies if it isn't constantly moving

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.640
 the electrons from fuel to oxygen.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.680
 - So this is a process that's going on every breath we take

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.520
 and every single cell in our body

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.520
 is moving these electrons from sugar or fat to oxygen.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.320
 - Yeah, and when you try to measure

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.920
 the electrical energy of a cell,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.880
 you stick a needle in, for example,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.200
 to measure the voltage.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:53.200
 And people have sort of a standing static picture

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.520
 of the cell in which it's a membrane

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.960
 and inside there are statistically

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.200
 randomized molecules carrying electrons.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.200
 And so they think of it as effectively a bag of electrons,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.760
 which they're measuring.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.880
 What they're doing is disrupting

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.880
 this intricate constant flow from fuel to oxygen.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:27.560
 And they're measuring an injured cell.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.880
 Every time they try to stop it to fit their model,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.280
 they're destroying some cell process.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.800
 And in the 1940s,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.960
 Ben Chorchee published some of his work

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.160
 with oxidative processes in muscle

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.240
 and how energy is used.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.520
 And he was the one who discovered

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.520
 that ATP literally makes muscle contract.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.880
 He extracted muscle and used various simplified preparations

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.480
 to show that simply adding ATP made the muscle move.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.320
 And he was thinking of something electronic going on

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.200
 related to oxidation and fuel use and so on.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.880
 But he found that the contracted muscle

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.880
 in the presence of ATP didn't break down the ATP molecule.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.000
 That ATP causes muscle to contract

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.320
 without changing its bond structure.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.840
 - And this is very interesting, folks.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.320
 When you hear this,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.400
 I don't want to interrupt you too much.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.000
 So muscle contraction can occur

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.280
 in the absence of the breakdown of ATP,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.200
 which is not what I was taught when I was at school.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.040
 So anyway, yeah,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.000
 most people that listen to what you've just said now

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.320
 might remember that the classic description is ATP

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.920
 is reduced to ADP and AMP.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.880
 And that release of that phosphate group

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.000
 is what actually drives the muscle.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.840
 But Dr. Peat, you're saying that that is not the way it is.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.360
 - Yeah, when I was in graduate school,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.000
 the muscle biologists all over the world

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.760
 were saying that ATP has a high energy bond

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.480
 of 11 or 14 kilocalories per mole.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.840
 And it's that energy that can be used

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.280
 to explain the little muscles,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.840
 motors in the muscles that cause movement.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.680
 Without that high energy,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.840
 it would be impossible to explain their motors.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.600
 But meanwhile, Gilbert Ling had,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 I think he probably read "Sanctuary II"

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.720
 and was aware that ATP didn't have to break down

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.320
 to release energy.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.320
 He pointed out that the energy of the whole molecule

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.760
 of ATP sticking to the protein of the muscle

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.640
 has an energy of stickiness or adsorption energy

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.120
 of 21 kilocalories per mole,

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.840
 twice as much as the hypothetical bond energy.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.360
 And that explains why it makes the protein change

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.560
 without having to break down.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.560
 Simply the relationship between the molecules

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.120
 shifts the whole structure.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.800
 And this is very much that kind of holistic,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.840
 alternative approach to science and to biology

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.320
 that enables these people that are doing this

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.640
 to see the whole thing is confluent.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.840
 And it's constant, like you said, electrons don't stop.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.440
 They're constantly moving.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.040
 They're constantly in action.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.280
 And that is life right there

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.040
 when molecules are being produced

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:03.040
 and cells are being signaled and communication is happening.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.360
 It all involves energy.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.720
 And I know you're a big advocate

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.560
 of supporting thyroid function

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.080
 because that ultimately is a very big driver of metabolism

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.040
 as is mitochondrial function.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.400
 - And the energy of the cell.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.960
 - Yeah, and that all of this is,

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.400
 we're all very much energetic living beings.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.680
 We're not static.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.000
 And actually a lot of what we'll perhaps get into later on

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.720
 here with cancer metabolism being a very aberrant form

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.000
 of that kind of metabolism,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 which is much more destructive and very negative

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.480
 is very much opposed to regular life,

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.840
 which is productive and energetic.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.960
 And that high energy state

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.760
 is what actually keeps us alive and healthy

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.240
 and allows our immune systems

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.000
 to get on top of spontaneous cancers

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.280
 'cause they know that they do arise all the time.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.400
 And it's only in those lowered energetic states

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.920
 where people can actually produce a cancer

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.080
 that starts to take them out.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.520
 And it's all the negative lactic acid production, et cetera,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.000
 from tumors that contributes in the carbon monoxide.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.200
 We'll get into that later on.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.120
 - But we're not talking about like the high adrenaline,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.000
 that type of energy.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.400
 We're talking about energy from a cell functioning properly

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.240
 and having enough thyroid,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.040
 which basically means the cell has enough oxygen.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.520
 And it's a very calm state,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.480
 but your cells have a lot of energy in that calm state.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.400
 - All right, you're listening to After Care

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.400
 with Dr. K.M.E.D. Galbraith, 91.1 FM.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.040
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.360
 callers are welcome to call in with questions

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.640
 either related to this month's topic

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.960
 of the metabolism of cancer.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.040
 And a toll-free number if you live outside the area,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.000
 there's an 800 number, which is 800-K-M-U-D-RAD.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.360
 So that's 800-568-3723.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.360
 Or if you're in the area code, the number's 923-3911.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.600
 - Actually, Michael said that he didn't think that-

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.000
 - I thought that the long,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.160
 well, if you've been calling the show from Missouri,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.440
 call whatever number you've been using.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.480
 But I was under the impression the 800 number

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.680
 didn't work out of California,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.520
 but I could be totally wrong.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.360
 - Oh, okay, interesting. I didn't know that.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.520
 Thanks for telling me. - Anyway, I mean,

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.320
 we're broke and the 800 number isn't free.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:10.720
 The 800 number costs us.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.520
 So you might as well have it on your phone bill anyway.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.040
 - All right, there you go.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.760
 Okay, so yeah, all right.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.080
 Somebody was gonna come in at one point.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.760
 - Oh, no, we're gonna do that at 7.25.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.440
 - Oh, we're doing it at 7.25, okay.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.360
 All right.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.080
 So Dr. Peat, getting back to this kind of energetic

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.200
 state of the cell,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.360
 that's probably a good point at which you understand

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.440
 how cancer can arise,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.000
 how it can be allowed to be outside the body's

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.520
 normal control,

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.160
 and how that energetic state,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.160
 we won't call it energetic,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.440
 perhaps we call it excited, depleted state,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.640
 should best be understood as a way to understand cancer.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.440
 In the 1920s, at the time,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.800
 Farberg was developing his idea of oxidation.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:06.320
 And in England, David Kylan was working on another side

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.520
 of oxidation with these cytochromes.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.520
 And he found that when an insect flight muscle,

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.840
 or a bird flight muscle,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.920
 a very energetic muscle,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.280
 when it was contracting and highly stimulated,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.880
 the pigment that he was studying disappeared,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.800
 showing that there was no oxygen present.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.800
 The extreme activity had consumed

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.040
 all of the oxygen momentarily,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.640
 and shifted the cell and those pigments

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.000
 into a reduced state of excess electrons.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.480
 So this was, St. George and Kylan

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.920
 were simultaneously working on the ideas

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.920
 that William Frederick Koch at the University of Michigan

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.240
 had developed independently,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.240
 that it's the flow of electrons through the system

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.760
 to oxygen, which has to be continuous.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:19.200
 And when something over-stimulates

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.560
 or irritates an area,

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.200
 the idea of irritation or carcinogenic smoke and so on

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.000
 was already known.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.760
 And the irritating effect of estrogen, for example,

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.280
 was already known.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.640
 So the idea of excitation,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.120
 exhausting the tissue oxygen,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.800
 is at the center of the idea of what cancer is.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.800
 Warburg described his thought at that time

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.120
 as the cancer has a defect in respiration,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.880
 which makes it lack the Pasteur effect,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.880
 which was what Pasteur had seen in yeast,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.880
 was that oxygen normally causes the yeast

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.600
 to stop from ending,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.040
 to stop producing lactic acid or ethanol

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.440
 in the case of beer.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.600
 But St. George, he said,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.040
 there's something wrong with the system

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.080
 that prevents cancer from,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.000
 even in the presence of oxygen,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.960
 from being able to turn off that excitatory process

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.520
 that produces lactic acid.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.320
 So there's something keeping the cell

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.200
 in the excited state.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:51.200
 And that's where the details have been developed now

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.760
 over the last 90 years since Warburg expressed that idea.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:02.400
 What are the things that can turn off the excitation,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.920
 the excess of stimulation,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.920
 and let the oxygen, which can be present,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.840
 let the oxygen do its work

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.960
 to turn off the lactic acid production?

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.320
 - So it's a form of energy production

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:23.560
 the body has as like a backup mechanism.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.920
 When it's not using oxygen properly,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.120
 then it converts to using--

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.400
 - Sugar.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.520
 - Sugar, and it's inefficient, and it's wasteful,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.360
 and it overexcites the cell.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.480
 I'm just trying to understand this myself

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.760
 and also put it into some

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.320
 a little bit more understandable terms for our listeners.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.160
 - When it's either deficient in oxygen or overstimulated.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.080
 - So that it used up all the oxygen

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.440
 'cause it was overstimulated.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.240
 - Yeah, so it's the same thing

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.120
 as suffocating or being overstimulated.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:00.080
 There's no oxygen to turn off the production of lactic acid.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.520
 And then the lactic acid itself

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.560
 is an irritant, a stimulant.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.880
 It shifts the cell away from the use of oxygen

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.840
 towards the production of more lactic acid.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.800
 - So it's like a vicious cycle.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.120
 Here, we're going to pause you for a moment here, Dr. Bate,

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.320
 while we have Jordan come in.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.840
 And we're going to talk about

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:28.280
 what a wonderful radio station this is.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.920
 It's an oasis of diversity.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.440
 And it's an oasis amid the sameness

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.280
 of the commercial media landscapes.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.440
 We provide essential nourishment for your mind and soul

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.280
 with our amazing variety of programs.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.800
 - Wow, what a show tonight, very scientific.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.240
 No one like Dr. Peat.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.320
 - No one.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.920
 - He really gives you the info,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.720
 but some real science tonight.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.440
 You really got to pay attention.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.480
 But I just want to thank you guys

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.600
 for coming in and doing your show every month.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.520
 I want to thank all the talk show hosts.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.280
 And I want you, dear listener,

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.600
 to thank the talk show hosts by calling in your support

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.520
 to 707-923-3911.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.760
 We've got some phone answers out there

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.080
 who'd really like you to keep them busy.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.080
 And I loved, Andrew, your opening remarks

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.560
 about the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.920
 and how if we don't use our rights, we lose our rights.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.000
 - Absolutely, absolutely.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.720
 The government need to hear that from us.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.720
 - Yeah, and your comment earlier out in the hall

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.280
 about that's what it's all about.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.560
 This is free speech radio.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:35.520
 There's 25 different viewpoints

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.920
 from seven to eight during the course of the month.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.640
 And it's part of our programming that includes you.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.200
 And we just really want you folks who listen,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.320
 and we know talk show listeners are pretty emphatic listeners

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.840
 and pretty dedicated listeners.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.160
 - And I know there's people who listen

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.000
 from all across the country for this because they call in.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.880
 - Right, yeah, absolutely.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.600
 From the East Coast through the Midwest.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.000
 - And if you don't call in even, that's okay.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.960
 You can still donate.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.480
 You can just call in at 903-707-923-3911

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.280
 because this community radio station

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.360
 is not getting support from all, yeah,

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.280
 or for when you buy products,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.080
 some of your money is going to, yeah.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.320
 And marketing budgets of major multinationals

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.280
 do not support KMUD, so it's up to you.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.640
 - Any amount, gratefully appreciated.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.400
 Just write out a check, money order, whatever you have.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.160
 Send it to KMUD here in Garboville.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.040
 - Yeah, it's box 135 in Redway.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.480
 - Box 135, Redway, California.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.920
 - And don't forget if you-- - 95, California, 95560.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.840
 - If you're listening online, kmud.org,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.840
 there is a way to donate right there

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.320
 while you're listening.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.760
 Press the red button.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.240
 Sustaining membership of $120 a year

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.400
 will, can be taken out $10 a month very painlessly,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.280
 and it's a great way to support the MUD.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.080
 - It's a great way to support your First Amendment too.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.840
 - Yeah, well, 'cause the free speech you're hearing today

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.680
 was paid for by people who donated

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.760
 during our last pledge drive.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.360
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.200
 - So I wanna let you guys get back to Dr. Peat,

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.880
 and thanks for the show.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880
 - Thank you, Jordan. - You're welcome.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.440
 Yeah, well, we appreciate KMUD for allowing the show,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.400
 Ask Your Ob Doctor, to even happen.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.480
 I think it was probably 12 years ago now.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.960
 I let time fly so quickly, but I think it was 2004.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.280
 Yeah, I think it was 2004 we did the first show.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.240
 Here we are, 2016.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.360
 Anyway, Dr. Peat, you're there, right?

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.320
 - So you were telling us about lactic acid

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.640
 and how it feeds cancer cells

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.600
 and because of the lack of oxygen?

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.560
 - Yeah, anything that causes a lack of oxygen

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.960
 or excessive irritation and stimulating

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.840
 to the point of fatigue

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.440
 will produce an excess of lactic acid.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.840
 - Just like when you run too long

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.200
 and you get stitches in your side?

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.200
 - Yeah, and lactic acid produces an imbalance

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.240
 in the electrons.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.240
 It takes up some electrons to be formed,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.680
 but in the process,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:12.520
 that increases the alkalinity inside the cell

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.840
 and in several ways creates a vicious circle

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.840
 of more electrons actually than it can take up.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:27.040
 And one way that the cancer cell tries to return to normal

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.920
 is to use some of those excess electrons

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.720
 that can't be consumed by converting pyruvic acid

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.640
 to lactic acid,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.560
 is to use them in synthesizing fat.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.560
 So interestingly, the cancer cell turns on the enzymes

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:50.320
 that synthesize fat as a way to drain away more electrons

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.400
 and then as oxygen becomes available,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.840
 the respiratory process will burn fat.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.240
 And so the cancer cell is eating all the sugar it can get

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.800
 and tearing down the tissue of the body

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.560
 to use amino acids in place of glucose

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.240
 when that's deficient

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.240
 and converting the energy from glycolysis,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.560
 either amino acids or glucose,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.880
 converting that to fat

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.400
 and then oxidizing the fat with whatever oxygen it has.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.400
 And oxidizing fat is less efficient

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.840
 - The last rule.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.760
 - in terms of oxygen use.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.040
 So it adds to the problem of oxygen deficiency.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.120
 - Is this where the myth comes in

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.440
 where you hear a lot of people say,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.120
 oh, sugar feeds cancer?

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.920
 - Well, yeah, actually.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.600
 - Does cancer eat sugar?

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.600
 - Sugar deprivation turns on the Warburg effect,

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.240
 turns on the stress reaction.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.360
 - And makes the lactic acid and makes the cancer.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.200
 - Cancer cells.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.040
 - Yeah.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.480
 - So it's actually the opposite, folks.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.600
 - If you go into the ketosis,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.520
 the stress metabolism that turns on this partial oxidation

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.520
 of fatty acids produces what they call the ketone bodies,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:20.440
 but one of the ketone bodies is not a ketone.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.440
 And it's the reduced state of this pairing

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.160
 of acetoacetate and beta-ketobutyrate,

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.040
 which is not a ketone.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.040
 This is shifted so that it increases reductive imbalance.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.440
 So it's almost as bad as lactate.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:51.360
 So it's the stress that is creating the cycle

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.280
 of excess electron imbalance.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.280
 And then that in turn activates things that can amplify,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.440
 depending on the total situation,

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.120
 can amplify the stress reaction

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.080
 and the reductive excess of electrons.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.320
 So that, for example, the formation of prostaglandins

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.240
 is turned on when there's a shift

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.000
 towards too many electrons,

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.440
 an imbalance in the direction of NADH rather than NAD,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:31.760
 or of too much reduced sulfhydryl.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.160
 People are talking, actually,

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.440
 they're giving glutathione supplements

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.440
 to increase the electron abundance in the tissue

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.800
 where the cancer cell already has an excess of electrons.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.640
 It's a powerful antioxidant system

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.120
 that keeps the cancer cell alive,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.800
 but in this defective state.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 And the same process that turns on prostaglandins,

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.800
 which create all kinds of inflammation

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.800
 and tendency to reproduce themselves

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.600
 without differentiating.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.680
 It also turns on aromatase,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.640
 which makes estrogen,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.880
 which activates more of the tendency

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.560
 to produce excess electrons.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:35.400
 - I picked up on what you said about five minutes ago,

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.280
 and I jotted a note down here just so I could ask you this,

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.480
 and this is definitely not scripted.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.480
 But you mentioned the inability to relax,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.000
 the over-excitation or the excitotoxic effect

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.440
 of various mediators that promote cancer,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:59.040
 and how the cancer itself is in a very excited state.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.520
 And this constant excitation,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.200
 and that oxygen, the presence of oxygen,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.960
 calms that excitation down.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.840
 And this is the part that's unscripted.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.760
 I wanted to ask you to understand this myself,

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.840
 because I know you're an advocate of CO2

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.400
 and increasing your CO2.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.680
 As a definite health benefit,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.040
 and I know we've talked about oxygen being a poison,

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.920
 essentially, and I think that's not a bad word for it.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.720
 But so how is oxygen in this way being a help,

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.400
 as opposed to our general understanding

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.640
 of oxygen being a fairly toxic gas?

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:42.240
 - The CO2 does at least three central things

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.320
 related to the cancer.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.320
 One, it's acting like a calming agent,

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.640
 the way ATP does to relax muscles

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.000
 that aren't stimulated,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.760
 holding them in a state of readiness to contract.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.880
 And the CO2 is an analog of these pigment molecules

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:12.640
 that Kirk and Moses Gomberg were visualizing.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.120
 - So you said CO2 has a structural similarity,

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.520
 'cause we haven't even talked about

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.520
 the anthocyanins and the flavonoids yet,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.480
 but is that what you're saying?

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.520
 - Yeah, it's an acid, a Lewis acid,

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.880
 which doesn't involve any protons,

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.440
 but the double-bonded oxygens on the carbon

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.840
 are the essential feature

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:40.280
 of the free radical oxidative catalysts

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.360
 that Koch was talking about,

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.320
 and that George worked with for about 40 or 50 years.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.480
 And this acidic effect modifies the proteins

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.200
 so that they are stabilized, calmed down,

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.680
 kept quiet so that they aren't forced

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.080
 to shift over to the lactic acid metabolism.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:09.080
 And the CO2 also can fill in and correct

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.800
 what's missing in the Krebs cycle

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.880
 or the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.880
 It's replenishing the catalytic effect of the fuel

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.320
 that keeps the oxygen process going.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:30.320
 And then CO2 also directly intervenes

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:37.040
 in the inhibition of lactic acid production.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.600
 And so just by increasing the CO2,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.920
 breathing in a bag, for example,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.400
 for a minute or so at a time, several times a day,

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.440
 will lower your serum lactic acid.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.320
 And it's only in the last two or three years

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.120
 that several people are recognizing

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.920
 that you can diagnose cancer

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.920
 just by an increased chronic lactic acid excess in the blood.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.480
 And since it's one of the factors

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.520
 that keeps the process going,

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.920
 anything you can do that will shift

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.120
 towards oxidative metabolism

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.880
 and lower your production of lactic acid is helpful.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.080
 - That's why you recommend for people who have cancer

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.800
 that they go to high elevation

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.800
 so that they can increase the amount of CO2

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.720
 in their bloodstream.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.720
 - Yeah, there were studies in Russia in the 1960s

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.200
 in which they gave carcinogens to rats.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.960
 And then they treated some with chemotherapy

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.960
 and took them to, I think it was 17,000 feet altitude.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:59.480
 And the ones at high altitude recovered

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:06.840
 at a very high rate with or without the chemotherapy.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:12.600
 The chemotherapy cured a few of them at normal altitude,

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.440
 but cured most of them at the high altitude.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.360
 And about 100 years ago,

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.280
 the insurance company industry was already aware

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.880
 that the cancer mortality was about 10% lower

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.200
 in cities at high altitudes.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:35.320
 So it was well recognized.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.240
 - Well recognized, 'cause if anyone doesn't wanna

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.200
 lose money, it's the insurance company.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.960
 Well, thanks so much for explaining that.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.640
 Let me just remind people again,

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.080
 it's a live show and callers are welcome to call in.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.040
 I know Dr. Peat enjoys answering questions.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.280
 The more outside the box, the better for him.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.040
 I mean, I really appreciate your explanation

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.560
 of the CO2 effects and those three different mechanisms.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.320
 And I know, I promise you now folks,

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.560
 nothing was scripted here.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.320
 That was just straight off the cuff.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.440
 So really appreciate your input, Dr. Peat.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.160
 A number, if you live in the area,

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.160
 923-3911, outside the area, 800-KMUD-RAD.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:15.120
 If those people listening on the internet,

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.480
 I know that you can always communicate

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.440
 with KMUD via the internet as well.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:24.320
 So Dr. Peat, just talking about those energetic effects,

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.800
 and I wanted to ask you about the pigments

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.480
 and we've already covered some of those.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.720
 You mentioned a deep purple pigment

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.680
 that Moses Gomberg first discovered,

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.680
 or it got him thinking about the energetic state of pigments

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:47.800
 and how I want to bring into this question,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.800
 the topic of flavonoids and in herbs and herbal medicine,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.960
 I know that things like bilberry, very antioxidant,

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.720
 there's blackberries, the dark berry pigments,

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.760
 and we'll get into a couple of other specific herbs

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.760
 like Pau de Arco and the anthraquinone molecule

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.080
 in things like cascara and Chinese rhubarb

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.320
 and a few other plants that contain anthraquinones

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.800
 and how they have, and I was only reading this afternoon

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.800
 on PubMed some articles based on those anthraquinones

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.560
 being proven to be anti-cancer or having

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.880
 an anti-cancer effect.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.000
 So how do you understand?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.600
 'Cause one thing for me, just to quote PubMed articles

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.080
 and understand in my own limited way

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.080
 from my own limited education background

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:44.080
 of how pigments work in terms of how science,

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.160
 I've been taught, understands it,

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.360
 but how do you think you see those pigments

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.840
 affecting that electronic change?

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.600
 - There have been several lines of research on Imodin,

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.600
 which is the pigment in aloe and cascara and Chinese rhubarb.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.280
 And it has a tremendous unexpected range of functions,

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:15.160
 including a somewhat sedative or quieting effect,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.280
 definitely not a stimulant,

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:21.280
 but activating oxidative metabolism in cells

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.280
 and having a bacteria suppressing effect

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.880
 and reducing inflammation.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.880
 These are all properties that W.F. Koch saw

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:39.480
 in the simple quinone type of oxidative catalyst.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:49.840
 When Koch went to Brazil, he began studying Lopacho.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.360
 He was probably the one that made it famous,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.080
 which is a similar structure,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.160
 multiple ring structure that has a deep color.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.880
 What these are doing is the same as carbon dioxide.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:11.040
 They're modifying, sort of tuning up

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.040
 the electrical system of proteins in cells.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:21.440
 And that's the basic idea that I think has been

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.280
 a common theme from Farberg through St. Georgi,

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:32.120
 is that it's pointless to try to kill the cancer

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:39.160
 as if it was a parasite that could simply be removed.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:44.880
 Because it turns out that when cells are normally

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:52.200
 being fatigued and replaced,

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:57.120
 the dying cell stimulates the growth of stem cells

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.160
 to replace the tissue.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.440
 And that's a process that happens in cancer.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:08.720
 The natural cancer cell is very weak and defective,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.120
 so it doesn't have a long lifespan.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.680
 But every time it dies, it stimulates the replacement

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.120
 of a similar defective cell.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:25.120
 And no matter how you kill the cancer cell,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.440
 that area is injured and is tending to be replaced.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.280
 The injury caused by killing it

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.280
 stimulates faster replacement in most situations

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.160
 than just leaving it alone.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.360
 And the alternative idea is to tune up

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.120
 both the tumor metabolism as far as possible

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.960
 and the metabolism of the surrounding organism.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.840
 - Let me pause you there a moment, Dr. Peat.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.520
 I think we've got one or two callers on the line.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.400
 So let's start taking this first caller.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.600
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.240
 - Hi, I'm calling from San Jose.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.080
 - San Jose, hi, what's your question?

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:15.360
 - My question is about the altitude that Dr. Peat mentioned.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.920
 Is there any other factor like the weather

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.120
 or something that influences it in addition to altitude?

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.560
 For example, let's say Denver versus Albuquerque,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.800
 they have different weathers, but fairly similar altitude.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.360
 Will both be beneficial

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.040
 or is there something else also to look at?

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.080
 - Dr. Peat.

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.680
 - What's what beneficial?

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.520
 - The altitude.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.520
 So he was saying, was there any other mileage

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.760
 in external factors like weather

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.200
 over the actual altitude that has a beneficial effect?

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:53.200
 - Yeah, I think excess humidity is harmful

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.640
 because our osmotic balance

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.680
 is part of the process of tuning up.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.680
 There's an interaction between oxidation reduction

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.760
 and pH and osmolarity

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:11.200
 and all of the regulatory processes interact.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.600
 And if you have very high humidity,

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.440
 it's a slight stress to the system.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.280
 So middle range humidity is good

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:27.120
 and as much daylight as possible.

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:32.760
 15 hours of daylight seems to be optimal

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.600
 for recovery from cancer.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.280
 - So being in the Andes would be a good idea.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.680
 Not humid, closer to the equator and high elevation.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.960
 - So my question to you, Dr. Peat,

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.600
 then perhaps about humidity is somewhere like Hawaii,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.440
 not a good idea.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.640
 I mean, I know it's a sea level for a start, but maybe.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.800
 - A volcano in Hawaii would be good.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.640
 - Right.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.480
 - There you go.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.320
 - Monokea.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.280
 - Top of Monokea.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.440
 All right, so humidity he said has a negative effect,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.840
 but outside that and daylight,

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.800
 the similar altitude will produce a similar benefit.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.000
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.800
 - Okay, so I think we have another caller on the air.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.960
 Hi, caller, you're on the air.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.880
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.440
 - Oh, this is Jordan, I'm from Redway.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.400
 And I wanted to ask Dr. Peat a two-part question.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.400
 Dr. Peat, earlier you said that when cancer cells go from,

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.320
 they survive on glucose

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.880
 and then when they've used all the glucose,

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.080
 they go on to amino acids.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.320
 I was wondering, are those the foods of choice

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.040
 for the cancer cells or is it because they're so acidic

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.680
 or is it because they're readily available?

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.600
 And then the second part of the question is,

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.000
 I've heard you say before that amino acids

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 create a medium in the body that allows cancer to grow

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.940
 and it's confused me because the amino acids are essential.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.160
 So I just would like a little explanation on that.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.920
 - It depends on what kind of amino acids.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.960
 The cysteine, tryptophan and methionine

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.560
 are the ones that most easily promote

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.840
 cancer growth and development.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.840
 But glutamine and several of the easily metabolized

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:34.380
 amino acids are the ones that fuel

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.720
 the production of lactate even when glucose

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.720
 is not available or is currently being depleted.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:49.580
 So the stress that lactic acid reinforces

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:56.000
 turns on cortisol production and other stress signals

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.360
 that break down, shift the balance

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.360
 away from protein synthesis to protein breakdown

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.860
 of providing amino acids.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.700
 Also, fatty acids come into the bloodstream

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.020
 under the same stress conditions.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:18.020
 And if those are polyunsaturated,

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:24.060
 that adds to the prostaglandin inflammation promotion.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.860
 And the stress hormones, cortisol and the prostaglandins

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.220
 accelerate both the inflammation

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.520
 and the conversion of the tissues to food.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:42.220
 There have been several types of experiments

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:45.860
 in which cancer growth can be slowed down

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.340
 by giving intravenous glucose.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:54.020
 The Russian researcher who was,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.580
 he began working on the Pasteur effect,

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:03.420
 probably was aware of St. George's thinking in the 1940s.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:09.900
 Some of his research involved giving good doses of glucose

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:15.220
 either intravenously or orally.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:20.220
 And with the use of intravenous glucose

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:25.660
 and higher provision of oxygen,

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.620
 the Ehrlich-Ascites carcinoma,

00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:37.620
 he found could be reverted to normal metabolism.

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.460
 The classical example of a cell

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.460
 that is in the Warburg effect of making too much lactic acid,

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:52.740
 giving it as much sugar and oxygen as possible

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.300
 caused it to revert to normal metabolism.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.100
 - Wow, well thank you doctor, that's brilliant.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.500
 Thank you so much.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.340
 - Well thank you for that.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.620
 - And thank all the doctors, thank you.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.860
 - Okay, so I think we have another caller on the air.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.940
 So let's take this next caller.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.900
 - Actually they just disappeared.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.460
 So hopefully they will call back in a second.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.220
 - Okay, the number here if you live in the area

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.700
 is 923-3911 or if you're outside the area

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.460
 it's an 800 number, 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.260
 - So Dr. Peat, we've talked about carbon dioxide,

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:27.020
 high elevation being quite an anti-cancer therapy.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.100
 And we've also talked about some antioxidants

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.020
 from like cherries and blueberries,

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:36.020
 bilberries and the pau d'arco, cascara.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.860
 What are some other things that you would say

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.900
 are pretty anti-cancer and help with this respiratory--

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:46.260
 - If you think of-- - Process.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:50.780
 - The process of stress between too much excitation

00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:53.140
 and not enough energy.

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:58.140
 And just look at things that are known to reduce excitation.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:04.140
 Anesthetics, some of the common anesthetics

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.860
 will turn off the excitation enough

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:09.340
 to slow down a cancer growth.

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.500
 - Have they done like injections of lidocaine or?

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:16.780
 - Yeah, lidocaine has been proven effective

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.500
 against several different cancers,

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.140
 leukemia and several solid tumors.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.180
 I think liver, pancreas and breast, prostate.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.540
 - Can I hold you there?

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.580
 We do have another caller

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.260
 who I think maybe that call is called back.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.460
 So let's take this, oh, the lights are flashing.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.540
 You're telling me there's no caller.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.580
 - No, it's a new caller.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.860
 - Oh, okay, it's a new caller, good.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.260
 Okay, caller, you're on the air.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.100
 What's your question?

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:42.940
 Where are you from?

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.300
 - Hello? - Hi, you're on the air.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.580
 - Hi, yeah, now do you advocate,

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.340
 let's say you have a lump that's just contained.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.740
 It hasn't metastasized.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.660
 Let's say it's a lump in your breast or somewhere else

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.900
 that it's easily gotten to.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.660
 Would you advocate surgically removing that lump

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:03.100
 so that it won't continue to be a time bomb

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.180
 and keep growing?

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.500
 - Dr. Peat, I can't imagine you would, but Dr. Peat?

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:13.460
 - If it depends on the whole context.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:18.260
 I've had lumps or things that doctors advised me

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:23.260
 to have biopsied, and I just changed what I was doing,

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.140
 and the problem went away.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:31.140
 But if you aren't aware of anything that you can change,

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:35.500
 and if it, for example, if it's hard

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.860
 and stuck to surrounding tissues

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.220
 so that it seems definitely to be cancerous,

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:48.620
 then probably a lumpectomy is okay

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:53.620
 if you make sure that you're taking precautions

00:49:53.620 --> 00:50:00.500
 against activating a cancer by the surgery itself.

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:07.220
 - Well, what kind of precautions can you take?

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:11.700
 - For example, surgeries done when a woman

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:16.020
 is in the low progesterone part of the month

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:21.020
 before opulation, that is much, several times more likely

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:26.340
 to metastasize than in the presence of high progesterone.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:31.660
 And I think all of the things that are known

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.080
 to reduce excitation, reduce lactic acid production,

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:41.940
 and increase oxidative metabolism,

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.820
 I think if all of those are done,

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:49.820
 then a lumpectomy is relatively safe.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:51.220
 - Okay, we do have another caller,

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.820
 so let's keep moving here and get this next caller in.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:56.020
 I'll give them a chance to ask their question.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:56.860
 Caller, where are you from?

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.540
 - Hi, I'm in Albion, California.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.060
 My question is around thyroid.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.800
 It seems that it needs to be at optimal function.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.540
 I recently went through about five years

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.860
 of really hard stress.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.180
 I'm having fatigue.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.740
 I have my thyroid levels drawn,

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.740
 which what they draw is TSH and free T4,

00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.500
 which come back normal, but on the low end.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.940
 And I'm wondering if there's another test

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.020
 I could ask for, because I know if I increase

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:32.020
 the thyroid medication dose, it will change my life.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:36.220
 But I'm wondering if we're looking at the right labs.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.260
 - Okay, and there is one more caller after this, Dr. Peat.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.100
 So be prepared for one.

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.100
 - I'm gonna hang up, thank you.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:41.140
 - Okay, thank you.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.380
 - I was gonna say, ma'am, if you take your temperatures

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.140
 and pulses at specific times of the day

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.260
 and specific reference to eating,

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.860
 that's a much more accurate gauge for yourself

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:54.100
 to assess your thyroid function.

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:57.980
 And if you contact us, we can send you a form for free.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.500
 So a form that you can fill out your temperatures

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.700
 and your pulses at different times of day.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.700
 - Let me just, let me ask you--

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.060
 - And Dr. Peat, do you wanna mention something?

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:07.100
 - Go ahead, we've only got five minutes.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:12.100
 - Yeah, the T3 is the essential active thyroid hormone.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:18.220
 And under stress, T4 is converted to reverse T3,

00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.700
 which interferes.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.220
 So you can't at all interpret thyroid function

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.820
 with just T4 and TSH.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:31.500
 And even T3 by itself, you have to consider

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.900
 how much stress is causing it to be converted

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.460
 to the inactive and blocking form.

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:44.180
 And so you want a good ratio of active T3 to reverse T3.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:47.420
 And if you measure your cortisol,

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:52.420
 you can see usually what is causing it to be inactive.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:53:00.420
 Sugar glucose is needed to convert T4 to the active T3.

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:04.940
 To the active T3 form and to hold down the cortisol,

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:07.300
 which would inactivate the T3,

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.820
 convert T4 to reverse T3.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:13.180
 So sugar is protective.

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:18.180
 Keeping, avoiding hypoxic conditions or inflammation

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.820
 that wastes oxygen locally.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.620
 Any area that's deficient in oxygen

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:31.620
 or has an excess of lactic acid can locally destroy

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.580
 active T3.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.780
 - I think I have to hold you there, Dr. Peat.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.860
 I don't wanna be rude, but we've got a couple of minutes

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.740
 just to close out some information here

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.820
 before we sign off at eight o'clock.

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.260
 So thank you so much for your time.

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.780
 - And is there any one last thing you wanna say, Dr. Peat?

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:46.620
 - Nope.

00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.300
 - Okay, thank you so much, Dr. Peat.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.740
 And I wanna make sure I announce before we wrap up here

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:55.540
 that the Broadway cinema is showing Vax

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.660
 or we're trying to get it to show Vax.

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.700
 There's two showings that are potentially possible

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:02.340
 if people go online.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.620
 - And what's Vax about?

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:06.140
 - Well, I'm gonna tell you that in a minute.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.500
 Well, actually I'm trying to hurry up here.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:13.500
 So Vax is about a story of vaccination in families.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.180
 There's a Facebook page.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.740
 - Vaccine damage.

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:18.580
 - Yes, definitely.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:20.860
 - Very much supporting that positive correlation

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.860
 between vaccines and damage.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.500
 And it's from a cover up to catastrophe.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.340
 It's an investigation and tell the CDC

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:30.740
 has covered up some information.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.020
 There's a whistleblower.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:33.860
 It's supposed to be a very interesting film.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.380
 I'm hoping to see it when it comes to Broadway cinema

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.940
 and Eureka if it does.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.740
 And you can visit the Facebook page.

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.260
 It's called Bring Vax to Humboldt.

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.020
 And you can go on to gather,

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:50.860
 which is gathr.us/screening/16238.

00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.940
 16238.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.660
 Probably easier just to go to the Facebook page

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.780
 and then you can get information from there.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.660
 So the two showings are August 10th at 7 p.m.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.660
 and August 15th at 7 p.m.

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:03.300
 Try to sign up for the August 10th first

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.500
 so that we can actually get the film here.

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.140
 Otherwise, August 15th will be the second showing.

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.540
 - Thank you for all the callers that called in.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:11.420
 We did have some more that we couldn't get on

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:13.500
 and thanks so much for being there.

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.260
 I just wanna let you know that next month

00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:16.380
 we won't be doing the show,

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.540
 but we'll be back again in September.

00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:21.060
 And it's my intention to carry this topic on

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.140
 through to next September

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:25.780
 because we hardly had any chance to ask questions

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.820
 that I wanted to get Dr. Peat to answer.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:31.700
 So thank you so much, Dr. Peat, for joining on the show.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.020
 Until the third Friday of September,

00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:35.100
 my name's Andrew Murray.

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.740
 - My name's Sarah Johannison Murray

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:41.100
 and we can be reached on 1-888-926-4372.

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.700
 That's 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:45.540
 - Good night.

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.380
 - Good night.
