 [Music]

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.640
 I think it's the situation between the cholecalciferol or the 25-hydroxyform and the 125-dihydroxy.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.680
 The relationship is very analogous to what happens when your thyroid is low,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.240
 your actual thyroid hormone. Your body increases the TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.920
 in supposedly a reaction to normalize things, but in fact the TSH itself is an irritant and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.280
 produces the bad symptoms of hypothyroidism as the TSH rises and with a progesterone deficiency.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 The absence of progesterone is one problem, but the fact that when progesterone is low,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.280
 your body increases the luteinizing hormone and the luteinizing hormone is pro-inflammatory

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.160
 and creates degenerating symptoms. Anytime the basic functional hormone or material is low,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.720
 the body goes into an emergency reaction in which at the same time that it's trying to correct

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.440
 deficiency, it's turning on a substance such as 125-dihydroxy D or luteinizing hormone or thyroid

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.840
 stimulating hormone, which in the process of adjusting has lots of dangerous toxic side effects.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.160
 In the case of 125-hydroxy G, these unwindered side effects include obesity and osteoporosis.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.160
 Welcome to the Win It Life Podcast, a place where we share everything you need to know

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.520
 about restoring your metabolism so you can break free from restrictive diets and build a body and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 life you love. I'm Kitty Bloomfield, co-founder of New Strength and your host for this episode and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.600
 today we're joined by our good friend Kate Deering, author of How to Heal Your Metabolism for those

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.280
 who listen to the podcast. You'll know who Kate is and if you haven't read her book, I highly

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.760
 recommend that you read it. I'll drop a link in the show notes with the discount code so you can

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.320
 either buy it from us or you can buy it on Audible, you can pretty much buy it anywhere. But today

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.440
 we're also joined by Dr. Ray Peat and we had such great feedback from the podcast that we did with

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.840
 him a few months ago so we thought we'd get him on again to talk about vitamin D supplementation.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.760
 Yeah and so we got a series of 30 questions from everybody that we want to talk about and I kind of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.040
 want people to think about when they're listening to this podcast because there's such controversy

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.560
 between vitamin D supplements or to take them to not to take them, is you need to see the viewpoint

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.600
 of what each argument is coming from and what we've kind of realized is if you're kind of an

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.080
 anti-d supplement, you're viewing the organism as maybe calcium is bad and that if you are highly

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.200
 calcified that you need to reduce calcium thus reduce vitamin D which if you're looking at

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.720
 through that lens that would make sense. However in the bioengine in your viewpoint or pro metabolic

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.480
 view we see calcium quite differently and we see calcium is very metabolic and if somebody

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.480
 is calcified it's normally because they aren't getting enough calcium and the usually parathyroid

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.040
 hormone or prolactin is increased to pull the calcium from the bone and that's creating the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.160
 calcification. So we actually want more calcium from our diet thus vitamin D would be supportive

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.960
 and helping us become less calcified. So I think it's important to kind of think of those things

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.760
 as you're listening to this podcast. Again we're not here to tell you what you should think take

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.360
 everything in and and decide for yourself but ultimately I think it's a good explanation of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.600
 kind of why vitamin D supplements aren't as bad as many think. Awesome thanks Kate and we'll get

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:59.120
 straight into it. Hello Dr. Ray Peat and Kate Deering we've had Dr. Peat on the podcast previously

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.920
 and I was just telling him how much awesome feedback we got from that and it's the most

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.400
 downloaded podcast we have on the Win It Life podcast and everyone was saying the information

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.280
 was just so valuable and it was really easy to understand. So yeah Dr. Peat thanks so much for

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:24.240
 doing that that podcast. Yeah I just have trouble with my sound system can you hear me now?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.160
 Yep we can hear you perfect and obviously Kate everyone knows Kate Deering she's been on the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.800
 podcast a million times always have a joke it should be the Kitty and Kate show. Kate Deering

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 author of how to heal your metabolism. So yeah we just wanted to do a podcast about vitamin D

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.120
 supplementation didn't we Kate because I think there's just a lot of confusion out there

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.440
 about it. Yeah Kitty and I go back and forth and I know in the community there's a big discussion

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.200
 on you know whether you should or should not supplement who should supplement when you should

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:59.520
 supplement or is there other things you could possibly do versus supplement and so Dr. Peat was

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.120
 very kind to come on here to offer some clarity and I had decided you know I was going to ask him

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.880
 7,000 questions I've limited to about 30 so we thought maybe a 24-hour podcast wasn't going to

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.880
 be a good idea so we'll do the best we can to make it as clear and easy to understand as possible.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.200
 Awesome all right well let's just get let's get stuck into it you've got the question or should

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.360
 I ask the first question? Yeah go ahead for that first one. Okay all right I'll cut the ribbon.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.360
 Dr. Peat can you please explain how vitamin D3 is utilizing the body?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.880
 What is its purpose? Is it a vitamin or a hormone?

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:49.120
 Those are questions that the best researchers are just now starting to ask for a hundred years

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:56.800
 people were treating it as just a calcium regulator just a bone builder or tooth builder

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:07.680
 and so on and their idea of calcium regulation was very limited. When you realize that calcium

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:20.480
 is involved in every possible cell reaction it's everywhere in everything living and it's a crucial

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:33.200
 regulator and if vitamin D is mainly a calcium regulator then that says the field of vitamin D

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:43.280
 activity is as broad and complex as the whole life question. So what's happening now in vitamin D

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:54.480
 research is just a few dozen people mostly starting to realize what the real issues are

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:04.880
 and so that the field is very open and expanding with really interesting stuff happening.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:14.560
 For example when you look at it evolutionarily it happens that

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:29.600
 fish don't really depend very much on vitamin D. Some experiments starving fish totally for vitamin

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:40.320
 D. Some of them develop spinal defects but some didn't. Living in the ocean minerals are very rich

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:50.560
 and it happens that even though fish are generally extremely high in vitamin D content

00:07:51.440 --> 00:08:00.080
 they don't pay much attention to it. It's very hard to treat a vitamin D deficient fish

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:09.760
 and much of the fish metabolism of vitamin D is getting rid of it. They accumulate it primarily

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:21.920
 from the food they eat the plankton mostly the animal zoa plankton and so it's just mostly a

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.880
 waste product for the fish and if you think of the cave fish the blind cave fish

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:37.360
 there's no way they get sunlight or even plankton that has been in the sun

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:46.560
 and still they they manage somehow to have bones and to be alive and so on.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:09:01.760
 Apparently caves generally being the result of water carbonic acid in water dissolving away

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:13.520
 limestone cave water is generally very rich in minerals especially calcium so they are an example

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:24.080
 of a vitamin D free vertebrate that gets along with just calcium instead of vitamin D.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.360
 Just real quick so what I hear you saying is are you saying that vitamin D can actually be produced

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.880
 in a being without sunlight and it seems that high mineral content would be very important

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:46.880
 to the production of vitamin D? No the cave fish seems to illustrate that the the organism doesn't

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:56.880
 really need a vitamin D if it has lots of calcium and experiments with various trash and sea water

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:11.440
 fish show that they have a very limited need for it. The abundance of calcium has made them handle

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:22.960
 the whole vitamin D issue mostly as a waste product of eating the the plankton which

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:33.760
 the cholesterol is converted to cholecalciferol by anything exposed to the sun

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:45.280
 and if you eat the material containing cholecalciferol it's as if you're taking a vitamin D

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:54.880
 supplement capsule and when you yourself are in the sunlight your cholesterol is exposed

00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:04.160
 ultraviolet light gets all the credit for the conversion of of our cholesterol to cholecalciferol

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:14.560
 but fish experiments show that even incandescent bulbs can activate the conversion of cholesterol

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:26.560
 to cholecalciferol and even injecting irritants into the skin can produce the conversion of

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:38.240
 cholesterol to the pre vitamin D or cholecalciferol so it looks as if the production of pre vitamin D

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:50.320
 or cholecalciferol is a defensive mechanism. Cholecalciferol itself does a whole range of

00:11:50.320 --> 00:12:00.080
 protective anti-stress antioxidant anti-radiation protective defensive processes.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:10.000
 So just for the listener can you basically let them know I mean that the supplemental

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.280
 D is essentially cholecalciferol correct? Yeah it's pre vitamin D the same stuff

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.600
 that fish eat and that we get out of fish

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:31.520
 and if you think of of people who were in the sunlight constantly

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:42.400
 producing their own conversion of cholesterol to cholecalciferol they were they didn't need

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:49.440
 any from the environment but when you move to the north the only way to survive more than

00:12:49.440 --> 00:13:01.520
 a season or so is to start eating some organism that still is in the sun and still producing

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:09.120
 cholecalciferol so you either have to live on the coast and eat fish or

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.440
 eat animals which have been in the sunlight

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:24.400
 so the when you're near the equator and have around the year sunlight exposure

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:35.440
 then you can be a vegetarian theoretically without the risk of a vitamin D deficiency.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.960
 So to kind of conclude that I mean what about consuming other foods that are high in vitamin

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:50.080
 D like dairy would that be also supportive? Yeah the cows were in the sunlight

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:58.880
 and so they produced the same material exactly that that fish produced by being in the sunlight

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.720
 or by eating that algae that was in the sunlight or zoa plankton that was in the sunlight.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.640
 Okay so you're saying that any animal or meat or food product that is actually getting sunlight

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:18.720
 would give some sort of vitamin D to a person? Yeah right except the

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:27.280
 healthy person after that gets into your bloodstream as the cholecalciferol with its own

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.360
 whole range of protective effects that your liver hydroxylates it on the number 25 carbon

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:49.200
 and that produces the what we know and measure in the blood as vitamin D it's what some people

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:56.560
 have called the storage form of vitamin D but that doesn't really mean much except that the liver

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:10.720
 does bind enough of the 25 hydroxy choleciferol to last for a few months and some of it is bound

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:23.200
 on proteins such as calbindin or the calcium binding protein and it passively dissolves

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.840
 being fairly fat soluble it dissolves into our fat tissues a moderate amount about the same

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:42.560
 concentration that you find in the bloodstream so the bigger you are the slight slightly greater

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:54.320
 amount is stored in your fat tissues besides what's in your liver and that conversion

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.080
 to the hydroxy cholecalciferol that happens in the liver

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:10.480
 can be blocked by a liver problem so a person with a sick liver is going to have

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:23.520
 probably enough of the plain cholecalciferol but have a very low level of the 25 hydroxy cholecalciferol

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:34.320
 and when you're low very low in that form of the half activated vitamin D

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:44.720
 especially if your calcium intake is limited then you will activate your kidneys

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:57.360
 the traditional story goes that under stress at efficiency of either 25 hydroxy cholecalciferol

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:12.800
 or calcium will cause your liver your kidneys to produce one hydroxy 125 dihydroxy cholecalciferol

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:26.720
 activating the one hydroxylase enzyme in your kidneys but in actuality any inflamed or stressed

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:36.800
 tissue has that ability to make one comma 25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol the old textbooks

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:43.920
 say it happens only in the kidneys but actually any stress tissue seems to be able to do it

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:53.680
 cancer cells for example are very good at the one hydroxylation which makes the so-called

00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:02.880
 active vitamin D okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna wind it back a second because that was a lot of

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:08.560
 information just kind of try to summarize it so that people can kind of understand and because

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:15.440
 there's so much terminology as we know in the in the D world there is obviously D3 or cholecalciferol

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.840
 which is the the starting supplementation form and then it does get converted into the 25 OHD

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.080
 or the calcium the calcium were what they refer to as stored and maybe that we'll use that term

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.080
 if that's okay because i think that's probably easiest to understand it doesn't mean that that's

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.840
 it's only form but that's what it's kind of known in in the language and then it does convert into

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:45.840
 the active D and i think what you kind of just explained was that the stored D converts into the

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:52.240
 active D under stress it's not that that is the active form is what is where the active metabolites

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:58.400
 and all the good stuff is it's that it actually converts when the tissue or when the system is

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:08.400
 under stress is that correct yeah i think it's the situation between cholecalciferol or the 25

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:18.880
 hydroxy form and the 125 dihydroxy the relationship is very analogous to what happens when your thyroid

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:27.920
 is low your actual thyroid hormone your body increases the TSH thyroid stimulating hormone

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:38.560
 in supposedly a reaction to normalize things but in fact the TSH itself is an irritant

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:50.480
 and produces the bad symptoms of hypothyroidism as the TSH rises and with a progesterone deficiency

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:58.880
 the absence of progesterone is one problem but the fact that when progesterone is low

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:08.240
 your body increases the luteinizing hormone and the luteinizing hormone is pro-inflammatory

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:19.280
 and creates degenerative symptoms any time the basic functional hormone or material is low the

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:29.520
 body goes into an emergency reaction in which it at the same time that it's trying to correct

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:42.320
 the deficiency it's turning on a substance such as 125 dihydroxy D or luteinizing hormone

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:49.360
 or thyroid stimulating hormone which in the process of adjusting has lots of dangerous

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:03.040
 toxic side effects in the case of 125 hydroxy G these unwanted side effects include obesity

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:14.800
 and osteoporosis for example when the conditions are stressful enough your parathyroid hormone

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:24.080
 increases and it's the major signal for turning on the one hydroxylase enzyme

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:34.400
 that so-called activates the vitamin B and when you're dominated by parathyroid hormone

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:46.400
 and the consequential 125 dihydroxy D then you start breaking down your bones and turning off

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:54.560
 your oxidative metabolism blocking the electron transport chain and creating the conditions for

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:06.560
 lactic acid production spreading inflammation degeneration and activating the storage of fat

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:15.360
 creating fat tissue and storing energy and all of the emergency things are activated

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:26.160
 bites the stress or inflammation that leads to turning on parathyroid hormone and the main

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:34.560
 two things that will keep your parathyroid hormone down and under control and stop all of those

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:46.720
 degenerative processes the main things are calcium and vitamin D the 25 hydroxy form

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:53.760
 okay so essentially what you're saying is the 125 or the active form as a lot of people call it

00:22:53.760 --> 00:23:00.560
 D is basically prone and it gives all the inflammatory at high levels of 125 D are not

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.440
 good and that's when you get a lot of the inflammatory responses weight gain elevated

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:12.640
 lactic acid and so high PTH turns that on and so the only things that are going to parathyroid

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.680
 hormone the only things that can actually directly lower the parathyroid hormone are

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:25.360
 calcium and the 25 or the store D or just taking a D supplement or sunlight or whatever is that

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:36.080
 correct yeah and lots of supportive things like sugar keeping your your energy up and preventing

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:46.160
 fat metabolism the stress of too much fat in your diet suppresses the sugar metabolism and

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:54.080
 and again turns on all of those pro-inflammatory processes so essentially keeping the body out of

00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:01.520
 stress and so the elevated 125 D is just a one of the many responses your body can adjust to when

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:09.200
 under stress and that would gotcha okay and so that's just the first question so we could be

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:16.880
 here for four days um that was super awesome and helpful and i'll and it kind of kind of goes into

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:23.520
 this next question is uh how is getting vitamin D from sunlight different from getting it from a

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.080
 supplementation are they metabolized different differently or is it they're at some point of

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.560
 time or they are they are at the same space and it doesn't matter where you're getting them from

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:40.000
 you get other good effects from the sunlight but basically as far as the vitamin D is concerned

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:50.400
 i i think they function identically along with the sunlight you're getting visible light

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:58.160
 which is another thing that activates oxidative metabolism in support of the good kind of vitamin

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:05.600
 D gotcha so there obviously there's a lot of other benefits of the sunlight i guess one of

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:11.520
 the things is that we know that usually most people can't they won't overdose on D by getting

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:17.200
 too much sunlight right our body has an innate response it will stop D production once we have

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:24.240
 enough if we're in the sun correct yeah for example you start tanning better when you have enough

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:33.440
 vitamin D you protect yourself more efficiently by starting to produce the melanin pigment but

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:41.440
 the vitamin D itself has an anti-radiation effect so you don't even notice you don't sunburn

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.440
 nearly as much what when you're when you have enough of the colecalciferol

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:57.200
 in your tissues it's like a radiation resistance factor okay so for somebody that as i mean i

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.360
 definitely have people say that they no longer can tan any longer then when they go out into

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:09.040
 the sun they just burn so would that be a sign that they are low D yeah for most of my life

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:19.680
 i would sunburn very very easily just driving in a closed car through a bright landscape

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:28.800
 my face would get bright red and i would have a shiny red nose from just a few hours of exposure

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:36.400
 sideways through the windows of a car and that isn't a very big dose of

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:43.440
 ultraviolet but i was super sensitive to it and after i started supplementing vitamin D

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:51.280
 i could spend hours outside in mexico at an altitude of seven or eight thousand feet

00:26:51.280 --> 00:27:01.120
 super intense radiation and not even get a red nose and why do you think that is why do you think

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.080
 that you were not able to get the needed sun or the vitamin D from the sun where that would help

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:15.440
 build up the the supplementation is what worked for you i just didn't uh apparently stay in the

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:25.840
 sun long enough gradually enough once you get the protective level of a vitamin D up then it's easy

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:35.760
 to go ahead and reach a very high level which has the full range of of protective

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:44.240
 anti-stress effects but once once you're deficient the fact that you sunburn so easily

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:51.120
 attempts to make you avoid the sunlight i see so it's essentially like everything else in this

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.000
 planet that you need to build up so it's a training mechanism to build up your vitamin D

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.360
 levels and your ability to withstand sunlight so it's just that if you did it slow and steady it

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:08.400
 would work it would be just as effective than actually having a supplementation yeah okay um

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:15.840
 i want to go back to when you were talking about the the 25d or the the calcideal also known as a

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.240
 store d and i think in in a lot of the other communities that talk about it they they say it

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.880
 is an inactive form and that this inactive form just can't have any sort of response in our system

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.880
 that it's only the 125d that actually has the any sort of response and i know you certainly told

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.240
 me that the the calcideal or the store d does actually have active form and that's the one

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.040
 that actually produces all the good stuff in our body can you give us a little more detail about

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:54.640
 that yeah the decisive experiments that show that were the receptor knockout experiments

00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:06.880
 the vitamin D receptor supposedly responds to the d1 25 dihydroxy but if you knock out

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:17.520
 that receptor the 25 hydroxy does all of the same functions so neither the receptor nor the 125

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:27.520
 dihydroxy is essential when you have calcium and the 25 hydroxy and and their knockout

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:38.400
 experiments with the one hydroxylase two similar results so that kind of goes back to Gilbert

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:44.480
 Ling's theory that that it's not just about this receptor idea and i know they kind of talk a lot

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:51.280
 about the ddr the the vitamin D receptors in the um anti-desupliment group and and essentially what

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:59.920
 you're saying is that that doesn't matter yeah the whole cell the whole organism in fact is the real

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:09.600
 receptor because every receptor is sensitive to context and if you take out the so-called

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:16.080
 specific protein that's named the receptor still you have the whole context

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:24.960
 and it turns out that the receptor is just like a an extra leverage point

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:34.960
 for getting the quick easy change of the physiology but as long as you have a living cell

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:45.760
 in the whole organism then the specific receptors are just a part of the story not at all the whole

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:53.120
 picture so essentially the environment that the cell in has plays a huge role in how the cell

00:30:53.120 --> 00:31:00.880
 reacts to certain substances yeah the cell is always orienting itself to its environment

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:08.720
 and when you produce an organism without the receptor or the one hydroxylase

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.240
 other things take take over and fill in for the lack of that particular thing

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:26.000
 i see okay so i guess just for context it's it's good to know that the the cell will respond

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.320
 differently depending on the environment that it's in and if the body is healthier it's going to

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.600
 respond differently than if the body is unhealthy and if it's under inflammation and is you're not

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.560
 giving it enough sugar or enough other things that cell is going to react very differently than one

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:47.680
 that is properly supported good thyroid function and so forth yeah that's the high energy state

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:56.320
 of the cell which is stable and essentially in a resting and and readiness condition

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:05.680
 if it's lower in energy than any slight disturbance can can throw things off but

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:13.520
 the cell is more oriented and ready to handle its environment when the whole system

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:23.360
 is well energized and well fed gotcha so what about the belief that a vitamin d supplement

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:29.200
 is actually immune suppressive so some people report that they feel better taking a vitamin

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.720
 d supplement and then one theory is that well the reason you feel better is is because it is

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:42.080
 suppressing your immune system is what's happening is it's just suppressing the 125d and and that's

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:52.480
 what's making you feel better i i think that's part of it part of the confusion is the definition

00:32:52.480 --> 00:33:00.720
 of the immune system people talk about wanting to stimulate the immune system but i think that's

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:12.480
 the last thing we we want to do the immune system it means whatever we do to a damaging

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:21.200
 threat some kind of the injury then we say that the immune system has been activated

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:28.240
 but a very healthy organism for example with lots of calcium and vitamin d

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:35.360
 doesn't even notice it isn't harmed by the presence of the pathogen

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:43.280
 so the immune system isn't activated by the really healthy organisms for example

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.320
 98 percent of the really healthy people don't mind having the covid virus it's a minor

00:33:52.320 --> 00:34:01.600
 irritant or disturbing effect when your cells are in a stable highly energized condition

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:10.560
 it's only the borderline low energy inflamed condition of old age or existing sickness

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:20.240
 that makes something like the covid virus or a bacterium or whatever a fungus

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:33.600
 or a toxin and so on the body doesn't get damaged when it's in a healthy energized condition

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:43.200
 right so i'm going to take a little turn and and say there are some researchers that are utilizing

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:51.040
 like a really low vitamin d status to address autoimmune issues and they're saying that if

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:58.400
 they suppress the d status to well below 12 that they're actually getting responses where people

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:05.200
 are recovering from an autoimmune issue is there some explanation for that that would be the

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.960
 trevor marshall people that would be them correct

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:23.120
 the i don't like to even call it reasoning it's the application of an engineering

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:33.200
 metaphor to biology and an electrical engineer for example thinks in terms of hard wiring

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:42.240
 and switches and the flow of current and so on and so the idea of receptors

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:53.920
 and the innate immune processes and all of that fits very well with

00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:02.800
 an engineering orientation and a lot of if not all of trevor marshall's

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:14.160
 ideas are based on what he calls computer modeling and in 2006 he referred to the

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:22.160
 omysartan and similar angiotensin receptor inhibitors

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:34.960
 called them antagonists of the vitamin d receptor but then in 2017 he was calling them agonists of

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:44.240
 the vitamin d receptor and saying they restored the vitamin d receptor function and what they

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:53.520
 empirically are doing with a mild dose of minocycline it happens to be a very effective

00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:04.800
 anti-inflammatory agent as well as an antibiotic or antibacterial and the sartans only sartan or

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:14.960
 low sartan those are very basic effective anti-inflammatory agents and so when you're

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:23.600
 talking about autoimmune and degenerative diseases both anti-inflammatory agents

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:30.240
 minocycline and omysartan are going to reduce the symptoms and

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:42.960
 i don't think they have any particular either antagonist or receptive or a restorative effect

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:50.960
 on the vitamin d receptor so so yeah trevor marshall uses i think it's venicar to treat

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:58.480
 a lot of his patients which is a angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist blood pressure medication but

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.640
 what you're saying is that it may be not even the the suppression of vitamin d that's making

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:10.800
 the difference it might just be these medications are making the difference yeah i don't think he

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:20.000
 presents any evidence at all that it has anything to do with the vitamin d receptor it was originally

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:31.920
 based on so-called computer modeling no experiments really and and then he changed his from antagonist

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:45.120
 to agonist and in in fact the sartans in general are very powerful anti-inflammatory protective

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:53.920
 agents regardless of whether it's rheumatoid arthritis that's the problem or covid infection

00:38:53.920 --> 00:39:04.320
 it's a general all-purpose anti-inflammatory protective substance right i remember you talking

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:11.120
 about low sartan being used in in covid and helped people get through covid so i would imagine that

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:19.360
 these other ones would work as well very interesting um okay so flipping again could

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:30.160
 could store d status be a sign of sickness meaning if somebody's d is low um does that mean that they

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:36.960
 are sick or does that or like another argument is does is it actual need for more d or is it just a

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:43.680
 sign that they may be sick and that restoring their health would correct their d

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:56.400
 um if a person is taking large amounts of a vitamin d supplement and or getting sunlight

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:08.160
 and still they're circulating uh 25 hydroxy cholecalciferol if that is still low i think that

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:16.400
 means they have a liver inflammatory problem because the liver is a major part that creates

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:25.360
 the 25 hydroxy active form but i i think most of the background of the question has to do with the

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:34.720
 trevor marshall's doctrine that there are occult organisms inside cells causing sickness

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:45.280
 and that his protocol is the way to eventually eliminate those occult organisms

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:54.880
 so let's say somebody was taking a decent amount of d of getting sunlight and had like i said low

00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.480
 d level still their store d was quite low what would you at that point recommend would you say

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.080
 continue to take more d or is there something else that we need to look at

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:12.480
 yeah the whole picture of what could be the source of inflammation and liver injury

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:19.440
 but taking vitamin d isn't going to make the problem worse the way the

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:29.840
 trevor people marshall people say it will okay so at that point what about for somebody who takes

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:39.920
 a d supplement and it makes them feel absolutely horrible what would happen i've been hearing from

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:49.200
 a few people who were deteriorating rapidly one thought she was approaching death with

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:59.280
 neurological and all kinds of other symptoms and i looked at her diet and supplements and she was

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:07.440
 supplementing things in a base of medium chain triglycerides and when she stopped everything

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:18.800
 containing mct all of her symptoms went away and there's one study in which in animals they found

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:28.960
 that a peanut allergy for example was created in the presence of mct it affects the immune system

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:37.280
 on the lining of the intestine in a way that destroys our ability to resist

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:46.160
 andogens and allergens and makes us susceptible to food allergy symptoms

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:55.280
 that's interesting i mean the one supplement i usually recommend is carlson's and that is in mct

00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:02.960
 oil so you are saying to avoid the ones in mct oil or if it's if it is creating an irritation

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:08.160
 it could be the oil might might be okay are they okay to have in mct oil is there one that you

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:15.360
 know of that is good that is not in those things a lot of people get benefit from them but i think

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:26.720
 some of the intense bad reactions stop happening when they use a olive oil at base vitamin d

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:32.480
 there are several companies that that make a pure olive oil and vitamin d

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:39.920
 product either in drops or capsules okay do you happen to know any offhand that we don't remember

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:48.880
 no i don't remember just look for the price at that very tremendously in in cost so a vitamin d

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:55.040
 in olive oil would would be where to try if if you are currently taking a d supplement and having a

00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:06.080
 bad reaction and i think so lead at low d status okay um what about let's kind of flip into maybe

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:12.560
 talking a little about the calcium and d um kind of communication and how they're all intertwined

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:25.280
 with each other and so well i'm gonna go back real quick um if somebody has low d could it also mean

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.680
 other things meaning i certainly read some research showing that just taking magnesium

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:40.480
 can raise store d levels so it would it make sense for someone to actually explore other avenues

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:48.560
 before taking a d supplement like looking at some of the co-factors that go into vitamin d metabolism

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:59.840
 yeah for example including milk and cheese in your diet is a good first step to to see whether it

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.240
 might be a calcium magnesium deficiency because those both of those have

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:17.120
 both of both an activating and stabilizing protective potentially sedating action

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:25.600
 a quieting effect on inflammation for example so deficiency of either magnesium

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:38.240
 or calcium can lead to the inflammatory condition that activates the 125 dihydroxy d

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:46.000
 okay so just being low right in calcium or magnesium will initiate an inflammatory response

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:53.440
 which will pull the 25 of the store d down and will elevate your 125 active d numbers

00:45:53.440 --> 00:46:04.000
 is that correct yeah okay okay so our here's an interesting question are high cholesterol levels

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.920
 and low vitamin d status correlated since cholesterol is the precursor for d yeah in

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:22.800
 old people for example the vitamin d that is active in the skin is greatly reduced

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:30.480
 and that shows that the cholesterol

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:41.040
 is a major reason that aging reduces vitamin d production they just aren't putting the

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.520
 cholesterol in the position to be activated by sunlight

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:53.920
 so then it would be fair to say that possibly taking a statin or any cholesterol

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.880
 lowering medication is certainly going to affect your vitamin d status

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:05.200
 yeah it affects everything including vitamin d status okay so that would be certainly something

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.400
 to look at would it be more something if your cholesterol was high would it would you first

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:20.960
 look at something like thyroid function or a neural deficiency in the 1930s into the 1940s

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:31.440
 hypothyroidism was very commonly diagnosed by elevated cholesterol and over and over

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:39.520
 experimenters within people who had had their thyroid plan removed and in animals showed that

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:52.400
 thyroid reliably lowers cholesterol as it increases the metabolic rate it's a very predictable event so

00:47:52.400 --> 00:48:03.600
 the whole hypercholesterolemia culture grew up along with the suppression of the existing

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:13.840
 knowledge of thyroid hormone function so essentially if somebody is high cholesterol I mean not not that

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.360
 you need to take a thyroid but obviously improving thyroid function whether it's for proper diet or

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.640
 de-stressing that alone without even taking a d supplement could improve their d status

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:37.280
 yeah the thyroid and vitamin d and calcium are intimately interrelated you can't separate

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:47.680
 the thyroid from the vitamin d and calcium metabolism gotcha okay um what about can we

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.840
 actually store enough d for the winter months is is that what the summer is all about and

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.560
 essentially for those people that obviously don't have a lot of summer months are they

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.280
 going to be able to get enough d during those months so that will take care of them during

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:08.640
 the winter or for those people is it pretty evident that they'll need to be taking some

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:13.920
 sort of supplementation or certainly eating foods that are certainly high in vitamin d

00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:22.880
 if they have really been in the sun during the summer they will assuming that their liver is

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:30.240
 fairly healthy their liver is going to store enough for several months of the darkest part

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:37.360
 of winter but it really depends on how much time they spend outside during the summer

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:46.160
 and also how good their thyroid status is and their general metabolism but yes

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:56.640
 the reason eating fish liver or beef liver or whatever is a good source of vitamin d

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:02.800
 is that the liver does store a considerable amount of vitamin d

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:11.120
 okay so kind of getting on that so would you and i know you've gone um and said kind of good

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:17.680
 and bad so would you say that cod liver oil would be an okay way to supplement vitamin d

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:29.280
 except that it comes with a considerable amount of fish oil yes and fish oil over time

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:39.760
 tends to accumulate with pro estrogen effects pro inflammatory pro aging anti thyroid effects

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:47.840
 so i don't think it's the best way to get your vitamin d and vitamin a but it is a

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:57.760
 source in an emergency better to use cod liver oils and to be deficient in vitamin d

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:05.760
 right but something like beef liver or whole milk would be better options much much better

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:13.680
 okay and what about let's say milk that has been fortified with vitamin d is that safe

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:25.760
 the choice of emulsifiers i'm not sure how much latitude there is but i've heard that

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:36.000
 polysorbate 80 and polyethylene glycol have been used as emulsifiers for the vitamin a and vitamin d

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.760
 and since some people are very allergic to those polymers you have to

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:53.840
 be watchful if you have an allergic reaction to milk try a milk that hasn't been

00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:03.360
 supplemented which usually means buying whole milk which hasn't been pasteurized then you can skim it

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:13.520
 to reduce the very high fat content of the whole milk and get an unadulterated natural milk

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:19.760
 right and that's one thing i certainly remember i mean over in the states we know that all low fat

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:26.960
 milk is has additives of a and d in it i don't think there are any that don't that are low fat

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:32.800
 and i know you consume a lower fat milk and i usually consume a milk like straws where you can

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:39.040
 actually skim the fat now if i was a skim the fat aren't i removing a lot of the a and the d that

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:48.480
 i'm trying to get yeah but a moderate amount like one or two percent fat is all you need for the

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:55.440
 vitamins if the cows are healthy okay okay and then you i know you use a lower fat milk do you

00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:02.880
 have a brand that you prefer that seems to do okay for you uh no i just get whatever tastes good

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:12.080
 some of the organic milks have a really bad taste and that means their cows were eating

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:21.680
 some kind of odd weeds that i don't like so i go by the taste okay so the so does your grocery

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.080
 store kind of let you taste test when that would be nice if we could all like you know it like going

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:32.960
 to a winery you could taste your milk before you purchased it that would be nice but i just don't

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:39.680
 buy it again when it tastes too bad that's probably good advice katie what do you do for your milk are

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:46.480
 you are you still there i am still here i um we drink low-fat milk craig likes skim milk because

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.040
 he drink i think skim is what the equivalent because you guys call it different things

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:57.120
 we call it low-fat yes you've got one percent and then yeah he drinks the like the really low fat

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.960
 lungs he drinks loads of milk i drink the low fat but we're so lucky over here we don't they're not

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:06.720
 fortified with vitamins which is so awesome so yeah we just get them from our there's a couple

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:14.320
 of local um dairies that we support that we get our milk from um which is really good but yeah i

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.160
 really feel for all our american and overseas clients because they're always posting about how

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:25.200
 they just can't find milk low-fat milk without the added vitamins yeah so i think the takeaway is

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:30.640
 yet you know you can either buy a milk that's full and try to skim the fat or you know try other ones

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.720
 and if they taste good you know and and you don't have some sort of reaction to it then it's a good

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.760
 milk but some people i find when reintroducing milk that whole seems to be the easiest route

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:44.480
 because they seem to tolerate the best at least in the beginning so um that's my general advice on

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:56.560
 that okay uh still got a bunch so everybody put on their seat belt um so ray when we measure the

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:04.640
 stored vitamin d or the calcidil uh in the blood is is this an accurate number because i always hear

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.440
 about there's certain things like estrogen and iron that you know really doesn't matter what's

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.880
 in the blood it's because it's in the tissue is this a similar case for store d because there

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:24.640
 obviously is a lot in the tissue as well um uh no the circulating in the blood you have the

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:36.000
 vitamin g binding protein as well as the lipids in the blood that are carrying a large amount of it

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:52.320
 so it the fat tissues passively act as storage but at a level not much higher than in the blood

00:55:53.760 --> 00:56:07.360
 and when it's in the muscles nerves and so on no one has measured the extracting those

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:21.120
 vital tissues to see how much of the 25 hydroxy is inside the cells it's assumed that the cells will

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:31.440
 take up according to what they need probably very similar to the blood level i see i think

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:37.120
 you once told me that if you are have a good amount of body fat on you though won't your body

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:44.400
 store more of that d in the tissue so maybe your numbers won't be as high and that might also be to

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:53.840
 due to a liver issue the level in the fat tissue corresponds pretty closely to the concentration

00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:01.360
 in the blood so if you have a very big volume of fat tissue at that same concentration then yeah

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:11.840
 that will act as a storage supplementing what's in your liver i see i see so let's talk about the

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.600
 optimal number of your store d like what number because obviously some people promote that

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:24.400
 anything above 20 doesn't make any sense so there's no biological reason for you or advantage to be

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:33.200
 above 20 and obviously i think you'd promote more of a 40 to 60 number so what would you say

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:37.120
 obviously that is what you would say but why would you say the number needs to be higher

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:45.760
 and and the reasoning behind that one of the functions is to keep your 125 dihydroxy

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:57.920
 d as low as possible by keeping your parathyroid hormone low so having excess calcium in in your

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:08.960
 diet and a generous amount of the 25 hydroxy d that is acting as sort of a buffer against

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:16.560
 any of the irritants and inflammatory de-energized conditions that would threaten to

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:32.560
 increase your parathyroid hormone and 125 dihydroxy so your go ahead the practical level like improving

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:42.480
 sleep for example being resistant to sunburn that pretty much happens above 50 nanograms

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:51.680
 per milliliter 50 to 70 seems to be the safe range where it's acting as a buffer

00:58:51.680 --> 00:59:01.360
 to reduce stress generally and what about some people i mean can you go too high i mean obviously

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:06.320
 you're not going to go higher than that if you're if you're getting natural sunlight but if you were

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:13.200
 supplementing i mean what what dangers are there if you if you go to 80 or 90 or 100 people working

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:23.920
 outdoors for example as a lifeguard have measured 130 nanograms per milliliter and higher

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:35.600
 and there's no harm evident at all but with a moderate overdose of 125 dihydroxy you can easily

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:44.720
 create hypercalcemia calcification of of soft tissues demineralization of your bones

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:56.400
 and other degenerative signs so as long as your calcium intake and 25 hydroxy are in that range

00:59:56.400 --> 01:00:08.000
 i don't know if anyone who has had 200 nanograms per milliliter but no matter how much sun

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:20.880
 exposure you get maybe 150 ng per ml would be a an upper healthy limit but

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:29.200
 it's the keeping keeping the 125 down preventing the parathyroid hormone

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.840
 from creating the degenerative inflammatory processes

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:45.120
 so i mean i've read research that will show that a there are healthy people that actually have a low

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:52.560
 25d store d also a low 125d and that would be a healthy person and it's the unhealthy person that

01:00:52.560 --> 01:01:04.320
 has a elevated or low 25d but then a very elevated 125d i mean can you be healthy with a number

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:18.400
 of 20 for a store d number temporarily i i just think the the long range outlet

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.240
 is better when you're in the higher range because you're

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:39.840
 having a buffer effect actually of an excess beyond what's essential of calcium and 25 hydroxy

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:48.480
 it gives you the opportunity to undergo some stress without tearing down your bones

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:55.840
 and calcifying your arteries okay so for someone that maybe doesn't have a lot of stress in their

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:02.160
 life and you know is living inside but not really very stressed that could totally work but obviously

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:07.840
 in today's modern society with a good amount of stress that would not be an ideal number to be

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:15.440
 protected for the long haul yeah i think so okay okay so let's talk about the vitamin d kind of

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:22.240
 calcium connection and because obviously i know you definitely your big things that you'd like to

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.760
 promote thyroid calcium vitamin d and how they all intertwine with each other can you just give me a

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:38.160
 brief synopsis of how vitamin d and calcium and thyroid all affect each other i'm keeping the

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:50.880
 calcium bound up so that it doesn't act as an excitement to cells the danger when your energy

01:02:50.880 --> 01:03:03.920
 is low or inflammation is high is that calcium becomes a cell exciter activates a breakdown of

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:16.640
 protein nucleic acids and the activation of all of the processes that lead to eventually cell death

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:32.000
 or loss of function and the vitamin d of the right sort is functioning to activate the proteins

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:43.200
 that hold vitamin d in a safe condition and in that condition vitamins or calcium is

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:54.560
 working with progesterone and thyroid as cell stabilizers as having actually a sedative effect

01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:09.040
 an injection of calcium salts can act as an analgesic and as a sedative by

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:21.280
 promoting the stable relaxed conditions simply being low in energy or having inflammatory signals

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:33.200
 will activate the improper functions such as calcification of your blood vessels and other

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:46.160
 soft tissues and that's where at 125 dihydroxy becomes a danger it has a brain excitatory effect

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:56.720
 which can can seem very good momentarily but at exactly the same process that makes it a brain

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:08.400
 excite and makes it a blood vessel calcifier by destabilizing the relation between calcium

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:17.040
 and the structure of the cell so i think one of the confusions about calcium is because you always

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:23.440
 hear about people are calcified and calcified arteries and blood vessels and their tissue and

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.560
 so people are constantly being told you don't need any more calcium everything's calcified

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:34.960
 and can you kind of explain what is really happening so that we can understand that obviously

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:39.200
 don't want to be calcified but is it due to the fact that somebody is eating too much calcium

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:49.760
 no it's the same situation with kidney stones people who don't eat enough calcium

01:05:52.080 --> 01:06:01.520
 or don't get enough of the right kind of vitamin D tend to get calcium kidney stones

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:11.360
 and the mechanism seems to be that your parathyroid hormone increases at your

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:22.480
 aldosterone and a whole inflammatory system increases the the angiotensin system becomes

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:36.320
 activated and the excitation goes with unopposed phosphate action if you have too much phosphate

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:47.840
 in your diet that activates the calcification process partly by a direct solubility effects

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:54.800
 inside cells but mostly through activating overproduction of parathyroid hormone

01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:03.280
 so when you talk about getting extra protective calcium in your diet

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:13.440
 that means relative to somewhat lower phosphate in your diet because both of those effects

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:22.640
 will lower your parathyroid hormone and the angiotensin system and adrenal stress hormones

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:30.640
 all of which protects the blood vessels and other soft tissues from calcification

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:45.680
 injection of the 125 dihydroxy will have exactly the opposite effect or an overdose of parathyroid

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:57.440
 hormone activating the 125 dihydroxy will pull calcium out of your bones give you hypercalcemia

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:10.560
 and create crystals of calcium and phosphate inside your living cells causing them to first become

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:19.760
 excited overactive stress producing excess collagen excess nitric oxide

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:29.760
 and a whole process of degenerative damage leading to a formation of bone

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:33.520
 fibrous hardening and calcified fiber

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:45.200
 so it's essentially the opposite so it's not due to ingesting calcium that's creating the issues

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:52.000
 it's essentially a lack of calcium and a high phosphorus diet that's triggering the parathyroid

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:58.560
 hormone to pull calcium from the bones and then that is what essentially is creating all this

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:06.000
 calcification yeah it's been known now for decades that women with the worst osteoporosis

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:18.320
 have the most calcified blood vessels gotcha and so obviously and this is obviously why you

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.240
 definitely promote a high calcium to phosphorus diet which essentially is a high dairy diet and

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:34.640
 low grain and meat diet is that my very reason yeah grains like humus nuts meats and fish all

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:43.200
 can create an excess of phosphate in the system activating your parathyroid hormone

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:50.480
 and during the night just the stress of the darkness of a single night

01:09:50.480 --> 01:10:00.720
 increases your parathyroid hormone and the if you measure the calcium output in the urine

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:11.440
 of a person who is developing osteoporosis most of the day's calcium loss is in the morning urine

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:19.920
 because of the elevation of parathyroid hormone during the night breaking down the bones putting

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:27.520
 making you relatively hypercalcimic hardening your arteries and other tissues

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:35.360
 and so especially at bedtime milk and vitamin g

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:46.960
 are protective against this constant nocturnal loss of calcium so just another reason to have

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:55.600
 milk and honey before you go to bed to help with that process is that one reason why people are

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:03.280
 always so stiff in the morning yeah lots of inflammatory things develop during the night

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:11.600
 if you look at all of the blood changes within about an hour or two

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:21.840
 or by the middle of the night all of the degenerative stress hormones have increased

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:33.040
 free fatty acids which are toxic to all of the cells by interrupting your oxidative

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:42.480
 use of glucose the free fatty acids rise steadily during the night along with cortisol

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:56.000
 serotonin estrogen angiotensin parathyroid hormone and all of the things that take take our tissues

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:04.800
 apart so that's essentially why we're trained to sleep at night right to go into the least

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:10.240
 stressed position we possibly can because of all of these things that are happening in our

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:16.080
 system just based on the darkness yeah people have had their blood tested every 15 minutes

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:28.240
 while either awake during the night or while asleep during the night and if you are soundly

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:35.680
 sleeping during the night you'll have a moderate increase of the stress hormones but when you're

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:43.600
 not sleeping the darkness is several times more destructive all of the stress hormones

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:53.920
 rise more quickly when you're not asleep so sleep is our obviously adaptive reaction to

01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:01.200
 avoiding those stresses right so if you're a shift worker and have to stay up at night probably

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.440
 something that would help you would be milkshakes and milky drink or high calcium foods or so forth

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:14.960
 to help kind of support the system during that nighttime yeah and everything that protects

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:31.680
 against the shift to fat metabolism of free fatty acids the 125 dihydroxy vitamin D is able to turn

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:41.440
 off the oxidative metabolism causing a shift over to the fat dependent metabolism and a shift to the

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:50.560
 cancer metabolism producing uh uh lactic acid why do you think that the doctors do not take

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:56.880
 the 125 D test i mean do you think that would be more helpful to people to understanding their

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:05.920
 own vitamin D status if they'd had both 25 D and 125 D taken um yeah the really useful test is the

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:19.280
 25 the unconverted form and some doctors measure the 125

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:28.480
 dihydroxy and if they don't realize that that's an indicator of more of stress

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:37.440
 than a vitamin D adequacy that can be a good indicator of vitamin D deficiency when your

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:47.760
 parathyroid hormone and 125 dihydroxy are increased right so oh just so if you are going to like if

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:55.120
 you really wanted to understand somebody's vitamin D status what would be the labs that besides 25 D

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:01.200
 and 125 D that you would have been taped to get to get a really good understanding of where they're

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:12.400
 at i think the 25 hydroxy is a good enough test for almost all purposes okay so they wouldn't even

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:20.160
 need to get like parathyroid hormone basically if you're if your 25 D is low you need more vitamin D

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:30.880
 or sunlight or you need to get out of stress or a combination of all those yeah there are surgical

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:39.520
 companies websites that are adding to the confusion by saying you can't lower your

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:52.000
 parathyroid hormone but by diet or other metabolic effects you have to have your parathyroid hormone

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:01.760
 parathyroid then cut out if you have excessive parathyroid hormone but there are these forces

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:11.200
 actively misinforming the public flatly saying that you you cannot lower parathyroid hormone

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:19.440
 by eating more calcium and vitamin D but that's absolutely not true right yeah and i also saw

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:26.000
 studies that just removing phosphorus or eating a low phosphorus diet can improve parathyroid hormone

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:37.760
 yeah that is pretty well recognized as a cause of the increasing degenerative disease in the

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:46.640
 population as the high ratio of phosphate to calcium in the diet in the industrial world

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:55.600
 yeah that yes so that's most people eating a high meat grain legume nut diet and all avoiding dairy

01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:01.040
 and eating their nut milk so that would be the perfect place to have low vitamin D status

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:10.800
 right right okay so i real quick i want to get back to just how vitamin D is metabolizes and

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.960
 talking about the other co-factors the other minerals or nutrients that are involved in that

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:21.680
 certainly there's a lot of talk that if you are to take a vitamin D supplement that it will

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:30.480
 deplete or use a lot of other nutrients like vitamin A or magnesium potassium copper and so

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:38.960
 if somebody is already deficient in magnesium and copper and vitamin A would it make more sense to

01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:50.080
 address those issues first before putting a D supplement in i don't think so that's actually

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:59.680
 important to work on all of them at the same time but the vitamin D itself is part of the

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:12.480
 calming anti-inflammatory process so the calcium and magnesium are essential and should be done

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:18.880
 immediately but i don't think the vitamin D supplement is going to make anything worse

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:24.880
 yeah one of the conversations is if you increase vitamin D you're going to increase kind of the

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:29.920
 burn rate of a magnesium and even vitamin A and if you're already deficient in those and since we

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:36.240
 know that vitamin A is very integrated in iron metabolism that that could actually make iron get

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:41.760
 more stored in the tissue or can dysregulate iron but also knowing that magnesium is involved in

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:51.280
 three thousand other enzymatic processes that by giving someone a lot of D and I think what you're

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.480
 saying is you just need to do it all together but obviously just giving someone D and not doing all

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:06.480
 the other things you could create a problem i think that idea comes largely from 50 or 60 years ago

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:16.080
 some animal experiments showed that if you give very large amounts of vitamin B1 thiamine

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:25.840
 that you you will increase the metabolic rate and for borderline deficient in others it will

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:33.360
 make the other deficiencies show up more quickly but i don't know of any experiments at all

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:45.920
 that would show that happening with vitamin D or magnesium or calcium to a great extent the body can

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:58.240
 use the boost it gets from one nutrient to reduce its need for the other nutrients

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:09.840
 such that even adding sodium or potassium can reduce your need for magnesium or calcium

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:19.760
 simply the alkaline mineral iron has a certain

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:33.600
 interactive equivalence and the vitamin A and vitamin D do work together but

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:43.200
 there you would have to be in at an extreme desperately deficient condition before you'd

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:51.200
 see one creating a deficiency of the other okay so what you're saying is even though

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:57.280
 vitamin A is needed in the vitamin D metabolism it really wouldn't matter if you started supplementing

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:03.600
 even somewhat high dose of D it wouldn't throw off your other nutrients if the other ones weren't

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:13.760
 being supported at the same time unless you were extremely deficient in them yeah yeah and vitamin

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:21.360
 A and thyroid have a noticeable interaction so that if you're on if you're borderline for thyroid

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:31.760
 function and take a huge vitamin A supplement such as a hundred thousand units you will probably

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:43.200
 experience a dip in your thyroid activity because thyroid hormone and retinol travel on the same

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:54.320
 protein and so you'll simply displace one by too much of the other but that is noticeable only in

01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:02.480
 extreme situations i see um i had a thought and then it left my brain

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:10.880
 so we'll go to the next question which is should people ever take a calcium supplement

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:25.040
 or are they harmful no they should get it from food but for example eggshells or powdered oyster

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:35.680
 shells you can think of it as a food instead of throwing away the the shell of the egg

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:48.640
 why not powder it up and add it to your omelette it's uh in a in a form that is very assimilable

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:58.400
 by most people so a calcium carbonate i don't think is is a problem to use as a calcium supplement

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:08.000
 calcium supplement but some of the counter ions have their own activity so you don't want to take

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:18.000
 a very big doses of a calcium lactate or calcium gluconate for example

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:27.760
 just because that counter ion can have its own metabolic action okay so taking a food supplement

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.920
 like eggshell calcium which i know i i certainly recommend i know you recommend because it is

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:38.080
 actually a food that is safe to take is is there any way you should take that i've always you know

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.160
 read that calcium is better absorbed with sugar or also vitamin d so is it would it be smart to

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:49.360
 take that with something like orange juice or yeah yeah i think with the whole meal

01:23:51.200 --> 01:24:00.720
 so you don't notice any highly purified substance tend to disturb and irritate your stomach and

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:09.200
 intestine and the calcium high concentration of calcium carbonate it can be irritating there's

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:19.040
 like too much salt or sugar in a concentrated form it's irritating to the membranes okay so anytime

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.200
 you're going to take a calcium supplement hopefully food source eat it with your entire

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:29.360
 meal so that you can get everything together because it can be an irritant yeah when you

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:39.040
 separate out the major nutrients the intestine is most efficient when it has the most complex

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:47.440
 mixture of of the major nutrients protein fat and carbohydrate for example if you eat only one

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:57.760
 component at a time your intestine doesn't recognize it as quite proper food and so it's

01:24:57.760 --> 01:25:06.000
 not as efficient at absorbing any of the ingredients that your your intestine wants a

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.520
 complex natural sort of mixture of nutrients right i think there's always an argument that

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:19.040
 calcium carbonate isn't absorbed very well and would you just say if you consumed it with your

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:24.400
 complete meal and with some sugar that it would absorb much better yeah it becomes calcium

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:32.880
 chloride in the presence of stomach acid i see i see okay is there any issues with obviously you

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.760
 know i always think milk is a perfect food because it comes with all of the other co-factors like

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:45.120
 vitamin a and d and magnesium all the supporting agents are all together and i feel like that's

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.640
 you know kind of how mother nature meant it and so when you do do something like a supplement

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:57.280
 is there ever a problem to you know just how your body will take it in i've always read if you do

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:03.040
 too much calcium you're gonna lower your potassium and you'll just throw off your minerals is that

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:11.680
 is that going to happen or will your body kind of figure it out i yeah the the receptor idea

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:20.720
 leads to a lot of those worries that are unnecessary the the cells and the intestine

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:27.920
 and the body in general are very adaptive and basically intelligent about

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:37.520
 adjusting what it takes in so that it it uh isn't very easily disturbed

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:43.760
 okay right because i've heard in circles that if you ingest too much calcium at certain

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:50.160
 that somehow you can have a thyroid suppressing effect and i think it's because it was gonna

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:56.640
 lower potassium and other minerals and i and i'm hearing that that's not the case

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.440
 yes that started i think with some pharmaceutical

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:09.920
 experiments in which they found that taking a thyroxine supplement at the same time you take

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:21.120
 a calcium supplement ordering milk slows the absorption of the thyroxine but the a lot of

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:27.680
 pharmacists are obsessed with the idea of quick absorption but in the case of thyroid for example

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:35.200
 slow absorption is what you want and with most nutrients slow steady absorption

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:48.320
 is the best for your system to sort out and use properly okay perfect what about you know you

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:54.240
 always hear about certain ratios of minerals and one in particular that i've heard of is this

01:27:54.240 --> 01:28:00.080
 calcium-magnesium ratio where you know you hear hey you need to have almost 10 times as much

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:05.920
 calcium to magnesium or and then i've also heard the reverse where the magnesium should be much

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:11.200
 higher than the calcium are you just going back to the entire back to that receptor theory that

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:16.480
 does that matter do we need to be aware of something like that or should we just eat whole

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:28.960
 foods and not worry basically yeah the body can sort out great ranges of proportion between

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:40.000
 calcium and magnesium and milk has quite a lot more calcium than magnesium but a pure milk diet

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:47.840
 you can't become magnesium deficiency because milk has more than enough magnesium

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:58.000
 if you're getting an adequate calcium supply from it okay and that kind of brings me to the next

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.800
 question that and then just so everybody knows we're almost to the finish line which is super

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:09.680
 exciting but i this has been so interesting um i think a lot of people get this idea this imbalance

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:15.600
 of minerals because they're using a diagnostic test like a hair mineral uh hair tissue mineral

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.920
 analysis tests and i think you get all these ratios on this test and say oh look you're high

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:26.560
 in calcium or you're high in this is that a good test to understand the minerals inside of us

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:40.160
 no it's a good test of what you wash your hair with okay and just being in a dusty environment

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:47.440
 or a chemically polluted environment you can tell where a person has been by smelling their hair

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:58.720
 because it it binds things so easily and it will pull things out out of the water with with a

01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:08.160
 moderate amount of calcium in water uh your hair is going to bind a lot of calcium but if you have

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:15.440
 softened water with lots of sodium in it then your hair is going to experience a high sodium

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:27.280
 rather than calcium environment. Experimenters years ago compared toenails to hair and found

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:38.800
 the toenails by being constantly protected and the thicker material than hair is much more

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:48.000
 representative of your actual tissue mineral levels but still your toenails take about six months

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:57.520
 to get long enough to clip off and so the hair is is convenient and if you clip it

01:30:57.520 --> 01:31:03.520
 close to your skin you can get hair that has only been exposed to the environment

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:16.160
 for several days but still just one one shampoo with hard water is going to fill your hair with

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:22.960
 calcium or magnesium. What about hair pulled it what if they pull the root would that make a

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:34.320
 difference? Yeah if you measure just the the knob on the end you would get more would it still be an

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:40.720
 accurate even like I said if you were able to use the hair that hadn't been uh altered by water or

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:50.160
 air would that hair be a good analysis of the minerals in your body? The water gets pretty far

01:31:50.160 --> 01:32:01.200
 down the hair shaft so it would have to just be the very knob at the end. Is there any good test

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:08.320
 outside of ripping your toenail off that sounds a little painful of actually checking minerals in

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:16.640
 your body I mean is is blood acceptable would that give you some understanding? Yeah if you include

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:26.160
 all of the blood cells that's going to be a very accurate and repeatable representative for your

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:32.800
 mineral content. So what test would those be specifically because that's obviously not a

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.520
 normal test that your doctor's going to do like are you talking about the the red blood cell

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:48.880
 what's in those? A chemist would just dissolve the whole whole thing

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:57.920
 in an acid or alkali and just measure the the mineral content in an absolute sense.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:06.960
 And you're referencing the blood though? Yeah measurable in the blood yeah okay so but if I

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.920
 wanted to go to my lab and then I wanted to know all of what my minerals were would it I mean because

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:18.000
 I can go get copper or magnesium or is it red blood cell magnesium or like what where what would it

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:27.440
 would it be that I would actually buy from a lab? Well if they're separating your serum and cells

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:35.120
 centrifuging it and so on then you're only going to be measuring one component

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:44.720
 of the blood and then you have to know how that component is reflecting what's in the rest of the

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:56.000
 body. So if you have a very good standard then any particular component is going to be altered

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:06.960
 according to the condition of the body but if you want to know the the general body status

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:16.000
 for minerals in general I think the whole whole blood homogenate would be the appropriate thing

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.280
 to measure. Okay um I had a real a question real quick and it was come in front of what does it

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:32.320
 mean if somebody has excessively low parathyroid hormones? Like I think that they are probably

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:42.000
 taking enough vitamin D and calcium and magnesium. So you're basically saying it can't really get too

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:52.960
 low like if they're lower than their norm number then you're good. Except when you surgically remove

01:34:52.960 --> 01:35:02.560
 the parathyroid glands if you keep them supplied with magnesium and vitamin D

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:14.320
 they generally are remarkably healthy. Their sleep improves and remember that aging is a constant

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:23.680
 increase in parathyroid hormone and the parathyroid hormone every night rises and accelerates the

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:33.200
 aging process. So it's something that gets worse the older you are and exacerbates the problem.

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:43.600
 And so the the good benefits of parathyroidectomy in people with kidney disease for example

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.520
 are very impressive.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:55.120
 So basically that is the explanation as you get old everybody when everybody but people

01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:02.000
 under stress certainly you see a lot of osteopenia all osteoporosis or kidney stones starting to

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:09.200
 occur and that's just a sign that the system is under stress. Correct? I think so. Right.

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:19.760
 Real quick a question about magnesium. Where would you recommend people get a source? Would you get a

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:26.000
 food source? And obviously there's a lot of people that you know use a lot of magnesium. Is magnesium

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.080
 something that most people should be taking since we're all under stress and we're losing it daily?

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:41.200
 A milk is a very generous source. Coffee is a consistent source. It's a small amount but

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:49.760
 it can help as a supplement to the milk. Orange juice contributes a moderate amount of meat and

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:57.520
 fish and the high phosphate foods always contain a considerable amount of magnesium.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:04.320
 And if people don't feel like they're getting enough should do you think they should supplement

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:09.040
 and if they they should supplement is there a preferred magnesium source that you would tell

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:18.400
 is a better source? Years and years ago I experimented with magnesium carbonate.

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:34.240
 I had used it for in Mexico as a counter action of tourista diarrhea and I always had a little block

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:43.120
 of magnesium carbonate and a doctor friend was complaining about her horrible uterine cramps

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:51.920
 and she normally wouldn't consider a nutritional supplement but since she

01:37:51.920 --> 01:38:01.200
 was pretty much immobilized by the discomfort of the cramp she was willing to take a chunk of

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:10.480
 magnesium carbonate and chew it up and in just about five minutes she looked down at her abdomen

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:21.360
 said I can't believe it they stopped completely and it can have almost instantaneous effect of

01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:30.240
 working the way calcium does as a quieting influence but it can be very quick and reliable

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:43.120
 but the trouble is that many of the manufacturing methods for magnesium carbonate and other magnesium

01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:54.160
 compounds they involve contaminants that can be allergenic and lots and lots of people get a

01:38:54.160 --> 01:39:07.120
 headache or a squeezing allergy symptoms of a variety of types from using magnesium supplements

01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:18.320
 magnesium glycinate so far I haven't heard any serious complaints from that form of it.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:23.680
 Yeah that's that would be the one I prefer and I don't know have you ever tried the magnesium

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:33.760
 bicarbonate? I know people who use it and like it yeah yeah those seem to be I think the least harsh

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:38.560
 and the ones that people don't complain obviously magnesium carbonate I think to a lot of people

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.200
 acts as a good laxative so I think things start moving quickly and I don't know if it's that is

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.880
 that because of the carbonate or was that just because of the additives they might have in the

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:59.200
 carbonate magnesium itself at a certain level it works as laxative if it's anti-inflammatory

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:07.680
 sometimes the the bowel is being paralyzed by inflammation and so something which is

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:21.280
 anti-spasmodic can let the normal pericelsus take over. Gotcha well that is all the questions I have

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:28.800
 I don't know if you have anything else to add Ray that was a lot of amazing information I don't

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:35.840
 know do you think we hopefully covered most of it? Yeah I don't think of anything else.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:41.920
 And well done in an hour and a half too I'm surprised I thought it might take like two

01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:47.040
 and a half hours. Well you know what as I was going I started to realize we'd covered a lot

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:51.600
 of these other questions I was like okay we kind of covered that and I'm like all right we covered

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:58.400
 that to start now I was getting a little bit yeah yeah that was awesome. That was so so good

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:06.000
 on you know like when we did the one with Georgie and Kate and Matt and Benny I think people were

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:13.280
 just a bit confused. I think this will be much easier to understand which is good. I hope so.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:20.640
 Awesome well thank you so much Ray I'm sure everyone will love this podcast just as much

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:25.920
 as the last one so much valuable information and thank you so much Kate for putting all those

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:33.200
 questions to get all those thorough super thorough questions. So I guess maybe just to finish off Kate

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:43.600
 so are we pro vitamin D? Well I think at the end of the day as Ray said I mean I think that if you

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:50.000
 are actually low vitamin D that it's it would be as you say it's not a harmful substance to try

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:55.600
 and I think Ray would agree I mean you have to take an excessive amount to really get a

01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:06.720
 harmful effect would you agree? Yeah I've never known a person or even a study of the 25 hydroxy D

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:19.440
 causing harm like five million units continued for a period of time probably can be harmful but

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:27.680
 I've never run across anyone of people with rheumatoid arthritis when they feel a slight benefit

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:33.600
 from five or ten thousand units a day some of them have gone up to twenty thousand

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:43.840
 or more units per day and not only get complete relief but tend not to have a recurrence

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:55.120
 so the big doses are pretty consistently therapeutic and once you get the

01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:04.160
 inflammation under control then you don't need to keep such high doses. Great I just had a thought

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:09.040
 because I've certainly read studies that have shown that people you know they've taken over time and I

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.240
 can't remember the study but it was they they gave different dosages of vitamin D's to women I think

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:19.680
 it was like 400 IUs two thousand and ten thousand IUs and then followed them for a significant amount

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.960
 of time and then then found at the end of this study that the ones that were taking the highest

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:35.120
 amount of D showed more bone loss than the other ones and do you have some explanation as to why

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:45.520
 that could occur? No I would have to see the details of the study and hope it wasn't done

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:55.200
 by a martial disciple. It might have been. Yeah one of the funny things in his 2017

01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:04.160
 publication was he was connecting not only the restorative effective vitamin

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:16.720
 of angiotensin blocker on the vitamin D receptor but he was incriminating electro-smog

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:23.680
 which isn't a good thing but he was incriminating that as a factor in the vitamin D receptor

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:32.240
 malfunction and he recommended a silver thread cap as a way to protect the brain from the

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:43.920
 electro-smog and help your vitamin D receptor but probably there is a shielding effect from

01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:54.880
 silver threads in the cap but why not the whole old-fashioned aluminum hat aluminum foil

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.120
 hat which is an absolute brain shield.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:07.920
 Well maybe we'll have to get that study over because there are some out there that I sometimes

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.280
 wonder and I'm sure there might be something in the study that would explain it not just

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:19.200
 I didn't know so that was awesome and so yeah I think that the takeaway is if you're gonna get

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:24.160
 vitamin D get some in olive oil. Yeah we'll have a look should we have a I'll have a search

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.760
 see if we can find some brands because I've never really seen any brands in olive oil.

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:33.040
 They're mostly I think fine in the MCT oil and most people I know don't have an issue with that

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:38.240
 but I'm sure as you say they could. I'd certainly have had people tell me they definitely have some

01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:43.840
 very strong reactions with vitamin D and they just cannot take it so it could be that MCT oil.

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:49.280
 Well we can drop the link to the Carlsen's and try and find some olive oil ones as well.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:56.800
 Absolutely. Yeah awesome well thank you so much Dr. Peat thank you so much Kate

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:03.200
 and awesome I'm sure we'll probably think of some another awesome topic to have Ray on again.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.080
 I hope so. Ray it was such a pleasure to talk to you and let me pick your brain

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:12.080
 for that long length of time I totally appreciate it and enjoy it.

01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:22.160
 Yeah thank you it's fun to think about the the subject it's an area that is going to get more

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:29.360
 and more interesting as more research opens up what the vitamin D is really doing.

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:37.840
 Yeah you're welcome anytime. Great thanks so much have a great day guys or evening I should say bye.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.680
 Bye.
