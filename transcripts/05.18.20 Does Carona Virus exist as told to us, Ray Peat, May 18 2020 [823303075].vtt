00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.720
 Ah, well good morning once again.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.560
 This is Patrick Timpone, One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.000
 And part two of our show, May 18, 2020.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Good to be here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.240
 David Wolf will join us tomorrow, 9 o'clock central.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:36.600
 So after the show, get your questions in for David Wolf, probably one of the foremost,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.160
 what kind of health gurus in the vegetarian/vegan world, David Wolf.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.160
 He'll be here tomorrow.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.320
 A couple of great shows for you on Wednesday that I think you're going to find fascinating.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.380
 Two very unique people talking about some of the legality of the people that are pushing

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.320
 this corona thing and actually some ways you may be able to protect yourself if you feel

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 so inclined.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.000
 And then also going back to some really old medicine and how some of the modern medicine

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.260
 came into being even before the early 1900s with the Rockefeller Foundation thing.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.040
 Pretty fascinating stuff that I read in an article and invited the man on and he said,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.360
 "Yeah, and that'll happen on Wednesday."

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.640
 Here's our contact info if you have a question or a comment for our next guest.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.720
 He's here on the second Monday at 10.30 central.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.480
 Ray Peat, very well respected around the world.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.100
 PhD, University of Oregon, specialization in physiology.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.880
 He started working on hormones back in '68, wrote his dissertation in '72.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.080
 He outlined the ideas on progesterone and hormones closely related to it.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.200
 His main thesis is that energy and structure are interdependent at every level.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 We love that.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.560
 His website is rayPeat.com and we'll tell you how to get his newsletter.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.480
 And he's here and we love talking to him because he's been around a while and so it's always

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.320
 fun to have somebody who's done a lot of research.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.040
 Dr. Peat, good morning.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.040
 Good morning.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.320
 How are things up there where you are, sir?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:33.440
 Oh, it's been raining for several days, but a pretty warm spring so everything is growing.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.960
 Dr. Ray Peat, do you think it's possible if we have cold weather blowing through, rain

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:50.920
 or chill or stress that we can create a situation where we think we have caught the flu or created

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.040
 a cold from a virus but it was really an internal combustion from things like weather changes

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040
 and stress?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.520
 Oh, for sure.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.800
 Change in atmospheric pressure causes all sorts of symptoms.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.360
 Usually it's increasing pressure that brings on the worst symptoms.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.760
 The rising oxygen tension actually is harmful when the pressure is increasing with cold

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.200
 air.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:38.840
 Cold dry air is very heavy and so it increases the atmospheric pressure.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:50.240
 Cold weather also, when you stay inside and run a heater, that raises the dryness increases,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.920
 the relative humidity decreases when you raise the temperature.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:05.680
 And so if you have a cold wave of dry air coming in and then you heat your house, you

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:16.080
 make super dry air with a high oxygen tension and that causes lung injury.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:29.680
 So your lungs are really susceptible to anything, bacteria or fungus or virus, but simply any

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.800
 stress can make those irritated lung surfaces produce symptoms.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:49.040
 Normally your lungs are the main detoxifying organ for things like circulating serotonin.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:57.680
 If your intestine is irritated because you ate some strange food, they secrete serotonin

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.280
 into the blood and it's carried to the lungs to be detoxified.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.520
 But if anything is happening in your lungs, even inflammation just from the dry air, extra

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.600
 oxygen pressure, then if your lungs fail to detoxify it, then you get all of these serotonin

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:29.760
 symptoms which can include increased coagulation in your blood.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:42.000
 For example, it's known that lung disease, colds, influenza, anything that messes up

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.640
 your lungs increases the risk of systemic coagulation and strokes even in young people.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.320
 And some of the news stories in recent weeks have said that there is this horrible new

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.840
 quality of coronavirus, young people are having strokes.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.560
 It's not at all new.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.960
 Severe cold increases the risk of a stroke.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.840
 So do I hear you saying though that we can produce symptoms, fevers, all kinds of things

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:28.680
 with the lungs because of outside influences that are not necessarily a virus or a bacteria

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.680
 that has come in from the outside and entered our being?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.680
 Right.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.160
 Just emotional stress.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.560
 And then so the body is producing these symptoms, why?

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.800
 To detox or to heal?

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:55.320
 That's the basic mechanism that when the body experiences a threat, it turns on the adrenal

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:05.280
 system, for example, the uncellular adaptive reaction system.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:16.600
 And he explains that the high cortisol lets you have super adaptive properties for a while,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:24.640
 but then if it continues too long, that high cortisol melts down your immune system, your

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.560
 thymus shrinks in a matter of hours of high cortisol.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:37.840
 And so even emotional stress that keeps your cortisol elevated for a while is melting away

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.440
 your immune system.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:51.480
 A young person with a big, juicy thymus gland, if they have a severe accident and live for

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.520
 maybe four or five hours, it's found that their thymus is gone.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.800
 Interesting.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.360
 So it's possible then that there could be many people, thousands, millions, whatever,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.200
 that are experiencing flu-like symptoms that they think they've caught a virus that just

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:18.600
 because of the fear that's instilled to them through the media, have creating symptoms.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.800
 It's possible without coming in contact with any virus.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 Not just possible, it's known.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.880
 Known.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.000
 Not just possible.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 It's known.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Yeah.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.200
 And then if you, wow, and then if you would give a test to one of these persons either

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:42.560
 before or after and it showed positive, does that mean anything?

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.520
 Yeah, that they're immune to that supposedly.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:55.280
 If you have antibodies to something, it means you've adapted to it successfully.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:05.600
 Same with blood tests for classes of antibodies that they find that you have antibodies to

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.360
 potatoes or blueberries or whatever in your blood.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.920
 They say never eat potatoes or blueberries because you have antibodies to them.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.360
 Actually it means you've adapted to them.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.360
 It's okay to eat them.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:27.480
 So these PCR antibody tests that they give to just regular people that they want to test

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.480
 everybody and this is the meme, let's test everybody.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.680
 Are they of any value whatsoever?

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.000
 Somewhat.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:47.560
 It will tell you that something like 80 or 90% of the people that might have the actual

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:54.280
 virus sitting on some membrane isn't going to get sick.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:01.200
 It shows you that the virus is harmful, harmless for the great majority of people.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.880
 So the people testing positive, you're saying could possibly be, they have an antiviral,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:16.920
 they have an antibody to, but not necessarily the COVID virus because they don't even, right?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:25.000
 The PCR test is to find the actual virus which can be present in most people without causing

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.240
 either symptoms or antibodies, but possibly the antibodies will develop.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:38.560
 But then the other tests are looking for antibodies and some of the tests that have been used

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:46.520
 have not been able to discriminate between any old standard coronavirus and the new coronavirus.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.520
 Yes, sir.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.520
 Dr. Ray Peat.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.760
 But so in mid-February when this thing kind of blew up and all of a sudden they had this

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.400
 test, let's test people, wasn't enough tests, but we're going to get more tests, and wasn't

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.600
 enough tests and people were testing positive, how would it be possible logically or from

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.040
 a virology standpoint that you could have a test that quickly that would be accurate

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.800
 to testing some virus, a new virus named corona that hasn't been around until now?

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.880
 To know the meaning of a test, you have to test the test and they didn't do that.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:27.360
 It takes a long time to know whether a test is going to tell you anything.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:38.320
 And so the test results, whether they're antibodies or PCR for the actual virus, you have to first

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.360
 establish what it means.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:50.640
 And they're just like a bunch of crazy chickens talking about numbers without having tested

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.200
 what the numbers mean.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.200
 And how long generally, Dr. Peat, would it take to have one of these test trials to make

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.200
 it really very accurate?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.480
 And what would be very accurate?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480
 70% accuracy?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.480
 80%?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:12.800
 Well, you have to test lots of healthy people and some sick people too, and then compare

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:22.000
 the differences to see if there's more antibody or more virus in the sick people than in the

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:35.040
 healthy people and develop the meaning of the test on the basis of actual results, conditions

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.880
 in the real world.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.920
 But if you only test sick people and say a certain percentage have the virus or only

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:52.560
 test healthy people, if you concentrate on the population in general, like the study

00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:04.920
 in Northern California, Jay Bhattacharyan and his group were showing that the number

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:15.240
 of infected people was low and also the mortality per infection was very low.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:25.720
 But still, they didn't test a big enough population to be certain of how many really are infected

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.400
 in that given area.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:38.560
 But he said he was getting emails from colleagues saying things like, "Jay, get with the program."

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:47.720
 And program means conforming to the opinion, the authoritative opinion.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.120
 Don't investigate and stir things up.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.640
 And if you really wanted to do, according to virology, a test, in general, how long

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:03.520
 can you theorize or the record show how long of a time frame would it take before that

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.080
 test was that we have a good one here, we have something real that's valuable?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.040
 How long?

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.040
 I would guess at least six months.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:23.840
 But meanwhile, the conditions are changing and so in principle, it's very hard to do

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:30.880
 anything scientifically meaningful when you have a virus that changes radically in three

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.720
 or four or five months.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:41.240
 And this virus, so you're saying there is a virus that is outside the body for some

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.760
 people and there's also many that are just creating symptoms from their own viral load

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.040
 or from their own microbiome.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.760
 How would you say it?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.320
 Oh yeah.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:04.960
 If you don't distinguish very precisely to know that it's a certain mutant coronavirus,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.160
 everyone is exposed to many different kinds of coronaviruses.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:20.080
 And so when you're under stress, your body might multiply and respond to some of the

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:27.200
 coronaviruses that are around you all the time or other viruses or bacteria.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:36.040
 Or you might even have similar reactions without any pathogen being identifiable.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:41.480
 And would it be fair to say that people who are afraid and fear of catching something,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.320
 possibly dying, walking six feet apart with masks and everything, that they're under

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320
 stress?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.240
 Oh, I'm sure that happens.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:16:04.360
 There was a sociologist who wrote the book about 40 years ago looking at the death rate

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.280
 according to the unemployment numbers.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:15.920
 And he saw that at that time, 40 years ago, the population was quite a bit smaller, but

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:26.640
 he saw an increase of 35,000 deaths per year for each point of increased unemployment.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:41.680
 So a five-point increase in unemployment would be very, very big, bigger than influenza.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:47.120
 So what I hear you saying is there is a lot more stress other than just the fear of getting

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.360
 something out there, but we have the highest unemployment of unemployed people in this

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.880
 country ever in the history.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.960
 So that's a whole financial, "What am I going to do?"

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.360
 stress added on to it.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:09.600
 You hear all sorts of media people saying, "We have to follow the science," but they

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.680
 don't want to talk about the science.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:22.120
 Two very common phrases you hear, medical experts say that that means one thing, that

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:27.520
 they want you to conform to conventional medical opinion.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:37.080
 And medical opinion is regulated by the state, the state boards of medical licensing.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.560
 If you don't conform too many times, you lose your license.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:52.120
 And the other favorite saying is, "Scientists believe," but the thing about science is that

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.920
 it's about testing and dissent.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:06.160
 And so if you say the dissenting researchers have been discredited because their opinion

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:15.560
 is not what medical experts say, then you're denying science itself.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.120
 Science has to be dissent-driven.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.440
 There's quite a few Docs on Record YouTube videos, you can find them, that have gone

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:33.000
 on Dr. Peat and said, "Well, we're being told to check off corona as a cause of death

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.800
 just because," just anybody that we come across, right?

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:45.640
 Yeah, in a typical month, six or seven percent of all deaths are from respiratory disease

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.960
 like flu or pneumonia.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:59.120
 And in the last report, they showed what looks like a doubling of respiratory disease associated

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:07.960
 with the diagnosis of coronavirus, but since respiratory diseases are around six or seven

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:18.720
 percent of total mortality, that month should have shown a big increase, not necessarily

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:24.840
 doubling the six percent, but a definite blip on total mortality.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:31.720
 But the CDC in their most recent report said total mortality in the U.S. is below average.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.280
 Below average?

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:43.640
 Yeah, I've been following the CDC's own reports, and not only is nothing happening, but there's

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:49.120
 a slight dip in total mortality this year.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:59.760
 And the only way you can account for that huge spike in corona-diagnosed deaths is to

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:10.880
 see that it's made up for by a spike downward in deaths from cancer, heart disease, sepsis,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.840
 and so on.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:19.880
 So if you diagnose someone that you would have put down for deaths by sepsis, heart

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:28.120
 disease, cancer, or other common things, if you decided you're not really sure what killed

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:35.680
 them, so let's say coronavirus killed them, then you have a perfectly normal total mortality,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:46.800
 but an apparent spike caused by a virus, and with all of the recognized ambiguity and absence

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:57.760
 of meaning for the definition and the tests, what you have is an epidemic of words.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.840
 An epidemic of words.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.120
 So you say that's what we're experiencing here?

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.120
 I don't see any.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.120
 Any other way?

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.120
 Yeah.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:15.120
 And it's on record that doctors who say that someone has coronavirus, I believe they receive

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:22.120
 9,000 from Medicare, and then if you put them on a ventilator, I think, what is it, 30,000?

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120
 35,000?

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:33.480
 No, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the old payment for being admitted with lung

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:44.520
 infection was around 13,000, but if it's diagnosed as COVID, that gets a 20% boost, so up to

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:56.320
 about 16,000 for diagnosing a COVID lung disease, but if you put them on a ventilator with ordinary

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:07.560
 lung disease, that goes up to around 40,000, and a 20% boost takes that up to 48,000.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:22.480
 So they're making basically $48,000 for putting someone on a ventilator until they die.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.200
 $48,000 received from the hospitals when they put somebody on a ventilator?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:36.720
 Received from both Medicare and the extra bonus from the CARES Act, the Free Money Act.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.720
 Oh, good.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.480
 Dr. Ray Petersworth is fascinating.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.800
 What do you know about the dangers of this ventilator?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.000
 We've read quite a few reports.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.040
 Have you seen some credible information that you can share?

00:22:51.040 --> 00:23:07.440
 Yeah, Luciano Garinoni, an Italian lung specialist working in Germany, has been advocating a

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:19.680
 more physiological, less dogmatic approach to treating all kinds of pneumonia-like or

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:27.720
 influenza-like lung infections, and he says in one hospital in Germany, and he didn't

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:36.680
 want to name either of the hospitals, but one good hospital was having a 60% mortality

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:46.440
 in their intensive care, and a nearby hospital that was abandoning the standard protocol

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:58.280
 of intubation had a 0% mortality following his more reasonable and physiological, non-invasive

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.280
 way of ventilating them.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.280
 Wow.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280
 Interesting.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:11.240
 And if you look at the average figures for mortality, some of the studies show an 88%

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:16.560
 at 60% wasn't an outstandingly bad hospital.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.680

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.920
 It is May 18th.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.560
 So before we start emails and have our first break, let's talk about vaccine.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.960
 We're hearing that President Trump is touting that there could be some kind of vaccine by

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.960
 the fall.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:52.360
 You know, just 100 million some kind of devices have been ordered through the military, and

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.760
 I think they want to do some kind of an oral.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.200
 Do you think it's possible, knowing everything that you have told us about this virus, this

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.760
 alleged virus, I guess is a good term, that there could be some kind of outward substance

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.800
 called a vaccine that could protect people from something that would be safe?

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.240
 I mean, I don't even know how to phrase the question, Dr. Peat.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.240
 Yeah.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:32.040
 There's no way to simply state the scientific issue because there has been no actual science

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:39.160
 involved in it for so long.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:49.560
 The media are denying simple, on-the-record published facts going back 30, 40 or more

00:25:49.560 --> 00:26:01.480
 years attempting to make flu vaccines, and they claim, the current CDC claim for effectiveness

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.720
 of a flu, last year's flu vaccine was 45% effective.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:16.600
 But if you look at the results they're talking about, it's very weird ways of arguing.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:26.400
 They don't simply look at a vaccinated population and an unvaccinated population because there

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:38.200
 have been about a dozen studies that have considered the whole health of vaccinated

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:51.160
 population versus an unvaccinated population, and those have found the people who were vaccinated

00:26:51.160 --> 00:27:05.080
 the next season developed several times as many lung infections from coronaviruses as

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:15.280
 the unvaccinated, and that has caused sort of a panic in various authoritative sources

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:18.880
 and fact-checkers and so on.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:27.160
 But you can look up those studies that the people getting flu vaccines the following

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:40.200
 year had, one study I saw was 4.4 times as many lung diseases caused by coronaviruses

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.040
 and a couple other viruses.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:52.040
 So you're making the argument that a potential for coronavaccine soon to come could be unnecessary

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.040
 and just ill-advised.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.040
 Dangerous.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.040
 Dangerous, yeah.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:04.080
 And would it be dangerous because of the adjuvants, maybe the mercury or aluminum and other things

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.560
 in there, or the actual substance that they'd be squirting into people, some kind of a virus,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.560
 small virus?

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:23.120
 Yeah, and if you look at the whole population, the availability of flu vaccines has gone

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:33.480
 from around 10 million doses per year, two years ago had a historic high of around 70

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480
 million vaccines.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480
 70, wow.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:46.640
 And then last year, again, a huge surge of I think it was 169 million people vaccinated

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:58.600
 in the US, and you'd think if it was 45% effective that this year and last year you would have

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.440
 had a very healthy population.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:14.840
 But no, the curve of influenza, lung disease, pneumonia deaths has been pretty steady over

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.640
 the last 10, 15 years.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:27.680
 If anything, a rising curve, somewhat following the number of vaccines.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:35.500
 So the whole population absolutely doesn't show it, a 45% benefit of being vaccinated.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:41.240
 So there's scientific proof to show that these flu vaccines are unnecessary and ineffective,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:46.560
 but also in many cases are causing more problems the following year.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.060
 From different viruses, yeah.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:53.280
 From different viruses, and where are these viruses coming from?

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.280
 In the body?

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.840
 Yeah, in the body and environment.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.320
 There are just millions of viruses around.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.720
 They're just everywhere.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:13.400
 Yeah, and you can look at the published papers in Nature and Science and the Standard Virus

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:19.120
 Journals going back.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:27.640
 They actually start with germ warfare research, and no one wants to talk about that.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:37.160
 For a while they were saying that the Chinese had a leak of germ warfare viruses, but then

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.520
 that was knocked down.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.520
 They don't want to talk about it at all.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:52.360
 The Fort Detrick and several other labs in the US were created solely for the purpose

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.160
 of germ warfare in the 1940s.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:06.080
 Many of our leading medical people were working in germ and chemical warfare.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:16.680
 The author of the world's most used medical textbook of physiology, Arthur C. Guyton,

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:25.640
 was a specialist in aerosolizing germs, bacteria, and viruses.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:33.800
 Some of those are known to have been tested on American populations.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:45.320
 One of the viruses he was aerosolizing was polio, and he became paralyzed by careless

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:52.800
 lab work and so went to Mississippi and became a medical professor and made up out of his

00:31:52.800 --> 00:32:05.600
 head this awful book that became the standard most used medical textbook in the world because

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:12.080
 of his origin and authority coming from the Government Association.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:24.680
 And Nixon in 1969, in response to world pressure, ordered the abolition of the germ warfare

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.560
 program and the destruction of all supplies.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:40.840
 And what happened was suddenly the viruses were being made more potent, more virulent

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.160
 as weapons.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:52.680
 Suddenly they discovered that there might be someone violating the international rules

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.120
 and making these weapons, and so they kept producing them.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:08.400
 They were ordered to stop making weapons, so they said, "Now these weaponizable viruses

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:13.160
 have to be made so we can make a vaccine against them."

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:21.600
 That started right in 1969 when Nixon canceled the war program.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:29.520
 And ever since then, they have been designing more and more virulent viruses, and the coronavirus

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.080
 was pretty much their favorite.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:44.840
 They created anthrax and Ebola, a lot of other potential weapons, but always with the excuse

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:53.480
 that we're designing defensive vaccines against these potential weapons.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:34:05.440
 But continuing exactly the gain-of-function type of research, making chimera mixes of

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:15.160
 different types of virus to escape known immune defenses.

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:27.120
 But in all of these 40 years of explicitly designing horrible disease-causing viruses

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:33.640
 so they could make vaccines, they have never succeeded in making a vaccine that worked

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.040
 against them.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:40.320
 Never succeeded in making a vaccine that worked against them.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:49.280
 So why would we expect to have one suddenly, historically unique event by next fall?

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.280
 Next fall.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280
 Why, indeed.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280
 Why, indeed.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.680
 Dr. Ray Peat, Ph.D., what do you think?

00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.600
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 Quick break, then we're going to get to all of your emails, and we always have lots of

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.840
 them and we do the best we can.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.600
 Here's a great product, previously with our friend Brandon Amelani of Shen Blossom.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.520
 A good example of this also is the Hoshu Wu formula.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.840
 That is a new one that came out.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.440
 It's really good because it's a blood builder.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.160
 A lot of people don't understand that Hoshu Wu is actually toxic if it's not prepared

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.160
 correctly.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.440
 So I wanted to come out with one that not only features the Hoshu Wu as the king herb

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.040
 in the formula, but it's prepared at a minimum of 14 days.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:33.160
 Usually we try and get 20, 21 days of cooking it.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.800
 So you can think of it as like it's in a slow cooker with black beans.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.640
 It's basically just cooking down and deactivating some of those liver toxic compounds.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:47.000
 So we do use that as the bulk of the formula, but we basically put a lot of mature ginseng

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.760
 root in our root extract.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.200
 We have the fermented and hydrolyzed pearl powder, reishi stem, and it's got shu di

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.360
 hong, which is like a ramania type family.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.080
 We have both the prepared warm stuff and then the cool stuff to kind of balance it out in

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.760
 a sense so it doesn't become sticky.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:04.400
 If you get a good quality Hoshu Wu that's properly prepared, it definitely has some

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:09.600
 invigorating qualities to it and makes you feel relaxed, but yet fully vigorous and energized.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.520
 Now that's the kind of Hoshu Wu that you would like, right?

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.000
 Really nice products as you can hear.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.520

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:31.120
 Years ago I recall David Wolf suggesting that all foods, superfoods actually just gives

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.080
 our body inflammation.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.480
 This came out last time we talked with Daniel Vitalis about colostrum.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.120
 I imagine people being born with an unformatted immune system and colostrum helps to format

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.720
 that, helps your body recognize viral and bacterial invaders early, and it also helps

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.400
 to restore and heal the lining of the gut that's damaged in so many people and one of

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.900
 the sources of inflammation and low immunity.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.600
 So it restores that gut lining at the same time that it educates the immune system on

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.440
 how to better fight off pathogens that get into our bodies.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.360
 And it's pretty cool too, I think, because moms can put it in the smoothies quite easily

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.040
 for the kids and it's yummy and they get some good stuff.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.060
 Yeah, it's really great to blend into smoothies.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.440
 You can make chocolates with it.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.120
 You can put it into anything that you're cooking.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.760
 And so it's easy to get into your kids and into other family members.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.620
 It tastes great and it's actually very versatile in the kitchen so you can use it in place

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.880
 of a lot of other products.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.760
 Yes, and it's very tasty and fun and easy to use.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.760
 Sometimes just late at night you can take warm water with colostrum in there before

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.100
 bed and it's a great product, a lot of benefits.

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.420
 We're with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:41.180
 He's a PhD and he's been around for a long time doing this kind of research.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.540
 And so thanks for coming on once a month, Dr. Peat.

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:49.140
 Got a lot of fans, got a lot of fans around the world that listen to the show.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:57.720
 So before we move on to some questions, so let's talk about just vaccines.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:04.260
 So this whole germ theory of Pasteur, did it start the vaccine idea?

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:20.820
 It somewhat advanced the idea, but I think the real motor for it was Paul Ehrlich and

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:33.860
 his specific drugs that were designed, silver bullets, the concept of a silver bullet chemical.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:45.540
 It blended in with the idea of antibodies that were the body's silver bullets.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:53.700
 And that created right from Ehrlich's time, the drug companies naturally were pushing

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.740
 their silver bullet chemicals.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:06.820
 But that ideologically blended in with the idea that antibodies were silver bullets.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:17.620
 And so the study of the immune system focused all during the last century on the idea that

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.940
 antibodies were the secret to immunity.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:33.420
 There were I guess about four Nobel Prizes between 1960 and 2000 given for good work

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:45.220
 on the protein structure of antibodies, but it was misleading because the immune system

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:53.900
 was being misunderstood because of the emphasis on that particular protein where really there

00:40:53.900 --> 00:41:00.460
 are a thousand other more important things than antibodies.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.420
 And the antibody specificity can go either way.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:15.540
 It can make a problem worse by intensifying inflammation as well as take down a potential

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:16.540
 toxin.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.340
 And who was Paul Ehrlich?

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:29.020
 Paul Ehrlich, he shared the Nobel Prize of, I think it was 1908, with Metchnikoff, who

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:39.300
 was an embryologist who emphasized the cell phagocyte part of the immune system rather

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:45.860
 than the chemical specific silver bullet part.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:42:04.140
 And the embryology based picture of the immune system was ridiculed by the chemical cartels

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.500
 all through the 20th century.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:16.820
 And two people started, mostly two people started, proposing a radical alternative for

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:27.380
 interpreting the immune system that went back to Metchnikoff's recognition that cells and

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:36.140
 embryological development, the very structure of our being, were part of the immune system.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:49.780
 Our whole being is involved in immunity and resistance all the way from energy, the oxidative

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:58.900
 energy of each cell leading to changes in function at all levels.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:06.100
 You can't say there's any one thing that is our immune system.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:15.100
 So the idea of the immune system has been changing in a kind of underground way.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:29.620
 Polly Matsinger works at the NIH now and she has been changing some of the terms that are

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:34.940
 now in the mainstream as danger recognition.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:48.380
 An English doctor, Jamie Cunliffe, calls it damage recognition system rather than danger.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:59.740
 Polly Matsinger is a little closer to the Ehrlich antibody silver bullet by saying that

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.940
 we have a system to recognize danger.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:16.540
 But I think Cunliffe is closer to the Metchnikoff interpretation that our whole being is involved

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:28.460
 and when we sense damage to our intrinsic nature, that's what we're reacting to and

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:37.100
 what they called the immune system, he calls it the disorder repair system, something like

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.100
 that.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:48.620
 So, I hear, so is the entire vaccine phenomena, I went back all the way to polio and all that,

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:56.580
 based on antibodies and it's still today, even measles, mumps, all these things, based

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:03.580
 on the antibody idea which is just a very small part of the immune system.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:16.100
 Dr. Ray Peat, wow, what's a mother to do?

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:21.580
 Can you imagine moms, what they're being told?

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:36.060
 Yeah, the official story isn't even believed by the insiders.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:47.740
 In December, the chief scientist of the World Health Organization was on international television

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:54.020
 telling the public that vaccines have been studied scientifically and they are perfectly

00:45:54.020 --> 00:46:05.180
 safe and then just five days later, someone leaked a video from the global summit meeting

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:13.540
 on vaccine safety and in that meeting, she was saying that the public is less and less

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:28.900
 trusting of what we say because of our obfuscation when they ask about the deaths caused by vaccines.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:40.340
 So one of the main concerns was that doctors were stopping their belief in vaccines and

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:51.180
 they weren't vaccinating their children, their own family and she said that's a real menace

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:58.020
 if our frontline becomes skeptical.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:06.260
 So people like Dale Bigtree and Robert Kennedy Jr. conjecture that there's never been a real,

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:13.700
 authentic, viable test proving that vaccines are safe and effective.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:14.700
 Is that true?

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.220
 Oh, absolutely true.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:29.340
 The Congress ordered NIH or Health and Human Services to report back to Congress every

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:41.380
 two years at least on studies of safety because Congress had given absolute immunity to the

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:50.020
 drug companies to produce vaccines without being sued for the damages and since there

00:47:50.020 --> 00:48:02.980
 was no financial motive to make them do safety studies, they ordered HHS to do the studies

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:12.900
 and report every two years and the Bigtree-Kennedy lawsuit when they wouldn't deliver under freedom

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:20.220
 of information, they wouldn't deliver the documents.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:28.260
 Finally when they were sued, they said no such documents can be found.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:37.220
 They simply ignored Congress for 30 years refusing to do studies because they knew that

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:42.620
 it was impossible to prove the safety of the tests.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:52.900
 All of the data showed that certain vaccines are less harmful than others but some of them

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:58.180
 are just terribly dangerous.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:08.980
 They know that they see the figures and there's a government agency that under pressure will

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:20.860
 acknowledge maybe about 1% of the actual injured patients will get compensation from the government

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:31.740
 for the deaths and paralysis but the definition that makes it possible to get compensation

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:41.500
 is that the death or paralysis or whatever has to be recognized and diagnosed within

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:46.980
 a time limit, 5 days, 15 days.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:58.340
 So if you die on the 16th day, you can't be compensated.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:07.460
 Despite all of that, they have paid out $4 billion to injured patients but it would be

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:14.620
 maybe 100 times greater if they didn't have those time limits.

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:25.820
 The government lists the injuries that they are bound to compensate for and that list

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:38.020
 of injuries that they are compensating with fairly paltry amounts of money coincides with

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:47.100
 the package insert label, the list of side effects published by the pharmaceutical companies

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:54.060
 matches the conditions that the government is paying for.

00:50:54.060 --> 00:51:03.300
 So if the doctor [inaudible] for the vaccine, if the patient knew that death and paralysis

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:15.900
 and brain damage and dementia, etc. were known recognized side effects, how many people would

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.060
 let their kids be vaccinated?

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.060
 Fascinating.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:23.100
 So there is, I wonder, wasn't that in 1986?

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:27.540
 Was that the immunity law during Reagan or '86?

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:31.820
 That was when the immunity was given to the drug industry.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:39.580
 So I wonder why there's even that many billions given out kind of under the table.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:51.420
 Well it's some little recognition of justice but meanwhile they're doing their best to

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:58.940
 not let people know that there is that system even.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:04.260
 Most doctors haven't heard of that system of compensations.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:10.620
 Most doctors don't read the package inserts and so they keep giving vaccines.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:18.500
 Dr. Ray Peat, PhD, Patrick Timpone, it's oneradionetwork.com.

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:24.260
 You can check out his website, rayPeat.com and we always have a link and it'll take you

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:31.660
 right to Dr. Peat and you can get his newsletter, it comes out every couple of months.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:35.820
 So well it's been really interesting talking about this.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:40.320
 Let's dig in, if you will, sir, to a few of the emails in the time we have remaining.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.180
 We always have so many for you.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:43.180
 This is from Thomas.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:47.600
 He says, "I finally took the dive and managed to get my hands on some desiccated thyroid

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600
 out of Thailand.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.740
 I do feel better after a couple of months of slowly upping the dose.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:59.620
 I'm just wondering what Mr. Peat thinks about the best way to dose throughout the day.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:04.260
 I always take it first thing in the morning and then a second time around noon or a few

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.480
 hours later.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.820
 Is taking it twice better than just doing it once a day or on an empty stomach?

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:11.820
 Any ideas?

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.260
 I would appreciate it."

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:21.300
 With desiccated thyroid, it really doesn't make very much difference because it has no

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:25.300
 hormone action until it's been digested.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:34.380
 So if you eat it with food, it's going to slowly release the hormone all during the

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:41.100
 passage of that food through your small intestine.

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:51.100
 Ideally, twice a day theoretically could be better, but in practice, once a day is fine

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.140
 with desiccated thyroid.

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:58.620
 So is that still folks are going to do some of the piggy thyroid?

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:02.900
 That's still the best to get a desiccated thyroid where you have the T3, T4 and all

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.700
 that right in there?

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:05.700
 I think so.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:14.420
 It has a lot of other things that are plausible benefits.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:26.580
 For example, the American brands, when the armor companies sold their product name, the

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:36.540
 new companies started removing components such as thyrocalcitonin to sell separately

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:41.180
 and that was always part of the traditional thyroid.

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:51.540
 And so the stuff from Thailand is more likely to be the full natural material coming out

00:54:51.540 --> 00:55:01.620
 of the animal and so it could be more beneficial than a selected purified material.

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:12.260
 But even the synthetics that imitate that balance of T4 and T3, those are almost always

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.420
 completely therapeutic.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:22.300
 Is there a way to use either one of the Thailand or the synthetic to work with your thyroid

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:26.180
 to get it happy again so you can get off of them?

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:34.540
 The traditional method that developed over several decades of practical use was to start

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:46.860
 with about 30 milligrams for a month watching for its effect and Broda Barnes found that

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:54.220
 the temperature when you wake up is a good way to watch the daily progression of a given

00:55:54.220 --> 00:56:04.540
 dose and then after maybe six or eight weeks, if the symptoms weren't gone, he would double

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:11.940
 the dose and over a period of five or six months, usually he would settle in for most

00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:18.540
 people around 120 milligrams or two grains.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.100
 But once you're on there, are you there forever?

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:31.460
 No, in fact, I tested on myself after reading experiments on rats and I found that my requirement

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:41.460
 in winter months was about two grains a day, but in the spring, I became slightly hyperthyroid

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:47.420
 on that dose and found that my summer dose was around half a grain.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:50.620
 Half a grain is 30 milligrams, right?

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:55.980
 So when you say symptoms, were you going by your temperature or you could just feel, is

00:56:55.980 --> 00:57:00.740
 a general observation, you get a little just antsy with too much?

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:09.580
 Yeah, I went mostly by my pulse rate, but if I didn't drop the dose in the spring, I

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:15.580
 would start getting out of breath just getting up to answer the telephone, which is a sign

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.580
 of hyperthyroidism.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:23.140
 Oh, hyper, yeah, that'd be a sign of hyper.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:30.620
 Here is Thea, she wants to know, "How can I get the most benefit of using progesterone

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:37.540
 properly if using Progest-E daily, rubbing on gums, is it still beneficial to skip maybe

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:44.580
 seven to 14 days a month or is that only if ingesting it?"

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:50.700
 Oh, and would it be the same for a male, she is also asking.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:58:01.380
 The liver, the reason a woman cycles two weeks on and two weeks off is partly that the liver

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:10.700
 is designed so that it maintains homeostasis, meaning that when something rises above average,

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:20.980
 it increases its excretory enzymes, makes it leave the body in the bile and urine.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:30.020
 And so when you have this big surge after ovulation of progesterone, it's extremely

00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:38.620
 effective the first week and then this liver increases its enzymes, its effectiveness drops

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:50.140
 off gradually and if you get pregnant, then the signals keep increasing so your progesterone

00:58:50.140 --> 00:59:00.180
 production rises steadily until the last week of pregnancy and the liver never gets ahead

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:08.740
 to lower this huge production of progesterone, always keeps your serum level ahead of your

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.260
 liver.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:18.860
 But if you're not pregnant and keep taking without the interruption, then your liver

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:24.380
 starts becoming so efficient that after two or three months, you can hardly feel the effect

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.980
 of the same dose of progesterone.

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:35.820
 So just to keep for economy so that you're sensitive to moderate doses, it's good to

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.340
 lay off for a week or two every month.

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.340
 Here's an email from Dustin.

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.680
 He's in Nashville, Tennessee this morning.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:48.220
 He says, "Beyond regular proper dosages of thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone and obviously

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:55.700
 a good PUFA-free diet, what would Dr. Peat recommend as the best regimen for retaining the elasticity

00:59:55.700 --> 01:00:03.700
 and the healing of scars, especially those past 50 and looking my best?"

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:20.740
 One of the factors that creates stiffness and specific loss of structural elasticity

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:31.820
 combined with stiffness, so basically it's a brittleizing effect of stress.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:42.020
 The system that drives that is mainly, it involves estrogen and cortisol, but the central

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:50.220
 factor is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:58.820
 Estrogen is the opposing hormone to progesterone.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:06.540
 The natural level of progesterone is one of the things that keeps your tissue firm, proper

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:11.620
 bulk and elastic.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:21.340
 So simply the absence of progesterone or excessive estrogen will turn on this angiotensin-aldosterone

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:31.620
 system and tend to weaken tissue so that you are more susceptible to aneurysms, bulging

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:46.420
 arteries, varicose veins, general weakening of tissues become easier to break from a scuff.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:58.700
 You can get more serious injury from light percussion and such.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:11.940
 The strengthening part is partly opposing those, keeping them down, and the things that

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:27.700
 most strongly keep down your aldosterone system are vitamin D, zinc, all of the growth protein

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:38.340
 anabolic things such as vitamin A, balance of calcium and phosphate.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:47.420
 Calcium works with vitamin D to hold down your aldosterone, which is the major brittleizing

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.420
 hormone.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.420
 Brittleizing hormone.

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:59.820
 So, are there any foods that keep the progesterone level nice and the aldosterone down dietary

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.100
 wise?

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.780
 Eggs and zinc and milk.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.180
 Eggs and zinc and milk.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.460
 For example, stretch marks.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:18.740
 I had a young cousin who was about six months pregnant and she showed me her belly had these

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:32.380
 like purple lightning streak patterns, half an inch wide and brilliant color with a zigzag

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:47.420
 shiny pattern and it was just the most vivid stretch marks I'd ever seen and I suggested

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:56.780
 eggs, milk, and oysters, which she ate for two or three days.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.140
 I think it was just about three days later she came back and showed me her belly, no

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.620
 marks at all.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:03.620
 Isn't that interesting?

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:11.100
 It was just amazing how her belly was meanwhile getting bigger but the stretch marks had absolutely

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.100
 disappeared.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.100
 Fascinating.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:19.980
 Isn't oysters also been touted to help men keep testosterone levels up?

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.980
 Oysters?

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.740
 Oh, sure.

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.780
 That's part of keeping cortisol and aldosterone down.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.300
 I see.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.900
 It tamps them down so the T levels can stay good.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.900
 Here is Matthew.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:40.740
 My question for Dr. Peat, can aspirin be taken together with Losartan?

01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:45.980
 I'm currently on 50 milligrams of Losartan.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:50.180
 I want to know how much aspirin I can take.

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:56.620
 There have been a lot of publications on that warning against the aspirin but I think the

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:01.900
 conclusion is, yeah, they're perfectly compatible.

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.820
 Why would we want to take aspirin?

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.740
 Is it okay?

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:18.060
 For example, for the coronavirus, those happen to be both confirmed effective protections

01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:23.580
 against the symptoms of the corona infection.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.580
 Good old aspirin.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:30.340
 Can you actually get just pure aspirin these days or they all have extra curricular activities

01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.340
 in them?

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:35.860
 No, the cheap kind is generally the best.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:45.860
 It's called Aspirin USP and it doesn't matter whether it's sold by a veterinary supply store.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.140
 It's about $15 per pound.

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.140
 A pound.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:56.820
 Can Dr. Peat elaborate on the mechanism of action of adaptogenic herbs or are they estrogenic?

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.260
 Is it safe to use example ginseng or Korean ginseng?

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:11.980
 Yeah, a lot of studies found that there are steroids analogous to but not exactly the

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:24.060
 same as testosterone and pregnenolone, the stabilizing steroids that protect against

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.060
 cortisol.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:33.980
 But I think it's safer to use pregnenolone if you can find a safe and pure form.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.300
 Pregnenolone.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.020
 Oh, more emails here.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.020
 Got lots of them.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:49.700
 Patrick Timpani along with Dr. Ray Peat.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:55.860
 Sorry, my little mouse is not cooperating.

01:06:55.860 --> 01:07:00.020
 Oh, here you go.

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:09.460
 What does it mean from Stefan, what does it mean when a woman bleeds during ovulation?

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.780
 Is it a progesterone issue?

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.820
 To some extent, yeah.

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:27.060
 The surge of estrogen, its effect is to break down the lining of the uterus and that's

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.220
 opposed by progesterone.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:41.540
 So usually the people who have what they call breakthrough bleeding, it can come anytime

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:45.020
 for example after a woman gets pregnant.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:54.420
 If she was having those ovulation bleeds, she's likely to have a monthly loss of blood

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:58.780
 even into the fifth month of pregnancy.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:11.660
 And that goes with all of the signs of progesterone deficiency, increased risk of preeclampsia

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:20.500
 or premature birth or all kinds of complications of pregnancy resulting from the bad balance

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:24.820
 of progesterone and estrogen.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:25.820
 One of your specialties, right?

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.820
 Yeah.

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:30.180
 I've been studying that a long time.

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:35.980
 Julie wants to know what you think, Doc, about intermittent fasting and a ketogenic diet

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:44.180
 for reversing type 2 diabetes.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:51.140
 I think the so-called ketogenic diet is always stressful.

01:08:51.140 --> 01:09:00.700
 Diabetes itself tends to turn on the stress ketogenic factors.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:14.940
 The body senses a lack of glucose in diabetes and that turns on stress metabolism and lactic

01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:24.100
 acid tends to rise showing that glucose is actually being used although the body feels

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:36.740
 that it is deficient in glucose so it starts turning muscles to glucose and that happens

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.740
 in the ketogenic diet.

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:48.940
 The cortisol increases when glucose is low and the cortisol converts muscle to glucose

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:58.700
 at the same time that you're drawing fats out of storage or eating fats.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:12.260
 So the fact that your diet is ketogenic means that your cortisol is bound to be having too

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:20.100
 much influence and that is one of the things that shrinks your thymus and other parts of

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:25.060
 your so-called immune system.

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.080
 Would you please ask Dr. Peat to talk more about pregnenolone.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.460
 Can it be used to reduce estrogen dominance in the body?

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:39.420
 Is there any change that pregnenolone would be converted to estrogen instead of progesterone

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:43.940
 and testosterone?

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:53.780
 The quantity of a hormone that is powerfully active in rat experiments and in experiments

01:10:53.780 --> 01:11:02.220
 I did on myself with the rats, they gave I think it was 10 grams of pregnenolone in a

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:10.500
 single dose, enough to stretch its stomach so it couldn't eat anything for hours, but

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:15.780
 they didn't see any hormonal effects in most of the rats.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:24.380
 But if the rat was stressed and having high glucocorticoid before the pregnenolone, they

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.980
 were normalized.

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:37.660
 So the only change was beneficial stopping of the stress reaction.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:50.540
 I found that 4,000 milligrams a day didn't have any harmful effect, simply felt about

01:11:50.540 --> 01:12:00.420
 the same as 100 milligrams a day.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:07.660
 Because in the rats, it's effect when you have a slight excess of pregnenolone is to

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:12.140
 lower your cortisol to normal.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:19.820
 An elevated cortisol is one of the things that increases estrogen.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:26.220
 And so when you're blocking the stress reaction with an abundance of pregnenolone, you're

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:39.460
 turning off the need for these other stress hormones and where a human body will make

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:48.980
 on the order of 30 to 50 milligrams a day of pregnenolone and progesterone and five

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:58.780
 milligrams of testosterone and probably around 50 milligrams of DHEA.

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:15.820
 The daily dose produced in the body of estrogen is on the order of a small fraction of a microgram.

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:21.340
 One microgram per day is an effective estrogenic dose.

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:34.220
 So the quantity of these precursor hormones, if they're adequate, they tend to turn off

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:39.220
 these microscopic downstream hormones.

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:51.100
 So you will never have an increased conversion to estrogen or cortisol from an excess of

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:53.100
 pregnenolone or progesterone.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.100
 Okay.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:58.780
 Dr. Ray P., Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:05.100
 So much has talked about oxidation and this cool thing with this new technology that we're

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.100
 working on.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:09.260
 And we have a 20% deal on this machine too, if you're interested.

01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:15.060
 Previously with the highly credentialed Dr. Thomas Levy, he argues because the literature

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.460
 shows that oxidation is the cause of disease.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:28.420
 But the whole point is the location, the concentration, the duration, the distribution of oxidized

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:34.340
 biomolecules determines 100% of all diseases.

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:38.820
 And so that's why I say oxidative stress doesn't cause disease.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.900
 Oxidation is disease.

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:44.780
 If there's no oxidized biomolecules, you don't have a toxin.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:49.820
 The toxic effect is oxidation of biomolecules.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.820
 That's the entirety of it.

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:56.380
 And by the grace of God, several months ago, George Wiseman said this about hydrogen.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:01.620
 Hydrogen is the world's best antioxidant by a long shot.

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:07.700
 First of all, it's 700 times smaller than something like CoQ10, 400 times smaller than

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.300
 vitamin C, things like that.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:14.180
 So it can literally go, the hydrogen molecule can literally go through everything in your

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:17.280
 body and go right into the very DNA and repair it.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.900
 So now it makes sense why George was able to say this back in August 2019 with such

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:25.140
 conviction.

01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:32.140
 The body accepts that gas and uses it to heal everything.

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.040
 It's like the fountain of youth.

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.020
 It's astonishing the amount of ailments.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:41.180
 In fact, in scientific studies, and they have over a thousand scientific studies now, they

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:45.780
 are showing that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly from virtually

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.900
 every ailment that ails any water-based life form.

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:49.900
 Okay, I'm sold.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:53.940
 And I was able to get one a couple of months ago, thanks to your support.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.100
 It's called the Aquacure Hydrogen Machine.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.340
 Breathe the gas and bubble the water.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.940
 There's a promo code 1Radio for 10% discount.

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.940
 Let's just stop right there and tell you it's 20%.

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.140
 George sprung that on us last week.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.660
 A 20% deal for another seven days or so, and that's it.

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:16.980
 So if you've been thinking about getting one, it's a lifetime warranty, so it'll be a lifetime

01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.300
 investment.

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.780
 One year, no questions asked.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:24.060
 30-back warranty and very interesting technology.

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:29.780
 This machine produces Brown's gas as well as molecular hydrogen.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:35.100
 You can go to the molecularhydrogeninstitute.com or is it .org?

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:36.220
 One of those, you'll see it.

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:43.340
 Google it up and look on studies, and you'll see hundreds and hundreds of studies, peer-reviewed

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:50.100
 studies on the benefits of Brown's gas and hydrogen, and it all involves oxidation.

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:52.460
 Almost every one of these studies, they talk about oxidation.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:54.440
 So there's something real here.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:17:01.420

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:26.100
 We're honored to have Dr. Ray Peat, PhD, on our show, and he's here the second or third,

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:35.620
 it'll be the third Monday of each month at 1030 Central Time.

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:39.740
 This one here, I wanted to see if I can, this is Lindsay.

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:42.700
 I'm sorry, did I lose Lindsay?

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:48.420
 She had a thing about, she's going to have babies in, oh, here she is.

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.340
 She's going to have babies in two years or so.

01:17:51.340 --> 01:18:02.460
 Wants to know how she can balance things out with her progesterone and regulate progesterone

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:08.700
 hormone for better health and prepare for a child in a couple of years.

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:16.380
 She is also, oh, another one, bleeding during ovulation.

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:27.980
 The thyroid is most often the problem hormone in causing pregnancy problems.

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:34.820
 So you want to check your temperature and pulse rate and maybe have a blood test to

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:43.060
 make sure that your TSH level isn't elevated.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:52.220
 The TSH itself is really a sign of some problems, so the higher it is, the less likely you are

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.940
 to have a successful pregnancy.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:19:04.940
 There have been several publications that are showing a direct link between increased

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:12.740
 TSH even within the so-called normal range and pregnancy problems.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:20.180
 Part of keeping that normal is to have adequate protein every day, not too much phosphate,

01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:30.580
 meat and beans and nuts happen to be extremely high in phosphate relative to calcium.

01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:37.980
 The high phosphate turns on your parathyroid hormone and the aldosterone, so it's bad for

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:44.020
 all of your tissues and increases cancer risk and so on.

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:51.380
 Calcium should be high relative to the phosphate.

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.420
 Vitamin D and calcium work together.

01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:02.580
 Adequate vitamin A works with the thyroid hormone to have an anabolic effect on your

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:12.740
 protein tissues, the thymus gland among others, keeping your muscles well-developed as part

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:18.140
 of keeping your endocrine system in balance.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:23.540
 So one enough protein, but the meat, beans and what else?

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:32.220
 Meat, beans and fish have high phosphate, which is a little counterintuitive there.

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:41.740
 The phosphate, it just happens that those are very low in calcium content.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:49.340
 The foods that are highest have the best ratio of calcium to phosphate are cheese, milk and

01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:59.420
 for an extreme high calcium ratio, well-cooked greens are the richest in calcium and magnesium

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:02.180
 relative to phosphate.

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:09.380
 So when the phosphate gets too high with the beans, fish and meat, that's a problem for

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.420
 almost everybody, right, if you have too much of those?

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:22.020
 Yeah, Americans in general, but when you look at the figures, the higher the phosphate is,

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:29.860
 when it gets to be five, six or seven times as high as the calcium, that leads to long-term

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:34.460
 problems like osteoporosis and inflammatory diseases.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:41.380
 On the TSH, you had mentioned the normal levels, we can't go by those, but so what would be

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:47.980
 a good TSH level after all these years of talking about thyroid that would say, "Well,

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.620
 everything's pretty good there with the thyroid."

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.420
 What level would that be?

01:21:51.420 --> 01:22:00.060
 When people have done large-scale surveys and looked at the incidence of thyroid cancer

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:10.900
 over the years, they have found that if your TSH is below 0.4, there's no thyroid cancer.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:14.660
 0.4, well, that's a low one, man.

01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.260
 That's really way down there.

01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:22.540
 So would you keep taking, if you wanted to test, just to be real geeky about it, Dr.

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:28.660
 Peat, would you keep testing if you're taking some kind of a piggy thyroid desiccated to

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.580
 get down that low?

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.780
 I think it would be worthwhile.

01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.660
 I go entirely by my pulse and temperature.

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.020
 Your pulse, yeah.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:50.220
 But when I see people's results, if their TSH is as high as even 1.0, they always have

01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:53.540
 some hormone-related problem.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:23:05.980
 And 2 is where everyone I see with 2.0, even they have fairly significant hormone problems

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.740
 by the time they're in their 30s.

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.900
 My goodness.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.380
 Stefan wants to know, "Would there be any benefits to introducing sourdough starter

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.820
 to the dough from making flour tortillas?"

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:23.700
 Oh, yeah.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:31.900
 I don't know how a sourdough flour tortilla would turn out.

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.540
 You lose gluten with the starter.

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:42.340
 And so I think it might be hard to make something resembling a tortilla.

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:55.100
 But anyway, flour tortillas are essentially unleavened wheat and studies have shown, for

01:23:55.100 --> 01:24:05.020
 example, in Egypt, they've seen dwarfism associated with people eating a lot of unleavened

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:06.020
 wheat bread.

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:15.380
 I got some of that next to my, you know, the one you talked about from that company, the

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.140
 grits, right, the corn grits.

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.180
 Is there any protein in corn?

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.500
 A little, yeah.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:23.500
 Not too much?

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:24.500
 Not very much.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.780
 But is it pretty good food in general?

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:38.500
 Yeah, as long as they get some protein and other nutrients.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:49.380
 You can't live on tortillas and beans healthfully, but people who eat mixed-molized tortillas

01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:56.700
 as a regular part of their diet usually are very healthy if they have mixed other foods

01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:00.980
 with it, partly because of the high calcium content.

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:06.380
 High calcium, so they are milk, cheese, greens.

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.460
 How about eggs?

01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:09.460
 Not very good.

01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:19.100
 They're somewhat excessive for phosphate, but of course, the protein and seafood, you're

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.060
 getting the trace minerals.

01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:28.500
 So it's good to have seafood once a week and eggs every day.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:38.380
 The mixed-molized corn is another source of calcium in the diet.

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:42.380
 So this is Nessa, and I'll try to see if I can get through this.

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:48.020
 It's kind of long, and let's see if I can edit down a little bit, if you can keep your

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:49.980
 emails as short as possible.

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:59.180
 She had TSH 9.7, put her on Armour 30 mg after seven weeks, went down 1.93, had a doc change

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:07.900
 her to Lavoxer Thyroxine, level, however you say that, 5 mg.

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:16.100
 Been reading the Rhoda Barnes book, and she asked her doc to change her back to Armour

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:20.500
 instead of the 30 and to 60.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:24.980
 She suggested I would be able to convert the T4 to T3 as needed, and would you agree with

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:25.980
 this?

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:30.820
 I do have MS, and it seems the Armour was helping me with morning muscle spasms that

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:32.940
 I was experiencing.

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.780
 What was her TSH when she...

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:41.540
 1.93 after being on the Armour 30 mg for seven weeks.

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:48.180
 I think it should still be lower, but that's a tremendous improvement.

01:26:48.180 --> 01:27:00.820
 I would guess that having a chronic TSH as high as 9.0 would be a major factor in what

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.020
 was diagnosed as MS.

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:04.020
 Sure.

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:05.020
 Wow.

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:13.500
 One of the things that you almost always see with a good thyroid correction is the muscle

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500
 cramps.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:21.580
 The first few days while you're adjusting, you need to make sure your diet is very high

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:24.460
 in calcium and magnesium.

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:32.380
 So a lot of milk while you're adapting to increasing thyroid dose will prevent muscle

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:42.380
 cramps, but basically thyroid is one of the nerve muscle protecting hormones, absolutely

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:43.380
 essential.

01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:48.940
 Beth wants to know from Dr. Ray Peat, do you think the 5G or glyphosates have anything

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:52.100
 to do with this whole coronavirus thing?

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.580
 Oh, sure.

01:27:53.580 --> 01:28:05.260
 Each of them is known to be biologically harmful and our whole system is part of our resistance

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:06.260
 and immunity.

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:18.500
 And so if you do anything crazy like sit in an electromagnetic field of any measurable

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:27.940
 intensity, even running an electric sewing machine for 20 years, they found a tremendous

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:35.180
 increase in dementia associated with just that moderate field.

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:41.700
 But the fields from these communication devices can be many times more intense.

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.780
 Very challenging.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:48.100
 So anything with the motor, really, we get some magnetic fields, don't we?

01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:50.100
 Anything with the motor, yeah.

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:56.100
 Dr. Peat, do you know, this is great, how much thyroid medication one can get out of

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.420
 one slaughtered pig?

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:07.900
 Oh, the gland is about as big as a human gland in proportion, maybe an ounce or so.

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:22.340
 And measuring in grains or grams, the standard pill was based on the fresh gland because

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:28.980
 for the first 10 or 20 years, they prescribed the uncooked gland.

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:43.020
 They would give usually four grains or 250 milligrams roughly as a replacement dose.

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:56.020
 And so when they started making dehydrated tablets, they added usually lactose to extend

01:29:56.020 --> 01:30:02.420
 the powdered gland, which they called 3X as a pure powder.

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:13.860
 And then they would dilute it, increasing the weight threefold so that 1X was the potency

01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:22.580
 of the finished pill, which was equivalent in weight to the natural wet thyroid tissue.

01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:35.060
 And so if you think of a 30-gram gland, each gram contains about 15 grains.

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:45.140
 So you can get 120 doses of more or less replacement dose from a single gland.

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:50.220
 Do you think when people ate more of a natural, I guess on the farm and stuff, or chickens

01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:54.740
 that we used to get some kind of a thyroid in there, didn't we, with the chickens, chicken

01:30:54.740 --> 01:30:55.740
 necks?

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:56.740
 Yeah, yeah.

01:30:56.740 --> 01:31:05.380
 I used to find even at the Safeway supermarket a pound of chicken necks, two or three of

01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:13.020
 them, they would have left the gland, thyroid gland under the skin, even though it was illegal

01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:21.860
 starting in the 1940s, the government required that it be removed and sold to the drug companies.

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:29.780
 On the farm, they would almost never bother removing the gland.

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:32.500
 So it goes in the soup or fried chicken.

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:42.420
 A guy I knew who worked on a farm said on Fridays that was their fried chicken day.

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:50.420
 And he always asked for the necks, would he eat four or five necks for lunch?

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:56.700
 And he said he'd always noticed that on Friday afternoons he was constantly overheated

01:31:56.700 --> 01:32:03.820
 and sweating because he was eating like 15 grains of thyroid for lunch.

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.380
 Isn't that interesting?

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:06.380
 Wow.

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:11.300
 Yeah, you would think if you had a live thyroid that you could, you'd feel that, wouldn't

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:12.300
 you?

01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:16.620
 I mean, you'd eat a whole one or something like that.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:24.140
 Yeah, and they aren't as toxic as the government warned.

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:32.420
 If that guy was on average, if half of the neck still had the gland in it, each one might

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:35.540
 weigh one gram.

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:39.380
 That would be 30 grains for lunch.

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:50.020
 And a friend of mine had her thyroid powder in a plastic bag and her cat, she had about

01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:53.420
 30 grains of thyroid in the bag.

01:32:53.420 --> 01:33:00.780
 And her cat found it and tore the bag open and ate it all.

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:07.140
 She said he was sitting there with a very fast heartbeat, smiling.

01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.340
 Hey guys.

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:10.340
 You're a great show.

01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:18.860
 Patrick, could you please ask Dr. Peat, what does he think of yogurt?

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:31.660
 If it's standard, tangy, somewhat sour yogurt, that amount of lactic acid in a big cup full

01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:38.740
 is enough to cause the liver reaction.

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:45.260
 The liver turns it back to glucose, but it's energetically expensive to turn lactic acid

01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:47.460
 into glucose.

01:33:47.460 --> 01:34:00.060
 And someone who is slightly hypothyroid can notice the depressed energy or even a headache

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:03.740
 brought on by as little as a cup of yogurt.

01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:08.380
 Do you know anything about Abendazole for parasites?

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:14.620
 There's somebody that's taken the dose and just wants to know if you think it's relatively

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:17.340
 safe.

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:24.020
 If you're sure you have a dangerous parasite, yeah, it's better than the parasite.

01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:32.260
 But if you are not certain there's a parasite, its toxicity is enough.

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:34.380
 It isn't something to take diagnostically.

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:40.300
 Because he says he has bruxism, severely grounding of my teeth.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:43.260
 Is that one symptom of parasites?

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:49.380
 That goes with sometimes anything irritating the intestine.

01:34:49.380 --> 01:35:00.780
 But often it's your green salad that you ate at lunch is a more common cause of intestinal

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:08.460
 irritation during the night because that releases serotonin into the system.

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:12.980
 And high serotonin is strongly associated with bruxism.

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:14.620
 High serotonin.

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:21.380
 So you might try something like cyproheptadine to see what effect that is at bedtime.

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:22.380
 What's cyproheptadine?

01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:23.380
 What is that?

01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:33.860
 It's an antihistamine, antiserotonin, old-fashioned antihistamine with the antiserotonin function.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:37.820
 Is that a pharmaceutical med?

01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:41.980
 It's a prescription drug, I think.

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:46.740
 A lot of doctors are willing to prescribe it.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:51.580
 So raw veggies can cause high serotonin?

01:35:51.580 --> 01:36:02.580
 Yeah, the cellulose in uncooked vegetables especially is indigestible.

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:10.620
 And so that carries the food far down your intestine where bacteria can get at it.

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:18.380
 And the bacteria live on cellulose-rich foods and produce toxins.

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:26.820
 And the irritation of the chemicals from the food and the bacteria and their toxins cause

01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:32.220
 the intestine to pour out a flood of histamine and serotonin.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:39.220
 And it's known that bruxism is very closely connected with high serotonin.

01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:47.700
 Do you think one has the same challenges with like sunflower sprouts or radish sprouts?

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:58.140
 If they're cooked or if you grind up alfalfa sprouts while they're raw, there's a surge

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.860
 of cyanide release.

01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:12.780
 So you don't want to eat a mass of raw sprouts of alfalfa.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.860
 How about sunflower or radish sprouts?

01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:21.140
 I think those are safer except for the high antithyroid effect.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:24.620
 Oh, they kind of can tamper down the thyroid?

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.300
 The radish sprouts in particular.

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:27.780
 Oh, well that's right.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.020
 Well, Dr. Peat, we're out of time.

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:34.100
 And if we didn't get your email, we'll just put it in our file here and we'll get you

01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.020
 next time around.

01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:39.020
 So no telling where this whole Corona thing will be.

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.020
 Hmm.

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:44.140
 What, 30 days from now, lots of talk about a second wave.

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.260
 Do you have any theories on that?

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:55.260
 I have the same issue of the word epidemic.

01:37:55.260 --> 01:38:09.660
 If they're putting down sepsis, heart disease, and cancer as coronavirus deaths, then you

01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:14.780
 have to look at the state of the language at the moment.

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:15.780
 Yes, sir.

01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:16.780
 Yes, sir.

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:17.780
 Yeah.

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:18.780
 Proof's in the pudding.

01:38:18.780 --> 01:38:20.260
 God's in the details.

01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:24.140
 Dr. Peat, we appreciate so much your being here.

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:27.500
 Thanks for your time and we'll see you next time around.

01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.500
 Okay?

01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:29.500
 Okay, thanks.

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.500
 Thank you.

 You just email there and then you're ready to go.

01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:52.300

01:38:55.580 --> 01:39:00.020
 David Wolf, yep, cool guy, really good man.

01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:03.300
 He'll be here in the morning, 9 o'clock Central Time.

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:10.580
 If you have a question for probably one of the foremost, I guess most popular and experienced

01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:15.940
 raw food vegan guys, but he stretched out his wings a bit and tried different kinds

01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:18.580
 of foods over the years, just like a lot of them.

01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.860
 So we'll talk to him about all kinds of things with David Wolf.

01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:25.140
 That'll be tomorrow, 9 o'clock Central Time.

01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.660
