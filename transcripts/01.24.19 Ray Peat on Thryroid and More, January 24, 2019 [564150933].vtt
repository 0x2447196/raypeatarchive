00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 From the Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Good morning, this is OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 The telephone number is 888-663-6386.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Email Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Here's your host, Patrick Timpone.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Okay, here we go, our two of our little shows. I mentioned to Mr. Peat in an email and also to you, Adam Bergstrom, who's a good friend and great researcher, and he's on our show, oh, several times a month, even more sometimes, and he's a fan and knows a lot about the work of Mr. Ray Peat. He's on the line. Adam, are you there?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 I am here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 There you are. Ray Peat is a PhD in biology from University of Oregon. His specialization in physiology, the schools he's taught in include University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine. He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968, and in papers in physiological chemistry and physics.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I mean, he's got such an incredible background and very well respected around the world, Ray Peat, and he's on the line. Mr. Peat, good morning.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Good morning.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 How are you doing? It's been a while.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Yeah, it's been five years.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Has it been five years? Yeah, yeah.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 What are you most passionate about these days, Mr. Ray Peat, and your work? And by the way, Ray, say hi to Adam Bergstrom.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Oh, yeah. Hi. I've read his stuff on the yellow fat disease. Very, very great work.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Thank you, Ray. Thank you very much. Thank you for turning me on to the concept, because the first time I ever heard the words was out of your mouth.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 And you mentioned it on Patrick's show, too.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Oh, really?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 The last time, yes, you did.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 When did you first get turned on to the yellow fat thing, Ray?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Well, in the 1940s, a family friend of ours was a chinchilla farmer, and he found that fish were poisoning his chinchillas.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 But that made me check the idea of essential fatty acids, and at that time, in the late '40s and early '50s, anytime someone mentioned the idea of essential fatty acids, it was very tentative.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Because in Texas, one of the research institutes, I don't remember the exact name of it, in 1946, demonstrated that the so-called fatty acid deficiency disease was really a vitamin B6 deficiency,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 because they could feed them a fat-free diet, cause the scaly skin symptoms and so on, and cure the disease with a supplement of vitamin B6 without any fat added.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 So I sort of grew up with the concept that the fatty acid essentiality is, first it was a mistake, and then it turned into a fraud.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And then in the 1970s, I saw research in which they fed saturated fat or highly polyunsaturated fats, or a mixture, to rats through their whole lifetime.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 And they found that it wasn't the quantity of fat that made them obese, it was the degree of unsaturation, so that the ones that ate saturated fats, such as coconut oil, were lean at the end of their lives, no matter how much they ate.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And the ones that ate only polyunsaturated fat were fat at the end of their lives, even if they had a low-fat diet.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Now Adam, you jump in any time, you don't need me, you can just jump in, we're just having a convo here.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 So these are the classic things Ray P. called PUFAs, right, polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Highly unsaturated fatty acids, Omega-3s mainly, DHA, EPA, ALA.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Yeah, those are so sensitive to oxygen degradation that people have checked the blood content after someone eats a fatty fish, and finds that very little of them even reach the bloodstream.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 And when they do, they're an oxidized breakdown product, a great majority of the fat is degraded by the time it gets into your bloodstream.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 Really? So overall, we humans, you don't think, Ray P., we need to be eating any fish at all?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Only because of the trace minerals that are reliably in seafood. Selenium and iodine, for example, aren't reliable.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 If you eat foods grown only in one locality, you can become deficient in a particular trace mineral.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 In your opinion, any fish better than others to eat, if you're going to have a little fish?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Oh, yeah, the low-fat fish and the shellfish. Shellfish are great sources of copper because they generally don't use iron.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Oysters are high in iron, but squid is very good. It's low in iron and high in copper, and has selenium and iodine and other trace minerals.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Cod and sole are low-fat fish that are safe.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Cod and sole, huh? But these fatty fish, you eat them before they even get to where they're going, they start causing the body a problem?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Yeah, if you take, say, a fish oil supplement and then look in your bloodstream, there's enough of the oxidized fat already to suppress the immune system.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 That's why they use them as anti-inflammatories, but the trouble is that they accumulate and create progressive suppression of your immune system.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 People talk about them being required for the brain structure because if you look at an adult's brain, it's full of fish oil equivalent.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 But a newborn, there have been many publications saying that when they check the brain of a newly born, say, miscarriage, they find that the brain is very low in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And so they say you must supplement pregnant women with fish oil or the equivalent because babies are being born with a brain deficiency of PUFA.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 But in France, there was a study in which they did give PUFA supplement to pregnant women, figuring that they would advance brain development, and so they gave a sound test to the woman's abdomen to measure the baby's response.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 They found that the babies learned more slowly in utero if they had extra PUFA added to the diet, and they were born with smaller brains.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And that shouldn't have been done in humans because already in the 1960s and 70s, experiments were showing that animals, if the mother was fed a diet high in unsaturated fat, the babies were born small-brained and slow learners.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 If they were low in PUFA but fed, for example, saturated fat, the babies had bigger brains and learned faster.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 Are any of these unsaturated fats like olive oil, in your opinion, are good food?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 It's about 8 or 10 or 11% PUFA. The rest of it is very good fat, so if you hold it down to one or two teaspoons per day, you're safe.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 All during the growth time up to the age of 20, the body is diluting the PUFA in the diet, so the brain isn't seriously impaired until about the age of 20.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 When you stop growing in size and volume, the brain and other tissues begin increasing their concentration of PUFA.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 So from 20 to the mid-40s, the brain is becoming more and more polyunsaturated and so more at risk of stress.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 When you're under stress, you release these, any of the stored PUFA, into the bloodstream where they can become oxidized and toxic.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 So in the fish oil and the EPA/DHA arena, not only what you're talking about, isn't there also the issues of these things being rancid, the way they're produced and stored and such?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Oh yeah, that gives a head start on the problem. But even if you eat most perfectly fresh PUFA, by the time it reaches your stomach, it's deteriorating.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 And then when it gets into the tissue, it's farther along. And some of it reaches your brain and is stored for years, but then every night, your brain is renewing itself considerably.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 But unfortunately, during the night, your free fatty acids in the blood coming out of your fat tissues rise.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 And so the brain is trying to renew itself, but what it finds in your bloodstream by the time you're 40 is polyunsaturated fatty acids that add to the damage to the brain.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 So that every night, when you're over the age of 40, your brain is at risk of deteriorating faster.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Oh great, that's all we need, right?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 Ray Peat is with us and Adam Bergstrom is co-hosting the show today because he's done a lot of research with Mr. Peat.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Patrick Tempone, oneradionetwork.com. If you'd like to join the show, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Adam, what's the most fascinating thing you've kind of picked up on the whole yellow fat thing that you were first alerted to with Ray Peat?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 I found references of it also causing brown heart disease and it was known that cod liver oil was a cause of it at about the time of the Civil War.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And there are several references, maybe about a half a dozen or close to a dozen that I've found from that time.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 So this has been known for a long time and also people forget that in 1982 in the book Life Extension by Dirk Pearson and Sandy Shaw,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 they basically told you to walk big circles around Omega-3s and mentioned specifically DHA and EPA.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 And the author of Never Cry Wolf, I believe, Farley Mowat, he also recommended avoiding fish and that the Inuit avoided fish.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 And it was the government that gave them nets. The Canadian government gave them nets and they wouldn't use it because they knew if they ate just those fish, those cold water fish, they would die.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 And that is in his book about the Inuit, the people of the deer, I believe it's called.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Fascinating. Right, Ray Peat, so the DHA, EPA molecule or whatever it is, do we need any of this?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Like just go right straight to some seaweeds or I don't know, something there. Do we need it?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And do we get it in other places other than fish oils and stuff?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 No, if we eat only sugar, for example, for calories, we synthesize the monounsaturated fat such as is the main fat of olive oil, oleic acid.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And from oleic acid, whether we get it from a good food like olive oil or make it from our own sugar or starch in our diet, that can be unsaturated.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 And the normal polyunsaturated fat in our brain at birth is made from glucose by first making oleic acid and then unsaturated fat.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 And these are omega minus nine polyunsaturated fats.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 They are natural fat. An Australian researcher tested, he found an easy source of omega minus nine fatty acids and found that they are very powerfully anti-inflammatory

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 and they don't break down and oxidize easily because they have nine carbons at the end that are saturated, which are very stable.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 And the acid at the other end is a stabilizing factor.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 So omega minus nine fats are natural and concentrate in the brain and give good brain function and good stability against oxidation.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 The whole concept of essential fatty acids, which was disproved in Texas in 1946,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 it was brought back in the 1950s when the food oil industry found they had lots of, oh, cotton seed oil was the first.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 It was a byproduct of the cotton industry and they were polluting the country with the waste cotton seeds.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 And they found that they could extract the oil, make people eat it as a food lubricant, basically.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 There was a great campaign around 1950 to sell Wesson oil, cotton seed oil.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 They gave recipes for making special pastries and cakes using that instead of butter.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So it was all an advertising ploy starting in the 1950s.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 And people accepted the advertising and people grew up believing in essential fatty acid concept.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 So when they went to medical school and did research, it became the official doctrine.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 And by the 1960s, people were already being poisoned by eating their cotton seed oil and soy oil and so on.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 The medical industry had convinced itself that there was such a thing as essential fatty acids and that they were protective, was the advertising line.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 They would protect you against cholesterol and saturated fats.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 And so they put several hundred veterans in Los Angeles on a diet with only the vegetable polyunsaturated fats or a fairly normal diet containing some butter and cream and lard and so on.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Not really a saturated fat, but just an average diet.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 At the end of eight years, there were three times as many cancer deaths in the group on vegetable oil as on the normal diet.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And so they stopped the study and said, well, it doesn't protect against heart disease, so we'll stop.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 But they didn't advertise the fact that it greatly increased the cancer mortality, which had been known in animal studies already.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 But the medical industry fell for the food oil advertising line.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 I grew up in the 50s and I know I had them probably did.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 I don't know how old you are, Ray, but I can remember the Wesson oil commercials.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Boy, they were everywhere.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 Yeah.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Yeah.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 Wow. Everywhere.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 So in general, from good sources, most saturated fats are just fine to consume for us?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Yeah. And the trouble is that even the good fats, olive oil has 8 or 10 percent PUFA, butter has 2 or 3 percent, even coconut oil has 2 or 3 percent.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 And these are the cells don't prefer to oxidize those because they're dangerous and poison the mitochondria.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 So they're packed away in fat cells.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 And so even highly selected so-called saturated fat diets, we're putting some of these in the storage and they're getting into the brain and fat tissues.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 And so by the time a person is 50, even if they've been reasonable in their diet choices, they're still going to have too much of the PUFA in their body.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And that makes you more susceptible to any stress when they come out and poison you more intensely.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 Wow.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Go ahead, Adam.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 I was going to say it's how you make lipofuscin too. And lipofuscin now has been shown to be not just a passive waste product, but it groups into iron, zinc and other toxic metals and uses them against the human body and any body, except if you're a salmon listening to this show, then DHA is okay.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 In 1970, when I was working on my dissertation, trying to understand why hamsters aged and became sterile halfway through their lifetime, I found that their uterus was accumulating lipofuscin.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 And so I studied it and it becomes like a little oxygen consuming, it's a brown speck in the cell, but it binds iron and other heavy metals, as you said, and that acts like an artificial hemoglobin that delivers oxygen to reducing agents.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 And so it produces the breakdown products peroxide and consumes oxygen before it can get to your mitochondria.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 So you seem to be consuming oxygen, but you're not using it.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 When I was doing that, just for fun, I bought a quart of vegetable oil, might have been soy oil or one of the standard liquid oils, and put a clear plastic tube in the neck of the bottle and sealed it and put the other end of the tube in a glass of water and came back a few hours later and it was sucking up water.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 I've been using that method to measure the oxygen consumption of hamster uterus and so on.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 And I found that the bottle of vegetable oil was sucking up oxygen in the process of degrading itself.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 It was consuming oxygen just like an animal would.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 So when you get it in your body, it competes with your mitochondria in a purely wasteful destructive process.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Wow. Ray Peat and Adam Bergstrom and Patrick Timponi, oneradionetwork.com.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Let's move on. We got a lot of emails and we're going to get to them, but I wanted to get Ray Peat's opinion because it's been a long time since I've talked to you.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And by the way, it's rayPeat.com. You can check out his work and he has a lot of stuff there.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 So much has been talked about of late, the grains and the lectins and all this stuff and they're not for us and human conception and whatever.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Give us your opinion on what you think, just grains in general.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 And let's consider that whenever you're talking about it, we'll be talking about good, well-farmed organic whatever, whether it be rice or wheat or whatever.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 What's your take on all the grain thing that's going on in the world today?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 In the 1960s, I was living and working in Mexico. I had a school there.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 And I got interested in how people could be fed economically and grains are a very cheap source of starch, but they come with a variety of defensive toxins.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 For a plant, its leaves are important. Cows and insects eat their leaves and so they put some toxins in their leaves, but they can regenerate the leaves.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 But their seeds are essential for the next generation to survive.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 So the worst toxins that a plant can produce are put into the seeds as defense against predators.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And so the traditional societies like the indigenous Mexican preparation of any grain was to soak it in lye or lime.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 But in China and other countries, the same thing was practiced. If they used grain, they would have ashes left over from their fires.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 And so they would put the ashes in and boil the grains with lye, alkali, which would break down the starches and the storage proteins, the gluten-like chemicals.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 And so the native Mexican diet based on corn, no one was getting pellagra. But in the South, when people started growing corn, they didn't know the traditional lye or lime treatment.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 And so pellagra became an epidemic through the southern states because of the corn in the diet.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 And corn is one of the less toxic grains. Any grain should be highly processed, such as with lime or lye, to degrade the toxins.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And just soaking a fresh grain, if you soak it for a day or two, that activates enzymes and turning it into basically a sprout.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Then the toxins are reduced. The root and the shoot will have some toxins, but the worst toxins are in the seed itself.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 So if one wants to consume a good organic brown rice or something like that, just soak it for 24 hours is the best way to do it before cooking it?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 Yeah. It loses some of its characteristic taste, but it's a lot safer.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Here's an email for you all from Lindsey. What thyroid medication does Ray P. recommend for hypothyroid and why is there such a scarcity of Natrithroid?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 It's a fairly long story. I've got some articles on my website about it, but until about 1940, the agriculture department hadn't required that it be removed from meats.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 The waste from the slaughterhouses used to be put into hamburger and such. In 1940 or '42, the agriculture department declared that the thyroid gland had to be sold to basically the Armour meat company to produce thyroid hormone by desiccating the gland,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 removing the fat, adding glucose to it, and putting it in tablets. But until that time, anyone who was eating a traditional meat-based diet, for example, in Germany, they would put the thyroid gland and other parts into sausages.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 And anyone that made traditional fish or chicken soup, the neck and the thyroid and the head would go into the soup. So everyone was getting thyroid as a natural supplement.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 After 1942, it was by law not permitted in food. So at that point, we became dependent on a supplement.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 It's our natural antidote to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the tissues because those, as they build up in the blood, block every function of the thyroid hormone.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 They block the production of it in your gland, the transport in your blood, and the reception and use of it in your mitochondria. So PUFA are the great enemy of thyroid.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 And if we aren't allowed to get it in our natural chicken soup or fish soup, then we're dependent on getting it as a supplement. And Armour made a great supplement for almost 100 years.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Then they sold their company to Revlon, the cosmetics company, and the price went up about tenfold. And in a series of sales, the pills went from less than one cent each up to close to a dollar each, simply as a matter of financial arrangement.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 But still, Armour has gone, with the new owners, Armour has gone through a series of problems because they changed the formula, added various junk to it, but insisted it hasn't changed because it's still called Armour thyroid.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 But since then, other companies have taken over more or less the traditional Armour formula, but it depends on who they are getting their glandular material from.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 The Armour descendant, Forest Pharmaceuticals, said several years ago that they were using the raw material of the gland to extract thyrocalcitonin to regulate calcium.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 That used to be a part of the natural thyroid supplement. So now it's hard to know whether your thyroid glandular has been pre-extracted, losing the calcitonin component.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 So since the 1990s, I've been using a product made in Mexico called Cynoplus, which imitates the Armour formula.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 The Armour company made a synthetic equivalent of the glandular and called it ThyroLar, and that formula was exactly copied by a couple other companies, but Cynoplus continues to make the Armour equivalent in a synthetic form.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 When I started buying it, 100 tablets cost 60 cents, and now they're selling for about $20 for a bottle, but still it's cheaper.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 The equivalent made in the US is close to $100 for that many tablets.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Ray Peat is with us, and Adam called back on the landline. We were getting lots of weird noises on your Skype. Thanks for doing that, Adam.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 Mr. Peat, I've been real curious about, let's see if I have this right, where you've been a kind of a proponent, and I think it has this thyroid functionality to it of a faster pulse rate, meaning actually been more healthful, like 70 beats per minute rather than 60, and an indication of thyroid function. Is that correct?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Yeah. There were some studies in the 1980s of various things related to heart rate. They found that brain function closely corresponded to heart rate.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 They looked at kids in school and high school and saw that their grade average corresponded to their heart rate, and that led them to look at people with pacemakers.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 They would give a person with pacemakers set at 70 beats a mental test, and then they would just turn the regulator up and give them an 85 per minute heart rate, and their mental functions all improved.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 There were studies that showed that if your blood pressure and heart rate increased every year a little bit on average, you were doing well.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 But they saw that if, for example, at the age of 70 or so, your pulse rate stopped increasing or even started decreasing, those people didn't have a long life expectancy.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Really?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 As long as things were tightening up with age, in effect compensating for the increased inefficiency because of the PUFA storage.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 If you could keep increasing your blood delivery, you were making up for that inefficiency from the stored lipofuscin.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 I'll be darned. Yeah, the reason I ask is because, you know, mine's about 55 or 60, and if I get 65 or so at night, Mr. Peat, I mean, I can tell if I'm above 60, and I don't feel good.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 It feels kind of anxious and feels like a body doesn't want to sleep.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 It's almost, you know what I'm saying?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Have you checked your temperature at those times?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 If your hands are cold as you're increasing your heart rate, that means you're running on adrenaline, which is not good.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Your hands should be warm, and your oral temperature shouldn't be too much above your hand temperature.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Keeping your adrenaline low will let your heart rate correspond to your metabolic rate, and when you get your temperature up so that your temperature rises to about 98 when you wake up and then gets up to 98.5 or 98.6 or 98.7 when you're moving around,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 then your heart will have a corresponding increase in rate, and that goes with also an increased stroke volume of the heart, so it delivers more blood per beat.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 If you're having high adrenaline or other stress hormones, your heart is going to have a short stroke, not deliver very much per beat, and so it has to beat faster, and that leads to inefficiency and tissue stress.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 So if you get the body temperature up, am I hearing you correctly, the heart may beat a little faster, but you won't feel the anxiety because of it?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 Yeah.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 That's what you're saying?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Yeah.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 When your metabolism is going at a good high rate, you're producing carbon dioxide in proportion to your oxygen consumption, and the carbon dioxide has a relaxing constructive sedative effect.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 Adam, you talk a lot about the carbon dioxide.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 Yes, definitely. I got the information from Dr. Ray Peat.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 By the way, let me add that we're just discussing the snowflake on the tip of the iceberg because Dr. Ray Peat is a true polymath. He's a Renaissance man. I recommend you go to his website and read his numerous blogs.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 He also sells a newsletter, and I don't know when his books are coming back online, but he writes books also.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Well, good plug there. Stay right there, Mr. Peat. We're going to do a couple of commercials, okay?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Okay.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 You guys stay right there. Wow, what fun. Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com. We have lots of emails here. I'm not sure how long Mr. Peat can hang out. I'll ask him when we go back, and let's do a few things here, and then we'll be right back. Stay right there.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 Previously, we talked with Dr. Rulan Zhu about using Perlcium on your teeth.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 You have to experience it. You'll believe it.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Yeah, you do. That's what I've been saying to my listeners. I keep saying, "I can't even explain this. Just buy it. Just click on it. Buy some. Trust me. Just trust me, and you're going to like the way your teeth look." That's what I keep telling them.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 A dentist, they did an experiment on their client, and they literally proved, and they literally showed a picture every day. When they take it, in a few days, their tooth literally become, like you said, like a pearl. It looks so beautiful and really white and shiny. Yeah, it really works.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 It's also scientifically proven by the experiment. He literally proved it is not only good for your teeth. He also proved it's also good for your gum.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Try some of this Perlcium. I think you're going to love it. You can try it internally as well. It helps with sleep. It's a great way to get absorbable calcium, and also on your face.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 You'll see the green ad there, the beautiful green container. Get the capsules or the powder. Perlcium. Click and order. OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 Previously with Andrew Goss, I asked him why would someone want to buy coins from his company.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 If you don't know coins, you better know your coin dealer. You shouldn't buy coins from someone who isn't a well-known registered dealer.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 If they're an NGC dealer, they're registered with NGC. If they're a PCGS dealer, they're registered with PCGS.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Ask questions. Don't just, "Oh, yeah, here's 10 grand or 50 grand or 150 grand. I just want to buy coins. Let me know what I'm getting."

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 No, that's not how an intelligent investor does it, and we do not let you do that.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 If you're not willing to learn about the coins that you're buying, maybe you should find another coin firm. Don't call this one.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 We're going to insist that you know why and how a coin is rare.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 Once you know that, then I think you can take that knowledge into the marketplace and make intelligent investment decisions.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Aha, what a concept, intelligent investment decisions. I've known Andrew for 25 years. He's the real deal.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 His company, SDL 800-468-2646. Give him a call if you're interested. 800-468-2646.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Once again, our heartfelt thanks to all of you and the outpouring of love and affection and goodwill for Andrew Goss,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 who left us at the mortal coil, as they say, a few days ago of suddenly brain aneurysm and just hundreds of emails and all kinds of stuff.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 We really, really appreciate it.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 PhD in biology, University of Oregon. He's really well studied for a long, long time, as you can hear.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Dr. Ray Peat, as Adam said, his website is rayPeat.com. You're going to find all kinds of things there, a newsletter, his books and things like that.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 Mr. Peat, let's stick with the temperature a minute. Let's see if I'm hearing what you're saying.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Is the body temperature, so the whole Broda-Barnes idea of in the morning you want to have it, what, 98.6 by mouth or 97.6 under the arm, something like that?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 Is that a mechanism of thyroid only or there must be other things going on? Does it necessarily mean you have a pokey thyroid?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 If you do have a pokey thyroid, what's your best suggestions?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Broda-Barnes spent most of his career up in Colorado at a high altitude where people were seldom overheated with high humidity.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 In Eugene in the summer, some days were very humid and hot. I found that hypothyroid people would come in with normal temperatures.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 I realized that even a dead person would have a fairly good temperature when the environmental temperature is very high.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 So I started looking at the pulse rate as well as the temperature.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 There were lots of experiments with the quality of brain function according to brain temperature as well as pulse rate and delivery of blood, glucose and oxygen to the brain.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 Someone devised sort of a heating pad integrated with a helmet so they could heat the head specifically.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 Again, they would give people mental tests, mental calculation and memory and so on.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 They found that when they heated the head up to I think 101 degrees or slightly more, their mental abilities increased with each degree of warmer.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 If you look at some fairly small-brained animals, if they have a high body temperature like crows and parrots run around with well over 105 degrees Fahrenheit temperature with a very small brain, they're extremely intelligent.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 It isn't brain volume. It's a combination of brain volume plus the working temperature.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 The warmer you can stand, you don't want to force yourself to get warmer because your liver has to keep supplying a good stream of glucose and your lungs have to regulate the oxygen delivery efficiently.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 But if your system can stand it, the brain works better the warmer it is.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Yeah. So again, the mechanism for cold hands and feet, is it totally thyroid or other things going on?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Yeah, you can't have cold hands and feet except during stress.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Emotional stress raises your adrenaline and will make your hands and feet and nose get cold.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 But if your thyroid is low, you experience stress almost all the time. So people run around doing their business with cold hands and feet and wonder why they're inefficient.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:28.000
 If you're highly stressed, for example, during the night, cortisol rises to a peak in the morning because your blood sugar is falling.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 Low thyroid people have extremely high cortisol in the morning as well as sometimes adrenaline.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 That can make your morning temperature misleadingly warm because the cortisol is tearing down your protein tissues to turn them into glucose.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 My goodness.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 And the adrenaline will make your skin cold to increase your core temperature. So it can be misleading unless you check all of those things.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 The cortisol and adrenaline will show up as your increased morning temperature and heart rate.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 But then if you have some orange juice and milk, for example, a couple of hours later, if your temperature and pulse rate are slower, that means you're under heavy stress during the night.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 So once again, it's back to our reaction to this world around us. What we call stress is a huge player in everything, right, Mr. B?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Yeah, everything is less stressful when your thyroid is good.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 If we had a good thyroid medication possible, are you okay with people doing that for a little bit to keep your thyroid up?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Or would you like to recommend other ways to get the thyroid just working good?

00:43:48.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 Sure. Unless you're eating chicken neck soup or fish head soup every week, everyone really needs a certain amount of thyroid supplement by the time they're 30 or 40.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 Chicken neck soup or fish head soup, really?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Yeah, if you're on a farm or where you get the unpacked.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 The real good stuff, yeah.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Yeah, for a while at Safeway stores, I found that chicken necks contained about one in ten contained the whole thyroid gland.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 But when I mentioned that, everyone started buying it and Safeway stopped selling their necks because they didn't want to get in trouble with the Agriculture Department.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 Oh, you mean so if you could find some good chicken necks from the farmer's market or something, they'd probably have a little thyroid in there and just cook it's soup and make some of that?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Yeah, that works just like the pill.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 I'll be darned. Oh, we have so many emails here. Let's see what we can do here.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Here's what I'm confused about.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 Many practitioners who support Dr. Peat's ideas of reducing PUFAs in favor of saturated oils always make an amendment for people that carry APOE4 gene like myself.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 For this population, the advice is to lower the amount of saturated fats and use more mimosa and more polys because they can't utilize these fats properly.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 They become plaque in the arteries and brain leading to Alzheimer's. Does Mr. Peat have a comment?

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 At my recent newsletter on cholesterol, there were two of them, but I reviewed the effects of PUFA on plaque and cholesterol.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 In the plaque, it decreases. People talk about the cholesterol increasing with age, but free cholesterol is decreasing because it's being bound to polyunsaturated fats which make it toxic and it piles up in the brain and lowers brain metabolism and brain function.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 In the plaque, it's in proportion to the PUFA attached to the cholesterol as an ester form that makes the plaque.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 In that newsletter, I go in detail over how the enzymes are changed under the influence of PUFA.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 So the plaque is strictly a matter of excess PUFA. About 40 years ago, people checked the lipofuscin content, basically yellow fat disease of the arteries, and found that the plaque was loaded with lipofuscin, the degenerated form of free fatty acids.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 So back to the PUFAs again. Just don't eat these things.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 Yeah, they cause plaque as well as other problems.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 That's in medical books too.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 What's that, Adam?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 That is actually in medical books that the plaque is formed as PUFAs and they wish people to believe that they're saturated fatty acids doing it, and it's not.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 For about 40 years, the agriculture department was listing lard as a saturated fat.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 So there are hundreds of publications on so-called saturated fat damage, and they were using lard as their saturated fat.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 Two or three years ago, it came out, someone measured lard saturation and found that it was about 30% PUFA.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 You're talking about the hydrogenated classic Crisco or something like that.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 Fully hydrogenated fat is very safe.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 There was a Russian study of using saturated peanut oil, very hard saturated fat shortening, and they found that it reversed the aging changes in mitochondria.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 Wow.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 And since that time, I've shifted to using hydrogenated coconut oil, which is now available on the internet.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 And that's okay? That's good?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 Very good, yeah, because it has zero PUFA.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 Okay. Is it actually hydrogenated or just kind of pure or virgin coconut oil, right?

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 No, it's actually chemically hydrogenated.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 Oh, but that's okay.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 Yeah, we're looking for ways to get the pure saturated form by distillation or something other than the chemical treatment.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:03.000
 That isn't available yet, but it would be the ideal.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 Any advantages over like a good coconut oil like that or maybe a well-sourced, like an organic farmer that's doing pigs or something and you get the real pure fat that way?

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 Is there any preference in your mind?

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:38.000
 In Mexico, out in the country where you can get chickens or pork that were fed on fruit and tortillas rather than soy and corn, they're very safe to eat.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here's an email. Patrick and Adam have been recently discussing Dr. Emanuel Ravici and his use of the periodic table to correlate catabolic and anabolic imbalances in the body.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 Can Mr. P discuss how the thyroid might be an influence to those states and how we supplementing with thyroid extract could possibly correct the imbalances?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 Yeah, Ravici was very good on noticing the effect of the day-night cycle and I started thinking about that about 40 or 50 years ago that you have to look at the hormones in context.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 If your liver is in very good condition and your muscles are working right, your body should store several ounces, maybe 10 ounces of sugar which can be drawn on during the night.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 And if you didn't store your sugar efficiently because you were not producing carbon dioxide but instead lactic acid, that wastes your sugar.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 So during the night, you run out of sugar and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol and you start breaking down your tissues, releasing whatever fat is stored and that's what causes bone loss during the night, for example.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 And if you can keep your body well-stocked on sugar, then you can avoid that night-time deterioration stress.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 Well-stocked with sugar, how do we do that?

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:27.000
 Avoiding the PUFA is the essential thing and eating adequate carbohydrate.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 I've known people who got very sick when they were on a pure meat diet because of several reasons.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:45.000
 Poor balance of amino acids but mainly the high phosphate content creates stress and increases the cortisol and adrenaline.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 Gail writes that sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and, like Patrick talks about sometimes, it's funny, have some kind of a carbohydrate and it puts me back to sleep like a little baby.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 And Gail, she wants to know what's going on in my body when it reacts like that to a carbohydrate.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 Salt has a similar effect because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine and when you have too much PUFA in your body, that poisons the ability to produce carbon dioxide from sugar.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 And so in making lactic acid from glucose, you use several times more glucose per minute than when you're making carbon dioxide.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 So within an hour or two of going to sleep, your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 It turns on the stress hormones.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 And so if you have sometimes just a little salty snack will do it because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar more efficiently and lowers stress hormones.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 But, for example, a tablespoon of sugar in a glass of milk could be honey will usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 But you said actually a salty snack would do the same thing.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 Very often it does.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 I've seen people with hyperactive kids who never wanted to go to bed, gave them a little bit of salty consomme or something and just right out like they'd been given a shot of morphine or something.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 I'll be darned.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 Here is Mark. He's in Tennessee.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 Whenever I drink coffee with sugar, when I drink orange juice, I develop a slight heartburn for a short period of time.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 How might I alleviate this problem?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 What could be the cause?

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Good oranges are very important.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially is from unripe oranges.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:07.000
 And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges, they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 So good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 And coffee, the various brands vary, but coffee is always somewhat acidic.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:25.000
 And it's much easier on the stomach if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 And that kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it, the heavy cream?

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
 Yeah, it makes it taste better and is much easier on the stomach.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
 And you absorb the caffeine more slowly.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Overall, you're okay generally.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 I'm sorry, I haven't read a lot of your work.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 It just gets so busy here.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 But just with good dairy and cheese and things like that, you think the body's okay with all those things?

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 Yeah, cheese and eggs and milk and occasional shellfish.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 I think the average person benefits from having liver two or three times a month

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 because so many of the foods are unreliable for nutritional content.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Shellfish has a lot of cholesterol, but we want to keep our cholesterol up though, right, Mr. P?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Yeah, the cosmetics companies have caught on to the fact that old people's free cholesterol decreases tremendously.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 The skin aging is basically a cholesterol deficiency syndrome, the way Alzheimer's disease.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 It gets the fatty acid ester, which is toxic, but the real cholesterol is down by about 50% in aged skin.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 The cosmetics companies are building on experiments which showed that if you add cholesterol to the skin,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 it restores the cell function.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 Live cells come back.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 The dead flaky cells aren't produced when there's adequate cholesterol.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 So they're actually adding cholesterol to the cosmetic creams.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 That biologically is very appropriate because the reason old people need more vitamin D

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 is because vitamin D is made when sunlight hits the cholesterol in the skin.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:35.000
 If you're old, the skin has only half as much cholesterol as a young person,

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 so you produce half as much vitamin D.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 So an old person just doesn't--they need twice as much sunlight as a young person.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 A lot of studies we've recently seen, Mr. P, out of Europe about the higher the cholesterol number for people 60, 70, and 80, the longer they live.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 Yeah, there were studies in the U.S. too in which people in rest homes and such,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 they looked at their cholesterol and checked how long they lived.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 250, 260 were the longest living.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 It's the same idea.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 If you look at how much progesterone an ovary produces,

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 it's exactly proportional to the amount of cholesterol in the blood going into the ovary.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 Same with your adrenals and brain, any tissue.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 It makes its hormones like DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone by converting cholesterol straight into the steroid hormone.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 And to do that, thyroid is the catalyst.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 Do you have a number that you go by that you'd like to see the minimum cholesterol

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 so people can do the whole hormone thing, testosterone and the rest of it?

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 Yeah, 180 is good for a middle-aged person, but by the time a person is 50, according to the Framingham study,

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is higher in people who are not over 200 in their cholesterol.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 Patrick, this is an interesting question from Leroy.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 Patrick recently had a good friend that had a brain aneurysm and just left.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 Can Mr. Peat explain the overall mechanism of strokes, whether they be in the brain or other parts of the body?

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 Yeah, experimenters have produced aneurysms in as short a time as one hour, giving the angiotensin hormone.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
 You produce angiotensin when the kidneys aren't getting what they need.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 Kidneys send out a signal, renin, which causes many tissues to produce angiotensin,

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:08.000
 and the angiotensin converting enzymes, the inhibitors, are used as drugs.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 That's one of the few drugs that has a logical basis.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:26.000
 If you give an animal an overdose of angiotensin, it immediately damages the artery so much that it has an aneurysm.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:38.000
 If you block that angiotensin, you can reverse aneurysms, simply restoring the energy to the blood vessels.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:48.000
 You don't produce excess angiotensin if your kidneys are getting the blood supply they need, the nourishment they need.

00:59:48.000 --> 01:00:02.000
 Thyroid and a diet adequate and free of PUFA is what keeps your kidneys getting the nutrients they need so they don't raise your angiotensin.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:10.000
 So that could be the connection with the kidneys and the filtration and the classic high blood pressure and the strokes?

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:26.000
 Yeah, and salt is another thing that guarantees adequate blood volume, perfusing the kidneys so they don't produce those toxic angiotensin reactants.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:40.000
 Salt lowers your aldosterone produced by the adrenals, and aldosterone works parallel to the angiotensin, causing tissue degeneration.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:50.000
 There are now drugs coming out to lower or oppose aldosterone to protect the failing heart.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:02.000
 High aldosterone is produced by chronic deficiency of sodium in your diet, and aldosterone causes fibrosis, aging of all of the tissues,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
 but the heart is usually the first one that shows up the effect as heart failure.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000
 So the low sodium diet is one of the most dangerous things.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.000
 And that's why some people I think have a good experience maybe using salt before bed, even like a half a teaspoon just straight away with sleep.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
 That makes sense, huh?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
 Yeah, even a fourth of a teaspoon is very helpful.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.000
 Here's an email from Robert. Does Ray Peat still drink three quarts of milk a day? And what are the benefits of milk?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
 Are you still drinking three quarts of milk a day?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
 Yeah, sometimes 20, 30 years ago I drank a gallon a day.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
 Really?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 The problem with grains and leaves is that the plants produce these defensive toxins,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:06.000
 and if a cow ate those and didn't process them in some way, the cow would succumb to all of those toxins.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:16.000
 But the cow has an extra stomach that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast process out those toxins.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
 So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:34.000
 Before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids and sugars into the blood, the plant material has been very detoxified.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000
 So you're getting all of those nutrients multiply filtered.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:49.000
 It's filtered before it gets into the bloodstream, and from the bloodstream to the udder, it's filtered again.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
 So it's the most highly refined food that we can get economically.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000
 And I suspect you're talking about raw, really good grass-fed and all that stuff.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:12.000
 Yeah, but even low-fat pasteurized milk is still the best food available, even if it isn't organic and raw.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:22.000
 No kidding, really. I'm surprised to hear you say that, because there's so much negative stuff said about pasteurizing milk and all that.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 Yeah, it's better when it's unpasteurized. The whole milk is superfood, but just 1% milk from the supermarket is better than most alternatives.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:50.000
 Steve writes in, "Fats are fun. Nothing like butter, coconut oil. How about wheat germ oil? I heard it helps build the myelin sheaths. Is that true?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.000
 And what are the positive or negative effects of consuming wheat germ oil? Is it actually made from wheat?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
 Or if so, would there be concern about the source?"

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:16.000
 The samples that I tried 30 or 40, 50 years ago always were chokingly rancid, dark color, and deteriorated by oxygen,

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:27.000
 because it's so highly polyunsaturated. I think it's a very toxic oil, but it does have the vitamin E in it.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 So if you've refined it to any degree, then it is a source of vitamin E, but I think it's very dangerous because of how easily it gets rancid.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 The same with lecithin. Commercial lecithin generally ranges from yellow to brown to black, depending on how deteriorated it is.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:07.000
 Fresh lecithin is pure white, and it's the polyunsaturated fats turning to pre-yellow fat. It turns yellow right in the bottle.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
 Lots of lecithin in it, and really good range. Eggs, you like eggs?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:29.000
 Yeah, if the chickens have been fed good stuff, yeah. If they range in the pasture, and in Mexico people feed their chickens tortillas and such things,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:45.000
 vegetables, fruits, tortillas, and let them eat bugs, then the eggs are very saturated. I've looked up the degree of polyunsaturated fats in eggs over the last, I think it was 80 years,

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:53.000
 and there's a tremendous, the commercial eggs are now mostly polyunsaturated fat.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
 Wow.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 A hundred years ago they were extremely saturated. So I've reduced my US egg consumption to one per day, figuring that I can count on detoxifying some of the PUFA.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:20.000
 Yeah. So I wonder, Peat, farmers markets around the country, you can find farmers that range feed their chickens, but sometimes they have to supplement,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:27.000
 and you can find farmers that are doing good organic grains with no soy even, here in Dripping Springs if you can believe it, no soy.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 Now are those grains, even if they're well-tended organic grains, are they adding to the PUFA in the eggs?

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 Yes. And you want to check the box to see that they haven't given them flax or any of the omega minus three, because those make the egg taste fishy.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:58.000
 Oh. So you want to make sure there's no flax. What else in the feed that they don't want? You know, just omega three stuff, right?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
 Yeah. I don't know if it's even legal to put fish meal in, but for a while they were getting fish additives.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:19.000
 So this is a good question. Yeah. You've been talking so much about PUFAs, Mr. Peat. Can you just list some of the most active and popular PUFAs that people are consuming?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:36.000
 Oh, fish oil, krill oil, fatty fish, people advocating salmon, but I stopped eating salmon 45 years ago, I guess.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:52.000
 And then the various cooking oils, soy, corn, safflower oil, all of the highly unsaturated oils should be avoided perfectly.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:00.000
 So salmon's a fatty fish. Yeah. Oh, man. A lot of people eat salmon. Yeah.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:10.000
 Is avocado filled with PUFAs as well, says Lynn, which is the best liquid oil to cook with and the best oil to consume on salads besides olive oil? Good question.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000
 If the avocado oil comes from the seed, it's pretty saturated and safe.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:34.000
 But if they use a whole fruit, that would be very unsaturated. So I think you shouldn't eat a lot of fresh avocados regularly.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:41.000
 And so she's asking the best liquid that you like to cook with? Oil. Yeah, oil. Sorry.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:53.000
 I use a little olive oil for some foods, quite a bit of butter for frying eggs and for frying chicken wings, for example.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
 Saturated hydrogenated coconut oil is ideal.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.000
 Adam, are you familiar with what Ray Peat's talking about, this hydrogenation of coconut oil and how you like coconut oil?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 Yes, I am. Definitely a lot of the coconut oils in the health food store are not pure oil.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:20.000
 So at the very least, you get a pure oil, which Ray Peat used to get, if I remember right, from some company.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.000
 But now the hydrogenated oil, I understand that he's gone to.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000
 And that's been my experience, because the coconut oil that's called virgin coconut oil, often in the health food store,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
 contrary to popular belief, because there are some poofers in there, it does go rancid.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
 So I definitely take Dr. Peat's advice.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:54.000
 Ghee too, right, Mr. Peat? That's a good one? Some ghee?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
 Some what? Ghee? Oh, ghee, yeah, that's fine.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.000
 Fresh butter, it's just a way of concentrating the fat from butter,

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000
 but I actually like the taste of fresh butter better than ghee, but ghee is nutritionally good.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
 Does Mr. Peat have an opinion about the TSH level?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:26.000
 So many people vary on their numbers that they go by, that would be a determination for our low thyroid.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:42.000
 The problem with TSH is that the medical profession practically totally ignores the factors that regulate TSH.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000
 So when you're under stress, the stress hormones lower it, so you can look like you're hyperthyroid.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000
 You can have 0.005 on your TSH and seem to be a hyperthyroid person,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
 but it could be your stress hormones lowering it.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:12.000
 And if you don't measure the stress hormones and your T3, reverse T3 is also increased by those same stress hormones.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:26.000
 So people are being diagnosed as hyperthyroid when they're extremely stressed and hypothyroid with very low real T3 relative to reverse T3.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:33.000
 So you have to measure several things at the same time to know what the TSH means.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:43.000
 I've never seen a person who really felt good whose TSH was as high as 2.0,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:53.000
 and people are healthiest when their TSH is 0.4 or less.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
 Wow, that's pretty low.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
 Yeah, the range has been adjusted down over the years,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:10.000
 but then a couple of years ago some pressure was exerted and they reversed and went back up for a while.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:23.000
 But the safe range seems to be now recognized by quite a few experts as 0.2 to 2.0.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 Oh, be darned. That's pretty low.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
 This is a good question.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000
 John says, "Patrick has talked from time to time and had an interview a fellow up in Pennsylvania."

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:42.000
 Oh yeah, from Birmingham, Pennsylvania, Amos Miller, where you can actually buy fresh thyroid from well-tended cows.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
 Would Mr. Peat think it's a good idea to eat some of those?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
 Yeah, you want to recognize the potency.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
 Yeah, boy, they'd be strong.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:02.000
 One gram of dehydrated gland is equal to 15 grains of thyroid.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
 I knew someone who liked chicken necks when he worked on the farm,

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
 and on the day they had chicken he would eat five necks.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000
 He said that afternoon he was always too hot to work very well.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:26.000
 He was getting about five grains in one meal, and that can make you overheat.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:38.000
 So one gram of dehydrated beef thyroid would be equal to 15 grains of the medical.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.000
 Oh, I see. So one gram of like a beef thyroid, if it's fresh or whatever it was, equals 15 grains?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
 Yeah.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
 Of desiccated, right, of desiccated.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
 Yeah, so you want to divide it into 15 portions.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 Yeah, be pretty careful there.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
 Yeah.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
 Please ask Mr. Peat what a person should do who's had their thyroid radiated.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
 Then you need to take thyroid.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:21.000
 Probably the healthy young person's gland produces about four grains of thyroid per day, the equivalent.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:32.000
 Doctors will often supply only thyroxine, only T4, and that will suppress your TSH down to zero,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000
 but you aren't necessarily getting any thyroid function from that because it depends on good sugar supply

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.000
 and selenium for your tissues to convert T4 to the active T3.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:56.000
 So using a glandular thyroid or the equivalent such as Cynoplus or Thyrolar,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:08.000
 you should think in terms of a healthy person being able to produce four grains per day.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:19.000
 You can usually maintain good function at two grains, but just in case symptoms show up,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
 you shouldn't resist taking the full four-grain supplement.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 Armour Company used to make lots of five-grain tablets,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:37.000
 and veterinarians generally recognized that cocker spaniels often needed a five-grain tablet,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000
 even though they weighed maybe 50 pounds.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000
 Lots of human patients required five grains.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:56.000
 I knew a couple people, one woman who was very sick for about 30 years.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.000
 Her hips were about a yard wide, and she had to use a walker and could barely get around.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:11.000
 She found a doctor who would prescribe five grains, and she improved so much over a couple of months.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:20.000
 She went to another doctor and got an additional five grains, and on a 10-grain supplement, she was almost well.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:28.000
 She found a third doctor, and taking 15 grains a day in just two or three weeks,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
 she was totally healthy and got a job.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:43.000
 After 30 years of extreme hypothyroidism, that was apparently because her liver had been poisoned

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:51.000
 so that she wasn't able to convert the T4 component, and with 15 grains of Armour thyroid,

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:58.000
 she was really getting the equivalent of a good four-grain function.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
 Now, do I understand, is a grain, that's 60 milligrams?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
 60 or 61.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:09.000
 Wow. So the body makes, what, 240 milligrams of healthy thyroid?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:16.000
 Yeah. When a healthy person is working well, it can make that much.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
 What does Mr. Peat think about collagen from bone broths? Good for us?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:29.000
 Yeah. If you don't use the marrow, avoid the long bones, use just the joints.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:37.000
 So there's a lot of cartilage and ligaments. Those are the source of the gelatin.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
 Very little comes out of the bone itself.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
 Oh, you mean like chicken feet and stuff like that, they have a lot of collagen.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:51.000
 Yeah, chicken backs and necks and skin and wings, those are the greatest chicken soup.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:59.000
 Are the cosmetic companies that Mr. Peat talked about adding LDL, HDL, or a combination to their skin creams?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:07.000
 I don't, I assumed that they were just using a fairly refined cholesterol

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
 rather than the actual stuff out of the bloodstream.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.000
 Here's from Don in New Jersey. Do you think NAD IV treatment is safe, NAD?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
 Never heard of that one.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
 NAD?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
 NAD IV treatment, right.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 No, niacinamide raises your cellular NAD and that's what you want.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:47.000
 But if you inject things intravenously, I think you're risking reactions en route to the cell.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:19:01.000
 Niacinamide is taken up and the cell does no harm in the cell and is converted to NAD so you can raise it in a safe way.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.000
 Leslie is in Sacramento. Supposing we're on a good, well-balanced, totally organic diet,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:16.000
 are there supplements that Mr. Ray Peat suggested that we should be taking just because we need them?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
 Good question.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
 It depends on what's in your diet.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:35.000
 Often people will include green salad and whole grain bread and maybe legumes and some things that are high in toxins.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 The number of people who are chronically sick because they're eating green salads, it's amazing.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000
 I've seen people get well from chronic problems just by leaving out their green salads.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
 What's with the lettuce? What's going on?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
 It's the defensive chemicals in the leaf.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:08.000
 They aren't as intense as in the seed, but they are designed to block digestive enzymes in the grazers.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:20.000
 Cows, goats, and insects and worms and things that would eat their leaves get poisoned unless they, like a cow, have a rumen to detoxify those.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:32.000
 People don't have the detoxifying system and so their digestive enzymes are simply blocked by the chemicals in the leafy greens.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
 Unless you cook them thoroughly, that breaks down a lot of the toxins.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:42.000
 That's the argument for a lot of people, Ray Peat, of cooking vegetables rather than raw.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
 I know my grandma used to say, "Oh yeah, you should cook your lettuce. Don't eat it raw. Cook your lettuce."

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
 She lived to 96 and never was sick a day in her life.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
 She knew.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000
 She knew, even without reading the research, apparently.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
 It's funny.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:12.000
 Here's a lady that's got swollen ankles, a lot of knees, and both knees have knobs sticking out.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
 I also have a pregnant-looking belly fat.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
 The wrists and knees are about two years old.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:28.000
 I'm wondering if Mr. Peat would suggest progesterone and maybe thyroid product for potential benefit.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:35.000
 Yeah, the basic problem is usually that a low-thyroid person has slow digestion.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
 So foods are feeding bacteria in the intestine.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:52.000
 Bacteria produce endotoxin and if your intestine is irritated and hypothyroid, you absorb that endotoxin into the system along with some allergens.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:22:02.000
 So the combination of low thyroid and slow digestion will cause various inflammatory degenerative processes.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:10.000
 When you're low thyroid, you aren't converting cholesterol to the protective hormones.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:25.000
 So if your cholesterol is very high, that means you're probably deficient in those protective hormones like progesterone and pregnenolone and DHEA.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
 I've seen people supplement.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:51.000
 Like a woman came visiting from Sweden to give lectures in Eugene and she had had, I think it was two joints replaced and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements because all of her joints were getting so deformed.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:06.000
 She spread progesterone over all of her body and spent two or three days in Eugene walking around seeing the sites with absolutely no joint pain.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:22.000
 Gail writes in, "I'm taking 90 milligrams of pig thyroid and I feel good. I just wonder if I take it ongoing that it's harmful or will my thyroid ever get back to doing things normally without the pig thyroid?"

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:34.000
 People have experimented with that experimentally giving higher and higher doses of a supplement, watching what is happening with the glands output.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:41.000
 They would increase the dose until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:49.000
 Then they would stop the dosing and measure the return and it's almost immediate.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:59.000
 I've seen people who could feel a stretching sensation when they were changing their thyroid dose.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:12.000
 Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose and I noticed that I had indentations beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
 So I stopped taking it.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
 The very next morning, my neck was smooth.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
 The glands had enlarged enough to fill out those empty spaces.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
 So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:35.000
 So what are some of the key things that people should do in lifestyle or diet if they want to start trying to cut down on the pig thyroid and get this baby working again?

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 What would be some things that they would play with so they don't feel terrible during the process?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:59.000
 Vitamin D is extremely important. It works right along with the thyroid to regulate sugar because calcium regulates everything and vitamin D is an important calcium regulator along with thyroid.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:08.000
 People sometimes are depressed or have other nervous symptoms just because they're vitamin D deficient.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:15.000
 But vitamin D, part of what it does is to suppress the parathyroid hormone.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:28.000
 When you're low in calcium and vitamin D, the parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones to keep your blood level where it should be or higher.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:50.000
 That causes many degenerative symptoms and eating about 2000 milligrams of calcium per day I think is pretty close to ideal if your vitamin D is also up around the middle of the range on the blood level.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
 So what else? Can we get enough vitamin D from the sun in your opinion?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:04.000
 Yeah, but if you're over 50, your time in the sun has to be much longer than when you were younger.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:20.000
 It takes from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the United States is usually the only time that you're going to get like a whole body exposure in 30 minutes. You can do it right at the middle of the day.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
 And you want to get on the skin, right?

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
 Yeah, it has to be directly onto the skin.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:31.000
 So to boost up thyroid function while you're cutting back, you mentioned vitamin D, calcium, anything else?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:42.000
 Enough good sugar in the diet. That's why I recommend orange juice. A quarter or two of orange juice is very supportive to your thyroid.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:53.000
 Adam, didn't you say orange juice at a certain time is the best thing for the thyroid? Was it 9 o'clock at night or midnight?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:27:04.000
 Well, I usually take it in the morning, but it's good any time. And I can tell you one thing that oranges, I won't go into details, changed my life. It was one of the most important things I learned from Ray Peat.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.000
 I've been eating one almost every day for six years since I first heard Ray Peat.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
 I'll be darned.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:22.000
 A couple of people have told me that their melanoma disappeared or got under control when they started drinking a lot of orange juice.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:30.000
 But see, I've always heard you guys that, "Oh, there's just so much sugar in orange juice. You don't want to drink orange juice."

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:38.000
 Yeah, they're advertising conspiracies against salt and sugar.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
 Does Ray Peat have any opinion on John Elliswater from Maggie in New York?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
 No, I don't know what it is.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 I don't know what that is either. Do you know what that is, Adam, John Elliswater?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000
 No. By the way, on a kind of an offbeat question, a friend of mine will not forgive me if I don't ask this.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
 What does Ray Peat think about pleomorphism?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:08.000
 Pleomorphism? Is that like another thing other than earthly being on Prime Video? What is pleomorphism?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
 Apparently, a bacteria can change into a virus, vice versa, and other things like that.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
 Anyway, a friend of mine would like the answer to that.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:32.000
 Yeah, there is a lot to that, but the particular practitioners, I think, drove it into the ground by trying to sell their particular treatments.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:39.000
 But yeah, there are various alternative forms.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:51.000
 And it relates to a bigger question. We actually have pleomorphic cells, stem cells in our tissues,

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000
 which are pleomorphic in the sense that they are pluripotent.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:06.000
 They can develop into what we need unless we're poisoning them with PUFA and heavy metals and radiation.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:13.000
 And our tissues should be able to change form as needed.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:23.000
 And incidentally, when you eat a particular food like beef or chicken or fruit,

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:30.000
 you are absorbing and integrating some of their DNA into your own structure.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:40.000
 And that increases, I think, in the long run, our capacity to produce the changes that we need.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:53.000
 Only about 5% of our DNA is really in use, and we have that big reserve that we can draw on under stress.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
 Interesting.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:01.000
 I've heard that they call that horizontal DNA versus the vertical DNA.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 Right. Yeah.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
 You guys are geeks with horizontal and vertical, man, I tell you.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:11.000
 Horizontal transmission of DNA.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:20.000
 Here's a good question. "Leon, late at night I have a very, very slight teeth chattering, and not because I'm cold.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
 I just want to repeat an opinion on what could be the cause and the cure of that one."

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
 I think that's, again, the adrenaline.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
 Ah, the adrenaline.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:41.000
 Yeah, and sugar and salt and calcium, milk and vitamin D are behind the thyroid function to keep your blood sugar steady.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
 So let's see. So he could increase the sugar and salt, and that would lower adrenaline,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000
 increase thyroid, and then lower that down.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.000
 So you think it's the adrenaline hit that's the teeth chattering?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
 Yeah, I think it is.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
 Interesting.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:06.000
 Lynn wants to know, "What digestive enzymes would be helpful for eating more raw foods or even cooked foods?"

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:13.000
 Nothing. Well, you could eat fungal enzymes to break down cellulose and such,

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:19.000
 but the problem is that you get traces of the fungus along with the enzyme.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000
 So I think it's better to try to not break down cellulose in your intestine.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:33.000
 The cellulose is having a good function to sort of sweep things along, help them not be reabsorbed.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000
 Your liver excretes toxins into the bile, and if you have fiber moving through your intestine,

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:46.000
 that will prevent that toxin being reabsorbed so you can excrete it.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
 Interesting.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:58.000
 People are hearing a lot of so much about too much stomach acid, not enough stomach acid.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000
 You know, after Jonathan Wright did his whole thing, well, everybody over 50 doesn't have enough stomach acid.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
 They just take HCL or apple cider vinegar.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:14.000
 What's your experience with it in research, and would there be a reason why just because somebody is 50, 60, or 70,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:21.000
 revolutions around the sun or age, that they would just not have enough stomach acid to do their thing?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000
 Yeah, the thyroid is really the source of acid.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
 There you go back to the thyroid again.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:40.000
 Yeah, oxygen is named, means the source of acid, and thyroid acidifies your tissue with carbon dioxide production,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:52.000
 carbonic acid, and that should keep your cells inside acidic and outside relatively basic.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:33:00.000
 And the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production to produce the hydrochloric acid.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
 Fascinating.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:11.000
 So, inability to use oxygen and thyroid increases with age because of the PUFA and heavy metal accumulation.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:20.000
 And so getting your thyroid metabolism right will usually improve all of your digestion, including the acid.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000
 Interesting.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:32.000
 So, maybe a lot of this low acid stuff that we're hearing is all coming back to this plethora or just epidemic proportions of underactive thyroid.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
 Yeah.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
 Wow.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:48.000
 By the tests that were used up to 1940, easily 40% of the American population is hypothyroid, just by the medical standards up to 1940.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:58.000
 Then the drug companies got involved, sold their phony tests like the protein-bound iodine test in the late 1940s,

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:07.000
 convinced everyone who had been taking thyroid they showed normal on that test, and so they stopped taking thyroid.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:16.000
 Doctors taught everyone that the reason they're fat and lethargic is because of their bad character rather than low thyroid

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
 because the test showed they were normal.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.000
 Twenty years later, that test was shown to be absolutely unrelated to thyroid function.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:37.000
 So for 20 years, people were indoctrinated to believe that 95% of the population has good thyroid function, where it was a phony test.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.000
 But on the basis of that belief that only 5% might be hypothyroid,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:52.000
 the new tests, TSH, is meaningfully related to thyroid, although ambiguously.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:01.000
 But those new tests were interpreted in terms of the 95% not needing thyroid.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:10.000
 So no matter how good a test it is, if your assumptions are wrong, the test isn't going to do you any good.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:23.000
 So if we take supplemental iodine, Lugol's, or detoxify the Edgar Cayce thing, does that help the thyroid function?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000
 No, and over the years, it's likely to make it worse.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000
 Oh, good.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:37.000
 Iodized salt is usually around the world where they have iodized the salt.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:49.000
 They see increased thyroid gland degenerative conditions, increased nodules, inflammation, Hashimoto's disease, and so on.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
 You can produce it by just a moderately excess of iodine.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:01.000
 So I take it then you're not a supporter of taking supplemental iodine at all?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
 No, seafood, once a week eating seafood gives you all the iodine you can use.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
 And again, you said the low-fat, I've written it down, but the low-fat fish are cod and sole?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
 Sole.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
 Cod and sole.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:28.000
 Is there an adrenal supplement we can take to lower the adrenal problem, writes Robert?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
 If you're on a farm, the adrenal gland is very good nutritionally.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:43.000
 It contains pregnenolone and a small supplement of pregnenolone, if you can find a safe source, which I can't.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:50.000
 But pregnenolone used to be a good, reliable support for adrenal problems.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
 But you can't find a clean one, Mr. Peat?

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:04.000
 Yeah, everyone is tending, women get breast pain or uterine cramps from it, which means it's probably contaminated with estrogen.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:13.000
 George wants to know, what's Mr. Peat's opinion on hemp plant and the hemp oils or the hemp protein?

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
 Are these worth looking at?

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
 The protein is okay.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000
 The hemp protein?

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:26.000
 Yeah, but you have the seed protein problem, it should be properly processed.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
 Lime processing would make it more digestible.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.000
 But the oils are highly unsaturated, so I think it's good to be very cautious with them.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
 They're poofers.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000
 Linda wants to know what the negative effects of flax seeds are.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
 Are there negative effects in flax seeds?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:50.000
 The high polyunsaturated is the main problem.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
 There are some good components, but some bad.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:04.000
 Most people who use the flax seed as a laxative or bulk are absorbing very little of the substance.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:09.000
 So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
 You aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000
 They have some good, most theoretically good organic psyllium husk kind of fiber things.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
 Are those reasonable things to take?

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.000
 Yeah, some people do very well.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
 Others get more constipated with it, so you have to try out the fiber.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
 Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
 Well-cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
 Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.000
 But then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots, apparently.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
 Dom wants to know, is there any way to regrow teeth enamel?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
 Only in the most superficial sense.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:14.000
 Before it has penetrated to the dentine, the proteins of the enamel can capture calcium from the environment and reconstitute the seal.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:24.000
 But once it has entered the dentine, then it should be treated with a filling of some sort.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
 A couple more, then we'll let you go, Mr. Peat.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
 You've been very generous with your time. Thank you. We really enjoy this.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:37.000
 So would drizzling a bit of lemon juice on a salad help to break down the anti-digestive toxins in the raw greens?

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
 No.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
 No? Doesn't do it?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
 No.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
 You know, it's interesting you mention about the raw vegetables.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
 You know, in Ayurvedic medicine, I'm kind of a fan and studied it somewhat over the years.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
 I'm no expert.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.000
 But they're not very big on raw vegetables at all.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
 Just nothing.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
 Nothing.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
 Cook them. Cook them, they say.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
 You know, 5,000-year-old methods.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
 So maybe on to something.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:08.000
 Are scrambled eggs, cooked eggs, poached eggs, any different?

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:15.000
 Yeah. Raw eggs are nutritionally very, very good.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
 They have an antiviral effect in the intestine.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
 They're fresh form.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:28.000
 But cooked, they're extremely nutritious, except for the cumulative effect of the PUFA.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
 Oh, you mean it just depends on their diet, and you've got to be really careful about that.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
 Well, Mr. Peat, it's been so much fun having you on. Thanks.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000
 We won't wait so long. Would you come back again sometime?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
 Oh, sure. Anytime.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
 Oh, that'd be great. It'd be fun to have you on.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.000
 Adam, do you have anything else you'd like to say or ask Mr. Peat or whatever?

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
 One more thing.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
 Go ahead, Ray.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
 Go ahead.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
 Go ahead. Sorry.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.000
 One more thing about to validate the DHA thing is that a salmon is lucky.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
 It's high DHA, and it's lucky if it lasts to nine years.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:13.000
 An orange ruffie is the lowest fish of all in DHA, and it lives to 149 years.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
 Really? The orange ruffie does?

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.000
 I've heard 300 years.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
 Oh, come on. A fish can't live 100 years, can they?

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
 Oh, sure.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
 Really?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
 Yeah. I'm sure some are older than that.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:34.000
 So the salmon only live to--well, salmon, though, they swim upstream and get girls and stuff.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
 I mean, no wonder they die early.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:46.000
 When they feed fish oil, they lose endurance and age quickly.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
 Oh, Peat, yeah.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
 And, boy, when you talk about fish, too, folks, be careful about all this.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
 You go to some stores and they say responsibly farmed fish, and you have no idea what that means.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000
 Right.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
 You have no idea what they're feeding them.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
 I think Whole Foods has some pretty good standards, but be careful.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:12.000
 I would suspect, Roy, Peat, that wild fish Atlantic would be a good choice.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:20.000
 The southern fish around the equator have the least PUFA.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000
 Oh, and which one? Oh, so is that back to the cod and the sole?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:35.000
 They are still pretty high in PUFA, but you pretty much have to live in the region to get the warm water fish.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
 Oh, I see.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000
 Well, Mr. Peat, thank you so much. We appreciate it.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000
 Tell folks before you leave what they might find if they visit RoyPete.com.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:55.000
 There are about 100 articles there on all the subjects we've talked about.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
 And do you have your own private kind of newsletter?

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:05.000
 Yeah, every two months now. It's $28 for two years for 12 fish.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
 Oh, man, I'm going to sign up for that guy.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
 $28 for two years. God love you. That's great.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
 And what part of the world do you live in?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
 Eugene right now, Oregon.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
 Ah, man, you're up there on the left coast.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
 Yeah.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
 Eugene, Oregon.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
 Oh, and a listener wants to know how old you are, if you don't mind.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
 82.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
 No. Really?

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
 Yep.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
 Well, you don't sound like a day over 50. That's great. 82. 82.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
 And you're in good health? You feel good?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:41.000
 Yeah, I haven't been to a doctor, so I don't really know 50 years.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
 50 years without seeing one.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:48.000
 Our friend Adam here, he's 75 around the sun. I'm 72.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:55.000
 And we're always kidding people, saying, "Okay, now, when you guys start to listen to some of us folks over 70 revolutions about longevity,

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:02.000
 that's, you know, rather than the kids on YouTube who are 30 telling you how to live a long time. It's funny."

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
 They all mean well, though. They all mean well.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
 Dr. Peat is an artist, too.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
 Oh, you are? What do you paint?

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:15.000
 Oh, there are some of my pictures from 20 years ago up on my website.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000
 Ah, okay. Well, we'll keep in touch. We'd love to have you back any time, and thanks for being here this morning.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
 Thank you. Thank you, Ray.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
 Well, Mr. Adam, thank you for being here. That was fun, huh?

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
 It was. Thanks for inviting me.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
 Oh, yeah. It was great, great having you guys on.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
 I had no idea that he was 82 revolutions around the sun. Man.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.000
 Yeah, he's doing great, too. I like that he doesn't know how healthy he is because he hasn't been to a doctor to get it validated.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000
 That's right. That's the way it goes, man.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
 All right, brother. Thanks a lot. I appreciate your ongoing support.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.000
 And, well, we really lost a good one with Andrew, right? Wasn't that pretty amazing?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
 We did. Quite a shock. Quite a shock.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:04.000
 But like Donnelly said, like it or not, we all survive our decent burial.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
 We all survive our decent burial. We sure do.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:13.000
 Okay, Adam, we love you. Say hi to VibrantGal, and we'll probably be connecting with you during Open Phones tomorrow.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
 Love. You bet.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
 Okay. Bye-bye.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
 Patrick Timponi, Andrew, oh, no, see, I just started thinking about Andrew.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:27.000
 Ray Peat and Adam Bergstrom will have this show up on the website very soon.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:34.000
 Oh, a couple hours? And this would be a good one to pass on to everyone that you care about, especially folks with a thyroid.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
 And I think most of us have it.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
 Less the few of you that got your thyroid nuked, but even then, he has some ideas for you.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:46.000
 So I love you all very much. Again, thank you for your outpouring of love and support.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
 With Andrew Goss going on his cosmic vacation suddenly, it's been just amazing.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:58.000
 My inbox just doesn't stop, and Facebook, and, well, it's just, I know the family really, really appreciates it.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:06.000
 They heard the little show we did yesterday. They were listening, and they really appreciate all the love and support you had for Andrew.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
 And I, you know, again, I'm just, I was just so fascinated.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:20.000
 You know, I know he had a big impact and had a big audience, but to the extent that people really cared about him and loved him and felt like they knew him was just, you know, I should have realized that,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
 but boy, I sure do now.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000
 Anyway, so I love you all very much. Thanks for your ongoing support of our website.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:36.000

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:47.000
 and that'll be available to you at no cost, and you can have your education, your PhD, and financial history,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:54.000
 and the way the money deal works, and thanks for your support to all the products we promote.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:00.000
 That's how we pay the bills in our house payment, and we appreciate that you support the people that we really like,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:06.000

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
