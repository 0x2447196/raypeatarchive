00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hi Ray, how's it going? Hi, very good. Awesome, well thank you for doing this

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.000
 today. I think this is going to be great. I'm really looking forward to this

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.640
 question and answer session. What we've done, I have some help from my wife, and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.080
 we compiled a list of questions from the basically a northern California birth

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.280
 community and listeners of the podcast and just in general we've kind of

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.560
 gathered an assortment of questions. They might be all over the place, but I've

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.080
 tried to compile them in a way that kind of makes sense. But before we get into

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.560
 the questions and hear your thoughts, could you go into your background a

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.360
 little bit, especially as it pertains to women's issues, pregnancy, and human

00:00:49.360 --> 00:01:03.040
 development in general? In 1968, after studying many other things for about 12

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.160
 years after getting out of college, I went to graduate school at the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.120
 University of Oregon specializing in reproductive physiology. I did my

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:29.720
 dissertation in 1972 on oxidative changes in the uterus with aging.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.600
 That had been one of my lifelong interests was the physiology of aging.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.360
 It seemed especially relevant to the process of reproduction because I had

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:55.400
 seen publications in the 40s and 50s in which they saw that when you make a

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.280
 graph of the baby's birth weight and head circumference, that both of these

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.960
 increase with each subsequent pregnancy so that the older the mother is, the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:23.920
 bigger her baby's brain is. That held true up until about the age of 38. At

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:33.000
 that time, women were having many more babies each, and so it tended to be the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.880
 third or fourth or fifth baby by the time she reached her late 30s. At that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:51.760
 point, instead of increasing the last birth before she became infertile, the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.320
 last baby tended to be lighter with a smaller head. But the general drift of

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:07.360
 both aging and parity was for the birth weight and brain weight to increase

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:17.160
 steadily. That was sort of in the background. I had started out intending

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:25.120
 to study brain physiology in graduate school, but I found that that subject was

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.800
 completely dogmatic, whereas the reproductive physiology actually

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.800
 tolerated a scientific approach.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.000
 Oh, that's great. So one of the questions, actually this leads right into one of

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.520
 our first questions. I love that summary of your background as it relates to

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.760
 pregnancy and child development issues. One of the questions from a woman was

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.320
 directly related to kind of what you spoke to, and it's maintaining fertility

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.760
 as a woman ages. This is kind of a general question, but what could a

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.360
 woman do to maintain fertility as she does get older?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:19.720
 The failure of progesterone around it starts statistically happening in the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.600
 mid-30s. Estrogen production and concentration in the body tends to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:35.520
 increase steadily from the 20s, about the age of 20, up until the late 30s.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:44.880
 That's about the time when aging and stress symptoms start becoming

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:57.200
 noticeable. Sometimes a woman is gaining excess weight around that age, and any

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.600
 kind of nutritional or environmental problem limits the ability to produce

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:12.720
 progesterone. As the ratio of estrogen continually increasing and

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:22.280
 progesterone reaching a limit determined by stress and nutrition, at that point

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:32.000
 you start getting the signs of menopause and infertility. So there are two

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:42.200
 processes that tend to extend fertility as well as lifespan in general. One is

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:51.480
 that the liver metabolically, when it's healthy, excretes 100% of the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:06:00.760
 estrogen arriving in the circulation to be made soluble for excretion in the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:08.480
 urine or put into the bile for excretion. The estrogen that goes into the bile, it

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:15.880
 tends to be reabsorbed if there's not enough fiber in the diet. So keeping a

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.400
 steady increase, a steady supply of fiber running through the intestine

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:35.200
 allows the liver to get rid of the bile- excreted estrogen. And the other,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.960
 it's a sulfated or glucuronidated water-soluble form of estrogen that goes

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.440
 out in urine. To make that, the B vitamins and protein are the most

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:58.600
 essential nutrients. So keeping up the B vitamins and in general good nutrition,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:07.800
 adequate protein and calcium keep the liver able to minimize estrogen. As it

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.240
 reaches the liver, it should be a hundred percent excreted so it doesn't build up

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.240
 steadily with aging. And that in itself makes the problem of producing adequate

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:28.880
 progesterone manageable because it isn't against this rising tide of estrogen

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:39.760
 with aging. Vitamin A, protein, adequate minerals, a balance of calcium and

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:50.480
 phosphate, and vitamin D are the main limiting factors for making progesterone.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:08:00.000
 Vitamin A is used almost a one-to-one relationship with the amount of

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.040
 progesterone you produce. Thyroid hormone travels on the same protein in the blood

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:17.360
 as vitamin A and that protein with the vitamin A in thyroid are taken up by

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:25.000
 cells along with cholesterol and are used in the conversion of cholesterol to

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.160
 progesterone. So it's essential to maintain a good level of cholesterol in

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.400
 your blood to be able to keep producing adequate progesterone.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.640
 Awesome. So Ray, when you talk about vitamin A and the B vitamins, would it be

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.360
 preferable to get these from food sources rather than supplemental sources?

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.920
 Yeah, the supplements always contain manufacturing contaminants and

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:08.360
 breakdown products. Vitamin A, for example, is extremely oxidizable and many

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:15.000
 people get serious side effects when they take vitamin supplements that they

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.400
 don't get at all when they eat foods that are very rich in those. So eggs, milk, and

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:31.280
 cheese and liver, for example, are very safe sources of vitamin A to some extent

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.120
 vitamin D, but if you don't get sunlight then you will need a supplement of

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:44.680
 vitamin D. Okay, great. That's great. Now for progesterone, if a woman is

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.080
 obviously supporting an environment where natural progesterone continues to

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:56.240
 be adequate or optimal, that's great, but as a woman ages and progesterone levels

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:02.880
 decrease, does it make sense for a woman to supplement progesterone

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:13.960
 more as she ages? Yeah, in the 1950s, Katharina Dalton in England, at that time,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:22.680
 the main progesterone product on the market was injectable in oil solution.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:32.160
 She was treating women with premenstrual syndrome with these monthly or

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.800
 twice-monthly injections of progesterone and found that the women who suffered

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:48.040
 from PMS tended to have their previous babies before they had come in to have

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:58.000
 their PMS treated, their previous babies had a very high likelihood of being

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.960
 premature, underweight, and mentally not up to par. And she found that the

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:13.280
 patients that she had treated adequately for PMS were having healthier

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:22.200
 pregnancies and if they continued having a PMS symptom in the pregnancy, she

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.960
 would continue treating their PMS symptoms. And many of these women had

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:36.280
 previously had monthly bleeding episodes right up into the fifth or sixth

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:43.600
 month of pregnancy and then they would deliver prematurely. And she found that

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:54.440
 by preventing the symptoms of depression, anxiety, headaches, and so on, that she

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.680
 prevented the monthly bleeding episodes and the babies were carried to full

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:07.560
 term. And after doing that for about 15 or 20 years, someone mentioned to her

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:13.880
 that her patients' babies were remarkably intelligent. She said that isn't very

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:25.320
 likely because the women who deliver prematurely are known to have

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:33.200
 babies with an average IQ of about 95. She did a study and found that her

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:44.960
 babies were averaging about 130 IQ. So the younger siblings were all many IQ

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.680
 points better, just the difference was simply the mother was a little older and

00:12:51.680 --> 00:13:00.440
 was getting progesterone support. Wow, that's awesome. Ray, there was a poll

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.800
 going around I saw recently where there were women who wrote in and answered the

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.920
 question, "Is progesterone supplementation being effective?" And a lot of the women

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.640
 said yes, extremely effective. They noticed positive effects from the

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:23.880
 progesterone and then some women said they weren't seeing positive effects. Can

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.360
 there be a reason that some women would see positive effects from

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:34.600
 supplemental progesterone and then other women maybe would not? Some women have a

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.560
 much higher need and many of the products simply aren't able to deliver

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:50.400
 enough progesterone to be effective. I think it was 1951, there was a study of

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.680
 using the commercial progesterone that was available at that time for treating

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:10.160
 uterine cancer. The treatment, it turned out, the doctors examining the changes

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:20.120
 saw just remarkable improvements in the uterine cancer, but they were giving

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:29.840
 what they considered to be a maximum dose, many, many injections of, I think it

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.680
 was a couple hundred milligrams per injection. They would give several of

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:41.200
 those per day, but they never mentioned that the patient was being anesthetized

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:53.800
 or they didn't even mention a sedative effect, but it's now recognized that when

00:14:53.800 --> 00:15:02.120
 you get the amount of progesterone that the placenta produces in the latter half

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:08.880
 of pregnancy, those amounts of progesterone are strongly affecting the

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:15.000
 nervous system, preventing childbirth pain, for example, with an actual

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.160
 anesthetic effect and having a sedative effect improving the quality of sleep. So

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.440
 what they were demonstrating in that 1951 study was that even injecting

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:37.080
 hundreds of milligrams of progesterone, it wasn't being available to the

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:45.920
 bloodstream. It was dissolved in oil and it was simply staying in the muscle or

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:53.280
 fat tissue where they infected it, and when you take it orally in a powdered

00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:03.680
 form, the particulate, even micronized progesterone, as it touches the lining of

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:14.240
 the intestine, a small amount of it is passed into the cell structure and in

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:22.080
 that form in the intestine and as it moves from the intestine to the

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:30.480
 liver in that form, both the intestine and the liver have the enzymes to

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:39.040
 solubilize it, the way the liver handles estrogen, and so any of the powdered

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:46.640
 estrogen or progesterone preparations that touch the intestine tend to go into

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:54.360
 the soluble form and leave the body quickly. And if it gets into the

00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:02.240
 circulation as a sulfated progesterone, that will have its own sedative effect,

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:09.280
 but definitely doesn't follow the metabolic pathway that natural

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:18.480
 progesterone produced by the ovaries or in the brain would have. And the closest

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:25.040
 you can get to a natural supplement of progesterone is when it's dissolved in

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:37.840
 oil and taken orally. The digestive system has the ability to break it up

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:49.680
 into micron-sized particles for absorption directly through the intestine

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:58.880
 into the lymphatic system where those particles are transmitted directly to

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.920
 the bloodstream. So it circulates as fat-dissolved particles

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.320
 through the general circulation, bypassing the liver repeatedly because

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:20.640
 red blood cells and these chylomicron particles are not recognized as

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:27.280
 something for excretion. They pass through the liver over and over and can

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:36.960
 be absorbed by the uterus, brain, all of the tissues. Wow, that's great. So would

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.080
 you say if you are taking a progesterone that gets into that metabolic pathway,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:49.280
 for example, like dissolved in vitamin E and you aren't noticing

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:57.520
 effects, would a good gauge be to just try taking more? Yeah, a fourth of a

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:08.080
 teaspoon of the solution containing 100 milligrams will, for a man, that amount

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:16.160
 will likely bring on sleep very quickly. For a woman, it will have a definite

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:27.920
 relaxing sedative effect. And a dose of that sort during pregnancy, the tendency

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:36.400
 of any given dose of progesterone that is sensed to be adequate, the ovary when

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:44.160
 you're not pregnant or the placenta when you are pregnant will be stimulated so

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.840
 that there's a positive feedback between a given dose and the ability of the

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.760
 ovary or the placenta to maintain and increase its production of progesterone

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:04.040
 so it can have a catalytic effect. There were studies in which women who were

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.920
 giving signs that they were about to miscarry at maybe the third or fourth

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:17.880
 month of pregnancy were given an injection of progesterone and it was

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:24.400
 two-thirds of the group went from the third month when they got that injection

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:33.520
 all the way to a full term. One third of the group needed another injection

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:41.120
 around month six and they then carried it to full term. So there's a positive

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:49.400
 feedback catalytic effect that one good strong dose will often solve the

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:56.240
 deficiency problem. Wow, that's great. One woman, it's kind of related, one

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.560
 woman asked a question about miscarriage. You mentioned miscarriage and thyroid.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.800
 So thyroid and progesterone are related, I imagine. Can you talk about thyroid and

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:15.040
 miscarriage in the same line? Yeah, everyone who is hypothyroid becomes

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:23.280
 subject to an excess of estrogen relative to the other protective

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:31.440
 hormones, progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA and to some extent testosterone.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:40.720
 When the thyroid is low, the tissues accumulate water and shift their

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.720
 metabolism, their energy production towards lactic acid formation rather

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:53.640
 than carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide that should be produced under the

00:21:53.640 --> 00:22:03.680
 influence of thyroid has a relaxing sedative effect on the uterus, tends to

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:10.280
 deliver more oxygen to the fetus. When your thyroid is low and you don't

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.920
 produce that carbon dioxide, you make a lot of lactic acid which has an

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:25.080
 excitatory effect on the tissues, tending to over activate contractions in the

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:33.560
 uterus, causing stress to the fetus and triggers cortisol production which

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:45.960
 tends to produce delivery. The thyroid acting on the liver is lowering

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:52.560
 estrogen which has the tendency to shift metabolism towards lactic acid.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:23:01.680
 The estrogen itself activates cortisol production and excites contractions in

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:15.800
 the uterus. The direct effect of thyroid and cholesterol on the ovary or the

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:24.800
 placenta is to increase the conversion of cholesterol to progesterone so that

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:34.480
 at every level of metabolism, thyroid is working towards maturing the

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:41.000
 pregnancy, keeping the delivery of sugar for the development of the embryo's

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.280
 brain, keeping the progesterone high and the uterus relaxed.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:54.040
 Great. So then would thyroid sometimes be appropriate as another supplement?

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.680
 It could be used by pregnant women?

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:06.680
 Even before getting pregnant, there have been many studies showing that thyroid

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:13.760
 hormone for both men and women is the most important single fertility hormone

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:20.800
 there is. I've known dozens of men and women who were unable to get

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.160
 pregnant. Usually the very first month they supplement thyroid, they're

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:33.440
 pregnant. Some of them after 10 or 15 years of trying, all it took was one

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:45.640
 month of thyroid. So it's good to start early. Another study looked at women who

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:53.160
 had used a supplement of progesterone even for just one month preceding

00:24:53.160 --> 00:25:03.400
 conception, where the normal percentage of birth defects in that study was 4%.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.960
 Those women who had, even for just one month, who had used progesterone before

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:19.080
 conceiving, there was only 1% incidence of birth defects. So progesterone has a

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:29.640
 very powerful stabilizing effect on the chromosomes and thyroid is working

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:37.280
 right along with the progesterone, stabilizing the genetic system.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:44.800
 Wow, that's great. Ray, you mentioned the lactic acid or the lactic metabolism

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:52.120
 being maladaptive for a developing fetus. A lot of people seem to be

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.920
 into intense exercise. Can over-exertion and intense exercise actually

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.840
 be not really what we want for a healthy pregnancy?

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:09.720
 Yeah, if you look at just athletes, not pregnant athletes, but just men or women

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:18.600
 either, one of the definitions of over-training is to look at their lungs'

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:27.400
 ability to diffuse oxygen. One study found that athletes who thought they

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:35.320
 were in great condition but who were over-training had a tremendously

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:44.000
 deficient ability of their lungs to emit oxygen to the blood. The over-training

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.720
 gave them a chronic oxygen deficit and lingering lactic acid level in the blood.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:27:00.720
 They found that those athletes who had elevated lactic acid even 12 hours or

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:08.640
 more after their exercise, those were the ones whose lungs had taken up so much

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:17.280
 excess water that the diffusion pathway was about twice normal. So no matter

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:26.680
 how fast they breathed, they just couldn't get efficient oxygenation. The

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:32.840
 same sort of thing happens under the influence of too much estrogen. A study in,

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:43.280
 I think it was mice, gave one injection of estrogen and then monitored the

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:50.120
 ability of oxygen to move through their lungs. They found that 95% of the

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:56.960
 diffusion capacity was knocked out in an hour following a single overdose of

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:04.880
 estrogen. Wow, great. I'm going to go back to a general question here from a

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.040
 woman. She asked, "What is the most important piece of advice that you would

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:21.920
 give an expecting mother?" To eat well. That means keeping protein up, having a

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:32.280
 good ratio of calcium to phosphate in the diet, be getting around 100

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:40.320
 milligrams of good protein every day, and something like a one-to-one ratio of

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:48.520
 calcium to phosphate if possible. Great, that's awesome. Thanks, Ray. Another

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.960
 question here from a woman, "What are your thoughts on the common suggestion that a

00:28:52.960 --> 00:29:02.520
 pregnant mother should be consuming high volumes of water?" Water can be very

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:14.480
 dangerous. Your requirement for protein and calcium means that during, once

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:24.440
 pregnancy gets going, two quarts of milk a day is kind of the minimum, along with

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:31.320
 maybe a quart of orange juice. With two or three quarts of those going in as

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:44.520
 food, you have very little need for other liquid. If you don't balance your

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:51.320
 water intake, especially with sodium, but also with calcium, magnesium, and

00:29:51.320 --> 00:30:00.000
 potassium, sodium is very often the most important mineral lacking in

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.480
 pregnancy, and if you add water to your regime without balancing it with

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:17.920
 salting your food to taste, that can have a very bad outcome. In the 1950s, when the

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:26.040
 drug companies devised new chemical diuretics, they decided pregnant women

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.480
 would be a good market for them, so they invented the idea that you shouldn't

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:38.360
 gain so much weight during pregnancy. And almost every doctor in the country fell

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:46.040
 for the advertising for diuretics and taught women to control their weight

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:56.640
 gain, and to do that largely with the water pills. That had really a

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:05.000
 disastrous effect on the outcome of millions of pregnancies. The progesterone

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.240
 is pretty much the basis for the body's ability to regulate water and salt

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:20.120
 accurately, but you have to take in a generous amount for the progesterone to

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:33.400
 be able to regulate it. In two different studies of preeclampsia, in which the

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:42.440
 women were developing high blood pressure, knowing the physiology,

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:50.440
 when progesterone is deficient, you tend to retain water without sodium,

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:59.120
 potassium, calcium, and so on. And so they tried giving pretty big supplements of

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:07.440
 table salt to these women with eclampsia, where the standard medical

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:15.040
 prescription was to have them avoid salt and take diuretics. These two studies

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:21.800
 supplemented several grams per day of table salt and cured the preeclampsia,

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:30.040
 regulated their blood pressure, and that same principle works anytime your

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:37.520
 progesterone is deficient relative to estrogen. You seem to be retaining

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.680
 water, but it's really that you're losing sodium too fast, and balancing your

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:52.320
 minerals will help you get rid of the water. How that works is that albumin in

00:32:52.320 --> 00:33:02.640
 the blood forms the negative charges on albumin molecules bind the positive

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:12.000
 charges of sodium, and that combination of electrical charges binds water around

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.680
 that cloud of molecules. And if you don't have enough sodium, the albumin can't

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:26.560
 retain its water. The albumin tends to fall out of solution going into your

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:33.600
 tissues or out your kidneys. The preeclampsia, high blood pressure women

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:43.400
 tend to lose a lot of albumin in their urine. And how these researchers cured

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:52.680
 the preeclampsia with sodium, it was because the sodium allowed the albumin

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:58.800
 to stay in the bloodstream and to attract water to it, pulling water out of

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:05.560
 the tissues and keeping it to increase the volume of blood needed to perfuse

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:14.640
 the placenta and uterus. So water without sodium, especially with the diuretics

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:22.840
 that were being sold to American and European and Australian women, the

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:29.440
 excess water and diuretic combination and salt restriction is a very deadly

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:38.480
 mixture. Wow. Ray, one woman who works with families who are becoming

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.640
 pregnant, she's worked with midwives and she's worked with pregnant women

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:48.640
 directly. She said there definitely seems to be an increase in preeclampsia. So

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.120
 what you're saying is it sounds like this, and I'm asking you I guess, could

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:58.360
 it be from something as simple as not having enough salt and consuming way too

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:07.960
 much liquid? Yeah. Salt and protein, milk especially, because it comes

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:16.000
 with the calcium. Awesome. You mentioned earlier the B vitamins, vitamin A. Are

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.400
 there any prenatal vitamins that are on the market that could be good

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:29.720
 apart from just getting the vitamins and nutrients we need from food? I don't

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:39.800
 really know of any. Traditionally they have emphasized iron and the idea that

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:49.000
 women need more iron than men isn't true because estrogen gives women a powerful

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.720
 advantage for efficient absorption of iron. From a meager diet, estrogen makes

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:07.080
 you attract into the intestine about ten times as much iron as a man would. And

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:16.880
 the reason so many women seem deficient in iron isn't that they're losing some

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:25.560
 every month with menstruation, that's true, but since the average diet contains

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:33.720
 enough iron if they're absorbing it efficiently, the real cause for the

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:43.800
 apparent anemia is low thyroid function. Thyroid is what governs the formation of

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:52.040
 red blood cells and as the red blood cells form, if you have enough copper in

00:36:52.040 --> 00:37:02.840
 your diet that will attach the iron. I would guess it's more than half of the

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:11.440
 diagnosed iron deficiencies in women are really thyroid deficiencies. The

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:18.080
 temperature of your arms and legs powerfully governs your ability to make

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.840
 red blood cells and if your thyroid metabolism is low, your arms and legs

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:31.400
 tend to be cooler than optimal and so you slow down your production of red

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:39.640
 blood cells. That's great. Ray, one woman, I'm trying to connect some of these

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:45.040
 questions here, one woman had a question about iron, speaking of iron, and her

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:53.640
 teenage boy, she wanted to know is there a way for us to help my teenage

00:37:53.640 --> 00:38:01.000
 boy, my son, lower iron levels even though he's not eligible to donate blood yet?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.360
 Is he having symptoms of iron excess? I don't know anything other than the

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:16.680
 question I got from the woman. If a person simply goes on a milk and

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:25.080
 cheese heavy diet, a couple of eggs per day will provide the required amount of

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:34.280
 iron from them without an excess. If you just go without meat, meat or fish, things

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:44.640
 that are higher in iron, the milk and cheese are so low in iron, within a

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:54.200
 couple of weeks you will probably have normalized your iron stores. You can

00:38:54.200 --> 00:39:01.520
 often go on for many weeks without developing an iron deficiency on a milk

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:08.560
 and cheese based diet, but at some point you'll start craving foods that are

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:15.000
 rich in iron when you actually start needing iron. Awesome, that sounds like a

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.680
 good rule of thumb. Now iron excess is similar to like

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.480
 polyunsaturated fat excess, right? Over time that can be really problematic. Can

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:36.760
 you talk about that at all? Yeah, those interacting tend to start

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:46.520
 causing problems about the age of 45 or 50 or so. With aging, just eating an

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:54.480
 average diet, because the polyunsaturated fats tend to go into storage while

00:39:54.480 --> 00:40:02.880
 saturated fats are preferentially oxidized, just an average diet after

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:10.080
 several decades, your tissues become very high in the polyunsaturated fats.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:20.000
 On a typical American-European diet, we're all getting more iron than we need

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.680
 and so the liver and marrow and so on become overloaded with iron. A

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:36.400
 stress that makes us short of oxygen, the same thing that leads to lactic acid

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:43.400
 production, it's a shift in the reducing direction away from the oxidizing

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:54.520
 direction that turns iron atoms in the sources of reactive electrons producing

00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:04.480
 hydroxyl ions that cause tissue deterioration. And when the tissues are

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:10.240
 overloaded with phospholipids that have been constructed out of

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:18.160
 polyunsaturated fats, our very tissue structure starts being attacked by these

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:27.640
 hydroxyl activated free radicals of producing chain reactions of inflammation

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:34.720
 of toxic breakdown products that tend to destroy mitochondria and put the cell

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:43.320
 over into the glycolyzing lactic acid producing condition. Interesting, so while

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.560
 there are several foods a pregnant woman should definitely be aiming to include

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:53.240
 in her diet, polyunsaturated fat is something a pregnant woman should be

00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:02.560
 trying to avoid. Yeah, the studies in various species but for example cows

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:11.560
 that they're easy to study because they're used for meat and so the studies

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:19.200
 there are large amounts of tissue to examine, they find that newborn calves

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:28.440
 brains and other tissues are what we would, dieticians nowadays would say are

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:37.640
 deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids, but eating hay and grass

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:46.920
 and so on, very quickly the tissues start acquiring these polyunsaturated fats.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:56.080
 But even though the cow was eating a diet rich in the grass PUFA, polyunsaturated

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:04.240
 fats, the newborn calf was completely free of these in its brain and looking

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:12.120
 at humans, they are now saying that the full-term newborn baby typically is

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:19.640
 deficient in the essential fatty acids so they want to give them a supplement

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:26.840
 of these to make the tissue start accumulating them faster. But if you look

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:33.400
 at the brain metabolism of a healthy full-term newborn, their oxygen

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:39.680
 consumption is very high and their free radical toxic breakdown products in the

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:47.240
 blood are extremely low and in the first couple of years the brain and other

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:54.680
 tissues of healthy kids tend to be borderline deficient in the so-called

00:43:54.680 --> 00:44:01.360
 essential fatty acids and their brain metabolism and brain function ability to

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:08.600
 learn language quickly are very high and as the brain gets more and more

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:16.640
 saturated over time with the PUFA, the learning ability and the brain

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:24.800
 metabolism are slowing down. That process in an Alzheimer's brain, for example,

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:34.000
 prematurely aging, the polyunsaturated fats are extremely high and they are

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.520
 bound up with cholesterol so that the available cholesterol is very low but

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:49.760
 the potentially reactive toxic fatty acids are very high. That's a process you

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:56.760
 want to get to as late as possible and so you don't want to supplement the baby

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:05.080
 with these unstable highly oxidizable polyunsaturated fats. Many of the best

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:13.880
 hospitals now give premature babies intravenous soybean emulsion because of

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:23.520
 this absurd doctrine of essential fatty acids in the brain. Simultaneously at the

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:32.080
 University of California Riverside, professors found that animals brains

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:43.360
 were damaged by a single injection of soybean emulsion. Forty-five years

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:51.360
 previous to that, someone else demonstrated that injecting this soybean

00:45:51.360 --> 00:46:01.160
 emulsion, intralipid for example, into a rat's carotid artery, 17% of that

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:07.840
 injected emulsion stuck in the brain, was taken up directly into the brain as

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:15.240
 soybean oil, causing changes, microscopically visible changes from that

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:23.640
 one dose of soybean oil. So almost all the doctors in the country are going to

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:31.880
 be pushing pregnant women and their newborn babies to either eat fish

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:41.520
 oil or supplement with various kinds of polyunsaturated fats. It's basically an

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:52.200
 advertising campaign for industry that is counterfactual. Seems just fraudulent.

00:46:52.200 --> 00:47:01.440
 Yeah. So clearly to avoid maternal stress, one way to do that is to

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:07.320
 limit polyunsaturated fat as much as possible. Yeah. What are some non-dietary

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:18.080
 ways a woman can reduce stress during a pregnancy? Oh, doing interesting things.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:30.280
 Just avoiding things that are fatiguing. Resting as much as feels right.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:40.200
 Activity that feels good is fine, but whenever it seems desirable to rest,

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:49.480
 that's very important to do. Fifty years ago, it was recognized that bed rest

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:58.040
 sometimes was all that was needed to have a healthier delivery, but recently I

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:05.560
 heard doctors saying that there have been no controlled double-blind studies

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:12.560
 showing that bed rest was helpful for preventing miscarriage, so they didn't

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:22.840
 advocate it. Wow. Great. Thank you for that. This is so great. One woman asked,

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:28.320
 "Can you talk a bit about cholestasis and why that might occur during pregnancy?"

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:39.400
 About what was the word? Cholestasis. Say it again. Cholestasis. Am I saying it right? Oh, of the

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:47.640
 biome. Yes, yes, yes, yes. High estrogen is known to be the villain.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:55.120
 Just keeping your thyroid up, I think, is the essential thing. Thyroid and

00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:02.680
 progesterone are the treatment as well as the prevention. Awesome. Okay, thanks.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:10.440
 And another woman wrote, "The occurrence of cesarean births, specifically, have

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:16.240
 tripled, have more than tripled in the past 30 years, from about 6% of all

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:23.840
 births to now around 31% as far as statistics go." Wow, that's crazy.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.160
 "How might this impact the generation being born by cesarean?" is the first

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.400
 question from this woman, and the second question is, "What effect might this have

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:40.040
 on future generations?" I think the main statistical thing is that it's being

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:46.160
 done for the convenience of doctors and hospitals. They don't like to sit around

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:55.400
 waiting for the woman to be ready to give birth, and I think it often results...

00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:05.720
 they have a mechanical calendar model of when the delivery should happen. For

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:11.760
 example, if a woman is just slightly hypothyroid or just has a less than

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:19.920
 optimal ratio of progesterone to estrogen, they can mature the brain

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:25.680
 properly if they just stay pregnant for another month or so. There's

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.880
 nothing wrong with prolongation of pregnancy if the woman is still healthy

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:38.640
 and eating well, getting enough sugar and other nutrients delivered to the baby.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:49.160
 Just by an arbitrary definition of when the pregnancy should terminate, the

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:56.960
 hospitals are creating a lot of underweight babies, and if the baby is

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:03.000
 underweight, its brain is underdeveloped. And in those last three months of

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:15.360
 pregnancy, there's a tremendous... at month six, I think it's about twice as

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:23.160
 many brain precursor cells as will be there at full term. So during that last

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:32.480
 month, if you slow down the death of these brain precursor cells, you're going

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:38.720
 to massively increase the number of functional mature brain cells when the

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:50.040
 baby is born. And the process of brain growth is fastest in the last month, and

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:57.680
 if that's allowed to continue, the future of the baby is going to be healthier in

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:05.840
 every way. The brain is in control of the circulatory system, the immune system,

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:12.600
 metabolism, and so on. So it isn't just that the baby will get in the heart

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:20.880
 ridge, that it will have good immunity, circulation, general vitality if the

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:26.840
 brain is allowed to mature. That was great. Wow, you really you really covered

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:32.920
 a lot in that one. That's amazing. And I, yeah, it's just so sad that the doctors

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:38.360
 are on schedule and that's determining, it seems like, when they want women to

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:44.840
 give birth rather than just the natural course. Yeah, many things are tending in

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:53.320
 the same direction. For example, multiple vaccinations, I think, various

00:52:53.320 --> 00:53:02.720
 environmental pollutions, but one of those is multiple vaccinations and other

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:12.160
 over-medicalization. The history of birth weight and brain weight have been

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:20.040
 pretty steadily increasing for a hundred years or so. In the 1980s, in three

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:27.640
 countries, Japan, Germany, and the United States, brains stopped growing. In

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:33.400
 Germany, the body kept growing, getting bigger, heavier babies, but

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:40.840
 without a bigger brain in proportion. In Japan and the U.S., there has been

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:51.680
 actually a downward trend in head circumference at birth. Wow. Ray, you

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:57.800
 mentioned autism and vaccination, I mean, sorry, you mentioned vaccination. Your

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.200
 recent, one of your recent newsletters, which I thought was so great, and people

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:10.200
 can subscribe to that by writing to you at Ray P. Newsletters, at gmail.com, is

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:16.080
 that right? Right. It was just, it was great. Can you, can you briefly talk about

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:21.080
 maybe, several women actually asked about the autism connection with

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:27.400
 vaccinations and autism in general, why is autism increasing? Could you speak to

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:32.880
 that at all? Yeah, there have been several studies showing that a woman's

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:42.480
 estrogen balance during pregnancy strongly corresponds to the risk of

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:54.520
 autism. Estrogen creates inflammation and lactic acid excess. Inflammation in,

00:54:54.520 --> 00:55:07.920
 during gestation in animal experiments creates behavior that resembles autism.

00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:19.880
 The various things that contribute to inflammation during pregnancy include

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:31.080
 the aluminum adjuvants in vaccinations, not only the intentional aluminum

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:38.320
 adjuvant, but a lot of the junk. For example, if they grow the vaccine in a

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:44.440
 culture, the vaccines are known to contain contaminants from the culture

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:55.680
 medium, milk protein, egg protein, various things known, synthetic chemicals known

00:55:55.680 --> 00:56:04.480
 to be used in some of the culture media for producing vaccines. All of this junk

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:13.600
 is there producing inflammation. The purpose of the adjuvant is deliberately

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:21.360
 to produce an inflammatory state to activate the immune system to produce the

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:30.600
 antibodies, but an inflammatory state in every study that has investigated it in

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:37.280
 humans and animals both. Inflammation during pregnancy damages the nervous

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:45.600
 system of the fetus. The whole outcome of the organism's health is

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:52.320
 deteriorated by inflammatory conditions during pregnancy.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:59.040
 Wow. Ray, this question actually is, I think, related. Someone said we seem, and

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:04.000
 you talked about any kind of stress, any kind of inflammation in pregnancy which

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.600
 comes from stress, it can be detrimental. Someone said we seem to be so caught up

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:17.600
 recently with this idea of hormesis in our society, like that if you do

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.000
 something that's stressful that we're going to have like

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.800
 positive adaptation from it. That's another advertising ploy.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:37.120
 The radiation industry was a leader in developing the whole idea of hormesis.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:50.360
 If it's something that we produce in making atomic bombs or in doing our

00:57:50.360 --> 00:58:02.480
 CAT scans and so on, or radium technologies and so on, it goes way back

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:13.360
 to trying to explain away why some certain commercially valuable amount of

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:19.120
 poisoning isn't something that you can sue the industry for because it's really

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:26.960
 good for you. In the 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission was getting data that

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:35.760
 they were exploding bombs in Nevada. They were causing cancer in people in Utah

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:44.400
 and all of the downwind states, but especially in the nearest towns in Utah.

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:51.640
 To explain away the radioactive elements they were seeing in babies' teeth and

00:58:51.640 --> 00:59:01.440
 the increasing mortality in small children with leukemia and bone cancer,

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:07.360
 to explain that away, they invented the idea of hormesis, that these small doses

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:17.680
 are actually good for you. Incredible. They called their big project,

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:23.600
 one of their projects, they called it Project Sunshine. That was the one

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:30.800
 looking at the strontium-90 in babies. Oh my gosh. It sounded nice to call it

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:38.080
 Project Sunshine. Unbelievable. Wow. Ray, one woman asked in relation to the

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:45.040
 autism subject, she said, "If kids already have autism or they are on the

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:51.320
 spectrum," what's a good way to go about this? Are there any things we can do

00:59:51.320 --> 01:00:00.400
 to mitigate some of the effects of autism? Yeah, everything that's good for

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:08.720
 the brain of the developing baby is probably still good at any age for

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.400
 helping the cells to mature and function. Pregnenolone, progesterone,

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:22.480
 DHEA, all of these are at any stage of life, they're essential brain hormones.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:29.360
 There are some drugs that have been developed in relation to blood pressure

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:37.360
 and heart disease that probably are working on part of the inflammatory

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:47.120
 system. For example, ACE inhibitors, conferring enzyme inhibitors, and

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:55.520
 enzyme receptor blockers, and calcium blockers. All of these stabilize the

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:03.640
 living state of the cell. The way they're explained isn't necessarily

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:12.480
 very illuminating, but what they're doing is protecting cells against things

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:18.920
 like high estrogen, high lactic acid, deficient sugar, and deficient carbon

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:27.280
 dioxide, and so on. Oh, good to know. Awesome. Now, so Ray, this question is still

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.560
 related to pregnancy, during pregnancy. "What would be the best course of action,"

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:39.680
 this woman asked, "for someone who experiences frequent migraines?" My own

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.720
 migraines were one of the things that got me interested in studying brain

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:54.880
 physiology. And when I was about 10 years old, I noticed that girls were much more

01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:02.320
 likely than boys to have migraines, and that got me interested in the physiology

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:16.600
 of estrogen. And the two techniques that I came across, someone in the 1960s told

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:24.920
 me that eating a carrot every day often prevented headaches. I tried it, and it

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:38.320
 worked. And the method, someone studying fertility had one group of women who had

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:45.360
 frequent infections, and so they gave them a series of antibiotic treatments,

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:51.520
 and they found that their cyclic monthly migraines had disappeared when they were

01:02:51.520 --> 01:03:02.760
 taking the antibiotic. And it turns out that a carrot a day or an antibiotic has

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:10.680
 the same effect. The antibiotic is suppressing the inflammatory bacteria in

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:16.160
 the intestine. The carrot is, to some extent, suppressing them and carrying

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:23.920
 them out of the body. Following up on the antibiotic effect, they saw that the

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:31.800
 women taking the antibiotic had lower estrogen, lower cortisol, and higher

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:42.960
 progesterone. Same thing, we tested a few women without and with a daily carrot,

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.720
 same thing happened. Their estrogen and cortisol went down when they ate a daily

01:03:47.720 --> 01:04:01.120
 carrot. And then supplementing thyroid, I found that I wasn't so bound to my carrot

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:09.160
 addiction. The thyroid itself helps to lower estrogen and cortisol and keep your

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:18.920
 progesterone, DHEA, and pregnenoline up. And once when I, for example, in San

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:26.400
 Francisco, I was taking my thyroid supplement and not realizing that

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:37.240
 fluoridated water knocks out T3, destroys T3 totally. And I became suddenly very

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:46.840
 hypothyroid and developed a migraine. And I happened to have the progesterone and

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:53.440
 vitamin E. I took about 100 milligrams on my tongue. And within seconds, the

01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:02.080
 visual flashing effect started right at the center of my visual field, quieted

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:10.920
 down, and this area of visual quiet spread quickly during about 30 or 40

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:19.120
 seconds, covered my whole visual field. And a sense of well-being kept flowing.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.760
 And after about a minute, all of the sickness and headache had disappeared

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:33.560
 and I got sleepy. I experienced that effect twice, exactly the same effect of

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:41.440
 about 100, 150 milligrams of progesterone, quieting the visual effect within

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:47.480
 seconds and totally knocking out the headache in about two minutes.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:56.000
 Wow, that's amazing. Ray, with the carrot and the antibiotic, is like twice a week

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.440
 activated charcoal, would that be kind of a similar deal? The animal studies

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:08.960
 suggest, yeah, that it's doing much of the same. It has an antibiotic effect. The

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:20.560
 pores in the charcoal act as catalysts and break down endotoxin. So it's

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:30.720
 working chemically as well as an antibiotic. Great, awesome. This woman, Ray,

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.920
 asks about PCOS or polycystic ovary syndrome. She says, "How can I begin to

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:47.640
 correct it?" Having a vitamin D blood test probably is helpful. Vitamin D is

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:56.680
 one of the things widely recognized as helping it. And the animal experiments in

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:05.760
 which they would remove the thyroid gland and then give a gonadotropin to

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:13.360
 increase the estrogen production, that combination boosting the ovaries while

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:21.040
 cutting out the thyroid will reliably produce polycystic ovaries in animals.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:27.520
 And so that implies that you would want to start with normalizing the thyroid

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:33.880
 and then check on the balance of estrogen to progesterone, probably

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:42.640
 needing a supplement of progesterone to balance the overactive adrenals. When

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.640
 something like a hypothyroidism limits the ability of the ovary to make

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:57.960
 progesterone, the adrenals become hyperactive in response to the estrogen

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:05.080
 excitatory action. The adrenals aren't as good at making progesterone, so they

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:11.840
 make lots of testosterone, which has the same anti-excitatory protective effect.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:19.200
 But that becomes a vicious circle and you can break it with thyroid,

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:27.080
 progesterone, and vitamin D. Oh, great. Ray, this woman asked about labs

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:32.560
 too. You said about the labs, getting a lab done during pregnancy.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:38.440
 One woman asked, "What are the most helpful labs? Are there any other labs that

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:42.680
 would help during pregnancy to best understand current health status?"

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.880
 Yeah, making sure that your thyroid is good. Temperature and pulse are very

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:55.120
 important. Waking temperature and pulse rate and middle of the day, another

01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:03.240
 measurement. And any blood tests that would validate a good thyroid function.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:10.920
 But the ratio of progesterone to estrogen is very important. Some fertility

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:19.480
 clinics found that women whose progesterone was not 50 times or more

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:26.560
 higher than the estrogen were the ones who didn't get pregnant. So, if they had

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:32.920
 50 to 100 times as much progesterone as estrogen, they were the ones that would

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:39.640
 get pregnant. And then their ratio would tend to stay very good, heavily

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:47.280
 towards progesterone. And that's something that should be tested about at

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:52.680
 least twice during a pregnancy to make sure that the estrogen isn't creeping up.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:10:00.480
 In animal studies, if you make a graph of estrogen and progesterone, all of the

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.080
 animals studied, there is a constant increase, just a straight line of both

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:11.680
 progesterone and estrogen, but with the progesterone being many times higher

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:22.520
 until the day of delivery. The recognition in the medical world that

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:31.280
 most pregnancies are defective turns up as advice that your progesterone should

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.960
 level off after month six. But all of the animal studies say that the best

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:43.360
 pregnancies turn out when the progesterone has continued to rise

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:50.280
 steadily right up to the last days of pregnancy. Wow, that's great. The same

01:10:50.280 --> 01:11:02.520
 woman, Ray, asked, "Is metabolism linked to the length of gestation?" Yeah, a good high

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:09.800
 thyroid metabolism, keeping your blood sugar steady, letting you keep the

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:16.760
 progesterone increasing, not letting the estrogen get out of proportion. Since

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:24.240
 estrogen dominance triggers cortisol production, cortisol triggers premature

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.920
 delivery. So you want to keep your sugar intake high enough that your

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:39.320
 cortisol doesn't tend to rise terminating the pregnancy. Okay, great.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:45.920
 And is that because in general sugar can help? Yeah, the sugar is the

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:55.880
 primary limiting factor for brain growth. Chickens, for example, have very

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:05.320
 small brains. The egg holds only a certain amount of glucose and some of

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:13.400
 the protein can break down to make glucose, but an egg is a closed world.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:21.960
 The brain is known to stop developing when the glucose present in the egg is

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:29.880
 used up, but experimenters made a hole in the egg and then at the day that they

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:39.160
 knew that the glucose was reaching zero, they injected either glucose or

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:44.280
 amino acids that could be turned into glucose, and they found that the

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:52.120
 chicken's brain kept developing for the rest of its gestational period, producing

01:12:52.120 --> 01:13:03.360
 chickens with bigger brains than it ever happened naturally. So the amount of

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.840
 brain development in the case of a chicken isn't developmental, it's

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:16.000
 environmental. The egg just didn't hold enough glucose to finish making a smart

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.680
 chicken, and if your glucose is limited after the six months of

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:33.520
 pregnancy, the brain stops developing. In the 50s, experiments were done on dogs

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:40.160
 and other animals, and they found that if they gave a little bit of insulin, lowering

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:47.760
 the mother's blood sugar, the cell division in the fetus's brain came to a

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:55.240
 stop. If they added estrogen, same thing happened. Blood sugar dipped, the brain

01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:01.720
 stopped growing. On that note, Ray, would you say anything to a

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:11.800
 woman who has been tested as a gestationally diabetic? Oh, that was...

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:22.440
 First, there was the real diabetes, which was defined as high blood sugar and

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:29.800
 excess urination, leading to wasting away. The body tissues were being turned into

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:38.240
 sugar, so it was a wasting disease. So they developed a market for insulin, and

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:46.200
 they found that they could create a new type 2 diabetes and have a new

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:54.120
 market for selling insulin and then other drugs to lower the blood sugar.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:01.920
 That market was saturated, type 1 and 2 diabetes. They came up with gestational

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:13.880
 diabetes, but the old obstetricians, several of them have told me that they

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:20.200
 observed that women, diabetic women, so-called, who had high blood sugar

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:29.600
 during pregnancy often had babies with very large heads. I happened to talk to

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:37.200
 one of those women. Her doctor had sent her to me for a weight loss diet, and her

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:42.680
 blood sugar was only 130 or so, but the doctor told her she needed to stop

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:52.600
 gaining weight and not have another baby like the previous one. I said, "What's

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:59.240
 that baby like?" She said, "He's two years old, wears an adult hat, and reads adult

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:09.760
 literature." So I don't think the invention of gestational diabetes was

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:18.200
 very constructive. Great. Ray, this question comes from a woman. She's

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:24.200
 asking about extended breastfeeding, and she says she's asking if for those who

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.400
 are extending breastfeeding beyond two years or more, would there be

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.880
 any additional considerations as far as diet and supplementation? Yeah, drinking

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:45.440
 lots of milk. Some women whose milk seems to be limited, just drinking,

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.800
 adding a quart of orange juice to their diet, getting their sugar and

01:16:50.800 --> 01:17:00.440
 potassium up, is sometimes overcoming limited ability to lactate. But if you're

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.760
 doing it chronically for more than a year, you need to make sure you're

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:13.560
 getting lots of calcium and protein yourself. Awesome. Same woman asks, "Does

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:19.960
 the continued production of high levels of prolactin involved in breastfeeding

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.560
 necessary to lactate, does that have a negative impact on the breastfeeder

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:33.520
 itself?" If you keep your thyroid function up, you won't experience bad effects

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:41.800
 from that prolonged... the prolactin does guide metabolism towards producing milk,

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:49.160
 and thyroid is the other. It keeps your ability up to produce the sugar if

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:54.800
 you're getting lots of protein and carbohydrate and minerals in your diet.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:02.640
 The thyroid supports the lactation and it keeps your pituitary from over

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:10.400
 producing a stress-induced prolactin. So it would be good to have both the

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:20.040
 thyroid and the prolactin test maybe a year into lactation. Okay, great.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.080
 That's awesome. This woman asked about childhood allergies. Actually there

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:30.120
 were several women who wrote in about childhood allergies, specifically eczema,

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:36.720
 and they're asking what might this be caused by and how can we mitigate or

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:44.880
 help that. Some studies found that the women who were urged to supplement

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:51.760
 with things like fatty fish, high intake of omega-3 fats, those were the

01:18:51.760 --> 01:19:02.800
 women who had the most allergic children. So it's prenatal inflammation again.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:11.320
 Those fats aren't really very compatible with pregnancy and so they

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:19.840
 create a tendency to suppress the thyroid and maintain inflammation.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:26.320
 If a kid is having allergies, you should check especially their vitamin D

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:35.320
 and thyroid level. Sometimes supplementing those will make an allergy

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:43.160
 disappear. Awesome. Thanks, Ray. A few more here. These questions I think are

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.960
 great and they're obviously directly related to some concerns and some

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.920
 thoughts and just things that these women think I think are important, which

01:19:52.920 --> 01:20:00.560
 is great. This woman asked about reversing autoimmunity in the toddler.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:11.160
 Oh, progesterone has the most immediate effects against some things like

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:20.680
 rheumatoid arthritis and estrogen for a long time has been known as the main

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:27.600
 villain. Women have at least five times the incidence of all kinds of

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:36.520
 autoimmune diseases as men and so it's been known for several decades that

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:46.600
 estrogen creates these. Way back in the 50s, women who were getting the early

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:52.120
 estrogen treatments were coming down with horrible rheumatoid arthritis and

01:20:52.120 --> 01:21:00.120
 other autoimmune conditions, but the estrogen industry has diverted attention

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:09.120
 from that. Just by stopping taking supplements, I saw one woman in a week go

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:18.200
 from totally incapacitated by rheumatoid arthritis to having no symptoms just by

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:25.240
 stopping her medical estrogen supplement. Another woman with scleroderma

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:32.360
 was getting a hardening of the backs of her hands and her face just by stopping

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:41.560
 the estrogen. That cleared up. Adding progesterone has the same effect as

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:54.640
 withdrawing from estrogen. Normalizing thyroid function and maintaining a good

01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:03.560
 level of progesterone and vitamin D. So far I haven't seen it fail to stop the

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:10.720
 so-called autoimmune symptoms. Dry eyes is another one. Sometimes thyroid load

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:21.080
 does it, but all of the natural stabilizing factors, vitamin D, calcium,

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:28.400
 adequate protein, as well as the thyroid and progesterone.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:34.560
 That's great. Ray, this woman asks, "What is actually considered early puberty in

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:41.200
 children?" Another woman asks about preteen hormones and should I honor

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:48.160
 craving that my child might have for sugar, for example, or should I let them

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.400
 eat as much sugar as they want?

01:22:52.400 --> 01:23:04.480
 It's important not to keep sugar in your mouth steadily so it satisfies the

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:15.680
 appetite, but then rinse the mouth to reduce cavities. What was the first

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.680
 question?

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:20.960
 Yes, sorry about that. I kind of asked a few questions at once. The first

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:24.720
 question was, "What is actually considered early puberty in children?"

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:36.200
 It's just a statistical thing. I looked at the average age of puberty in girls

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:50.960
 in areas that were coconut-based economies. Their average age was 18. In

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.720
 animal experiments, polyunsaturated fats acting like estrogen, increasing

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:05.480
 estrogen production and activity, you can bring on puberty earlier with

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:12.840
 excess PUFA in the diet. My interpretation was that the coconuts in their

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:21.800
 diet were protecting against the estrogenic effects of polyunsaturated

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:29.680
 fats. The tendency in the last several decades has been for puberty to come

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:36.440
 earlier and earlier so that even 8 years old isn't considered extreme

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:48.320
 anymore. It had been that 9 years old about 40 years ago was notable as

01:24:48.320 --> 01:25:00.280
 early puberty, but 8 years, I think now, is in the same position that 9-year

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.440
 old puberty was 40 years ago.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:11.760
 Wow, that just seems awfully early, for sure. Back to the sugar question,

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.480
 because I kind of put those together. You mentioned something about keeping

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:20.000
 sugar in the mouth too long. Does that just mean maybe rinsing after you've

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.800
 consumed sugar being a good effective measure?

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:24.800
 Yes.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.600
 Rinsing with water and salt or what?

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.200
 No, just plain water.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.080
 Okay, great. Ray, there's two more questions here. One woman asked,

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.560
 actually three more questions. This is so great, by the way. Thank you so

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:47.360
 much for doing this. This woman asked about endometriosis, how that

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.320
 developed and why the tissue can become displaced in various spots in the

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.640
 body.

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:07.920
 The estrogen effect is to activate cell division and at an extreme,

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:14.960
 it increases the motility of the cells and the looseness. Progesterone

01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:21.240
 should come in quickly and change the development of the tissue into

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:30.840
 glandular tissue. I think the basic problem is low thyroid function. When

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:38.280
 your estrogen isn't eliminated quickly and progesterone isn't produced

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:45.760
 abundantly and quickly, then the endometrial cells keep getting the

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:56.200
 stimulus and besides growing excessively, they lose their tissue

01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:00.400
 integrity when there isn't enough progesterone. It's the same effect in

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:08.080
 the cancer cell. Cancer under the influence of estrogen becomes more

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:16.880
 likely to metastasize and progesterone makes it tend to stay put. All of

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:24.320
 the women that I've known who had very serious endometriosis, I cured it

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:30.800
 immediately when they corrected their hypothyroidism. Just an immediate

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.000
 turning off of all of the symptoms.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.520
 - Awesome. That's great, Rick. All right. I saved these last two

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.440
 questions because I thought they were kind of more general parenting kind

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:51.600
 of topics. The first was from someone who said, "What do you think is the

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.400
 ideal learning environment for a young human together with a young family?"

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.680
 - Together with what?

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:05.320
 - Together with a young child and the family. What's the appropriate or

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:10.040
 what's the optimal learning environment? Also schools, et cetera, is the

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.040
 question.

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:21.400
 - I think the optimal thing is to have an interesting environment and that

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:30.760
 includes having adults talking about interesting things, constantly being

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:44.040
 engaged in doing something that's interesting, which could be working. Any

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:49.000
 activity that is meaningful to the adult is going to be a learning

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:59.480
 experience for the kids. Experiencing adults being interested in life, I

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:05.080
 think, is the most important thing for kids to see that the world is

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:15.560
 intrinsically interesting and a matter for exploration, not for

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:16.560
 indoctrination.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.960
 - That's awesome. Ray, that's so great. The last question is, I guess,

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:30.080
 kind of related because it was, "Does Ray have any kind of parting message

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:34.880
 from this for parents?" I think you might have kind of talked about that, but

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:38.480
 the question was, "Would you have any kind of overriding message that you

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:45.200
 would give to parents of our next generation of people?"

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:59.440
 - To be watchful for imposed doctrines and ideologies and procedures, being

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:13.040
 critical of medical doctrines is just a starting point. The world, the

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:22.240
 culture has some very dangerous things that it wants to impose. You have to

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.840
 be watchful for the multiple ways those keep turning up.

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:32.080
 - We certainly have our work cut out for us, don't we?

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:32.880
 - Yeah.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:41.680
 - Ray, you're such a...I mean, this is such a bright light in so many ways. I

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.680
 really enjoy this. I also know that there's so many women who are going to

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:50.320
 listen to this and so many families and so many men and so many children who

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:54.560
 are actually going to hear this. I think we're all grateful for your time and

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:59.760
 your knowledge and your experience and your thoughtfulness. Thank you so

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.800
 much.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.440
 - Okay. Fun talking to you.

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:05.200
 - Likewise. Until next time.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.280
 - Bye.

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:09.920
 - Okay. Bye.
