00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.960
 (gentle music)

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:44.740
 - Well, very welcome to you all listening

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.860
 to Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.260
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.180
 - My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.300
 - We both trained in England and graduated there

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.100
 with a degree in herbal medicine

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.460
 and clients consult with us regarding their health issues

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.980
 and we recommend personalized advice in nutrition,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.340

 or on www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.180
 So a little departure from the last few years

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.540
 and definitely from Dr. Peat's altruistic

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.000
 and giving all of his time and his energy

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.460
 and his research.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.180
 I'm very excited to show you that tonight

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.340
 we are hosting two filmmakers,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.660
 Brad Abrahams and Jeremy Stewart,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.140
 who are producing a documentary film

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.580
 called "On the Back of a Tiger."

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.980
 They've interviewed eight maverick scientists,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.660
 including Dr. Ray Peat,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.020
 who weave an alternate story of life

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.220
 from the molecular level to consciousness and perception,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.380
 challenging the mainstream medical dogma

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.140
 with scientific research,

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.040
 illuminating radical new ways of understanding disease

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.440
 and its treatment.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.040
 I welcome Brad and Jeremy to "Ask Your Herb Doctor."

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.200
 Are you guys with us?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.160
 - Yes, we are. - Yes.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.840
 - Okay. - Great intro.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.080
 Sums it up nicely.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.920
 - Excellent.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.160
 Okay.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.480
 - Welcome Dr. Peat to the show.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.360
 - Yeah, hello.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.640
 - Oh, hi Dr. Peat.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.520
 - Seems like we have a threesome on the airwaves.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.600
 - Oh, great.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.120
 - Okay, so basically we've been very fortunate

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.840
 to interview you, Dr. Peat, for a number of years now.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.800
 And you frequently mention names during your discourses,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800
 and they're usually eminent scientists

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.600
 and groundbreaking alternative researchers

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.960
 whose view of mainstream medicine is alternative

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.440
 to the dogma, if not controversial.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.640
 Most people view the doctor as an all-knowing entity,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.640
 but many doctors fail to read the research

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.920
 that points to anything other than the dogma,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.560
 which is perpetuated by Big Pharma.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.840
 Up until the time that I just realized

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.240
 that Dr. Peat was gonna be with us a couple of minutes ago,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.440
 I had written a small outline for Brad and Jeremy,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.840
 apparently who've been exhaustively traveling Europe

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.560
 in the year 2014 to track down

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.840
 these eight principal scientists

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.880
 who they did manage to get one, two,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.280
 and three day interviews with, I think.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.280
 So I wanted to cover the timeline

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.880
 with which you started interviewing these scientists,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.880
 starting with Dr. May Wan Ho, and give each of you,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.200
 I don't quite know how we're gonna work this

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.280
 with both of you on the show.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.520
 I think one person will do one and the other will do another,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.600
 or you can both interject, and Dr. Ray, Peat, you too,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.840
 at the same time, you can all cut in.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.000
 I wanted to ask both of you two, though, Jeremy, first,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.680
 like I always have done with Dr. Peat,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.880
 if you would just give an outline

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.440
 of your professional and academic backgrounds,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.480
 perhaps starting with you, Brad.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.120
 - Sure, well, my background and Jeremy's are quite similar,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.040
 so it could cover both of us.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.400
 We both went to film school originally,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.560
 and very soon after graduating,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.520
 entered the advertising and commercial production world

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.120
 where we were trapped for many years,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.920
 pining away, trying to figure out a way

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.080
 to work on projects that were more meaningful to us

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.080
 and to other people, and you just can't do that

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.200
 with a full-time job.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.960
 It takes up so much of your energy,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.960
 creatively and physically, that we ended up quitting,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.240
 still working freelance for funds,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.080
 but spending more and more of our time now

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.400
 working on projects like these,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.840
 and we've focused specifically on this project now

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.560
 for the last year or so.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.120
 - Have you had any background reasons

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.000
 for pursuing this kind of health topic,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.800
 medical establishment approach to disease?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 Is anything pertinent in either of you

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.840
 that has kind of spurred this?

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.720
 - Yeah, you can go ahead, Jeremy.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.480
 - We both, I think, are sort of sensitive,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.880
 fragile people in that way,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.880
 like as far as always being more aware

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.040
 of what we eat and sensitive to the environment.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.160
 You know, some people are maybe more hypothyroid than others,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.720
 as Ray might say.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:15.480
 And so I think we both had similar interests.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.360
 That's how we became friends in the first place

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.440
 while working together, seeing that reading about,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.600
 I think, on World's Healthiest Foods

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.200
 was when we first had our first conversation

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.200
 and realized that we had a lot in common.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.880
 But seeing health problems in friends and family

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.640
 who couldn't find solutions,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.440
 I think that's always been a background

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.360
 and having an interest in science.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.840
 - Yeah, it was originally for myself

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.400
 just things like really bad digestion, allergies, fatigue,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.840
 and a lot of it, I think, came with overworking

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.720
 and just the confines of the modern world.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.120
 But more recently, it's been seeing deteriorating health

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.840
 of family and friends, and in particular,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.240
 my father, who's been, in the last couple years,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.400
 had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.840
 And I was already skeptical of the establishment,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.160
 medical establishment, but just seeing the bad science

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.160
 and really suspect motives, particularly with this disease,

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.680
 really spurred a sense of urgency,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.200
 creating a project like this.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.040
 - Okay.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.200
 - And Jeremy and Brad, I was wondering,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.080
 how did you first find out about Dr. Peat?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.800
 Because I know you wanted this film,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.360
 and initially, you were thinking this film

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.200
 was going to be focused solely on Dr. Ray Peat.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.160
 How did you first hear about Dr. Peat?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:51.280
 - Well, I was introduced to him by Brad.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.640
 - By Brad, you found him through Danny Roddy?

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.960
 - Yeah, originally, Danny Roddy.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.640
 I had been on the roller coaster of diets

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:07.800
 and in need of recovery and had found Danny's site

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.520
 that had mentioned Dr. Peat and just found it

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.440
 so fascinating, someone looking at health and nutrition,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.880
 starting at the molecular level

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.880
 and actually really understanding that,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.880
 having such a solid grasp of the biochemistry.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.480
 It took a long time.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.960
 The work is dense and hard to understand

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.520
 for someone without a scientific background.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.800
 So it took a long time.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.800
 It took actually a couple years of reading and listening

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.040
 and talking with Jeremy and others

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.080
 to really have a grasp on the unique view

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.680
 and also self-experimentation with diet

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.320
 and certain lifestyle things

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.720
 that really ended up having quite a large impact,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.440
 I think, in both of our healths.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.160
 - Definitely, and it was a while.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.280
 We were aware of reading Ray's work

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.320
 for quite a long time before we talked about

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.480
 the idea of doing a documentary.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.800
 I think it coincided and somewhat inspired

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.960
 doing something, getting into a project

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.120
 that was more meaningful than outside

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.400
 of the commercial world that we'd been in for so long.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.720
 - Wow, that's excellent.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.880
 Well, all this talk about Dr. Ray Peat,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.000
 I think we need to ask Dr. Ray Peat

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.600
 what your professional and academic background is

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.880
 if there's listeners tonight that have not heard our show

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.200
 in previous months.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.360
 - I was studying art and literature as an undergraduate

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.040
 and did my master's thesis mostly on William Blake.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.040
 And all that time, I was interested in life in general

00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:01.280
 and saw biology as a way to get some concrete facts

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.000
 that would confirm alternative views

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.600
 because I saw in the humanities dogma

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.600
 and political opinions influencing

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.880
 what was teachable in the universities.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.880
 And I thought that real science might have relevance

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.160
 to the humanities.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.160
 And as soon as I enrolled at the University of Oregon

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.600
 to work on a PhD in biology,

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.400
 after taking a few years out in between my master's,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.880
 I quickly realized that biology was exactly

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:57.760
 as unscientific as linguistics, philosophy,

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.560
 literature, and so on.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.200
 Ideology was right at the center of nerve biology.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.280
 And so I wrote to Gilbert Ling,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.120
 and I told him what my professors were teaching,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.240
 that he and others had shown to be profoundly wrong

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.640
 20 years previously.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.720
 And he answered, said,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.520
 "You just don't understand what science is.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.080
 "Science is all about prestige and money."

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.080
 - And so what year was that that you wrote to Gilbert?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.160
 - 1968, I think, in the fall when I started the university.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.080
 And just after a few more months

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.720
 working with the nerve biology brain people,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.840
 I found that the reproductive biologist

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.680
 was actually a scientist who,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:00.840
 when I observed things that were counter to the dogma,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.680
 he said, "Is it repeatable?

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.480
 "Then go ahead."

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.080
 - Great, so he had an open mind to science.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.800
 - Yeah, and the nerve biologist said

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.040
 he wouldn't even look at the experiments that I was doing.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.480
 All of my experiments showed something

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.200
 contrary to the nerve dogma.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.840
 And my professor would just turn instantly

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.160
 so he didn't have to see what the instruments were showing.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.920
 - Excellent, that is the thrust of,

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.880
 and I definitely haven't spoken to you, Dr. Peat,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.840
 since early on in the week

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.000
 before we even invited Brad and Jeremy to the show,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.800
 but that's exactly the thrust of where tonight's show's going.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.440
 So the scientists that we mentioned earlier,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.240
 well, sorry, we haven't mentioned the scientists yet,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.880
 but I was saying earlier that you have,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.920
 in the course of the last several years,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.120
 whenever we do radio shows,

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.440
 we will always throw out these eminent scientists' names

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.560
 and we look at them like Gerald Pollack and May Wan Ho

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.920
 and Gilbert Ling, et cetera.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.760
 And Jeremy and Brad took it upon themselves

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.520
 to go take a list of these people

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.560
 and go see if they could track them down and film them.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.400
 - I know, I wanna know how that came about

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.920
 when Jeremy and Brad were talking to you, Ray.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.680
 - Well, one minute, I just wanted to say

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.880
 at this point in time in post-production,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.360
 sorry, pre-production, the editing stage,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.360
 they have produced a fantastic couple of minutes movie clip

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.280
 showing all the different people that they've interviewed.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.360
 And these people are all on the cutting edge.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.120
 They're all PhD, they're professors,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.600
 they're research scientists.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.960
 They're all very respectable people

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.360
 who've produced works in published journals, et cetera.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.520
 And they are directly refuting some long-held tenets

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.880
 and dogma of science that most people

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.800
 just get faced with by their doctors

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.200
 because the doctors are not reading research.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.840
 So the whole thrust of tonight's show

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.160
 was not only to bring out these scientists

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.640
 and their various different aspects

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.440
 of what they're looking at in science,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.800
 but to let people know that they can find out more

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.920
 about this movie that's being created

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.920
 by going to www.perceivethinkact.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.400
 So perceivethinkact is the main link.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.960
 - Dot com. - Dot com, of course.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.040
 Or you can just put that perceivethinkact

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.200
 in a Google search term, Google search bar.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.640
 It'll take you straight to their website

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.200
 and you'll be able to see the work that they're doing.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.680
 So yeah, the main thing is I wanted to go through

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.400
 the different scientists that Dr. Peat's mentioned in past

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.800
 that Jeremy and Brad went to see on different continents

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.680
 and get a feeling for the kind of science

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.960
 that they've put together in I don't know how many hours.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.760
 How many hours do you think you took altogether

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.520
 and how many hours do you think the DVD will be?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.360
 - Oh, well, in terms of raw footage so far,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.360
 we've shot hundreds of hours.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.600
 - Yeah, 200 hours.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.520
 - Yeah, the final project will be a feature film length,

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.520
 but perhaps we're gonna explore maybe shorter series

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.400
 that could cover more ground as well.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.400
 - In depth, okay, cool.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.640
 - Okay, so Dr. Peat, how did you come up with the idea

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.280
 for Brad and Jeremy or Brad and Jeremy,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.200
 how did you come up with it

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.520
 to interview these other scientists?

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.800
 - Well, it was the original conversation we had

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.520
 with Dr. Peat talking about this idea.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.120
 And he mentioned or had asked had we thought

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.200
 about talking to Harold Hillman

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.840
 and we had heard of Harold Hillman,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.120
 but hadn't really looked into him.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.760
 And he mentioned a couple other names,

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.760
 Miao Wan Ho, and we started diving deeper into their work

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.480
 and realizing there's a much larger story to tell here.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.800
 And that really sparked this quest

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.800
 to then sort of check off all of the people

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.960
 who's what seem like disparate theories,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.200
 Ray has connected the dots and woven together

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:00.200
 into what we think is a fairly cohesive new model

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.200
 for the workings of life.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.120
 - That's why I keep telling Dr. Peat,

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.720
 we need to write a book that's called the Peat Manual

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.680
 instead of the Merck Manual, you know, it's a Peat Manual.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.640
 - Who knows?

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.320
 Okay, so let's start with Dr. Miao Wan Ho,

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.840
 just because you have firsthand knowledge of her

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.720
 and you've met her and maybe you can just give

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720
 an outline of Miao Wan Ho's background,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.960
 her philosophy and you know, her character.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.280
 - She's covered a lot of different topics.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.320
 I think probably what she's known for being

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.440
 most controversial on is GMOs,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.840
 but mainly what we talked to her about

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.640
 is her study of basically quantum biology

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:50.240
 and the crystalline structure of organisms.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.440
 And she did a number of experiments

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.600
 using a type of microscope that's,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.680
 I think generally used in geology.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.400
 And it's basically uses polarized light

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.920
 and allows you to look at generally like

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.040
 the structure of crystals and rocks.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.480
 But she found that the small organisms

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.680
 had the same sort of crystalline structure

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.000
 in a liquid form.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.880
 And I think that was kind of an inspiring

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.880
 paradigm shifting thought to her.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.720
 - Okay.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.920
 - And it fits in with things like, you know,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.320
 structured water and thinking about the organism

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.680
 in a way that it's in the mechanistic views of science

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.960
 and various sorts of chemical biology

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.880
 is totally counter to that type of thinking.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.480
 - Okay.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.400
 - So she wrote the book "Rainbow and the Worm,"

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.040
 which is kind of all about that.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.280
 - "Rainbow in the?"

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.120
 - I think it's called "The Rainbow and the Worm."

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:52.960
 - "And the Worm."

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.480
 - "And the Worm," okay, got it.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.320
 Okay.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.320
 - And that also, those findings to her

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:08.200
 that connected with criticisms against neo-Darwinism

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.000
 as well, if the organism is not fundamentally

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.560
 so mechanistic and much more fluidic and subtle,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.560
 then it would support, lay support to the theories

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.080
 more in line with Sidney Fox and others.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.920
 - Okay.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.560
 Well, Dr. Peat, given that you are on the show,

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.720
 let's just quickly ask you of a rundown for Maywan,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.800
 if you like, just because you've always,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.400
 you're the one that's been mentioning her

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.800
 in the first instance.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.560
 What springs to your mind?

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.440
 - That image of the worm really is one

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.440
 of the most important things that people

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.720
 should start thinking about.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:56.800
 The quantum biology, I think Albert George,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:04.800
 actually was the one that motivated people

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.360
 to start going in the direction of electronic biology

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.400
 and a coherent view of the cell.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.240
 Maywan Ho is to a great degree an extension

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.400
 of some of Albert George's ideas.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.240
 - Okay.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.240
 All right, well, moving on to Harold Hillman,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.960
 and I think he's the next person.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.120
 Yeah, first of all, when did you first interview Maywan Ho?

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.960
 What data are we looking at now?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.920
 - Well, we actually started with Harold Hillman.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.840
 - Oh, you did, I'm sorry.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.800
 - Yes, but only a few days before Maywan Ho,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.400
 and it was around the 15th of April of last year.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.240
 - Okay.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.080
 - Yeah.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:49.920
 - So you went to England.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.600
 - Yes, we went.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.800
 - It was, yeah, planning our first trip,

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.240
 we wanted to knock several interviews out at once,

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.880
 and there were several people in England.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.760
 So there was Harold Hillman and Maywan Ho was like,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.200
 Harold was our first interview,

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.800
 and then two days later, we went to see Maywan.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.240
 - So tell me a little bit about Harold Hillman

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.720
 and his background and what he was like

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.120
 and what he's contributed to the documentary.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.440
 - Well, the crux of his work is his criticisms

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.080
 of traditional microscopy as well as electron,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.360
 the use of the electron microscope,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.800
 in that most of the structures we see

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.360
 when we're looking through them are artifacts,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.080
 and this is because of the processing

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.680
 that what was once living material has to go through,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.120
 and it would make your head spin hearing him list

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.560
 all of the things that, the dehydration, dying, smashing,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.800
 and what you're left with is something

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.480
 that bears almost no resemblance to an actual living cell,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.040
 so then how can you learn about the living cell

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.120
 when what you're looking at is basically artifacts?

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.720
 - And is he saying that this is still happening

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.240
 in mainstream biology, this is still the norm?

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:09.160
 - Oh, yeah. - Yes, yeah, yes.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.440
 - He made a film, sorry, on YouTube,

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.440
 there's old films of his that you can watch,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.680
 and it's still, it's pretty pertinent today.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.720
 It's really simple, which is what I think

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.840
 makes his criticisms so inflammatory,

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.840
 is he just shows a side-by-side

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.320
 of a cell being prepared for a microscope slide,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.280
 and you've got the living cell on one side

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.440
 looking like a transparent blob,

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.520
 and then after it goes through all of the steps

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.080
 of being washed in alcohol and various other compounds,

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.800
 it's like about a third the size

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.280
 and all squashed and squiggly-looking.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.520
 - Does he do anything with live blood microscopy?

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.840
 - Not himself personally, but he did,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.440
 we asked him about the techniques currently in use

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.080
 that do let you look at, or at least more accurate

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.800
 than light microscopy, or the electron microscope.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.480
 And going back to what Dr. Peat had experienced

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.280
 when he was a student, his professor

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.040
 not even wanting to look at what he was doing,

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.040
 similar with Dr. Hillman, his work was so difficult

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.320
 to criticize that people would just leave the room

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.040
 when he would come in.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.120
 At scientific conferences, they would literally

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.160
 turn around and run away because they just didn't want

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.600
 to hear him speak.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.400
 - They'd rather keep their paycheck coming in

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.600
 than actually look at what science might be showing them.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.920
 - Unfortunately in the medical world

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.720
 and/or the scientific world, the ego I think

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.840
 gets in the way so much that people don't even see

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.480
 the truth when it's right in front of them.

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.480
 But yeah, at the same time, there are people

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.400
 that have very alternative ways of looking at things

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.000
 like Dr. Peat and the people that you've seen,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.040
 so this again is a part point of your documentary

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.120
 is to illustrate, I think from that first instance

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.720
 you talked about Harold being the first person

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.520
 you saw, that's pretty interesting

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.280
 because he's the person who you're saying

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:09.440
 is refuting a lot of what microscopy is revealing.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.680
 - Yeah, exactly. - Where it all stems from.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.240
 Yeah, rotten foundations basically.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.080
 - Okay.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.840
 - There was a famous Swedish electron microscopy expert

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.840
 named Fridtjof Shostran who did a lot of studies

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:29.840
 or did a lot of very clear explanation

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.120
 using different fixatives showing how profound

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.120
 the artifacts are in standard preparations

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:44.120
 and he was a mainstream researcher

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.040
 but the mainstream simply overlooked

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.000
 his work on the artifacts.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.080
 - Okay, well let's move on to Dr. Gerald Pollack.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.600
 A lot of people that are listening to the show

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.040
 may well have mentioned, sorry, may well have heard

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.320
 his name mentioned in the past and may well know him

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.640
 from his structured water.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.720
 He's kind of water, he's called the water wizard

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.120
 I think they call him.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.520
 - Yeah.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.200
 - Go ahead, either one of you want to start

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.200
 and tell us a little bit about Gerald Pollack

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.680
 and what you gained from his interview.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.280
 - Well yeah, he's really known probably more widely

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.440
 than anyone else that we've interviewed so far

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.760
 as far as having, he's got mainstream talks.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.760
 He's done a TED talk and his focus today

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.880
 is really on what they generally call structured water,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.440
 another phase that, you know, it's one of those topics

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.480
 I think he's really unpopular in his department

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.680
 because he has chosen to study something

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.880
 that seems like obviously it's already been figured out.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.840
 But they do some fairly simple experiments

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.240
 to show that there are more unusual

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.360
 electrically based forms of water

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.560
 and they create, they call it easy water,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.920
 the exclusion zone when you get the water

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:14.840
 building up on a surface and it purifies itself,

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.520
 basically everything becomes excluded from it.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.840
 And that seems to be the exact kind of water,

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.160
 how water's structured inside cells.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.480
 So it has all sorts of implications

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.160
 for further understanding biology.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.960
 - He found that one of the substances

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.720
 that seems to create easy water or structured water

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.280
 with the most affinity is aspirin.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.080
 - Interesting.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:45.920
 - Which we found, yeah, very interesting

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.120
 in that it has such broad effects in the body

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.040
 and if it's connected to that attribute of it.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.280
 - Yeah, the stabilizing effect of water.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.560
 - Okay, Dr. Peat, I know you've always been a proponent

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.960
 of aspirin for quite a wide range

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.120
 of different conditions, inflammatory generally,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.120
 but do you have anything to say on Gerald Pollack?

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.120
 - Oh, everything he's been doing in recent years

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.960
 is just extremely interesting.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.960
 He has developed some theories on how light energy,

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:31.320
 infrared is used in building structure in water

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:36.080
 and there's a young German named Andrei Sommer,

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.360
 S-O-M-M-E-R, who is working with red light

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.640
 structuring water.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.040
 Very similar and very concrete demonstration

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.160
 of what on a bigger scale,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.160
 Patterson, Gerald is working on.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.880
 - So is that some of the reason why red light

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.000
 is so anti-inflammatory, because of its effects

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 on the water of the cell?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.160
 - Yeah, I think that's part of it.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.080
 - Well, it's a good time of year

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.320
 to get your red light, folks.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.480
 It's nice and sunny here in California.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.440
 - It was also just really heartening to see Gerald's lab.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.280
 You know, it's easy to feel gloomy

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.280
 when pondering all the ills

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.040
 in our medical and scientific establishments,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:29.040
 but Gerald's lab is full of young and excited,

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.320
 inspired scientists that are working

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.400
 on all sorts of interesting endeavors

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.400
 that it made us hopeful for the next generation.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.040
 - Yeah, one of his students,

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.040
 who I think is sort of the top guy under him now,

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.120
 originally did a project trying to disprove him.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.360
 And I think he spent a year,

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.160
 and then he proved to himself, basically,

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:05.160
 that Gerald was doing good science and joined his side.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.280
 - Excellent.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:07.880
 Okay, so from the first three that we've mentioned,

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.720
 then, May Wan Ho, Harold Hillman, and Gerald Pollack,

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.720
 they're all doctors, but didn't say that to begin with.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.280
 So starting with May Wan Ho,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.480
 then looking at polarized light and quantum biology,

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.000
 criticizing the neo-Darwinism that's kind of so prevalent

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.640
 in the scientific community.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.160
 And then Harold Hillman, the microscopist,

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.920
 looking at microscopy as,

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.200
 or what's being done in microscopy as being poor science

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.720
 and actually very damaging, if you like,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.720
 to the subject that's being visualized,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.960
 and how that can impact various experiments.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.480
 And then also, then, Gerald Pollack and structured water.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.320
 So I know we've got several other scientists

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.680
 that I'd like you to cover that you've been with,

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.000
 but first of all, just let me let people know

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.840
 who are listening.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.960
 This is "Ask Your Obdoctoran," K.M.E.D. Garbleville, 91.1 FM,

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.720
 and we're interviewing Jeremy and Brad,

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.280
 and let me just get this right.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.400
 It is Jeremy Stewart and Brad Abrahams.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.000
 - Yes. - And Dr. Peat is with us,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.480
 although I thought Dr. Peat actually

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.840
 was gonna have the evening off.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.000
 (laughing)

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.960
 - Well, we're glad that he's here.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.520
 - Yeah, we're very glad too, Dr. Peat.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.360
 So we definitely appreciate that.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.200
 But these two gentlemen are documentary filmmakers,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.000
 and they have done the seemingly impossible

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.440
 and interviewed eight of these scientists

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.080
 that Dr. Peat has been talking about for many years now

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.320
 when he brings out his various different anecdotes,

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.600
 as he always does,

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.480
 and have producing a fantastic documentary film,

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.720
 kind of unifying all of the theories,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.200
 I think in some ways, that Dr. Peat is able to understand

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.520
 that all these people working in their individual fields

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.800
 are contributing all the same sort of unifying knowledge

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.880
 to an approach and a framework to approaching disease

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.440
 that is so radical, and hopefully it's about time

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.400
 for mainstream science to wake up

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.880
 and some people to see what's going on.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.720
 We've always said, you know,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.080
 for those who have ears, listen and let them hear.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.080
 So they can be reached at www.perceivethinkact.com.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:13.600
 So go ahead and check them out on the web

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.800
 and see the work they're doing.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.760
 It's really quite special.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.440
 So let's move on then, Brad and Jeremy,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.640
 to Dr. Gilbert Ling.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.160
 And tell us a little bit about this fellow.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.840
 And I think actually, in some ways,

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.800
 this next couple of people seem to be getting on

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.960
 in their years.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.240
 They've been doing it for a long time.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.160
 So let's talk about Gilbert Ling.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.200
 - Well, Gilbert, I think now is 96, I believe.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.200
 And when we saw him, he was in shockingly good health,

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.280
 living alone in a mansion,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.200
 basically running up and down the stairs,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.960
 doing everything for himself.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.520
 The only issue really being his hearing.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.320
 But recently he had a health complication

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.800
 and is now not able to live on his own, unfortunately.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.800
 Yeah, but he seems to be getting back to his old self,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.320
 which is good to hear.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.160
 But it's really difficult to sum up

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.200
 Gilbert's past and achievements,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.920
 but he's most known for disproving

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.880
 the sodium pump hypothesis,

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.880
 which is at the root of all basically thought on--

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.280
 - Physiology.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.760
 - Physiology and the role of the cell membrane

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.160
 in that sodium pump hypothesis.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.240
 And his hypothesis,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.080
 called the association induction hypothesis,

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.160
 it basically details a totally different,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.160
 totally unconventional model of how the cell works.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.760
 - And it's based only on physics and chemistry.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.680
 - Right, actual science.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.280
 Yeah, that's what's so forward thinking about it.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.960
 - It's scientific and reproducible,

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.960
 you're saying, it's something that--

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.840
 - Yeah, and he's done possibly thousands of experiments

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.200
 showing the work and proving it

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.080
 that have all but been ignored.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.840
 And they won't even, if he submits a paper to,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.440
 even on an unrelated subject to any journal,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.040
 they reject it just saying--

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.880
 - Immediately.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.840
 - Yeah, they don't even read it.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.800
 They just send him a rejection notice because of his name.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.080
 - Wow, now Dr. Peat, I know that

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.200
 when we've spoken to you in the past,

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.560
 and I, again, unfortunately went through an education

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.680
 where it was very science-based

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.120
 and it was the same kind of erroneous science.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.960
 - Not really science-based, it pretended to be science-based,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.680
 but really it was just medical dogma.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.320
 - We still had sodium pumps and potassium pumps

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.200
 and all that kind of stuff moving,

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.120
 allowing things to be transported across the cell.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.280
 And I know, Dr. Peat, that you're very anti

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.760
 the membrane pump idea,

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.600
 saying that actually cells are very fluid and elastic

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.560
 and they flow and they move and they make space

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.840
 between the cells for things to enter and exit.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.880
 And actually this is a much better and holistic approach

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.760
 to the physiology of the cell.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.600
 - Yeah, wasn't the cell membrane theory

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.920
 just brought about by big pharmas

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.280
 so they could try to explain how their drugs are working?

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:17.360
 - Well, sort of, I think it really relates to neo-Darwinism

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:25.800
 and the genetic idea that they want to get away

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:31.760
 from the idea that life is somehow stable.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:37.000
 And so it's more like a machine which has to run

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.320
 to keep itself in a given state.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.960
 But Gilbert Ling showed that even if you turn off

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.960
 the energy supply, the cell is stable for many hours.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:55.040
 The sodium keeps going in and going out,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:00.360
 but the cell retains the life-like imbalance

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.320
 between sodium and potassium.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.280
 And all of the life-like properties don't require energy.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.000
 They simply require the structure of the water

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.640
 and the whole living system.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.920
 And there are just apparently in the infinite number of ways

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:25.640
 of looking at that that confirm Gilbert Ling's view,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.640
 but the absurd, the need to see things

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.320
 in this mechanical way makes people overlook the facts

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.600
 and believe absurd things.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:45.600
 - In an electron microscope course that I took,

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.480
 I decided to try different fixatives.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.960
 I had read Sjostrand's, some of his publications,

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.600
 and simply by using a different fixative,

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.600
 my cells were nothing but membranes,

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.160
 membranes all the way through.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.240
 (laughing)

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.240
 And so I looked at the origin of how they got

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:16.520
 the first membrane, and in an old medical book,

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:21.520
 19th century ideas, I saw that doctors treated ulcers

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.400
 and burns with osmic acid, osmic tetroxide,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.960
 to create what they called the false membrane.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.560
 And that was a standard medical term.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.560
 So it was in the consciousness of the people

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.280
 who were working on cells.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.640
 And the first preparations for electron microscopy

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.400
 of cells showed no membranes at all,

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.560
 but they believed that there had to be membranes.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.800
 And apparently someone recalled that old medical concept

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.960
 of creating a false membrane to seal up a wound,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:06.600
 and they applied the osmic acid to living cells

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.040
 and created, in fact, a membrane,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.160
 which was about 10 times thicker

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:17.120
 than they eventually decided they needed.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.720
 And so they refined the technique.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.400
 Now they have approximately the right thickness of membrane.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.640
 (laughing)

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:28.320
 - And just how they've never been able to find

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:32.440
 one of their hundreds of pumps that they've invented.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.560
 - And any time there's a new thing

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.680
 that goes in and out of the cell,

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.960
 they have to create a new pump,

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.960
 add a new pump to the list?

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.800
 - If you wash all of the ions out of hair

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.480
 and dip hair in the serum,

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.480
 it picks up the proper ions and excludes sodium.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:56.560
 So apparently dead hair has all of the necessary pumps.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.200
 The working pumps.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.040
 (laughing)

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.560
 - Okay, well let's move on.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.400
 Go ahead, go on.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.040
 - I was gonna say one more thing about Gilbert Lang

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.600
 that I think he's not more well-known

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.400
 because he's got an impressive academic career.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.200
 He's really intelligent,

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.520
 and he speaks at such a high level

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.720
 that it's pretty difficult to follow along

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.920
 sometimes what he's saying,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.560
 unless you have degrees in biochemistry.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.400
 And so reading his books is really challenging,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.720
 especially for a layman.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.120
 Even for a scientist.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:29.960
 - Yeah.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.240
 - Well, that's why we appreciate Dr. Ray Peat so much.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.080
 - Exactly.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.920
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.840
 - Because you're able to put all these pieces together

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.160
 and make a coherent picture that we can understand.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.560
 - So let's go on to, let's see here, Dr. Michael Persinger.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:49.080
 - He was one that was not initially on our list,

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.520
 but someone that Brad and I both had mutual interest in

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.200
 prior to ever, I think, even hearing about Ray.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.880
 But we were really surprised at how well he entered up

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.400
 fitting in in the interview phase.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.400
 And I guess he is listed as studying parapsychology.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.320
 But basically he's done a huge amount of work

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.320
 on the effects of fields on life, on consciousness.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.440
 And he's most well-known for what's now

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.880
 a very old experiment.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.560
 And if you just search for the God Helmet on YouTube,

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.800
 you'll see videos on that experiment showing

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.160
 electromagnetic stimulation of the right hemisphere

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.360
 inducing a sensed presence in quite a few people.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.840
 - Okay, as if they perceive something,

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.160
 they perceive a person or...

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.840
 - Yeah, and it's like a closed eye experience

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.480
 in a sealed room wearing a scooter helmet.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.440
 And for, you know, it's an experience that's induced

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.960
 in people who seem to be sensitive to it

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.880
 and then totally filtered by their cultural eye.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.800
 Like if someone was highly religious,

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.600
 they might have some kind of God experience.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.440
 - Okay.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.280
 - And so that, well, that's kind of, I think,

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.080
 what most people know him from.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.640
 But he's done decades of other more advanced work since then.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:22.960
 But he has lots to say about operating in the system,

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.960
 doing controversial study and proposing radical ideas

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:33.320
 and doing good science and, you know, showing the effects.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.240
 Basically, I think it's really controversial

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.760
 to do anything with fields.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.680
 - Okay.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:43.120
 - And he's done a lot of work showing how sensitive life

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.480
 is to electromagnetic fields.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.160
 - How many, I just have to ask a question here at this point.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.200
 How many of these people that you've interviewed

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.200
 up to this person, Dr. Michael Pettinger, are marginalized?

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.000
 - All of them.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.840
 - All of them, really?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.080
 - Yeah, I'd say the one who's least marginalized

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.360
 is Gerald Pollack, but even in his case, he's often--

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.880
 - He's treading a fine line, huh?

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.880
 - At risk of his, I mean, he's had his funding

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.040
 taken away from him and is always at risk of that.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.680
 And as well as constant attacks from other professors

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.120
 that feel threatened.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:24.920
 Michael Pettinger has seemed to have carved out a niche

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.800
 for himself in the bitter north of Canada

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.240
 at a small university.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.280
 And I think that that allows him to do what he wants to do

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.960
 and have the facilities that he needs to do it.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.160
 - He doesn't have the same introspection, huh?

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.000
 (laughing)

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:40.840
 Okay.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.480
 - Maybe it's because he's in Canada.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.560
 - Well, let's move on to the next person on the list.

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:49.880
 Probably one of my, I'm probably more,

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.040
 I'm as drawn to this person as I am to Dr. Harold Hillman,

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.480
 just because Dr. Harold Hillman's British,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.560
 but Dr. Fred Kummerow, he's 100 years old now, isn't he?

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.200
 And he looks so good for his age, folks.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.520
 If people that are listening here, Dr. Fred Kummerow,

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.400
 K-U-M-M-E-R-O-W, he's 100 years old.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.280
 And I'm sure Dr. Peat will have something to say about him

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.640
 as well as both of you, Brad and Jeremy,

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.640
 but he was very into demonizing polyunsaturates

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.640
 a long time ago, and his skin looks so good.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.120
 You've met him in person, what's he like?

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.120
 - Yes, it's even, he looks even better than you'd imagine.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:31.440
 He has no age spots or the lipoflex skin anywhere.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.800
 And his hair, while gray, he has a full head of hair.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.800
 It's nice and soft, nice full set of teeth.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.880
 - Do you touch his hair?

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.320
 - No, but it's very soft.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:49.320
 And he basically had, for his adult life,

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:55.040
 avoided any added polyunsaturated fats in his diet.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.360
 That I think is the--

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.520
 - Tell us all about him.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.360
 - Well, he's most recently known for success

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:07.160
 in his 60-year-long tireless crusade against trans fats,

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.120
 which is something that everyone sort of knows now

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.360
 that is bad for their health.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:18.720
 But what is not reported is he basically says

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.480
 very similar things about the polyunsaturated fats.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.040
 And when we told him, since he's quite old

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.880
 and he's not really connected into the modern health world,

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.360
 when we told him that fish oil is sold as supplements

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.520
 and people drink flax oil,

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.920
 he literally physically recoiled,

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.040
 knowing the harm that it can do to health.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:49.040
 And it has caused some people to die early, die young.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.080
 And yeah, it actually horrified him

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.080
 that it's a billion-dollar industry,

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.040
 that all it's doing is harming your health.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.960
 - Yeah, that's pretty sad, isn't it?

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.360
 Go ahead, is there anything else you want to say

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.440
 about Dr. Fred Kimbrough, having met him?

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.000
 And then maybe I'll ask Dr. Peat

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.560
 what he has to think about him.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:16.200
 - No, he's just, it's inspiring to see,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.600
 he's getting older and recently in a wheelchair

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.960
 because of a swimming-related accident at 97.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.600
 So, age is starting to take its toll at 100 for him,

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.520
 but he's still doing active research at the lab

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.560
 and working on some novel compounds

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.960
 related to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.840
 that have to do with oxidization

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.720
 of the polyunsaturated fat.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.200
 - I just want to let our listeners know

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:51.000
 that if you visit this website, www.perceivedthinkact,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.960
 you can see a short clip, a short video clip

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.880
 of all of these doctors we're talking about this evening.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.480
 I don't know if that's been mentioned, but.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.440
 - Okay, and just for some context on the website.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.800
 - Yeah, please do, go ahead.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.920
 - Perceivedthinkact.com is our,

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.640
 it's just like the journal of our,

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.960
 it's our journey of making the film.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.280
 So it's the production journal,

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.040
 and in chronological order,

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.200
 it has a post for each of our shoots

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.240
 with every subject we've had,

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.800
 and pictures and videos from the shoots.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.600
 - And I think also important to note

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.720
 that we're not finished shooting.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.720
 We've only really shot about 30 to 40% of the material.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.600
 - Really?

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.440
 - Yeah, there's a lot of people

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.400
 that we still want to interview.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.320
 - How are you gonna get them all

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.920
 into a one and a half hour DVD?

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:42.480
 (laughing)

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.120
 It's gonna be a compendium, isn't it?

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.240
 - The magic of good editing.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.600
 - Yeah, editing.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.320
 - Yeah, I'm not too sure how you're gonna cut enough out

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.680
 to get it all into a small movie

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.400
 without cutting out some very good information.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.880
 But anyway, I'll leave that to you guys.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.400
 You guys are the film pros, so I'll leave that to you.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.480
 But let's talk a little bit more then.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.720
 Got a couple more subjects, and then we can...

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.560
 Actually, yes, I wanted to ask Dr. Peat.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.480
 Dr. Peat, I don't want you just to be on the sidelines.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.280
 I know you're probably fairly happy,

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.720
 but hopefully not too tired.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.360
 What do you have to say about Dr. Michael Persinger

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.880
 from your experience and/or your work?

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.440
 Where has he led you, if anywhere, in his journey?

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.840
 - Well, my interest in fields went way back.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.000
 My brother was a radio ham

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.320
 and had a lot of electronic equipment

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:38.080
 that I, from I guess the age of nine or so,

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:40.600
 had the opportunity to play with.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:44.320
 And so the electrical properties

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.920
 of all of my acquaintances,

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.920
 seeing how aging affected the conductivity and so on,

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.720
 kept me constantly aware

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.560
 of the electrical magnetic properties of organisms.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:06.560
 And in 1968, I went to Russia largely

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:13.560
 to talk to a man working in what he called

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:19.280
 magnetobiology, as opposed to biomagnetics.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 He concentrated on the effects of fields on organisms

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.720
 rather than the fields produced by the organisms.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.840
 And one of my very first experiments at the university

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:40.880
 after I got back was with a strong magnet

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.040
 that my brother made for me,

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:48.040
 and looking at its effect on a crab nerve.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.840
 And I could see that just the presence

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:56.840
 of a strong magnetic field apparently affected,

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:02.280
 I interpreted it as affecting the structure of the water.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:08.440
 The latent period, there was a delay between stimulation

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.000
 and reaction in the presence of a magnetic field.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.560
 And I also paid attention to the fields

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:24.680
 that I produced, electrical fields that would,

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:29.480
 some of the things like a millivolt meter,

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.160
 I couldn't operate because my field would,

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.040
 from about a foot away, they would go off scale.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:42.480
 So my lab partner had to handle the knobs on those things.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:47.480
 - So all very interesting, actual practical experimentation

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.960
 showing that fields do not just subtly,

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.480
 but grossly affect nerve impulses

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.160
 and/or electric activity in the body.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.880
 And that's been a lot of the basis for your outcry,

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.880
 if you like, against radiation and X-rays

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.120
 and all the other visualization techniques

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.520
 that are used in medicine as being very harmful.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.520
 - Yeah, very subtle fields have very big effects

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.480
 on organisms.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:21.720
 - Okay, what about, I don't want to take too long

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.000
 with that one, but how about Dr. Fred Kummerow

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.320
 and his background in trans fat,

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.640
 trying to keep, trying to ban trans fats?

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:37.480
 - The trans fats normally occur in butter

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.120
 as an intermediate stage.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:45.120
 And the conjugated linoleic acid is the next step

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:50.080
 in shifting the unsaturation.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:54.560
 And the very beneficial effects

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.880
 of conjugated linoleic acid, I think,

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:02.880
 are because they block some of the toxic effects

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:06.360
 of the normal linoleic acid

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.320
 and other polyunsaturated fats.

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.040
 So even though cow's milk and butter

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.600
 contain some trans fats,

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.160
 they also contain the beneficial next step,

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:25.160
 the conjugated form of the unsaturated fats.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:32.960
 - Yeah, and Dr. Kummerow's criticism is more

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.000
 about the artificially created trans fats

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.400
 rather than the naturally grown in dairy and other forms.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.080
 - He's got nothing against butter.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.440
 - Yeah, he likes butter.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.480
 - Yeah, it's all about the wholesale production

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.680
 then of trans fats and pumping those into the food chain.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.800
 - Yes.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.400
 - Okay, well, I see that we've got 10 minutes left here

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.120
 and time goes so quickly, unfortunately,

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.680
 but just want to let people that are listening know

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.720
 this is Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD 91.1 FM.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.080
 We've interviewed Dr. A.M. and Peat, thankfully,

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.320
 for quite a while and he's spoken on many different subjects

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.640
 and he's mentioned many different eminent scientists

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.320
 in that time and that, fortunately, the step has been made

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.360
 where these two gentlemen filmmakers

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.000
 that we're interviewing now have actually gone

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.160
 and interviewed these eight scientists

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.640
 and they're actually talking about interviewing

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.200
 quite a few more, but they are in the process

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.960
 of producing a documentary and they do have,

00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:33.480
 excuse me, a very good clip, a taste of things to come.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.280
 If only people will go there and see what's going on.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.280
 Their website is www.perceivethinkact.com.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:45.160
 - And the name of the documentary that's in progress

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:47.120
 is On the Back of a Tiger.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:50.200
 - Okay, so let's just go on to Danny Roddy

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.720
 and his background.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.480
 He's probably the only non-doctor so far, isn't he?

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.640
 - So far, yeah.

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.960
 There's sort of two sides to the film

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.160
 and we've focused so far on the scientists,

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.800
 but the other piece is what we've been calling

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.640
 the health seekers, people who have used this information

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.320
 to empower themselves and take their health

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.000
 into their own hands.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.520
 And he's someone who's had his own health journey

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.840
 and now he's, I guess you'd call him a health blogger.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:23.160
 His main focus is on hair loss specifically,

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.080
 but he's, I think, probably read almost anything

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:30.960
 that is available that Ray has written ever.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.800
 - Okay.

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:36.680
 - And he's got no formal academic background,

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:40.400
 but he's learned an incredible amount on his own.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:45.880
 And I think really had a huge journey

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:50.880
 learning to understand his own metabolism and stress.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.960
 - And he's applied this to himself

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.560
 and this has been something kind of groundbreaking.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.000
 I think it's Stoltz moment where he's, wow.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.560
 - Exactly.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.640
 Yeah, he's been on, I think, the roller coaster

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.680
 that a lot of us can relate to

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.080
 with trying to solve your own health problems

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:14.800
 and thankfully has come out on top with a,

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.360
 and now able to connect with people.

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.960
 I think that's why he connects so well with people

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.880
 is he's been where a lot of people are now

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.880
 and has the gift of taking those very complex

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.080
 scientific theories and translating them

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.800
 so anyone can understand them.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.640
 - Yeah, good.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:34.880
 I mean, that's always been the challenge, isn't it?

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:38.160
 Science is sometimes so chewy.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.120
 It's a lot to get your teeth into sometimes

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.600
 and sometimes the language is almost a different language

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.800
 and therefore it needs a translation to put it

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.560
 into a context of everyday language

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.280
 so people can truly understand it.

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.760
 I think that's what we try and do with Dr. Peake

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.440
 is sometimes he's very scientific sometimes

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.720
 and other times, you know,

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.440
 doesn't sound quite so difficult to understand.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.560
 - Well, it depends who he's talking to.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.280
 Sometimes when it was just you and Dr. Peake

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.240
 on the radio show, you guys got a little carried away

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.920
 in science 'cause you were talking to each other.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.760
 - Anyway, anyway.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.680
 - Pardon my interference there.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.480
 - Okay, so you actually went and interviewed Dr. Peake.

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:12.120
 Dr. Peake, he's probably the unwitting star of the show,

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.200
 but you interviewed Dr. Peake here

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:18.080
 and obviously you got to share with him

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.280
 and he got to share with you

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:23.400
 and what I can gather is that, again,

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.200
 I think he's kind of unifying the theories

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.160
 of all these different scientists

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:32.600
 and applying it to health and the perspective of health

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.640
 and kind of meeting the challenges

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:38.560
 of the way health and medicine is working or not working

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.840
 in this day and age with people

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.160
 and how dogma is just so entrenched

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.080
 as is the ego, I think, in the science community

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:48.360
 that it fails to see sometimes the obvious

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:52.560
 and doesn't allow that ego to fall to one side

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.120
 to let the facts come through

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.600
 and then support them by being a little bit out

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.560
 on the edge of the field, as it were.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.160
 So you interviewed Dr. Peake

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.120
 and unfortunately I know we've only got five minutes left,

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.080
 but you can talk briefly about Dr. Peake,

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.680
 but let us have a little bit of time

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.480
 just to remind people where they can find out more about you

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.320
 because you've got a great film that you put in together.

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.680
 So Dr. Peake, very briefly,

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.520
 you got a couple of minutes, I think.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.360
 (laughs)

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.000
 - So, well, one of the, you know,

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.640
 the thing about the working scientists

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.080
 and people who've spent their life in science

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.840
 is they focus on a little tiny area

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.320
 and they're not usually fully aware of the larger context

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.560
 that they may be helping to expand.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.640
 And so I think Ray's work,

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:44.560
 it kind of puts all of these people into a paradigm

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.400
 that all makes sense together into a much more holistic view.

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.200
 - And really, what is the worth

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:54.160
 of all of this scientific inquiry

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.040
 if you can't apply it practically

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.320
 to people's health and nutrition?

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.520
 And I think that's where nearly everyone we've interviewed

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:04.800
 somewhat misses the mark

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.240
 in that they don't think about it that way.

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.840
 They don't think, well, how does this apply to me?

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.520
 - They're looking down the microscope.

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.800
 - Exactly. - Yes, yeah.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:17.280
 And that's where one of the many realms

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:20.640
 where Dr. Peat's work resonates with us

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.000
 and so many other people.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.760
 - And I also think that Dr. Peat helps people

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.000
 take their health into their own hands

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.640
 and he encourages them and gets them to start looking

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.040
 at what do you feel like after you eat that food

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.560
 or what do you feel like after you do that?

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:37.960
 And that is so important

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:42.960
 because we are the ones that know ourselves the best

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.320
 and a doctor teaching a patient to do that

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.400
 is very, very contrary

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.960
 to the authoritarian medical system we have today.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:55.360
 - And it's funny, it's kind of surreal

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.400
 being on your show tonight

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.040
 because your show, it's one of the few resources

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.880
 to hear Dr. Peat talk on so many different subjects

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.960
 and Brad and I both have spent so much time

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.280
 listening to your recorded shows as research for the film.

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.560
 So thanks. - Yeah, interesting.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.640
 I didn't even-- - Thanks for your interest.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.400
 - Yeah, we're finally on the other side.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.640
 - I didn't even know this until about three days ago, folks.

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:24.640
 But anyway, I'd heard about Brad and Jeremy,

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.520
 oh, in early, I think late 2013

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:29.600
 and they said what they were gonna do

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.000
 and I was like, okay, great, sounds like a great idea.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.160
 And we've been back and forth with a few emails

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.440
 but we never got to actually meet or talk

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.040
 and then the next thing I was, they've done it.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.520
 (laughing)

00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.800
 So I take my hat off to you

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.120
 and I know that you probably really enjoyed it

00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.840
 and I think you're gonna certainly exceed

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.360
 most people's expectations

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.840
 and I really wish both of you the very best in your work.

00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.680
 - Thanks so much.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.840
 - And also in getting the funding

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:02.160
 that is gonna be necessary here to put this together.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.400
 - Yeah, the first, the very first post

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.480
 if you go to our site, perceivethinkac.com

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.280
 has a link to the Kickstarter campaign

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.320
 where you can donate or share around

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.360
 with friends and family.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.560
 - I know it's doing pretty good, so that's a good sign.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:22.160
 - And lastly, Dr. Peat, can you comment on the film

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.040
 that Jeremy and Brad are producing here?

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.040
 - In about a minute.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.560
 - Well, the bits that I've seen,

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:33.560
 it's very much fun to watch those people

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:39.120
 I had seen, I spoke briefly to Gilbert Ling in 1971,

00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:46.120
 but it's good to see the newer stuff

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.160
 about him and the others.

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.600
 - Well, if it wasn't for people like you, Dr. Peat,

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.720
 and all the people that Jeremy and Brad

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.240
 have actually gone and seen and videoed

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:58.440
 and gotten real life footage of,

00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.640
 it wouldn't be able to reach people

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.440
 and people wouldn't get to know about such alternatives.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.360
 So in keeping alternatives alive,

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.840
 I thank all of the three of you for being here

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.520
 and you, Dr. Peat, I didn't even know

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.880
 you were gonna be on the air, but thanks so much.

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.720
 (laughs)

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:13.440
 - Thank you for all your time.

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.360
 - Okay, so-- - Yes, thanks.

00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.200
 Thank you, everyone.

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.280
 - You're very welcome. - Appreciate it.

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:21.280
 - Okay, so until the third Friday of next month,

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.440
 my name's Andrew Murray.

00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.960
 - My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.240
 - And we can be reached 1-888-WBM-ERB

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.600

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.600
 In fact, people just want to contact us

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:33.760
 for whatever it is.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:38.600

 www.perceivethinkact.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.680
 It's really very interesting.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.720
 You should see it.

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:53.720
