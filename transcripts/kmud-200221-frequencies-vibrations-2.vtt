00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:13.040
 My name is Sarah Johanneson-Murray, and I'm delighted to be back on the show joining the incredibly knowledgeable Dr. Peat and my wonderful husband.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 Okay, so it's February 21st, 2020.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.400
 The second show this decade, as I mentioned last month, it's a new decade,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.040
 but we are still able to

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.880
 entreat Dr. Peat to join us on the show to share his wisdom. Last month,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.560
 very briefly, we were discussing

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.600
 resonant frequencies, the effects on cells of

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.400
 frequencies, and I came across a lot of very interesting abstracts

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.820
 done that were actually 19, sorry, 2019 and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.960
 2020. So even in the earliest parts of January, there are articles being posted on PubMed,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.760
 research articles and abstracts related to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.320
 electromagnetic frequency and extremely low frequency electromagnetic frequencies, and

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 very exciting news because one of the main

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.620
 studies that caught my eye was a treatment of breast cancer,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.280
 where they were showing it was

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.180
 absolutely effective, and as an adjunctive therapy to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.680
 traditional

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.720
 cancer management in breast cancer, I would just like to say that it was part of a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.020
 adjunctive therapy, not the sole therapy as the authors wanted to make sure they pointed out too,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.920
 but that it had very significant cell killing effects.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.100
 So last month, like I said, that was the beginning of the show, we opened it up and we got quite a few calls in,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.440
 so didn't get a chance to get through some of the other very interesting articles on different pathologies that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 this post-EMF was being used to treat, and I know in the past

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.040
 discussions and shows we'd touched a little bit on Rife therapy.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.680
 We've definitely mentioned

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.440
 vaccines, and I know Dr. Peat's latest newsletter on vaccines in context is something else we'll get to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.560
 once we get through some of the pathologies related to the abstracts on EMF and its treatment.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.920
 And then there are some other questions that I have that are part and parcel of people asking questions and wanting to put them to Dr. Peat.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.260
 So it's a live show folks from 7 to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.240
 7.30.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.360
 We basically interview Dr. Peat, ask him questions and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.680
 listen to what he has to say about the mechanisms by which he understands the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.500
 activity of certain things that we don't normally see as being relevant or being effective because it's just not the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.700
 it's not the way things are sometimes that when the drug comes out is given all these different

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.700
 treatments, treatment uses and actually turns out to be fairly negative. So

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.780
 he's got a very different perspective on a lot of things that we would see as just headlines and advertising

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.740
 and goes certainly into the science of it to show and explain why it's not a good thing. So Dr. Peat, let's

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.500
 introduce you to the show. You here?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.460
 Hi, Dr. Peat. Okay. So as always for people who maybe haven't heard your name or

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.820
 know anything about you, we'll definitely at the end of the show give out your web details for people to find more about you.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.540
 But would you just give an outline of your academic and professional background?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.340
 I went from

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.980
 after graduating from college and getting master's degree in

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.540
 humanities

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.220
 and studying

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.580
 linguistics for several years, I decided to study brain biology for a PhD and

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.800
 when I got to the University of Oregon, I quickly decided that brain biology was a dogmatic

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.380
 topic at the time. I looked around and found

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:11.260
 reproductive physiology was actually doing empirical science. So that's what I did my dissertation on reproductive

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.020
 physiology and the

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.420
 changes aging makes in the

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:25.420
 energy metabolism of the reproductive organs. Okay, very good. Okay, for people that are listening from 730 to late p.m.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.660
 we take callers live on the air. The number if you live in the area or even if you don't live in the area,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.860
 let's just give out the whole number so no matter where you are,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.260
 707-923-3911.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.580
 So from 730 on callers are invited to call in 707-923-3911.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:52.180
 And Dr. Beat, I love the way that you can describe your educational background in a slightly different manner every month. It's just wonderful. Thank you.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.180
 So you said that this very briefly going back to what you said about the developmental biology or reproductive biology.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.420
 It was empirical based still so it hadn't been swallowed up by the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.860
 machine.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.580
 The professor, the main professor in female reproduction,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.580
 Arnold Soderwal,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.940
 had

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.940
 been working in the field

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.140
 way back in the 40s and he was one of the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.700
 early people to test the effects of vitamin E on

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.980
 reproduction.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.340
 In the 1930s and 40s it was considered a sex promoting

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180
 vitamin or almost a hormone.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.580
 And he was one of the people that showed that its effect on increasing fertility

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.380
 took place by being an anti-estrogen.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.940
 The older an animal got,

00:05:51.940 --> 00:06:00.700
 earlier it became infertile. He found that increasing the dose of vitamin E steadily with aging,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.940
 he kept the animals from miscarrying

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.500
 well into old middle-aged.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.940
 And I continued that research and found that

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.300
 it was partly acting by way of improving the production of

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.940
 progesterone as well as lowering the effect of estrogen.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.900
 And I also remember you telling me about those

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.300
 flamingos in the African Rift Valley

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.300
 that don't age reproductively because they have so much CO2

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.860
 from not only the elevation but from the non-PUFA

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.500
 algae they're eating.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.660
 No one is really sure but I think the high carbon dioxide

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.940
 environment is very likely a big part of it. Their usual mortality

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.620
 curve,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.220
 it's a

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.220
 semi plateau

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.020
 up until middle age and then it crashes and the

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.020
 mortality rate per year for most organisms

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.980
 increases rapidly after a certain age. And with flamingos, it seems that

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.940
 all through a period of their whole lifespan,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.780
 the

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.820
 annual mortality continues at just about the same rate by accidents mainly.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.420
 And that they can breed up until they die from an accident, right?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.460
 Apparently, yeah.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.260
 Wow, very briefly when you were doing your PhD,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.740
 what forms of vitamin E did they know of then? I'm not saying it was so many hundreds of years ago,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.020
 but you know 40 years ago or whatever,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:54.460
 had they discovered them all? I found a bottle of the very old stuff in the freezer in the lab

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.180
 in 1968 or so.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.380
 It had been there for decades and it was a

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.140
 very, very viscous

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.180
 material and a

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.940
 light amber color.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.940
 And I tested it

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.380
 against

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.740
 some of the

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.140
 quinones,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.140
 comparing

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.900
 benzoquinone for example, reacting it

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.860
 with vitamin E

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.340
 and

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.980
 doing a combination

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.100
 staining experiment.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.180
 I got chemical reactions that showed that the

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.060
 sensitivity of the quinone

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.100
 reaction was

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.140
 very vivid

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.980
 in that old sample and

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.980
 the newer samples

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:03.340
 with so-called pure vitamin E, I haven't been able to see that same reaction

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:10.420
 that I got around 1970 using the very old stuff. Is that anything to do with its antioxidant?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:14.300
 No, it was a

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.460
 really a very different kind of

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.860
 reaction.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.580
 Was it, where did they get that vitamin E from? How did they process it?

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.220
 That was bought from Sigma Chemical Company.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.020
 But it was

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:36.020
 fairly typical at the time. It was very highly refined. It was the highest grade available at the time.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:42.140
 But at that time all vitamin E was fairly

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.740
 brown colored and

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.180
 very, very thick.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.500
 I think

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.460
 some of the studies suggested that it was a waxy, highly saturated,

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.300
 long-chain fatty acid

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.540
 that was part of the

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.540
 endurance

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.980
 promoting antioxidant effect, not the

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:14.140
 simple tocopherol itself. So it makes a big difference what form of vitamin E they're using to test and

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:21.460
 coming up with these results, does that mean that we need to be careful when we're supplementing with vitamin E? Yeah, lots of it now.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:29.260
 Even 10 or 20 years ago, the majority of it was highly diluted with

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.740
 soybean oil.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.700
 Highly unsaturated, exactly what my professor found was

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.940
 the

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.020
 antagonistic effect it

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.660
 protected against the

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.180
 pro-aging effect of the polyunsaturated fats.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:54.940
 So if your vitamin E is thin and liquid, then it's probably not a good vitamin E. If it's thick and viscous,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.220
 then can we assume that that's a better quality? I think so.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.020
 All right, we're good. That's a little bit of a digression,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.580
 but very interesting nonetheless because I was looking at vitamin E just last month and wanting to get some feedback about

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.540
 the best source of vitamin E. Very quickly, do you have any,

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:19.020
 would you speak to that? What you think is a good, what makes a good quality vitamin E supplement?

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.020
 I

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.860
 think the mixture of the

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.780
 isotopes or the

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.940
 non-rheumatic

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.580
 natural

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.300
 forms

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.420
 alpha and gamma are

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.460
 probably

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:49.020
 the most important, but I think the mixture as it occurs in nature is much better than any of the synthetic.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:56.660
 DL alpha has been sold for a long time because it's cheap to make

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:03.960
 synthetically. Okay, so what about wheat germ oil is one of the main sources for it, right? But you would not advocate that given

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.980
 it's very full of polyunsaturated fats.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:15.700
 I tried some of it in the 1970s and that caused a choking

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:21.740
 sensation when you took just a little bit of it. So you're recommending that you take a mixed tocopherol

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.660
 supplement of vitamin E and not just an isolated D alpha

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.300
 tocopherol. Yeah,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.820
 in the 1940s

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.380
 the

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.460
 anti-estrogen

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:40.060
 quality that was identified from the 1930s, an

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.620
 anti-clotting and anti-estrogen effect

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:50.180
 was very clearly identified. But with the rise of the estrogen industry starting in 1940,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.700
 that

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.180
 property, the idea that vitamin E could be very pro fertility,

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:03.180
 it was the main fertility vitamin and at the same time purely anti-estrogenic,

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.860
 really

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.860
 put a crimp in the

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.820
 estrogen advertising

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:16.140
 idea and they were I think a major factor in creating the

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.940
 doctrine that

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.660
 vitamin E's action is as an

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.700
 antioxidant.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.700
 And the

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:33.260
 vegetable oil industry at the same time was trying to sell the idea that

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.660
 seed oils are edible and

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.980
 in feeding them to animals,

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.460
 they were finding that animals became sterile

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.420
 on a high intake of

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.380
 the various seed oils,

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.900
 polyunsaturated. Sterile and fat.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:57.180
 Right, didn't they put on weight too? Then they find that farmers could give the animals?

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:02.860
 Yeah, but when they had a really high proportion, they became sterile and

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.340
 brain deteriorated.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.860
 Low energy.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.380
 The gonads in the brain were the first to deteriorate and

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.020
 that my professor for example

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.180
 identified that as

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.620
 an estrogen

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.980
 promoting effect that has continued to be confirmed that estrogen

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:33.220
 increases the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats in the body and

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:41.140
 increases their activity at any one moment and those fats

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.380
 simultaneously are increasing

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.700
 the effect of estrogen.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.940
 It's a vicious cycle, huh? Yeah, so the anti-estrogen effect

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.860
 was

00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:01.980
 identical to the anti-PUFA effect, but both the food, the seed oil industry and the estrogen industry

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.780
 found it very convenient to

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.380
 sell the idea that vitamin E is merely an

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.420
 antioxidant. So from the 1940s on

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:18.020
 D-alpha-tocopherol was identified as

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.020
 how to measure the

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:27.140
 value of vitamin E because it was the most antioxidant and so

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.900
 until just fairly recently the only

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:39.660
 component that they measured was the alpha component, but it turns out that the gamma and others have

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.980
 very distinct more important biological activities including

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.020
 opposition to estrogen.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:53.180
 Excellent, all right good. Well, I'm glad I'm glad we accidentally went there.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:59.780
 It's a good a good breakdown of vitamin E and it's used for sure. Okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Doctor, KMED,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.900
 Garbovill, 91.1 FM from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:09.660
 You're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's continuing subject of

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.060
 ELF,

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.940
 extremely low frequency,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.940
 electromagnetic frequencies

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.900
 for healing. We have a bunch of abstracts here that I just want to get through with

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.820
 very specific known pathologies just to get Dr.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:29.540
 Peat's insight onto the activity of how these frequencies could have such a profound effect.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.940
 I know we've mentioned Reif therapy in the past and

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:39.180
 for want of not understanding it as well as I'd like to, I certainly want to believe Reif is a very

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.300
 realistic approach.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.180
 They certainly wanted to put the man in prison and take away all of his research material

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.420
 back when Raymond Reif was doing his research.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:56.340
 So probably sounds like something they wanted to keep covered up, not to get too conspiracy theorists about it.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.420
 Anyway, the number is 707 923 3911.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:05.700
 That's 707 923 3911. Dr. Raymond Peat's joining us live on the air.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.660
 So Dr. Peat, I just wanted to cover quickly. I don't want you

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.540
 I don't want you getting bored with any of the subject matter.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.540
 Sometimes I feel that it we kind of drudge through some of the subjects you're not that interested in perhaps, but

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:24.700
 without going too far in that direction, I looked at some articles last month for

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.220
 extremely low frequency electromagnetic

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:36.540
 spectrum and these electromagnetic fields on various pathologies and we talked about the breast cancer one that showed definite conclusive

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.300
 positive benefits on breast cancer.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.900
 I saw another one on and it surprised me here because I

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:50.700
 know you've always mentioned high altitude being very good for people and the increased CO2 and being part of a longevity

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:58.100
 formulation if you like, high altitude reducing stress, improving CO2 and improving longevity.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.780
 But this was a test that was done on rats

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.020
 and they were I guess probably because the ulcers were

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:11.420
 simulated. They weren't actually, I don't know that I think they were put in a hyperbaric chamber at

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:19.700
 you know different partial pressure of oxygen to simulate higher altitude, but it was a high altitude stress ulcer healing

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.220
 in rats. So they gave these rats

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:27.380
 ulcers and they said that basically it was a hypoxia that was a

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.020
 part and parcel the reason they got these ulcers and that it was fairly prevalent among people

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:37.940
 high altitude. But do you have that do you have any idea first I guess about

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:44.740
 high altitude and ulcers, ulcer formation? In that particular experiment they were

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:52.060
 using restraint stress to produce the ulcers and it happened to be combined with high altitude.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.900
 So I don't think

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.700
 anything can

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:02.060
 be inferred from that study for humans. So the stress was that they were restraining the rats?

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:07.180
 Yeah, if you're being suspended by your tail at high altitude.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.260
 It doesn't matter what altitude you're gonna be stressed out. Yeah.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:18.180
 Okay, well anyway, all right, I just wanted to bring it out. They said that the low frequency

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.940
 pulse electromagnetic fields

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.000
 could penetrate the stomach tissue and they said they relieve the symptoms of the

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:34.300
 stomach ulcer and promote the regeneration of disturbed tissues and they said that there was a clinical potential for this therapy for ulcer treatment.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.980
 Okay, well, maybe not dwell on that one too much and how about

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:44.140
 this other study here was called it's entitled the neuroprotective effects of low frequency pulse electromagnetic fields in

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.620
 ischemic stroke.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.780
 And this again, I think is probably part and parcel of reperfusion or reducing the

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:57.380
 inflammatory sequelae that happens as a result of reperfusion after an ischemic event.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.740
 I think people I think about people that have heart attacks or coronary

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:09.820
 artery occlusion and heart attacks and benefiting from using hawthorn extract as a normal medicine and definitely

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.980
 has shown to reduce the ischemic the size of the ischemic tissue post

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.900
 event and

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.900
 promote healing.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.100
 They mentioned some of the

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:27.060
 inflammatory cytokines that are reduced by the treatment and I think

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.860
 behind those particular

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:36.420
 neuroprotective changes, I think there's likely to be an increase of

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.620
 some of the basic

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.860
 defensive factors such as heat shock protein.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.260
 Any kind of stress will bring on these

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:56.100
 stabilizing proteins and I suspect that those are behind the various

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:59.820
 reductions of the inflammatory

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.820
 mediators.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.060
 Another

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.220
 acute stress

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.860
 induced

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.860
 protective factor is

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.060
 hypoxia

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:20.580
 induced factor that tends to come up at the same time as the heat shock proteins and these

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:27.980
 helps nerve cells, for example, to get through intense stress which could be

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.860
 glucose deprivation or oxygen deprivation either one.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.260
 Right, because I have to be a little careful here when I

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:43.860
 look at these things and and and maybe take them out of context, but it's a little bit like inflammation, you know,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.820
 it's not all bad. Inflammation is necessary to achieve certain end results,

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.300
 but obviously out of control inflammation is where we discuss inflammation as being negative.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:58.260
 Okay, all right, let's see here the other article I'm looking at

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.020
 I think that's actually we can probably skip this one. This is part and parcel of

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.860
 hypoxia induced neuronal cell death.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.660
 They've mentioned here that there was various

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.460
 signal

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:18.700
 molecules that were involved in inflammation and various proteins that were secreted in response to inflammation and that this

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.020
 pulse electromagnetic

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:28.260
 fields could mitigate the effects of this. I think I'm probably more interested in how the mechanism by which

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.980
 sound waves and this is again, it kind of harks back to Rife therapy and

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.740
 disrupting

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:41.220
 cancer cells or indeed bacteria that Rife was experimenting with and how

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.540
 the frequency

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.980
 and I think we have to make analogies here to things like the Clifton suspension bridge

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:56.220
 swaying in the wind because of the harmonics that were produced by the wind blowing through the cabling and how that

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.980
 frequency and that resonance became very disruptive and destructive and

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:07.180
 involved of bridge failing, but how these electromagnetic fields

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.900
 generate this disruptive

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.900
 event to

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:17.060
 become healing, you know, in terms of inflammation and how that actually works.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.460
 Do you have any insight into how that may actually, you know, may actually

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:28.980
 be physically provable? I mean, I didn't really look at articles in terms of actually outlining the science of it.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.580
 Just I was just very excited to see articles referring to people's disease

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:38.380
 and especially bone treatment, bone remodeling. It was very conclusive. But how they

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:43.060
 how this activity could actually be a physical event?

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.900
 The research of Robert Becker

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.420
 in

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.420
 biological electrical

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.460
 activity, he found that

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.900
 organisms are

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.060
 responsive to

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.860
 extremely weak

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.460
 electromagnetic signals of pulsations in the earth's

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.060
 electromagnetic field and

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.940
 older research

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:20.980
 in the 40s and 50s, we're finding that all sorts of organisms

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.020
 govern their metabolic rate

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.220
 by

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.140
 changes picked up from the electromagnetic field.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:36.300
 Currently, the doctrine is that it's simply the light and dark

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.140
 changes that are

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.860
 cuing in

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:44.820
 the expression of certain genes appropriate for night or daytime.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:53.620
 But in this older research, they would put the organism in sealed chambers out of sight

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:59.620
 of the outside changes of night and day and some of the

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.420
 changes persisted even in

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.380
 holes in the ground, mine shafts and

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.220
 plants, for example, that folded their petals

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.300
 during the night.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.060
 Some of these plants were taken down and they

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:23.780
 could still detect the changes of day and night until they were 60 feet below the surface.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:30.700
 There are some very penetrating electromagnetic fields that are

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.540
 crucially important for the cycles of plants and

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.060
 the

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:44.380
 current dogma that it's nothing but daylight and nighttime are

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.220
 really trying to

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:53.940
 cover up that extreme sensitivity to weak fields and how important it

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.500
 is that we're being

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.700
 bombarded with polluting

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.300
 electrical rhythms.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.460
 I'm going to ask you a little bit, I've got one or two more abstracts I quickly want to look at, but I wanted to

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:13.500
 bring up the subject again, probably not for too long, but just to bring it up again the whole 5G rollout of wireless internet

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:18.940
 that's taking over Europe and it's obviously mounting opposition to it, but we'll go there in a little bit.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:24.820
 I had another article here and it caught my eye. It was for the treatment of Alzheimer's

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.380
 and they were saying, and actually we go a little bit more specific here, and they were using

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.340
 5 Hertz and

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:39.100
 90 minute cycles of 5 Hertz and they said that there was a definite improvement in cognitive

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:46.860
 ability. So for those Alzheimer's patients that are definitely declining cognitively, they saw a definite improvement

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:53.500
 using that and they said during the abstract here, they gave a little bit more information, they were talking about

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:57.300
 tissue regeneration

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.580
 because of the ability to

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.340
 stimulate cell proliferation and immune functions

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.580
 via the specific heat shock protein

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.500
 family of heat shock proteins and how that

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.180
 I guess that probably plays into the

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:20.860
 neurofibrillary tangles and those kind of proteins that get deranged in Alzheimer's.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.900
 So that was quite interesting.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.180
 And then the last thing I wanted to cover

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.500
 was a...

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:34.300
 Actually, did you want to say? No, go ahead. Yeah. Okay. Well this next one again is just another article here

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.100
 about

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:42.700
 bacterial infections that antibiotics are not able to treat anymore. So kind of a drug resistant bacteria type scenario

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.580
 where they've used

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.740
 electromagnetic fields and

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:54.220
 basically blocked things like tumor necrosis factor and transcription factor kappa beta and

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.780
 they have basically

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:03.580
 been able to prevent the previously untreatable bacterial infection from getting out of control and

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:08.020
 have actually been able to slow it down to a point where they're saying that this

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.540
 continuous exposure to pulse electromagnetic field at 5 Hertz

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:18.180
 demonstrated significant changes in the down regulation of all those inflammatory cytokines that would be part and parcel of breaking down the cell

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.780
 damaging the tissues and all the sequelae that

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.860
 inflammation brings with it and all the damage that it brings with it. So that's pretty pretty cool.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.300
 So Dr. Peat, would you

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:37.940
 recommend a practical approach to using these ELF and various post EMF

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:43.220
 treatments? I don't think there's been enough research.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:48.020
 It's clear that these

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.500
 acute treatments can stimulate

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.100
 increased blood circulation

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:03.300
 and these defensive heat shock protein and hypoxia induced factor which are defensive.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:08.340
 The subtler things, long-range

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.140
 development, of course, I

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.180
 don't think there's enough information yet.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.900
 And there's very little interest in following up research that was done

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:24.860
 40 or 50 years ago on sounds for example.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.580
 The

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.580
 dogma says that

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.820
 ordinary

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.540
 speaking

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.420
 frequency sound waves at that intensity

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.540
 couldn't possibly be

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:51.260
 interacting with cell chemistry, but several experiments have demonstrated that in fact just

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.780
 moderate

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.060
 volume

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.060
 music or speech

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.580
 vibrations

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.580
 affect the activity of

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:07.500
 muscle enzymes. ATPase, for example, was one that was tested and

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:11.620
 the H440 cycles

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.620
 was found to

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.780
 distinctly

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.900
 activate that particular enzyme. Each enzyme

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.660
 probably has its own

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.900
 responsive frequency, but

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.020
 that was contrary to

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.580
 standard

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:35.060
 biochemical cell function and so it was totally neglected.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.100
 ATP was found to

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.620
 respond

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.220
 to

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.220
 musical frequencies

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.140
 and that's another

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.140
 violation of standard

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.380
 physical chemical. So we're supposed to speak to each other and hear voices

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.140
 and listen to music.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.580
 And speak kind words rather than shouting and screaming.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.580
 I know, have they done

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.060
 tests on the various

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.260
 pitch of the voice?

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:09.020
 Yeah, the pitch affects enzyme activity.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:15.340
 Yeah, I can believe it completely without having to see any proof. It's just a concept of...

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.580
 What is hearing a baby cry? Well, yeah, that and...

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.700
 put anyone on edge. Yeah, or people that get in road traffic, you know,

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:27.980
 situations where they're just being loud and obnoxious or you know all of that.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:33.580
 I can't see that as being as being creative or healing in any way. It's always seen as being inflammatory and destructive.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.700
 It's all part of that screaming and shouting cycle. Okay, so let's hold it there a second.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:43.300
 You're listening to Ask Your ObDoctor, KMED Galbraithville 91.1 FM.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.380
 From now until 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's subject.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.980
 The closing subject here of

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.980
 electromagnetic fields and

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.340
 healing for different

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.980
 Hertz

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.700
 frequencies and different times. It's all out there on the internet. If you want to look at it folks, it's pretty exciting stuff.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.900
 And there's 2019 and 2020 publications in

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.580
 I'll say quote-unquote respected medical journals, but they are

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:14.860
 on PubMed and you can see the various journals that have printed out the or put these

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:21.980
 abstracts out there for peer review and they've actually shown up as articles. So the number here is 707-923-3911.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.020
 Dr. Raymond Peat joining us and we do have two callers on

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.740
 on the line. So let's take this first caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:35.180
 Hello, is this me? Yeah, you're on the air. What's your question and where are you from, caller?

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.220
 I'm calling from Gartherville

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:46.860
 and I'd love the conversation. I'm wondering where it's going in general as far as how much

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:54.380
 individuals need to deal with and how much is actually medically relevant.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:33:00.060
 I've been dealing with a chronic problem for a while that

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.740
 pushes me to the my limit of

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.820
 of

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.820
 mental ability

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:15.500
 because of past traumatic brain injury.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.540
 So

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.780
 I wonder what Dr. Peat has to say about

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.700
 organic damage

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:35.340
 to one's brain as far as any of this new research goes.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:42.540
 Dr. Peat, are you able to hear that clearly? I'm not getting it too clear here, but I got the general idea about

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:49.260
 how much repair happens to organic brain damage.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.540
 Well, I know what I think he was asking is

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.700
 this gentleman has organic brain damage and he's asking how

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.740
 much relevance

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.740
 brain damage.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.740
 Well, I know what I think he was asking is...

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:09.900
 Sorry, we're having a lot of feedback from the caller. The listener needs to turn his radio down when he speaks to us.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.780
 Okay, did you hear that? Listen, if you could...

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:18.540
 I unfortunately couldn't hear the answer otherwise, so I had to get close to my radio. Okay.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:25.580
 Okay, so just one small caller. You are suffering with traumatic brain injury. Is that correct?

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.420
 And

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:37.900
 you sound so distant. I'm sorry. I don't know what's... I hear you. Yeah, I'm not too sure either.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.900
 Okay, but what I think he's asking is

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:42.620
 is any of this EMF or ELF

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.920
 frequencies

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.820
 applicable to brain damage? Dr. Peat, he wanted to know if you thought that that could help his brain damage.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.460
 I think

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.540
 the random

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:02.940
 the white noise... I'm hearing all of you now. I'm nowhere near my radio. What I was

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.480
 possibly asking is

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.580
 what advice would you have for somebody who

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.600
 realizes that

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.860
 there is damage?

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:21.180
 Hello?

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.340
 I think

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:25.340
 when the brain

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.860
 has

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.600
 any

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.300
 inefficiency

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.920
 from whatever cause, it's more susceptible

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:36.520
 to

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.740
 interference from being around a broadcast station, for example.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:48.860
 The healthier the brain is, the higher its threshold is to that kind of

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.220
 pollution.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.340
 And

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:54.460
 the

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.760
 healing influence of the natural hormones

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.420
 proceeds at any age and

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.380
 in any starting condition.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:10.620
 In traumatic brain injury, for example, they found that

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.060
 progesterone and vitamin D

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.180
 are both of them extremely helpful for

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.620
 facilitating

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.620
 repair, keeping down

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.080
 the

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.080
 inflammatory processes

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.380
 that would

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:37.580
 amount to something like a scar formation rather than a creation of new functioning nerve circuits.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:43.340
 If I might interject just because I'm only

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.660
 barely understanding half of this because of the weird connection,

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.380
 I'm nowhere near my radio, but he seems to be saying something about

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.120
 progesterone and vitamin D

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.180
 as being helpful for

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:04.860
 brain function. Yeah, that's correct. If you look online, you'll find lots of articles

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.020
 published by

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:10.380
 credible universities and scientists engaged in

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:16.860
 traumatic brain injury as a subject specifically mentioning progesterone being very supportive and very

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.720
 anti-inflammatory.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.040
 So as a layman's question,

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.220
 where do you get

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.220
 progesterone? Is that

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:35.680
 something that would be prescribed or is that something that one could find on their own or? You can find vitamin D and

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.220
 progesterone online.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:45.660
 What I heard was you can find vitamin D and progesterone online.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:53.160
 Correct. You can find both of those in a good health food store too. As a supplement. Yeah, there's nothing restricted about them.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:38:00.040
 And there might be three or four doctors in the country who are willing to prescribe those things,

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.000
 but it isn't necessary to have a prescription for them.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.960
 And also, Dr. Peat, where you recommend...

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.720
 Where does the, if I might ask, where does the progesterone come from?

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.360
 It's usually from wild yam.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.080
 It's synthesized from wild yam as a starting material.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.920
 It's the same molecule

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.920
 that your brain

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.440
 manufactures.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:31.980
 The brain has the highest concentration of any tissue in the body of progesterone.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.680
 It's an essential brain

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.840
 stabilizing molecule.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:43.240
 Okay, I think we should wrap this one up and move on to the next caller who's waiting.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.680
 I appreciate your questions and hopefully you were able to hear

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.560
 what we were trying to say. But next caller, caller you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.360
 Are you there, caller?

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:01.800
 I see the lights are flashing. Well, they are, first of all. But my main question is to all three of you.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.040
 What do you, and I'll take my answer off the air.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:10.040
 What do you know, if anything, about Dr. Hilda Clark's machine? I was

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.320
 thinking about that. Right, in terms of

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.440
 Rife.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:21.160
 I'm sorry, we're having a lot of feedback here. I think Hilda Clark's

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.680
 apparatus was a simple direct current

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.960
 device, which is

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.280
 in Robert Beckford's research, he found that he could

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.240
 promote and normalize,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.720
 promote nerve regeneration,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.920
 and

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.360
 establish normal function when nerves had been cut.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:46.200
 But the use that Hilda Clark

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.920
 made of her direct current device,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:54.840
 I don't think there was any research supporting the things she claimed for it.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.320
 There we go.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.880
 Okay, let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.840
 Hi, yes, I'm calling from Washington, Tacoma region, and I'm calling on behalf of my husband since he wasn't able to call in due to

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.640
 work.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.020
 He works in the medical field and was recently denied a influenza vaccination

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:22.760
 Okay, for some reason we're hearing the engineer talking to

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:27.640
 He works in the medical field and he was recently denied an influenza vaccination exemption request

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.560
 by his hospital's immunization exemption appeals committee,

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:37.500
 despite the hospital having a written policy that allows employees with strongly held personal beliefs against vaccination

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.760
 to simply wear a mask instead of receiving the flu shot.

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:48.220
 My question to Ray P is since these health care workers have compulsory annual flu vaccination with toxic adjuvants,

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.440
 are there any changes that you would recommend to such people to their diet

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:59.660
 or supplementation regimen around the time of vaccination in order to mitigate the effects of adjuvants on systemic inflammation?

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:06.120
 For example, is it safe or effective to increase aspirin intake in order to minimize cytokine production?

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:14.680
 Yeah, interesting. So good, good question. We were going to cover adjuvants specifically in Dr. Peat's polio article,

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.640
 but Dr. Peat, would you speak to that? Did you hear that clearly?

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.440
 Yeah, and the same things that will protect you against

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.680
 any injury from radiation to

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.800
 trauma or bacterial

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.680
 toxins,

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:40.360
 they can be used to protect against the aluminum particulate matter and the other

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.900
 random proteins that are contaminating

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.500
 vaccines.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.500
 Aspirin is an important one.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.340
 Progesterone and the

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:59.640
 youth-associated steroids, pregnenolone and DHEA and progesterone in particular,

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.600
 are protective against

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.800
 the whole

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.040
 range of inflammatory processes.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:14.520
 Okay, I mean, what kind of doses would you recommend on aspirin? Like a couple grams a day?

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.840
 Then you'd want to be taking vitamin K with that?

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.560
 Or would you think a low dose would be sufficient?

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.760
 I think

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.760
 the day or two before

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.880
 and the following vaccination, I think

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.680
 probably

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.800
 500 milligrams per day would be good.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.000
 And that would require some

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:45.800
 vitamin K as well? Vitamin K2? Yeah, vitamin K is another generally protective factor.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:50.140
 Calcium, sodium, magnesium,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.800
 these have a basic

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.840
 anti-inflammatory function when you get them through good

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.280
 food.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.800
 Okay, so did that address your question, ma'am?

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.840
 It definitely did. Thank you for your time, Dr. Rapi. Yeah, you're welcome. Thanks for calling.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.560
 Okay, so those people listening, this is Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMED Galbraith Hall,

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:19.480
 91.1 FM. From now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in and that number is

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.180
 707-923-3911.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:25.480
 Once again, 707-923-3911.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:34.120
 We do have another caller here lined up. So let's take this next caller call away from, what's your question?

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.800
 Hi, I'm in New Harris and this is Kim.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.800
 I wanted to share that there is a site online, Dr. Pollock,

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.820
 pawlua.com.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:51.640
 Can you hear me? Yep, I can hear you, Dr. Pollock, you said, yeah.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:58.200
 The engineer is talking to someone now and apparently it's cutting into you. So I don't know what's happening.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.560
 Yeah, I can hear you again. So just say that again.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.720
 Hello?

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.080
 Yes, Kim, we can hear you now. The engineer is not speaking so we can hear you.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:13.020
 Okay, it's interesting. I can't really hear you guys, but I wanted to tell you Dr. Pollock.com

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:18.360
 p-a-w-l-u-c-l-u-k Pollock.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.320
 He has done extensive research on pulse electromagnetic fields

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.480
 and his latest

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.400
 blog

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.840
 talks about

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:36.360
 traumatic brain injury. It was just posted February 10th, 2020. Good. You can sign up for his article

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.640
 at drpollock.com.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:44.280
 Well, good, well, thank you for sharing that. It's very timely.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.200
 Hopefully the first caller can go online and look up Dr. Pollock.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:57.240
 Okay, so for all of those of you listening, I'm very sorry about the trouble with feedback and not hearing us properly.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.880
 I know it has been a question in the past and some people have been pretty vociferous about it.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.280
 Okay, so let's take this next caller. Caller you're on the airway from and what's your question?

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.640
 Hello, how are you guys?

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.960
 Doing good. How are you? What's your question away from?

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.800
 Hello?

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:17.080
 Hello caller we can hear you.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.880
 How are you folks doing?

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.800
 Good. What's your question?

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:27.240
 I have a question. First, I just want to say have you guys ever heard of Dharmasingh Kultham D?

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:30.040
 No.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:35.720
 He has, I can't really hear you, but he has a book called Food is Medicine

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.040
 which I haven't read yet and I've read a little bit as Meditation as Medicine.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.240
 Hello?

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.240
 Hi, we can still hear you.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.200
 Okay.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.680
 So what's your question?

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:56.520
 Are you talking to me? Yeah, we heard part of your...

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.920
 Okay. Yeah, somebody just told me I was going to be next.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:07.720
 The Dharmasingh Kultham D, he talks about how when you meditate and your tongue hits the roof of your mouth,

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.800
 it releases amino acids

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.800
 to your brain and helps rebuild your cells or releases amino acids from your brain.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.880
 And

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.880
 it's been real helpful for me for healing

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:23.240
 bone injuries. But the question I have is how does

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.960
 spices,

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.840
 how do spices help our digestive system? Like do they help our cells

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.400
 take in nutrients and stuff like that? I could take my answer off the line. Thank you.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.560
 Okay, I think Dr. Peat you want to answer that probably with a

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:49.240
 lots of spices or allergenic type response, but what do you think about spices and nutrient uptake?

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.280
 You know the idea that

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.100
 anything stimulating your appetite,

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.040
 your nerves, your brain

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:01.640
 is in control of your digestive system.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.960
 That was

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.960
 Pavlov's

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.120
 basic research

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.200
 seeing how the brain

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.620
 manages the whole digestive process.

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:15.400
 And

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:21.900
 if you have negative thoughts, anxiety, you'll have digestive problems.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.760
 The spices that stimulate

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:34.460
 salivation, for example, will stimulate secretion in your stomach and small intestine.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.200
 And

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.640
 make everything

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.080
 digest

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.760
 optimally.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.760
 But some spices

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.640
 happen to be allergenic for some people. So

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:51.180
 you have to be cautious. Well, you have to experiment and find out. And also just like chili or capsicum,

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.540
 that increases blood flow so that it can improve digestion.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:48:02.600
 Okay, so but in general, the caller was asking about spices as aids to nutrient absorption. And I think

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:10.440
 what you've mentioned about people that have malabsorption syndrome, for example, is when they're not actually producing enough bile from the liver or

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:16.760
 they're not stimulated to release, you know, pepsin or any of these other digestive enzymes. There are certainly

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:21.500
 digestive enzymes that can work, but obviously there's plenty of herbs that do stimulate

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:27.400
 secretion of salivary enzymes as well as digestive enzymes and increase hydrochloric acid.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.560
 And that is all part and parcel of nutrient absorption. And a lot of these would be termed

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.360
 spices. So things that would be

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.440
 aperitifs,

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.440
 things like cinnamon,

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.960
 ginger,

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.080
 cloves.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.920
 These are definite spices, but I also recognize that there are people that are definitely

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:52.840
 sensitive to those and they can cause other symptoms. Well, bitter herbs are very useful at increasing the digestion,

00:48:52.840 --> 00:49:00.040
 the digestive enzymes and increasing absorption of nutrients and increasing stomach acid. And of course people that are low thyroid

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.360
 will have a decrease in all of the

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.840
 enzymes and the

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.540
 digestive secretions needed for

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.880
 absorbing nutrition. The bitters

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.200
 work on multiple levels, stimulating your nerves,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.440
 and some of them

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.180
 actually improve

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.180
 mitochondrial energy production.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:23.160
 Some of them have systemic,

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.640
 sedative and stabilizing effects.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:32.200
 They can be very important to your general health. Yeah, good. Things like ginseng, wormwood,

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:39.080
 any of the... We've started giving our daughter a century. Yes, which is a little bitter. It's a little clover. Yeah.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:44.840
 All right, excellent. There is one more caller. Let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.520
 What's your question?

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.400
 Yeah, my question relates to the topic of the day.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:55.320
 Dr. Peat, were you referring in your earlier discussion on energy to scaler energy,

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.560
 which ultimately can be...

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.160
 It doesn't really degrade. It's been around since I guess Tesla

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.960
 developed it.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.080
 Essentially also known as zero point energy and the health benefits, I guess,

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.280
 as I understand it, in a nutshell, are that it

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:19.960
 enables the cells to operate at the appropriate frequencies, which I guess are in the 70 to 90 millivolt range.

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:23.160
 Is that what you were referring to earlier?

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:28.120
 No, no. Earlier we were... I'm sorry. I'm asking Dr. Peat.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:33.500
 Oh, well, the stabilizing hormones

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:38.120
 and the

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:43.340
 nutrients and physical factors of thyroid hormone, progesterone, pregnenolone,

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.560
 carbon dioxide, for example, all

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.340
 tend to

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:52.340
 stabilize around the

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.820
 70 to 90 millivolt

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:58.240
 resting potential.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.800
 But the

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.680
 high energy state

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:10.880
 really is a quiescent state, so the voltage is

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.600
 not

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.600
 active. It's a quiescent.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:18.080
 My second question...

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:24.400
 My other question relates to Dr. Ling, I guess, who died last year. I heard you speaking about him earlier.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.960
 I guess his AIH

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.780
 hypothesis...

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:34.320
 Okay, yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:40.480
 Hello, can you hear me?

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.800
 Up to Ling's

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.340
 association induction hypothesis.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:52.240
 Yeah, yeah, sorry. So essentially like a red blood cell has 300 million of these NPUs, so

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.720
 within one red blood cell. So

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.680
 essentially, are we talking about health that must be

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:02.640
 at some point analyzed not at the cellular level, but at the NPU level?

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:06.880
 No, no. The cell

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.960
 in Ling's view is

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.600
 a unified phase

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.480
 which

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.640
 doesn't have the

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:29.360
 properties of a random solution, but a single unified functional

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.040
 sort of a personality

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.040
 that goes through

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.000
 basic changes

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.480
 that organize its function.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.040
 Where did we get that?

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:53.840
 All right, I think we've got some real problems here. Let's just call this good for the evening. It's five to eight.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.720
 I've got a quick question. I wanted to ask Dr. Peat.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:02.180
 Dr. Peat, I had somebody send an email in who was concerned

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.960
 with the fact that most cattle,

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.680
 most milk dairy cattle

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:11.760
 are kept in a permanently pregnant state and he was wondering

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:17.360
 what you thought perhaps is the potential estrogen load of milk.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:23.360
 I don't know if it's that relevant, but what do you think about milk and

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.040
 cows that are constantly in estrus?

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.660
 There is an

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.660
 anti-milk lobby that

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:34.300
 makes a lot of

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:38.400
 publicity and that's one of their current ploys

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.240
 to direct people away from milk. But if you look at the

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:44.880
 consumption of milk

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.880
 over the last 50 years,

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.640
 there's a tremendous decrease even in children.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.120
 More and more they're

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.120
 shifting to so-called

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.920
 vegetable-based

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.080
 milk substitutes.

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.080
 And during this time

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.080
 looking at the population

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:09.040
 you see a tremendous increase in premature puberty in girls

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:15.440
 and a great increase in gynecomastia, the development of breasts in boys and men.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.120
 As the milk consumption decreases,

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.520
 estrogenicity...

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:26.480
 And the cows aren't kept in constant pregnancy because I have a dairy farmer friend.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.600
 He's saying that basically they're pregnant, they're made pregnant,

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:34.160
 they deliver the cow, a baby calf, and then obviously they're producing the milk, but then they're

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:36.780
 automatically made pregnant again essentially.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.360
 No, they get a drying off period.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:45.120
 One of the reasons milk tends to have an overall

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.020
 protective effect against estrogen

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:52.160
 is that the estrogens that are in milk are in a

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.320
 detoxified form. Estrone sulfate, for example,

00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:00.020
 is the least harmless form of estrogen.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:03.120
 Not at all comparable to the

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:08.000
 estrogens that are in the soy milk substitute. Right, exactly.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.260
 Okay, well, let's hold it there Dr. Peat because we've only got a minute and a half before the top of the hour.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.980
 Thank you very much for joining us again. I'm sorry about the

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:21.420
 the difficulty with the engineering and the sound and the feedback and everything else. So

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.620
 for those people who've tuned in and want to know more about Dr. Peat, he can be reached at

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:29.400
 www.raypeat.com

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:37.500
 He's got lots of articles fully referenced about many different pathologies, most of which people

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:40.220
 are going to look, they will find certainly

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:45.980
 information relevant to what they're searching for. And then also he's written some books and

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.940
 obviously he's lectured fairly widely, but

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:52.940
 information is quite hard to find out about Dr. Peat because I think he's

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:58.220
 I think he ends up doing a lot of his own research and doesn't really

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.460
 doesn't really get around like he used to. But anyway, thanks so much for joining us Dr. Peat.

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.620
 And for those people who want to find out any more about us,

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:09.200
 our business web address is westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.900
 My wife and I both produce medicinal herb extracts. We're GMP

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:20.140
 registered and inspected and audited and all that good stuff. And certified organic. Certified organic.

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:24.380
 Yeah, I've been doing it over 20 years too. So for those people who've listened to the show and

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.860
 called in, thanks for your questions. Until March of next,

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:31.740
 Thursday, Friday of next month in March,

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:35.040
 good night. Good night. Thank you for listening.
