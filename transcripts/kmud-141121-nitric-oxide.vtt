 And as usual throughout the broadcast day, the views and opinions expressed on Redwood

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.880
 Community Radio are those of the speakers and not necessarily those of the listeners,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.080
 sorry, certainly not necessarily those of the listeners, but not necessarily those of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.240
 the station, the underwriters, or the board of directors.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.800
 And it could easily be sarcasm, but of course sarcasm is totally easy to understand on the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.600
 radio, so you would know it if it is.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.080
 And without further ado, we'll get to our next talk show, which is Ask Your Herb Doctor.

 Well, thank you once again. This is Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMU DeGarboville, 91.1 FM.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 My name's Andrew Murray, and for those of you who perhaps have never listened to the

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.080
 show, which runs every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm, I'm a licensed medical

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.080
 herbalist who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.080
 My wife and I run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.080
 of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice, and has become very consistent

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.080
 with the last couple of years. Dr. Peat is happily joining us on the show to share his

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.080
 latest discoveries in his research. So, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU DeGarboville,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.080
 91.1 FM, and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.080
 in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of nitric oxide.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.080
 The number, if you live in the area, is 923 3911, or if you live outside the area, the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:47.080
 toll-free number is 1800 KMUD RAD, and we can be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.080
 for consultations or further information Monday through Friday, 9 to 5.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.080
 So, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us again.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.080
 For those, perhaps, people who have never heard you, would you give an outline of your

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.080
 academic and professional background so that people can understand the work that you've

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.080
 been doing?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:16.080
 First, I studied for a master's degree at the University of Oregon in literature-related

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.080
 things, and then studied linguistics for a while. Finally, came back to study biology,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 1968 to '72, specializing in physiology of reproduction and aging, and especially the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 biochemical side of aging physiology.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 Okay. All right. So, I wanted to ask you some questions about your most recent newsletter,

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 which was based on nitric oxide, and hopefully open it up for people to understand the context

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 in which we're talking about as a product. I think the very first question that I wanted

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:09.080
 to pose, given that the compound manufactured by Pfizer will be well known to many, both

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:19.080
 in its generic form and in the off-counter or other brand label types of product, being

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 Viagra, nitric oxide majorly has a vasodilatory effect, as I understand it. That's just one

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.080
 of them, though, I guess, that's mediated by Viagra. And that drug is approved, or has

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 an FDA approval, for erectile dysfunction.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.080
 What is it about nitric oxide that makes it so dangerous and responsible for things like

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.080
 cardiac arrest, stroke, arrhythmias, and also increased ocular pressure, which most people

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.080
 wouldn't even associate with Viagra, but I've had several people who have used it and have

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.080
 had heart attack and stroke. And that prompted me to even look at it as being something that

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.080
 should definitely be taken seriously. And I know also the kind of recreational drug

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:13.080
 users who use poppers, exactly the same compound, has some very damaging effects on the body.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.080
 What's your take on nitric oxide?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:27.080
 Speaking of poppers, several of the early theorists of AIDS were blaming it on whatever

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 the chemical is. I guess it's nitric oxide that's produced from the poppers, some kind

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.080
 of nitric compound anyway. And they were arguing that that in itself was enough to account

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:51.080
 for the AIDS among the people who were using that as a pleasure drug. But in the 1980s,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 everyone knew nitric oxide primarily as a toxic component of smog. So when people started

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:08.080
 discovering that it was being produced in small amounts in the body, immediately they

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:18.080
 started looking for the parallels with smog poisoning, lung injury, circulatory disease,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.080
 and so on. And one of the first things they found was that it kills the beta cells in

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:33.080
 the pancreas that produce insulin. So in the early 1940s, there was this flurry of papers

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:44.080
 demonstrating that our internal smog is just as toxic as Los Angeles smog. But then the

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:54.080
 Viagra patent and publicity came out in the later 1990s. And right then, suddenly the

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:04.080
 medical publications all found that it was a glorious, protective, natural, protecting

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:11.080
 just about every function you can think of, making you smarter, have more endurance, and

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:20.080
 all kinds of good things. But then after a few years, I guess the investment in publicity

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:29.080
 started wearing off and people started coming back to the diabetes producing effects and

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:42.080
 looking at what it's actually doing biochemically. The basic way it causes harm probably is that

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:53.080
 it is kind of parallel to the effects of carbon monoxide or cyanide in being a competitor

00:08:53.080 --> 00:09:03.080
 for oxygen in the mitochondria, the enzymes that produce most of our energy. It in several

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:13.080
 ways knocks out not only the key final respiratory enzyme, cytochrome oxidase, but it poisons

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:24.080
 the previous electron transporting parts of the mitochondrion too. So simply turning off

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:33.080
 the energy supply can account for a lot of its problems. But it also, when you're stopping

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:44.080
 the oxidative run through the mitochondrion, the mitochondrion starts leaking, in effect,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:53.080
 electrons that have no place to go. And the whole cell shifts over to a reduced chemical

00:09:53.080 --> 00:10:02.080
 state. The electrons aren't being constantly drawn down. And so the balance, if you imagine

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:10.080
 a stream of electrons falling steadily towards oxygen, when you cut off that, they accumulate

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:21.080
 and float back. And literally the reducing environment shifts the whole balance of the

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:29.080
 self-reduced sulfur compounds and it's expressed all the way out to the surface. And the surface

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:38.080
 properties of the cell change. And there are some enzymes right across the surface so that

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:48.080
 this reducing energy from inside the cell is available to reduce oxygen outside the

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:56.080
 cells. And mitochondria aren't using it productively. In fact, this cloud of excess electrons flows

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:07.080
 through the enzyme called NADPH oxidase and directly reduces oxygen on the surface. And

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:17.080
 that produces superoxide, possibly toxic free radical, which then produces hydrogen peroxide.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:27.080
 And in the immune cells that are under stress, that's considered productive because it helps

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:40.080
 to break down bacteria or whatever is exciting, disturbing the white blood cell. So this toxic

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:53.080
 oxidative burst has its useful aspects, but probably it's one of the better outcomes rather

00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:08.080
 than just using the hydrogen peroxide directly or producing nitric oxide. This hydrogen peroxide

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:18.080
 can be used to oxidize chloride that is always present into hypochlorite, which becomes one

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:28.080
 of the very strong germ digesting chemicals that when a phagocyte has eaten something,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:35.080
 then basically it's like Clorox. It helps break down the particle.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:43.080
 Okay, so in general, the nitric oxide forms of a pretty energy wasteful mechanism and

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.080
 also damaging in its free radical producing effects.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:59.080
 Yeah, this shift of the whole cell away from oxidation starts that whole process that people

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:05.080
 are still just starting to put together the whole picture of how it fits into physiology.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:13.080
 But it has its effects on the nervous system that people are now seeing that Parkinson's

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:25.080
 disease, for example, has the signs that nitric oxide is one of the central damaging components

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.080
 of the dopamine system.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:36.080
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Galbraith 91.1 FM. From 7.30 to the

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.080
 end of the show at 8 o'clock, callers are invited to ask questions about this month's

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.080
 subject of nitric oxide and the ramifications thereof. It doesn't have to be specifically

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.080
 about this subject. I know people often call in about other subjects that Dr. Peat's well

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.080
 versed in, like thyroid, etc. But the number here in the area is 9233911, or if you're

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:02.080
 outside the area, there's a toll-free number, which is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:12.080
 So, so far as the damaging effects of nitric oxide are concerned, I think there are three

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.080
 species of nitric oxide, and the one I think that's most commonly referenced in PubMed

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.080
 and other scientific literature for its effects, both negative and for the small beneficial

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:33.080
 effect of its burst, energy burst effect on bacteria, etc., is the inducible nitric oxide

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:39.080
 synthase. And that's been implicated in causing an increased severity of disease in quite

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.080
 a few different models, one of which was a herpes simplex model and kephalitis, which

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:51.080
 is a brain inflammation in mice. And then I saw other references as well to chronic

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.080
 viral hepatitis in man, is definitely being aggravated by nitric oxide, and potentially

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:04.080
 nitric oxide suppression might be a useful treatment for people suffering from chronic

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:10.080
 hepatitis. What are the most reasonable ways of blocking nitric oxide synthesis in the

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.080
 body, or at least managing its production and providing a buffer to it, so that you

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:22.080
 can maintain the little nitric oxide that is beneficial whilst keeping in check any

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:31.080
 excess? The body has its various natural ways of keeping it under control. For example,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:40.080
 progesterone inhibits the enzyme that makes nitric oxide, while estrogen excites and activates

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:50.080
 that enzyme. And so when the cell is stabilized by a generous amount of progesterone and related

00:15:50.080 --> 00:16:00.080
 neuro steroids, the stabilizing things, including pregnenolone, those hold down the production.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:09.080
 Anything that irritates the cell and excites it, the endotoxin from the intestine is probably

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:19.080
 the biggest single constant promoter of the production of nitric oxide. And sometimes

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:28.080
 serotonin and histamine, which are produced in reaction to endotoxin and other irritating

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:38.080
 things, these can increase in various tissues. Serotonin and histamine can increase the formation

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:53.080
 of nitric oxide. In some situations, caffeine and similar drugs that are known to have a

00:16:53.080 --> 00:17:02.080
 variety of protective antitoxic effects are acting by locally in a certain type of tissue,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:15.080
 turning down the nitric oxide production. But in recent years, the old dye, it was used

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:25.080
 as a treatment for malaria 100 years ago, called methylene blue. It's a common lab chemical

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:32.080
 used for showing the presence of a reducing compound. For example, vitamin C turns it

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:45.080
 white. Lots of people use it to demonstrate chemistry in a visible form. It's being used

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:56.080
 for a tremendous variety of therapeutic purposes. And simply by turning down nitric oxide, which

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:04.080
 causes so many bad effects, methylene blue is having very positive effects in this great

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:16.080
 variety of things, including herpes and other viral, chronic viral diseases.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:26.080
 The recent news about the Ebola virus, some people have noticed that one of the things,

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:35.080
 if the patient is going to die, their nitric oxide level in the blood is very high. And

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:42.080
 it's what is causing the blood vessels to leak and break down, causing blood to leak

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:50.080
 out every place that it shouldn't. But you see something similar in ordinary influenza

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:59.080
 and other viral infections. The blood vessels tend to become leaky and produce swelling

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:07.080
 and a lot of very common side effects that you see in diseases of all sorts.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:13.080
 What would you think would be a good short-term approach to that, to block that?

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:24.080
 From what's available presently, niacinamide and progesterone are things that are commonly

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:33.080
 available. But methylene blue is probably, when it's available, it's probably a good

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:43.080
 emergency thing to turn off the massive amounts of overproduced nitric oxide.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:50.080
 I did read an article, I think there were several references to methylene blue and its

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.080
 use either promoting or suppressing depending on a dose. And it seemed like very small amounts

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:03.080
 of methylene blue were having this favorable suppressive activity where larger amounts

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.080
 could actually cause...

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:14.080
 Yeah, some of the toxicity experiments have been kind of ridiculous in which they feed

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:22.080
 rats the equivalent, if for a person it would be an ounce or two of crystalline methylene

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:34.080
 blue, which it would just that amount of concentrated any chemical is going to be harmful. But it's

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:46.080
 been 25 years ago, someone did a very well-controlled study of severe depressed people. 15 milligrams

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:59.080
 per day was all it took to relieve severe depression. And the side effects of even many

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:05.080
 times higher doses than that are essentially zero.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:18.080
 Two studies, one by the NIH six years ago and one more recent, gave graded doses up

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:25.080
 to what would be the equivalent of about four or five or six grams a day for a person of

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:34.080
 the crystalline material, many times higher than the curative antidepressive dose. And

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:43.080
 they did it for the whole lifespan of rats and mice and saw no life-shortening effects

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:51.080
 in either rats or mice. But in female mice, in both studies, they saw an extension of

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.080
 the maximum lifespan with the highest dose.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:06.080
 So in these ridiculously high doses, many times, I guess about five to 10 times higher

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:14.080
 than the dose Paul Ehrlich used more than a hundred years ago to treat malaria. And

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:22.080
 he cured two cases of malaria in a period of just a couple of weeks, giving five doses

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:33.080
 a day of 100 milligrams each time orally. But with very much smaller doses, you see

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:41.080
 changes in the brain and reduced stress and curing depression and so on.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:49.080
 But with several times higher doses than he used to cure malaria, you still don't see

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:59.080
 any harmful effects. And in animal experiments, it took one of the gigantic doses equivalent

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:06.080
 to, I think it was about eight grams a day for a person before it stopped showing the

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.080
 simple antidepressive actions.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.080
 Now, do you think the effects of methylene blue are, there's probably multiple effects,

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:24.080
 but I wonder if any of the electron quenching or electrical stabilizing activity of methylene

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:32.080
 blue might be responsible for interacting with different proteins and that kind of...

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:42.080
 Yeah, one of the known mechanisms is that it can receive electrons from the mediator

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:51.080
 that receives them from glucose. And NADH, for example, can be oxidized and then the

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:59.080
 methylene blue can pass those electrons onto the part of the mitochondrion that is still

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:09.080
 working, bypassing damaged parts of the mitochondrion. So it can act like the missing enzyme, simply

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:22.080
 restoring mitochondrial function. But in subtler ways, for example, the receptor that causes

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:31.080
 excitotoxic damage from overdoses of glutamic acid, for example, anything that is depleting

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:42.080
 the brain of energy while stimulating it activates these glutamate receptors. And there are two

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:52.080
 sulfur groups in those proteins that respond to excitotoxins that methylene blue oxidizes

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.080
 those and turns off the receptor and stops the excitotoxic process. And that's one of

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:07.080
 the ways the excitotoxic process is one of the things that turns on nitric oxide production

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:15.080
 going ahead and killing the cell. That's why the excited state is toxic, largely because

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.080
 of the production of nitric oxide.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:24.080
 Okay, now I guess methylene blue is not an FDA-controlled substance or anything. I think

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.080
 it's fairly widely available. It's just a dye, isn't it? I think typically it's known

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.080
 as a dye. I know it's a tissue stain.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:39.080
 And fish stores use it. I'm not sure how they use it, but it's for sterilizing aquariums

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:48.080
 or something. And fish farmers use it to cure various fish infections.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:54.080
 Okay, well, people listening perhaps might want to start looking up methylene blue and

00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:03.080
 its implications in the treatment and/or prevention of different degenerative conditions. So extremely

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:09.080
 cheap, I'm sure, not all patented, not controlled. And if there's some good studies coming out

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.080
 showing methylene blue's positive effects in blocking nitric oxide, I think that could

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.080
 be well worth people looking at as an alternative to many of the drugs that people might be

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.080
 using for different conditions.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080
 Okay.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:31.080
 I've counted about six different ways that methylene blue stops or blocks the production

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.080
 of nitric oxide.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.080
 Okay, go on. Do you want to share them?

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:53.080
 No. The excitotoxic thing was one, preventing excess polymerization of the microtubules.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:27:04.080
 Another, probably increasing progesterone production, inhibiting estrogen production.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:13.080
 But probably the most important thing people should do is to start being critical about

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:21.080
 the tremendous amount of propaganda selling the idea that people should eat more arginine

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.080
 to increase their nitric oxide production.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:33.080
 Wow. Wow. Yeah. I don't know, it always amazes me how this stuff actually comes into circulation

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:44.080
 as "common knowledge" and how easily influenced the media is by Big Pharma. Anyway, not to

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.080
 go on too much about that, because we could probably go on forever about how Big Pharma

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.080
 have their hooks all over. Anyway, it's coming up for 7.30. I've seen the lights flashing

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.080
 a couple of times, and I don't know if anyone's on the line at the moment. No shaking his

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.080
 head, must have gone off. Okay, no problem.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.080
 You're listening to Ask Your Ob-Docs, we're on KMED Gallup 91.1 FM. From now until the

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.080
 end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in any questions, either related or

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:12.080
 unrelated to this month's subject of nitric oxide and how to control its damaging effects.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:19.080
 Dr. Raymond Peat is with us in the studio. He's a pretty foremost authority on lots of

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:27.080
 different subjects surrounding hormones and aging and all the interactions thereon. He's

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:33.080
 with us in the show. We have a caller on the line already, look at that. Okay, caller,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.080
 you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:50.080
 I'm from Southern Humboldt here. Okay. Yeah. John, I wanted to know if all of the estrogen

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:56.080
 imitators that are around us in the environment that we've created for ourselves to live in

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.080
 are also something that'll put us at risk?

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.080
 Very much, very much so, yeah. That's it.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.080
 I think I've seen that bisphenol A activates nitric oxide production.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:16.080
 There you go, and that's an estrogen promoter, or mimic. Yeah, okay, so environmental estrogens

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:22.080
 very much have a negative impact on our health, many of which have come from petrochemical

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.080
 industry, plastics industry, etc. Dr. Peat, what do you think some of the most damaging

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.080
 environmental estrogens that you know of that are...

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:40.080
 Oh, the natural estrogen is... It's damaging enough.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:48.080
 Yeah, it's through the sewage, it's getting into the rivers, and for the environment,

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:56.080
 I think that the natural estrogen and the birth control estrogens that are many times

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:05.080
 stronger than natural estrogen are showing up in all of the downstream waterways that

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.080
 receive sewage. So wastewater management does not selectively

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:15.080
 remove hormones from the water, then, are you saying? It's found... I wonder if it's

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.080
 reasonable to posit that there is detectable amounts in drinking water, even.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.080
 Well, as a sewer board person, I can tell you that one of the ways that they tell whether

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:32.080
 water is coming from a sewage system or from nature is they look for caffeine, that's considered

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.080
 one of the chemicals that makes it through and is a marker for sewage as opposed to animal

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.080
 waste or whatever. So yeah, a lot of those chemicals do make it through.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.080
 Okay, did we have any other questions?

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:55.080
 Oh yeah, the other part of my question was, is there a plant or an herb that actually

00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:01.080
 produces or mimics methylene blue that you can ingest instead of...

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:13.080
 Oh, I've been looking around at various molecules and it was a precursor for many of the drugs,

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:22.080
 the tricyclic antidepressants and tricyclic antihistamines and anti-inflammatories, I

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:30.080
 think all grew out of the dye industry that methylene blue was one of the very first examples

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:42.080
 of, but it's a three ring molecule and that seems probably because it's structurally roughly

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:50.080
 the same size and shape as the steroid hormones, it probably can get into many of the places

00:31:50.080 --> 00:32:01.080
 that our natural steroids act. So I've looked around at plants that make analogous things.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:10.080
 The tetracyclines have many of the same anti-inflammatory effects, I suspect they're also working against

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.080
 nitric oxide, they just have one extra ring but in a very similar arrangement.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:24.080
 And vitamin K and vitamin E are even analogous in some ways.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:40.080
 Lopacho, a chemical from a South American tree, it's a dye that has many of the anti-inflammatory,

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.080
 anti-cancer properties of methylene blue. Spell that.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:58.080
 Lopacho is a tabubui, so T-A-B-E-B-U-I-A, tabubui, and impetigenosa, it's a South American,

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:04.080
 tall South American hardwood, but it's used extensively for cancer as Dr. Peate mentioned,

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.080
 they call it pau de arco.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:15.080
 Recently people are talking about a thing, an Asian herb, I think one of the names is

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:25.080
 black cumin, but it contains thymoquinone and the quinones are I think the essential

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:38.080
 model of the protective pro-oxidant stabilizing chemical and thymoquinone is considered to

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:46.080
 be a very powerful anti-inflammatory and I suspect that it'll turn out to be acting against

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.080
 excess nitric oxide.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.080
 So it's a free radical quencher again, isn't it, the quinones?

00:33:52.080 --> 00:34:00.080
 Yeah, that's just one of their many, they seem to activate the right kind of oxidation

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.080
 while quenching the bad kind.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080
 Okay, very good.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.080
 All right, well thank you very much.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.080
 Yeah, thanks for your caller, caller. We have three callers on the lines here, so let's

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.080
 get them one after the other. Caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.080
 Me?

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.080
 Hi, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.080
 Hi, Arcata.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.080
 Arcata, okay. Go ahead, what's your question?

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.080
 Thanks, I've been listening to your show for a good four years or so.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.080
 A couple of quick review questions from the past that I've been wondering about for a

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:35.080
 long time. It was mentioned some time ago about a nutrient I believe that could help

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.080
 remediate or, you know, fix the earlobe crease. Does that ring any bell?

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.080
 What was the last thing you said?

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.080
 Earlobe crease?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.080
 Oh, the earlobe.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080
 Earlobe crease, yeah.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.080
 That's a thyroid deficiency, isn't it?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.080
 Yeah, I think it is mainly a thyroid deficiency.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:58.080
 Okay, and did I hear at the time a simple recommendation for correction of that? Was

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:03.080
 there a nutrient or is that a much more complex matter to address?

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:12.080
 I think the main thing causing hypothyroidism in so many people is an excess of the polyunsaturated

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:20.080
 fatty acids because they're able to block the production of thyroid, its transport and

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:29.080
 its action. So, they're very capable of antagonizing thyroid function.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:36.080
 So, to avoid all the nuts and seeds that contain liquid oils in them, so nuts and seeds are

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.080
 principally the kind of polyunsaturated sources and obviously there are other polyunsaturated

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:47.080
 yet commonly available in food that you should definitely avoid. So, any of the liquid oils,

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.080
 obviously.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.080
 What about like coconut oil? Is that for?

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.080
 Coconut oil is saturated, so that's good. Dr. Peat's always recommending coconut oil

00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.080
 and butter as being the two saturated sources of fat. That should be the most consumed.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.080
 And then to avoid all the liquids, liquid polyunsaturates, obviously fish oil being

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.080
 the worst.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.080
 Okay. Whoa, like cod liver oil?

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:17.080
 That too, but I think, Dr. Peat, don't you say that the vitamin content in cod liver

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.080
 oil...

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:24.080
 Oh, yeah, if you don't have any better source, cod liver oil is a great source of vitamin

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.080
 D.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.080
 Yeah.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.080
 But it's better to get sunlight.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080
 Yeah.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.080
 Okay.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.080
 Can I have one quick other question?

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.080
 Go ahead.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:40.080
 There was something that came up about eating carrots and I don't know what the term would

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:46.080
 be, but I want to say like an astringent or a cleaning or a purifying or...

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080
 An antiseptic, yeah.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:53.080
 ...a helpful aspect of eating carrots. It was recommended that carrots be cut diagonally

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:59.080
 as a juicer and a cook, I guess, of my own food. I thought that was a bit peculiar and

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.080
 I wondered if that could be elaborated upon.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:07.080
 I think Dr. Peat's always mentioned that grated carrots to increase the surface area is the

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:12.080
 mechanism that's preferred and that's basically is a antiseptic, if you like, for the gut,

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:19.080
 removing excess estrogen and other waste products and it's undigested, so has a pretty good

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.080
 action in the gut without physically being changed.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:28.080
 But like chewing it is not enough to enhance the surface area, like breaking it down?

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:33.080
 Well, not the same because ultimately when you grate the product in a grater then you

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.080
 obviously have a big surface area then and whatever you chew that up from then is going

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:42.080
 to increase it still.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:50.080
 The juice does contain a lot of good things, but if you throw away the fibre you're losing

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:57.080
 the most important thing for stimulating and cleaning the intestine.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.080
 Alright, cool. Thanks for your help.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.080
 Thanks for your call. I've got a couple more callers here, so let's take the next caller.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.080
 Where are you from?

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.080
 Hello, caller. You're on the air. Where are you from?

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:13.080
 Was on the air. Engineer, is he on the air or on?

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.080
 I guess not. Caller, 321. Actually, the other caller hung up too.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080
 Hello?

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.080
 Oh, there you go.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.080
 Oh, I'm here. Yeah.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.080
 Where are you from, caller?

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.080
 Excuse me, I'm from Southern Humboldt.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.080
 Okay, go ahead. What's your question?

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:32.080
 Well, I've got a couple of questions. First, did you say that L-Arginine was bad?

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.080
 I've heard that that was supposed to be good for you, but I'm not sure what it's supposed to do.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.080
 Okay, Dr. Peat, Arginine, you mentioned it a moment ago.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.080
 Yeah, I've been noticing...

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.080
 And is there a difference between Arginine and L-Arginine?

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:54.080
 Yeah, the internet is just swamped with advertisements for ways to supplement Arginine.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:02.080
 L-Arginine is just the natural amino acid, but if you get more than you need,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.080
 it will increase your tendency to overproduce nitric oxide,

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:19.080
 and too much tryptophan happens to boost that, possibly by increasing serotonin,

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:24.080
 but it's very important to keep your amino acids in a good balance,

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:31.080
 especially avoiding too much cysteine, tryptophan, methionine, and Arginine.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:35.080
 So you don't recommend taking an L-Arginine supplement?

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.080
 No, I think it's very dangerous.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.080
 Oh, okay.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:50.080
 Now, did you say that Viagra is bad for you because it's made out of this nitric oxide stuff?

00:39:50.080 --> 00:40:05.080
 It inhibits an enzyme that is supposed to inactivate a substance made by the production of nitric oxide.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:12.080
 Nitric oxide starts a chain reaction, and Viagra keeps that chain reaction going,

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:20.080
 and in the process it ends up systemically increasing not only the effect of nitric oxide,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:26.080
 but even in some situations the level of nitric oxide.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:38.080
 So it probably is increasing the aging process basically in brain, heart, pancreas,

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080
 everywhere you get an excess of nitric oxide.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.080
 But they say having sex is good for you.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.080
 If you can't have sex, that's not so great either.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:52.080
 I mean, is it a matter of moderation and not using it too often?

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.080
 Can it be okay if you use some of it?

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.080
 I mean, I don't know. I'm not a man.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:04.080
 Well, it's one of the essential amino acids, and so if you eat any good high-quality protein,

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:10.080
 even potatoes, milk, cheese, you're going to get all of the arginine you need.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.080
 No, no, I'm talking about Viagra now.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.080
 Oh, Viagra.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:20.080
 Yeah, yeah. I mean, is that like totally bad, or is it okay to have some of it?

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:25.080
 Because I'm saying if that improves the sexual function of an older man,

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.080
 then sexual function is supposed to be a good thing.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.080
 I mean, is there a balance there, or do you think it's totally bad?

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:40.080
 I think it would be better to work on the actual physiological problem,

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.080
 improving natural circulation.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:52.080
 And, for example, restoring good thyroid function will often increase libido and potency.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:42:01.080
 Now, Dr. Peat, I remember now some time ago you also mentioning pregnenolone and/or progesterone as being very positive.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:11.080
 I mean, in the past, it always talked about progesterone potentially being slightly sedative and maybe decreasing.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.080
 I think now you have said this, let me quote you.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:21.080
 I think you said decreasing penis size, but it does not block the vasodilatory ability,

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:26.080
 and so therefore actually does promote and enable erection,

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.080
 and actually is a reasonably safe way of doing that in males.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.080
 Well, what about testosterone?

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.080
 One thing at a time, huh?

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:43.080
 Aging men have decreased amounts of testosterone and progesterone and increasing amounts of estrogen,

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:52.080
 and that increased estrogen and the decreased amounts of the protective steroids,

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:58.080
 I think, will increase the tendency to have erectile problems.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:10.080
 And one of the really odd side effects of increased nitric oxide is that it decreases the ability to make testosterone.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:21.080
 And, at least in women, it lowers the progesterone synthesis, but those are synthesized very similarly.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:33.080
 So I think in both men and women, nitric oxide is opposing and lowering those protective steroids while increasing estrogen.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.080
 Well, what about Cialis? Is that just the same as Viagra?

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.080
 There are several products on the market that are supposed to help men with their erections.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.080
 It's another version.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.080
 Are they all the same?

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.080
 Yeah, pretty much.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:51.080
 All right, well, thank you.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.080
 Yeah, thanks for your call.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:58.080
 Okay, Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you some more questions about nitric oxide

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.080
 and/or some of the articles I've seen about it promoting cancer.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.080
 What are your thoughts on the cancer-promoting effects of nitric oxide?

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:17.080
 I think it's one of the central factors in keeping cancer going, so turning it off.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:22.080
 You don't necessarily think it's a promoter, then?

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.080
 Oh, yeah, it is a definite promoter of cancer growth and metastasis.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:33.080
 Many publications are now recognizing that, breast cancer, prostate cancer,

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:44.080
 and probably every cancer will probably eventually be discovered to respond badly to nitric oxide.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.080
 Okay.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:59.080
 The function of anything interfering with respiration, that's where the Varberg hypothesis was

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:10.080
 that simply shifting away from oxygen as the energy source to being able to produce too much lactic acid,

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:16.080
 even when there's oxygen because the cell has lost its mitochondrial function,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:26.080
 nitric oxide and carbon monoxide are both able to knock out the mitochondrial function

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.080
 and imitate the cancer metabolism.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:44.080
 There are several recent publications showing that the Varberg cancer metabolism is created by nitric oxide excess

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:52.080
 and it's turned off by methylene blue simply by turning off the production of nitric oxide.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.080
 Okay. You're listening to Ask Your Abdoctor on KMUD Galbraithville, 91.1 FM.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:03.080
 From now to the end of the show at 8 o'clock, we're pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us on the show.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.080
 The number here is 923 3911.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:11.080
 Hopefully, outside the area, there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:17.080
 So, Dr. Peat, again, I had a question on my mind during this week

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:23.080
 that reading different research on different diseases and apart from that,

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:34.080
 knowing that some individuals are just inherently more able to enjoy good health seemingly against all odds,

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:42.080
 have you any understanding of why some individuals, for example, are immune to HIV?

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:48.080
 Why some individuals mount a successful response against hepatitis?

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:57.080
 Some individuals just have an innate immunity which enables them to overcome what it is they come into contact with

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.080
 and they don't suffer from it.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:05.080
 Do you think there's any connection between anything that you've read that you know about that you might be able to explain that from?

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:16.080
 Yes, there are new ideas about the whole functioning of the immune system that have been coming up in the last 20 years.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:24.080
 Jamie Cunliffe and Polly Mattson are the leading figures in that view of the immune system.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:36.080
 I see it as imagining the body as an ecosystem which is simply so strong in some people

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:49.080
 at maintaining its own organization and stability that when something extraneous like a bacterium or a virus

00:47:49.080 --> 00:48:04.080
 or a cancer cell happens to invade it, the situation is so tightly organized in favor of maintaining the host organism

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:08.080
 that the invader can't find a place.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:16.080
 The niches are all occupied doing business with the owner of the property.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.080
 There's simply no place to camp out.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.080
 Like the strongman in the house, no one can invade it.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:32.080
 Yes, and I don't see it as a killing of the invader but simply as using up all of the electron space productively

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:40.080
 so that invaders can't do strange things with it like turning sugar into lactic acid.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:53.080
 Okay, I'd love to be able to get into the subject that I saw posted last thing today and that was to quote what I've said before many times

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:57.080
 and I think it's been repeated through generations that you are what you eat.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.080
 I think I'd love to get into that subject with you next month.

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:07.080
 I think we have another call on it anyway but I'd love to get into that subject next month and just show that what we hear sometimes

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:14.080
 really does mean a lot more than we take for granted and that actually a lot of the things that are passed down from old generations to now

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:22.080
 really have their roots in fundamental science and that science now is at last being able to bear that out.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:26.080
 So let me just get this other caller on the air and then we'll carry on.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.080
 Actually, two simple questions coming through me.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080
 Okay.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:34.080
 First one is MSM and does it have an influence on male or female libido?

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.080
 Okay, dogspeed, methylene sulfmethane is it?

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.080
 I believe.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:44.080
 I'm very cautious about it.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:58.080
 The dimethyl sulfide I think has its uses but I'm not sure that there's anything really fully safe with MSM.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:04.080
 And what about DCA or dichloroacetate for cancers?

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:15.080
 That happens to be very similar to methylene blue in the way it is essentially non-toxic in moderate amounts.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:23.080
 People are now getting as much as 10 or 12 grams of it per day intravenously and feeling great.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:31.080
 But what it does is restore the productive oxidation of glucose,

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:38.080
 getting the electrons to go all the way from glucose to form carbon dioxide,

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:43.080
 pretty much what methylene blue is doing in different situations.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:57.080
 But the DCA is reversing the cancer metabolism or the so-called Farberg metabolism the same way that methylene blue does.

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:14.080
 So I see it as a very important way of making up for the toxic effects of nitric oxide, endotoxin, free radical, fat oxidation and so on.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:17.080
 And you've spoken of antioxidants that are too strong.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.080
 Could you maybe give a spectrum of antioxidants and say is ALA too strong

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:28.080
 or what is the strongest antioxidant you would recommend and THC in that spectrum as well?

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:40.080
 Vitamin E and ascorbic acid in the right proportion and the right situation are very safe and constructive.

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:57.080
 Alpha-oleic acid is pretty safe, but I would be very cautious with the acetylcysteine.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:03.080
 I think large amounts of it can push the balance in the wrong direction.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:16.080
 Okay. All right. Dr. Peat, I had a question actually from a person who wrote to me who said that they were unable to call in because they were outside the country.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.080
 And I think by the time I responded to them to ask them what country they were in, it was probably already too late.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:26.080
 And I have come across this with other people anyway in our own practice and working with you,

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.080
 I think I understand the situation, but I'd like to hear it from you.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:40.080
 It was particularly a woman who said that she had hypothyroidism symptoms including depression, weight gain, cold hands and feet, dry hair and skin.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:48.080
 Her TSH, her thyroid stimulating hormone, was 1.6, which wasn't super high, but I know you like it to be as close to zero as possible.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:52.080
 And her T3 was 3.5. She said she used to take armothyroid.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:56.080
 She was prescribed this by a doctor and it helped with symptoms for a few months.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:05.080
 And she said that when she tried to supplement with T3 or a T3 and T4 combination, she developed anxiety and tachycardia.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:13.080
 She said she's experimented with doses as small even as 1 milligram of T3 and she said it would send her into a hyperthyroid type state.

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:20.080
 I think that's kind of anxiety and palpitations. It may be an adrenaline thing.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:24.080
 But she said is there anything that she could do to better tolerate thyroid supplementation?

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.080
 She is currently taking zinc gluconate, vitamin D, vitamin K.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.080
 She's using 4,000 IU of vitamin D.

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:38.080
 She's using Progestin, the second half of her menstrual cycle, aspirin, magnesium and calcium.

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.080
 She also eats liver weekly.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:45.080
 What do you think might cause that in a person who previously might have used thyroid

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:51.080
 and then suddenly becomes what they call sensitive to it and unable to use it?

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.080
 Sometimes I think it's that the product has changed.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:54:02.080
 European forms of thyroid supplement seem to be very unpredictable.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:13.080
 But if it's for sure the same product, then usually a magnesium deficiency can cause exactly those symptoms

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:20.080
 because the thyroid makes your cells able to use magnesium and so take it up.

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:31.080
 But a big organ like your skeletal muscles and bones can take up so much from your blood

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:39.080
 that your brain and heart and such have trouble getting the magnesium they need to respond to the thyroid.

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:45.080
 And then you get an exaggerated stress and adrenaline reaction.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:50.080
 And low cholesterol is another limiting factor.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:57.080
 If you have very low cholesterol, you can't respond to increasing your thyroid

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:07.080
 because one of the basic functions of thyroid is to turn cholesterol into progesterone, pregnenolone and DHEA.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:13.080
 Okay. So what kind of dose of magnesium would you think for that kind of person would be suitable?

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:28.080
 About 100 milligrams at a time as you take say one or two micrograms of cytomel or senomel.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:39.080
 100 micrograms will be plenty for the first two or three hours of responding to one or two micrograms.

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:46.080
 Okay. I looked earlier on as I was doing some searching around.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:52.080
 I saw that the main principle sources that seemed of magnesium were nuts, nuts and seeds.

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.080
 I think there were small amounts in soy.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:02.080
 But I think principally what would you recommend as a good magnesium source?

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:16.080
 Fruit juices and coffee I think are if you want a really intense source, you can boil leaves like kale or beet greens or something just for two or three minutes.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:23.080
 And the green water that comes out quickly is very concentrated in magnesium and calcium.

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.080
 Okay. Excellent.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:37.080
 That's a very pretty safe supplement. Coffee and fruit juices are practical and something you can do every day.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:45.080
 Okay. All right. But like I said, perhaps next month if you're available, I'd love to look into that new research.

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:50.080
 Well, actually I think it was brought out in mid-1960s by that Korean.

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:57.080
 It sounded very interesting about the third circulatory system in the body and actually that you are what you eat

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:06.080
 because there is a pretty intimate interaction between food products and our own DNA.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:10.080
 They can be switched on and off and regulated. That sounded pretty fascinating.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:22.080
 Yeah. There's a German group that has been doing this for about 15 years now looking at the DNA from our foods getting incorporated into our own DNA.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080
 Yeah.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:29.080
 And some biologists have been theorizing about this for the last hundred years.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:46.080
 Carl Lindgren was someone who reviewed the topic about 50 years ago showing good evidence that organisms all across the spectrum are sharing nucleic acid.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:58:01.080
 Pollen, for example, when you ingest pollen that's blowing in the air, some of the DNA is probably actually getting incorporated into our chromosomes.

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:06.080
 Yeah. Well, listen, I want to let people know how to find out more about you if they've not heard about you.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:10.080
 So thanks so much for giving your time for the show this evening, Dr. Peat.

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.080
 Okay. Thank you.

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:17.080
 Okay. So for people who've listened to the show or maybe haven't heard of Dr. Peat before, he's got a wealth of information on his website.

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.080
 It's freely accessible. It's fully referenced scientific material.

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:33.080
 It's not just made up. It's fully referenced and there's plenty of articles both on PubMed and other medical research sites to validate what Dr. Peat is saying.

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:44.080
 It's the science that provides the answers and it's not what we know in the mainstream media which is told to us by pharmaceutical companies and other vested interests.

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:52.080
 But the scientists that are interested in humanitarian causes are definitely finding lots of very novel ways of treating disease.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:59.080
 So don't just think that what you see on the television or read in the newspapers is the only way that you can get yourself healthy.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:04.080
 So Raymond Peat's website is www.rayPeat.com.

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:16.080
 It's got lots of articles and for those of you who'd like to get in contact with us during regular business hours, we can be reached on 1-888-WBM-ERB for further information.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:20.080
 So until December's show, thanks so much for joining.

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:31.080
