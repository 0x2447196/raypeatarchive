 And support for K-Med comes apart from Golden Dragon Medicinal Syrup,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 an anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, antioxidant medicine made from...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Sorry, made without heat or ice.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000

 Garberville, 91.1 FM, KMUE, Eureka Arcada, 88.3 FM,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 KLAI Laytonville, 90.3 FM, and FM Translator K258BQ, Shelter Cove, 99.5,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 And coming right up, we have Ask Your Herb Doctor,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 although their nice CD is not working.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It's funny because it doesn't work in my computer, and now it does not work in the most reliable of our lovely KMUD CD players.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 And I will try on the unreliable KMUD CD player, and if not, actually, I have a lovely song,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 and we're going to have a new theme song for right this second.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Here we go.

 [Music]

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 PM,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 We run a clinic in Garberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 As I mentioned a few months ago, it's become increasingly obvious over the last few years

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 that if you really want to get a point across, you cannot just mention it once or twice,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 but that varied topics encompassing a similar root subject

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 will allow the emergence of a coherent view of the matter in question.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Association is, after all, an excellent tool for improving the memory.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 We get such a lot of positive feedback concerning Dr. Ray Peat on our shows

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 that he's joining us again tonight and we want to explore misconceptions in medicine

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 and marketing related to serotonin and melatonin,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 but with wider implications for medical drugs in general,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 as well as carrying on last month's topic on the Fukushima incident,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 which is still ongoing, unfortunately.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Thank you once again for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Hello?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Okay, maybe he's not with us just yet.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 All right, well, until he comes on, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 to this month's topic of the continuing Fukushima incident

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 and the misconception in medicine surrounding serotonin and melatonin,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 with wider implications for medical drugs in general.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Okay, so I think we've got Dr. Peat on the line,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 so thank you once again for joining us, Dr. Peat.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Hello.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 I think, probably, if we start with finishing off last month's topic on...

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 First, I'd like you to introduce Dr. Peat to our listeners.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 Okay, well done.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 You've introduced us, and my name's Sarah, this is Andrew.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 We always do this, I'm so sorry.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 I got thrown a little bit there when he wasn't joining us,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 so I kind of skipped the intro, Dr. Peat.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 So if you would, please just describe your academic professional background

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 for those who, perhaps, have never listened to you.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Okay, after I had studied and taught literature and linguistics,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 I decided that to understand consciousness and language, I should study the brain.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 But when I started graduate school specializing in nerve biology,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I discovered that the brain scientists were just as dogmatic as the linguistic theorists,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 so I went into general physiology, specializing in reproductive endocrinology.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 And that was--one aspect of that got me interested in the biological effects of radiation,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 although I had been interested in the fallout from the nuclear tests for many years as a big problem.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 So when I saw that the biology of estrogen was very similar to the biology of radiation damage,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 I tried to understand just what was going on in a cell that caused identical biochemical events to occur,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 either from a dose of x-rays or a dose of estrogen.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Okay. All right.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Well, I guess to continue on and wrap up, last week--last month's presentation on the Fukushima dilemma,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 what was happening there, unfortunately the power plant is still smoldering,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 and it doesn't look like there's going to be any real hope of having it calm down sufficiently,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 at least until September, I heard, as a realistic date.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 The cores themselves are not either approachable or too hot to deal with at this point in time,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 and it looks like they're going to continue smoking away.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 And then the initial stages of the development of this catastrophe,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 several websites were revealing information.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 I think one of the first ones we came across was an Austrian website, and it was zamg.au.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 I think it was .au something. I can give that address out a little bit later on.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 There's also a website, RadNet, which is the EPA RadNet air concentration measurement data.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 They were giving out measurements right in the early days,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 and we could see, looking at the model of the plume fallout from Fukushima,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 that it was spreading across the Pacific and was eventually going to touch land on the West Coast

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 and/or affect northern and southern latitudes.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Sarah, do you want to go cover some of what's gone on with those results to date?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 And just cover some more of that?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 Well, I've only found one PDF file on the EPA's website that lists reported uranium

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 in Anaheim, Uranium 234 in Anaheim Riverside on March 15th,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 and then also in Seattle and San Francisco on March 18th.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 And I haven't seen an updated file of recent records of uranium.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 On that same PDF, it did list plutonium.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 It had a column for plutonium, but it didn't list that it had detected any.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Right. It seems to have shut down.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Well, I'm not sure if that's just because they haven't detected any

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 or they haven't reported what they have detected.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 It seems that there's iodine being detected in the rainwater and the air all over the country.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And I don't know if that's--we can presume that's from Japan

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 or whether that was being detected there before the accident

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 and we only see it after the accident.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Dr. Peat, I wonder, I had a look on--

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 there's an interesting website which is called the Modern Survival Blog

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 which covers many different topics relating to preparedness, etc.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 And when this incident happened, the person who runs Modern Survival Blog

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 got straight on it and was posting a day-by-day scenario of what was happening.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 There was a retired nuclear scientist--

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 I think that was his title, nuclear scientist--called Arne Gunderson

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 who I think he's been on several radio and television interviews with various people

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 detailing what's happening.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And from the very outset of the incident, he was saying that

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 rather than being a level 5 accident, it was already a 7 about a month ago.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 And in fact, they've raised it from a 5 to a 7 now.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 So in terms of what's potentially happening here,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 what do you think is some of the best advice people could take?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 I think the basic thing is to eat old food, canned or dried food,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 and avoid fresh vegetables as far as you can do that.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And for example, cheese, aged cheese is going to be completely safe for a long time.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 And avoiding the iodine damage to the thyroid gland,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 you can pretty well protect yourself by saturating yourself with iodine from kelp

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 and eating canned oysters and other shellfish.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 And maybe even taking--if you paint a tincture of iodine on your skin,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 you absorb quite a bit of it.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 So you can saturate yourself with iodine to protect the thyroid gland

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 during the time that iodine is still active,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 but it stays harmful for roughly six weeks after its creation.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 So if they're still making new radioactive iodine and emitting it,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 there's no telling how long that might continue to be a problem.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 What's your impression of potassium iodide as a supplement?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 Well, it has its own long-range potentially harmful effects.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Even one milligram a day in a chronic diet is known to be associated with thyroiditis,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 hypothyroidism, and probably increased rate of thyroid cancer.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 You don't want to take any thyroid supplement beyond a normal dietary sufficiency,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 except in the presence of serious radioactive iodine exposure.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 But considering the risk from the radioactive iodine,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 I think a few milligrams of potassium iodide per day is a reasonable balance.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Okay, but you would probably--I think in a lot of ways with most things,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 you would rather see these things come from nutrition.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Yeah, it's a safer balanced amount.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Even iodized salt is now seen to correlate with increased thyroiditis.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 So just what they're putting--they're putting iodine in our salt to try to protect us from thyroid problems,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 and in fact, it's now been associated with causing thyroid problems.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 So a half a teaspoon of kelp powder a couple times a week

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 or a couple milligrams of potassium iodide if you're in an area that has iodine coming,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 or even if you're not in an area with radioactive iodine,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 the fact that that low dose shouldn't be too harmful for several weeks.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 For most people, not.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 A few people have some strange hypersensitivity to iodine,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 so you want to test the first dose at a very small amount

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 because some people get an asthma attack

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 or other very violent symptoms from even a small dose of iodine.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 Okay.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 And then the other site I wanted to mention was the beta count on the RadNet data, the EPA's website.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 It's showing that there's been up to 50 counts per minute.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 Well, 50 per second is where I would be seriously concerned,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 but 50 per minute wouldn't be bad.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 So that was showing--like in Eureka, California, they have a beta count monitor,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 and it's showing it was up to 50 counts per minute before the Japanese catastrophe,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 and it continues sometimes reaching up to that level.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 So locally, if this information is correct,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 there's another website that's called Radiation Network,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 and it's a bunch of individuals with their Geiger counters,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 and they've hooked up to a database that's on real time.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 So every minute, this website updates with the counts, the beta counts per minute.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 And so that's another place people might want to go if they're interested to look at real time around the country,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 and it's called RadiationNetwork.com.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 The government website is the EPA.gov, and you click on Japanese nuclear emergency.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Okay, and then lastly, the other one I mentioned at the beginning was ModernSurvivalBlog.com,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 and the nuclear scientific engineer, Arne Gundersen, he's got a couple of posts on the site,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 and he's basically giving a day by day breakdown of what's been happening.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 Okay, I think as time goes on, these things will become more apparent.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 But unfortunately, I think what Arne Gundersen was bringing out was the striking similarities

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 in the cover-up of information between Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and this incident,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 and that it's unfortunate, but the pathways of which the information comes is restricted

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 in many ways at many times.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 The same thing holds true, and that'll be the focus of the rest of the show,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 of a lot of pharmaceutical drugs.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 Unfortunately, pharmaceutical drugs and drugs in general are manufactured for profit

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 with supposed pathologies to treat, and not always does the truth emerge,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 until much later perhaps when they're withdrawn.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Unfortunately, the motive behind their production is not always too white.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So, I just wanted to let people know that you're listening to Ask Europe Doctor on KMED Galbafield 91.1 FM,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 and from now really until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 either related to the nuclear incident and what can be done,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 or surrounding the rest of this month's show, which is going to be serotonin uptake inhibitors and melatonin.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 Both of these are, I think, widely known by people, and people have heard of the SSRIs,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 and they've heard of some of the controversies surrounding them,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 but it seems that people generally believe that serotonin is a good, happy drug.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 If you look for it, or you search for it on the web,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 everyone talking about it says it's a feel-good hormone.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you have to say about serotonin in terms of your knowledge and information on it?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 The body has many responses to injury,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 and serotonin and estrogen are two of the most basic primitive responses to any kind of generalized injury.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 And, for example, if you get sunburned, in the next few hours you can measure a large amount of serotonin in the urine,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 and the same thing happens for any kind of injury, including ionizing radiation.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 Dental x-rays are enough to activate the production of serotonin,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 and it's one of the basic defense mechanisms.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 What it does is activate simple things like shifting away from oxidative metabolism to glycolytic

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 or even a kind of hibernating shutdown of systems.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 At an extreme overproduction of serotonin, you tend to go into a hibernating state.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Animals, according to the diet and weather stress and so on,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 before they go into hibernation for the winter, will be producing more and more serotonin.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 And that's its basic purpose, is to keep the machinery running while shutting down the expensive biological processes.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 Actually, Dr. Peat, could I ask you to hold that thought for a second?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Okay.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 There's actually a caller on the line, so I just wanted to make sure the person gets on.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 You're on the air?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Hi.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Hi.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Yeah, I had a couple of questions.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 One, does anybody know how long it takes for the ocean currents from Japan to come over to the West Coast?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 I was looking at an old atlas, and the current goes north up Japan and south down the West Coast,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 and my fisherman friend says that it's actually seasonal.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 It does that in the summertime, and it's something different in the winter or something.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 And the other question I had is, is anybody monitoring the ocean contamination from the plan?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 And, of course, everything that's not coming over to us is ending up, you know,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 most of it's probably going into the ocean.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 So I was wondering if anybody would know, maybe some callers would know on that.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Anyway, thank you very much.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Okay.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Yeah, I think we'll leave that open to other callers,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 as I don't have that information in front of me, and it would only be a rough guess.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 I think some of it, so something like 80 to 100 miles a day, maybe.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Right.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Okay, there you go.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 And it's 4,000 miles, is it?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 Okay, all right.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 I think more than that.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 I think it's 6,000, isn't it?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Somewhere around there.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 Okay.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Maybe even 8.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 It takes 12 hours flying, or 11.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 Right, so that's--

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 Okay, well, let's carry on.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 We'll leave that thought open, then, for any other callers,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 perhaps, who've got that specific information to hand.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 And then, Dr. Peat, if you'd carry on, you were talking about hibernation

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 and a protective mechanism for expensive cellular machinery.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Yeah, in the 1950s and '60s, when the Soviets were worried about getting hydrogen bombed,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 they were doing a lot of research on ways to defend against very intense radiation doses,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 and serotonin was one of the things that they were studying and looking for safe analogs to use defensively,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 because a big dose of radiation puts the organism in a state where it can tolerate

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 maybe reducing mortality for a given dose by maybe 50%, in some cases, for a dose of maybe 1,000 rads.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 And unfortunately, for the kind of dose that we're more likely to be exposed to,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 serotonin is really what's causing the bulk of the damage.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 For example, if you give cells in a culture dish the amount of X-ray exposure that you get with a set of dental X-rays,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 these cells will-- if you put them in a photon detector,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 they'll be emitting photons, light produced by the cellular damage and excitation,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 for over an hour after the exposure.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 And if you put unexposed cells in the water that those cells are in,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 even without being exposed to radiation, just to the emissions such as serotonin into the water,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 the second batch of cells will begin mutating hours later,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 and people have cultured these unexposed cells,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 exposed only to the chemical products produced by the injured cells,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 and for 30 generations mutations keep occurring.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And to form a human being, you only need about 30 multiplications of the original fertilized ovum.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 So that one small exposure has tremendous repercussions.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 And, for example, a man with an X-ray treatment to a brain tumor, for example,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 is much more likely to have children with major malformations.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 The injury is circulated through the body, even affecting the health of the sperms,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 and probably animal studies suggest that these genetic instabilities can go on for many generations

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 of whole cycling organisms passing on their unstable genes.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 So do you think the amount of radiation we might be exposed to, however small it might be,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 right in this area in Humboldt County or even up to Oregon or along the West Coast,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 you're saying that's not a lot of radiation, but it could be causing our cells to express more serotonin

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 and be exposed to more serotonin that then could have long-term negative effects?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Yes, probably one single atom fissioning in your body, it will cause that cell or a few cells

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 to produce those toxic communicating substances.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 And the rest of the body, if the person is healthy, the rest of the body will shut down those excited signals.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 So it's a matter of balancing the vitality of the whole organism against the number of these injured cells.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Okay, good. Well, we're going to talk about how we can balance that serotonin,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 but we do have a couple callers on the line.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 Actually, first a caller just wanted to interject that they had heard that it's going to take three years

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 for the parts of houses that were washed out from the tsunami to start washing up on our beaches here.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Three years?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Three years, according to one source. And we have another caller coming right on now.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 You're on the air.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 Oh, sorry. That was me. I did say that. It was on the BBC.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 Thanks a million for the program. It's terrifyingly wonderful. Thanks.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 What was the name of that program? I didn't quite hear that.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Was that the name Terrifyingly Wonderful?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 I'm not sure. It was on the BBC, whatever it was.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 I didn't hear the name of the program.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Okay, so that was the caller who said it would take three years.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 She heard on the BBC it would take three years.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 Okay, well, let's get back to what we were doing here a minute ago.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, so if our cells are being exposed to a minute amount of radiation or more,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 if they're not telling us the whole picture, the full story,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 and our cells are starting to express more serotonin and the vitality of our organism is trying to quell that cascade of inflammation,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 what can we do to keep our cells in a vital state?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 If you think of the old studies of the radiation causing DNA breaks,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 they found about 40 years ago that high thyroid function and the magnesium taken up into the cells under the influence of thyroid

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 was the best way to accelerate the repair process so that you didn't have the lingering mutations from breaking the chromosomes in the DNA.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 But that was the repair activation for fairly high doses.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 But there are processes that apply to even the lowest exposure.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 For example, a study in Seattle two or three years ago found that a full set of dental X-rays to a woman who was pregnant

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:46.000
 but wearing a lead apron and so on, the exposure to her face would cause systemic influences

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 that would cause the babies to be underweight and underdeveloped,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 just as if she had taken an estrogenic substance that was stressing the system.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And animal studies found that those estrogenic effects coming from the exposure of any part of the body to ionizing radiation

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 could be antagonized just like normal estrogen is by a good dose of progesterone or even testosterone

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 and the usual nutritional things that help the body constantly control the estrogen that it's being exposed to.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 So just average everyday stress has a great overlap with radiation injury

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 and estrogen and serotonin happen to be the things that we have the best handle on

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 for protecting ourselves from the long-range effects.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Okay, well, how about the, gosh, all the serotonin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors that have come out,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 some of which have been discontinued, some of which have been modified.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 What's your opinion on this class of drugs in terms of their negative effects,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 knowing what they do energetically within the body?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Well, to the extent that they really are acting largely on the serotonin,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 I think it's good to look for alternatives, but much of that is just advertising invented things

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 for going with the TV commercials,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 the idea that they're a happy pill for raising your happy hormone and that sort of thing,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 but actually they're acting on many different processes, increasing adrenaline and dopamine

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 and activating enzymes and inactivating other enzymes all through the body,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 so no one really knows the full extent of what they're doing,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 and some of what they're doing is beneficial, some of it isn't, so it goes pill by pill.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 There are a few very effective antidepressants that are the opposite.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 They're the serotonin uptake promoters, just exactly the opposite, but they even work better,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 so what are the drug names for those serotonin reuptake promoters?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 The best studied is tianeptine.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 The brand name is Stabilone, and some people get it over the Internet, but it isn't legal in the U.S.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 But it's basically, it promotes, you're saying it--

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 It promotes the uptake of serotonin, so it's less active,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 and it turns out to have lots of beneficial effects on bodily health for arthritis and diabetes

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 and lots of inflammatory things that relate to overexposure to serotonin.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 So with people that have diabetes and arthritis,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 maybe for them to take something that would block their serotonin like Stabilone, is that how you say it?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Then that would help their symptoms in arthritis?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Yeah, I've talked to quite a few people who were taking it as an antidepressant

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 who had very dramatic physical improvements at the same time.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 And the physical conditions are all things that are known to be associated with high serotonin.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 And there's a whole class of antiserotonin drugs that are becoming popular for more uses.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 For example, some of their uses are to prevent nausea or diarrhea from radiation exposure.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 What they're doing is protecting you from the serotonin,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 which is a byproduct of the radiation exposure.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 And you can even prevent sunburn with an antiserotonin drug.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 So I wonder if the Japanese medical system is giving the people that have been exposed to high levels of radiation,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 I wonder if they're giving them these antiserotonin drugs.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 I suspect that they're just as hypnotized by the pharmaceutical industry as Americans are.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 So what are some of the names of these antiserotonin drugs that are used for nausea, diarrhea, and radiation exposure?

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Ondansetrin is the most popular antinausea, antiserotonin drug,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 but I think one of the best is called Blisuride, L-I-S-U-R-I-D-E.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 And all of these are based on the same indole molecular structure that serotonin is,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 but they are tuned in a different way by additives.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 For example, adding bromine, bromocriptine, is one that's used to treat pituitary tumors

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 because prolactin is promoted by stress or by serotonin or by radiation.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 And by modifying the indole molecule from the ergot fungus,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 that's the basic molecule that is used for these antiserotonin drugs.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 By modifying it slightly, it blocks the effect of serotonin

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 and shrinks the pituitary tumor by preventing the stimulating effects of the serotonin.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 Wow.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Own Doctor on KMED Galbraith 91.1 FM

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 and from 7.30, and it's gone, it's 7.35, until the end of the show here at 8 o'clock.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 You're invited to call in any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 serotonin, melatonin and misconceptions in medical drugs.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 And we have with us special guest speaker, Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 who's able to answer any questions that you may have about that subject

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 and/or the ongoing Fukushima accident and what can be done safely to help yourself avoid any unnecessary harm.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Okay, so serotonin, it's so strange, it's come full circle that serotonin is supposed to be the happy pill

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 and yet, slowly but surely, through one mistake or another, they're now bringing around antiserotonin drugs.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Well, our tax dollars are paying for research in medical universities.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Well, I think, I don't know exactly if it's tax dollars or not,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 but all these professors and people doing their PhDs are doing this research on these things

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 and yet, the general public, when they go to see their doctor and they ask for this drug or that drug,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 well, that's not what they get prescribed.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 It doesn't matter what the research shows, it has to go through how many...

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Oh, it's just very frustrating.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 Well, how about melatonin, Dr. Peat?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Oh, well, the body has enzymes that are activated by stress,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 for example, in the pineal gland, adrenaline is the signal.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 Adrenaline rises in the darkness because ordinary light is preventing some of the free radical activity

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 that rises in the darkness.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 That activates adrenaline and the adrenaline is the immediate activator of the enzyme

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 which converts serotonin into melatonin.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 But the same enzyme system can be found in an inflamed breast or a rheumatic knee joint, for example.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 And in these situations of inflammation, melatonin is...

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 Some people have believed that melatonin was at fault for causing rheumatoid arthritis,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 but actually, it seems to be performing the same function that it does in the brain,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 a way of eliminating serotonin which is the actual pro-inflammatory substance.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 And since serotonin stimulates cell division and inflammation,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 the presence of this enzyme in the breast is being considered one of the approaches

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 for preventing or treating breast cancer to accelerate the removal of serotonin.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 And into the breakdown of serotonin into melatonin.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Yeah.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 We have a caller on the line.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 Hey, Cooley, you're on the air?

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 Hi, yeah.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 A couple of questions and you've gotten actually to where my question was going to go,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 how serotonin relates to melatonin.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 I'm understanding that serotonin is converted by adrenaline into melatonin

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 and is that part of, as a body has maybe done a lot of work,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 that sort of downshifts them into a sleep mode, because I understand,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 and it's available as a supplement, melatonin is, to help people relax

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 and get to a sleep state sooner.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Yeah, probably melatonin has a fairly direct anti-serotonin effect.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 It hasn't been studied very much, but besides eliminating the serotonin

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 by combining it chemically, turning it into melatonin,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 I suspect that the melatonin is actually a defense as an antagonist to some extent

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 against the serotonin.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 And when you say antagonist, I want to make sure I understand the term.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 It means basically that it counters or converts whatever that material that it's an antagonist to

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 into something else or neutralizes its effect?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Neutralizes the effect, I think.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 The presence of the enzyme that changes serotonin to melatonin,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 it's present in inflamed situations,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 and I think that's a way of getting down the level of serotonin.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 But I think the presence of melatonin itself blocks some of the effects,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 such as free radical production activated by serotonin.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 So melatonin in and of itself would be an anti-serotonin in effect, I would understand.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 Yeah. I don't know how great that effect is,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 but I think there's evidence that it has some of that effect.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Now, you mentioned something a little bit ago that piqued my curiosity.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 We've got this huge problem with diabetes,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 and I think that a lot of it is related to high fructose corn syrup,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 if I can say that obscenity on the air.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 And the other thing is, since you brought this up,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 I'm curious as to whether the huge influx of SSRIs such as Prozac, et cetera,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 may also have contributed to the rise in diabetes and obesity amongst very young kids

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 that seem to be the lab rats for the pharmaceutical industry

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 when it comes to giving them these new, allegedly wonderful antidepressants.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 A study at UCLA that came out last summer

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 analyzed the corn syrup sweetener that's used in soft drinks,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 and they chemically tested it and found that it contained

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 just the amount of fructose and glucose that it was claimed to have,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 but then they hydrolyzed it and found that it contained polysaccharides,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 starch-like material containing four to five times the amount of calories

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 that the original sugar had.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 So it's basically a syrup or a starch-like material

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 with four or five times as many calories as you think you're getting from the sugars.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 And then if somebody were taking a lot of those types of foods

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 and was given an antidepressant that was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 that might even further compound the problem.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Well, these polysaccharides that aren't easily digested by our human enzymes

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 are likely to feed bacteria lower in the intestine

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 that produce fermentation products including lactic acid,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 which are responsible for causing the intestine to increase its already great production of serotonin

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 and to cause it to be absorbed into the circulation in quantities enough to affect behavior.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Anxiety, for example, is increased in animals in proportion to the fermentation of these starch-like molecules.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 So I suspect that the starchy materials in the corn sweetener

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 are pretty directly increasing exposure to serotonin.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 Well, I wonder if anyone has done a study on someone taking Prozac or a related SSRI

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 who's also obese, would expose the real cause of this whole thing spinning out of control

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 and causing all this obesity.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 It's really an interesting point that you brought up and it made me think along those lines.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 And before I go, I did want to mention to previous callers,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 there are some websites that should have the information as to how long those radionuclides

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
 and weather in general coming across the Pacific from Japan and the whole Asian continent

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 over here to the Pacific coast.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 And that would be the NOAA website, the USGS website, Helen Caldicott,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 and Physicians for Social Responsibility will have all kinds of information on radiation

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 and radionuclides and its after effects,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
 and probably will have some links to other websites that might have good information on that.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 And there should be a UC Berkeley site that has specific transmission across the Pacific.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 I saw on a newscast specifically what that caller was asking about,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 and it was just a few days because of the jet stream.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 So if it gets up into the jet stream, that's why we here in the Cape Mendocino area,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 both in Humboldt and Mendocino County,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 we were the first landfall that detected radionuclides a few days after that occurred.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Thank you very much for the program,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 and I always enjoy listening to the information that you bring to the air.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 Thank you for calling.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 We do have one or two more calls on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 Actually, your engineer has a question about inflammation.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 I keep honeybees and get stung a lot, and I've heard it's good to stop inflammation,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 yet I get inflamed when I get stung.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 So what's going on?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Probably developing some kind of hypersensitivity to it.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 Did you get the same inflammation?

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 Oh, no, no.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 I mean, at the site of the sting, it's inflamed,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 but I hear it's good for you and anti-inflammatory in the long run,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 so I was wondering if you knew anything about that.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 And it seems to be good.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 Okay, yeah.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 I heard a little bit about the treatment of arthritis with bee stings.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 I know that I've heard about the nettles,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 the Romans thrashing themselves with nettles to relieve joint pains,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 and that seems a little bit--I don't know.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 In terms of the histamine, Dr. Peat, what would you think about the histamine reaction from that?

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 I've heard that it's the high cortisol production from the pain

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 as well as the histamine and serotonin from the venom itself.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 Serotonin has some very direct actions on the cortisol-producing system,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 and I think it's maybe analogous to the way surgery can cure things.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 In animal research, they have to do a control, false surgery on one group of animals

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 because it's so common for the trauma of just being cut to cure whatever it was

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 that they were thinking a surgery was curing.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 And a very painful bee sting will activate your adrenals to the point that it can relieve a swollen knee, for example.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 Right, from the cortisol.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 Counter irritation that doctors used to practice.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Okay, we do actually have two more callers on the line, so let's take the next caller.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Hello.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 The pharmaceutical industry makes a claim that these SSRIs increase the receptors for serotonin,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 accounting for long-term effects even after the drugs are stopped.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 I wonder if you could comment about that.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 If you block a transmitter, the body adaptively increases the so-called receptors.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 So increasing the exposure to something usually decreases the receptors for that substance

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 in an adaptive process so everything ends up more or less the way it started.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 The whole idea of the receptor, I think, is just another ploy of the industry

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 to make things simple for television advertising and for medical school.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 When you look carefully at the long-range arguments behind the whole receptor idea,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 people for 60 years or more have been pointing out that the state of the organism and of the cell

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 absolutely determines how a given substance is going to affect the cell,

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 exciting it or inhibiting it, for example.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 It isn't necessarily that you make more of the so-called receptor protein,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 but that the whole state of the cell, the energy charge, for example, of the cell,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 governs what activation of that receptor protein is going to do to the whole cell.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 So I think the only way to think of a receptor is that the organism is the receptor

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 or the cell is the receptor because the state of the brain affects the way the gonad or the adrenal,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 for example, is going to respond to a given chemical

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 because everything is constantly being subjected to nervous chemical and energy inputs.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 Caller, is your phone on?

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 Oh, sorry about that.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Yeah, sorry, we're having a really hard time here.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
 Callers, always turn your phone off, please.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
 Okay, next question.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 No, I didn't mean you to hang up.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 Okay, well, we do have another caller.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 Let's take the next caller.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 Callers always turn their radios off before you talk on the phone, right?

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 Yeah.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
 I said phone off.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 Whoops, sorry.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
 That's okay.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 I think the next caller should be there.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 Are you there, caller?

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 Yeah, I'm here.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 I can't hear you too well, but let me get my question.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 This show is just fascinating, I must say,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 and the expertise is well appreciated that you're sharing it with us on the air.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:55.000
 I want to find out, because I'm currently taking Lexapro,

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 and also sometimes I get migraines and I take Imatrex,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 and I know that Imatrex sure works well on those migraines.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 And I've got a thyroid condition, so I'm hypothyroid, so I take Synthroid,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:31.000
 and I just kind of wondered if the serotonin uptake inhibitors are any kind of a problem for the thyroid situation.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 Yeah, they're very closely connected.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 For a long time it's been clear that hypothyroid people often have extremely high serotonin levels,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 and so the active part of the thyroid hormone, T3, Synthroid is just T4, which requires the liver to activate it.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 The active thyroid hormone increasing will decrease the production and retention of serotonin,

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 and serotonin being inflammation-promoting and affecting constriction and leakiness of blood vessels

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 is a major factor in migraines, which are mostly associated with hypothyroidism.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
 Well, you know, I also take Cytomel.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 Yeah, Cytomel is a good antiserotonin thing, and with the right amount of it,

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 it's pretty effective against migraines.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 That was one of my first interests in endocrinology was my own migraines.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 I found that it was largely an interaction between intestinal inflammation,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
 which 95% of our serotonin is made in the intestine,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.000
 and any kind of irritation in the intestine increases our exposure to serotonin,

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 but especially if your thyroid function is low, causing inefficient sugar metabolism,

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:37.000
 hypothyroidism plus a sensitive intestine will cause periodic flooding of the system with serotonin,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 which can be measured in migraine attacks during an attack or just before an attack.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 The serotonin rises tremendously.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 So I can't hear everything you're saying, but the upshot is,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 is there a problem to combine the Lexapro and the Imatrex and the Synthroid and the Cytomel

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 and all that crap they got me on?

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 There is a blood test for serotonin that I think more people should be checking on.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 It's much more meaningful than the urine test and so on.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 And the long-range effects of excess serotonin exposure are very similar to the long-range effects of chronic radiation

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 or chronic estrogen exposure.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 They acutely can produce inflammation, but if you keep up the exposure in the long run,

00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 you increase your tendency to have fibrosis of various tissues.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 Okay, one last question for the host there.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 Are you guys the ones that own the Western Botanical Medicine Company?

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Yeah.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 I've tried it.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 I initially had real good luck with your headache relief medicine or whatever you call it, the Tinkster.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 But I thought I bought it again recently and I hadn't bought it for a while.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 But did you change the dosage amount for migraine?

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 Because I thought I used to use more of it for migraine.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 And it seems now like the migraine and the other kind of headaches have the same kind of dosage.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 Was there some change?

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
 Yes, there was a label change.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
 Okay.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 And it was also a dosage recommendation change on that.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 Right.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.000
 I just recommended the same type of dose whether you were -- you can still take up to the 20 milliliters per day,

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 but I changed the dosage because if you were having a stress or tension headache,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 I'm not allowed to put that on the label, and I can't put migraine on the label either.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000
 So I have to just put for occasional headaches.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 I see.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 Yeah, because that helps explain it because when I took the lower dosage that you talk about now,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 it didn't seem to have the same effect as the dose that I had previously been recommended to.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
 So I guess I'll just try to go back to that.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
 Okay.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 Thanks.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 That's a good product.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 Appreciate it.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 Thank you.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 Bye-bye.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
 Well, there's one more call on the line.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 We better not take it because --

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 Because I still have to give some recommendations for nutritional advice before we get off the air tonight.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 So, hello?

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 We've only got three and a half minutes.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 Hello, you're on the air.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 Are they all taking me?

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 Okay, yeah, hello?

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 Yes, my name is Louise, and I live on Spirox Mountain, and I have a thyroid condition,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 and I take levothroxine prescribed by my doctor every month, but I also -- I'm 60 years old,

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 and I also take a Tyrenol for high blood pressure.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 And I've recently been having some migraine headaches, and I was wondering,

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 does my thyroid have something to do with that?

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 Well, there's lots of different things that could cause migraine headaches,

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 but it would be good if you came for a consultation and we could look at your nutritional status.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 That's always a good place to start.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
 And if you --

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 Okay.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Are you going to be in at Cave Mud or Midway or --

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 I'll give you my number at the end of the show.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 If you'll just listen, in a couple more minutes,

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000
 I'm going to give our phone number and Dr. Peat's website, and you can contact him,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 and you can also contact us, and we'd be more than happy to discuss nutritional advice with you.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 Okay, because I am overweight, and I'm very, very saddened and concerned about this.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 I've never been overweight before in my whole life, and I've never --

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 and my thyroid condition, I have real bad migraines also.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 I mean, the cough will weigh both of those things.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
 Well, we'd be happy to talk with you, and we'll give you that information in a little bit.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 I'm sorry, we have to end the callers,

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 and I wanted to briefly mention before the end of the show that Dr. Peat's talked about starches,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
 as in the form of the corn syrup, irritating the intestine and increasing serotonin.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
 So one way we can protect ourselves from this radiation

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 and the increased serotonin effects of inflammation is to replace our starches,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:34.000
 which are grains and beans and starchy vegetables like cooked potatoes and carrots and beets,

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 replace those with soft, ripe, juicy fruits,

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:45.000
 and also by keeping our thyroid function high with lots of coconut oil, up to three tablespoons a day,

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
 plenty of foods with calcium, local dairy, if it's still okay around here.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 It seems to be that Eureka's level hasn't changed, and also plenty of good fruit sugars.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
 And Dr. Peat, did you have any final comments?

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
 No, I think that covers it.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 Okay, well, for those that are listening, Dr. Raymond Peat, endocrinologist and research biochemist.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:17.000
