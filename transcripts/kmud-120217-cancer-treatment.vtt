 Well, thank you, Michael. Welcome to this month's "Ask Your Herb Doctor." My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every Thu, Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 So you're listening to "Ask Your Herb Doctor" on KMUD Garboville, 91.1 FM, and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated to this month's topic,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 very pertinent topic here, the misunderstandings in the approach to cancer treatment.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Once again, we're very fortunate to introduce Dr. Raymond Peat onto the show,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 who has just done some recent work on a newsletter, amongst other things, following his interests, anyway,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 in the approach to health in general and specifically the misunderstandings in cancer treatment.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 So hopefully Dr. Ray Peat will be going over some of those mistakes and helping us to understand some of the misunderstandings

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 that we've been led to believe are the way to go ahead.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 In the light of President Nixon's 1971 address to fight the war on cancer,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 we've probably made no real advances in cancer therapy, unlike other diseases,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 and cancer is almost the number one killer now, very close to cardiovascular diseases.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So Dr. Raymond Peat, thank you for joining us.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 Once again, for those people who perhaps have never heard your name and what it is you've done and what you still do,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 would you just give people an outline of your academic background?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Oh, I studied biology about 40 years ago at the University of Oregon,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 and since then I've been doing my newsletter and writing books and occasionally doing seminars for medical people, mainly.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 And over the years I've been thinking about the medical culture and what makes it so wrong.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 When I was in graduate school in, I think it was 1968 or '69, we had a seminar on cancer biology,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 and my part of it was the nature of carcinogenesis.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 Each person had a segment of a cancer issue, and my part was to explain what things are carcinogenic and how they work.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 I listed 50 different types of things that are carcinogenic, including inert objects embedded in the tissues,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 distilled water, and psychological stress. The professors were a little annoyed, well, greatly annoyed,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 because their whole point in doing the seminar was to work out the ways that mutations are carcinogenic.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 They wanted me to talk about the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and causing mutations.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 That was just one very small section of what I covered in the carcinogen section.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Since then, those biologists were still fairly in harmony with the medical view of cancer,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 but since then, with the cloning and stem cell research of the last 10 years,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 biology has strongly turned away from that understanding of cancer.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Those professors have retired, and I don't know what they're teaching now,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 but the active research in cancer is more in tune with the biology of stem cells rather than mutations.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 Do you think that's a more accurate approach to understanding cancer?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Oh, yeah. It was when I did that seminar, but I was just gathering up stuff that was 30, 40 years old at that time,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 but it was still outside the academic preferences.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 But since then, because of the big changes in the gene industry, they've looked for natural events to parallel their genetic engineering.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 They've had to be open to people like Barbara McClintock, who showed that stress mutates corn plants and so on.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 So that opened up the whole issue of psychological factors in the development of cancer

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 and how stress affects immunity as well as cancer.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Given that the current or the background of the 40 years up to the current point in time

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 have yielded very little in the way of promising approaches to cancer treatment

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 and/or survival rates post-surgery or treatment,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 and given that there's a fairly large opinion that there is a conspiracy theory against people actually recovering and getting better

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 and that actually it's a huge multi-billion dollar industry that really wants to not actually find a cure so much

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 as just come up with new treatments that can be patented and money can be made,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 would you explain perhaps what it is about the current or the approaches up until now that have yielded such poor results

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 and why that direction was chosen as a, you know, like excise the tumor and radiate the tissue when I know that you put such a lot of emphasis

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 on the damage that radiation can cause and how negative that can be also to lowering a patient's energy,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 which is very important in their long-term survival?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Yeah, for decades people in the alternative health business have been asking that question,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 how is it that doctors can forbid these experimental treatments to themselves or their family members?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 If something really exists as an alternative, they would not let their relatives die or themselves,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 but it's such a deep cultural thing that they really believe it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 They're trained in medical school in sort of a boot camp atmosphere

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 where they don't have time to get philosophical about what they're learning,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 but they're drilled with these ideas of genetic determinism.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 And it was only less than 200 years ago that it was discovered that people are made out of cells.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 And a few years after someone discovered that people and animals are made of cells,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 they discovered that cancer is made of cells.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 And then with Pasteur and so on, the germ theory of disease came up

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 and the atomic theory of chemistry and physics and so on.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 And everything fit into this being explained by the subunits that things are made of.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Right, it's kind of a reductionist approach.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 And that happened to fit the idea that a cancer is made of bad cells,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 some kind of difference in the cell.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 When genetics came up just 100 years ago,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 genetics was used to explain what's different about the cancer cells.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 They're a special kind of cell explained by a mutated gene which makes them completely alien to ourselves

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 because they're genetically different right from the start.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 They're different.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 So it's like a new being has come into existence with cancer.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 And the old tradition all the way back to the Greeks was to cut a tumor off

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 or burn it off with a corrosive or with hot sticks or whatever.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 And so that line of medicine was being taught to people

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 and then they fit the idea of the alien cell into that tradition of cutting something out.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 And it was perfectly reinforcing.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 It was something that is not part of us that has to be eliminated, otherwise it will kill us.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 And at the same time, other people were studying metabolism and physiology

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 and trying to understand how an embryo turns into an adult

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 and seeing that there are fields governing the relationship of one cell to another in the developing embryo.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 Like electromagnetic fields?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Well, including electrical gradients, but chemical fields, they didn't define the field.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 They just saw that a thing had an influence on its environment.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And you would cut a piece of an embryo or even an adult animal

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 and then you could see a wave of cell division spread out over the next hours

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 and a ring around the entry.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 As a kind of messenger system or just a reaction?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Well, some kind of a communication that the injured cells would send out something

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 that would cause the first one row of cells and then the next one to divide to replace the injured cell.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 And this idea of embryological developing fields and injury fields, it was partly electrical.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 The injured cells were found to produce a negative electrical charge

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 and that helps to organize molecules and it probably involves even light emission from cell to cell

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 as part of the field process.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And the idea of a cancer field was being demonstrated in the 1930s and '40s

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 along with this field idea of developmental biology.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 And they would show that if you found, say, a definite cancer in a piece of the intestine,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 if you examined circumference rings around the cancer itself,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 you would find progressing away from that degrees of abnormality,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 grading off to normal through inflammation and different degrees of deterioration

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 until finally it would be outright cancer at the center.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 So the idea of a field and gradients of trouble were all the way through biology.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 But as soon as the molecular revolution came about with a great push from the government

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 and the DNA doctrine started being used to explain everything,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 they said that information comes only from the gene to the expressed individual cell.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 The body is only a mortal product of the immortal reproducing genetic material.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 So that when virologists demonstrated that there were reverse transcriptases

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 that made it possible to have an RNA virus, my professors wouldn't believe it

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 because they said information only comes from the gene and the organism is a passive product.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 They would say you're going to be a Lamarckian if you say that we can have RNA viruses.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 But since then this whole change in biology has happened,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 and medicine is still stuck on the idea of the alien mutated clone of different cells.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 So it's like the argument between Louis Pasteur and Antoine Bechamp.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Louis Pasteur was saying that it's the bug that is the problem,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 and Antoine was saying no, it's the toire of the system,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 the environment of the cell or the body that determines whether or not an animal or a human gets an infection with a bad bug.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Didn't they have that rival their entire life?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And then finally on Louis Pasteur's deathbed he admitted to Antoine that really he was right,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 it was the toire of the body.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Yeah, but medicine didn't --

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Agree.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 -- acknowledge it.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Louis Pasteur had already done the damage.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Yeah, and by the time the DNA molecule became stylish,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 medicine had just totally locked itself into that way of seeing things.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 And at that same time, interestingly, 1950,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 I think it was Reader's Digest where I saw the article about a man who was injecting cancer

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 into hundreds of prisoners in Ohio and hundreds of his patients at the cancer clinic in New York.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 And he found that if he injected the cancer into a sick person,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 it wouldn't be thrown off immediately the way it was in a healthy person.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 And if he injected it into a person who already had cancer, it would sometimes persist as long as they lived.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 And so he said there's something in the body that either favors cancer or resists it and destroys it.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Right.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 But --

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 The healthy subjects would basically get on top of it straight away pretty much.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Yeah, that happened to basically be suppressed by the molecular biology that at that time didn't want to accept

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 that the body made the decision whether to let cancer grow or not.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Well, were they wanting just cancer to just be something that we have -- that our bodies had no control over?

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 It was just because of our defective genes.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Yeah, once one cell becomes mutated, the doctrine says that it produces a clone.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 All of the offspring are going to be essentially that cell, which is no longer you.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 And you have to destroy it or it will destroy you.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 And when you actually look at cancers, they're very often polyclonal and full of even different numbers of chromosomes.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 The inflammation field at its worst is cancerous.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Within the cancer, there are zones of bad and worse.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And as the cancer progresses, it gets more genetic deviations and chromosomes are falling apart and so on because it's under such stress.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 But several people have analyzed the cancer more closely and have found that tissue can be perfectly normal and still functioning

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 and contain more than a thousand mutated genes.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And a typical cancer has hundreds, if not thousands, of mutated genes before it starts going bad.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 And 40 years ago, people were demonstrating they had been storing bits of cancer tissue in deep freeze.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 And when they would bring them out and thaw them to grow in culture, sometimes they would use a solvent like the MSO or dimethylformamide

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 or even some more biological things, butyrates and so on.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 And they found that what had been cancer when they put it in the deep freeze,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 if they brought it out and thawed it in the presence of one of these somewhat structuring solvents,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 it would revert to a normal tissue and not be cancer anymore.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 And around that time, someone took parts of tumors from two different colors of hamsters,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 I think black and white or orange and black, so they could be distinguished.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 But they were just tumors, and they isolated cells from each of the tumors and mixed them with cells from a normal embryo.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 And the developing embryo would normalize what had been tumor cells,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 and you would produce a perfectly normal hamster, black or red or whatever,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 showing that it had some of its inheritance from a tumor,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 which, given the right environment, was able to produce a perfectly normal hamster.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 So that's disproving the genetic abnormality theory that cancers are a defective gene,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 because if you can inject a cancer cell into a growing embryo --

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Yeah.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 You'd think it would be cancerous.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Yeah.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 And Harry Rubin and Anna Soto and Carlos Sonenshine, I think his name is,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 have been making that point that the organism really is, for most of the life of the cancer,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 the organism is in control, and at some point, the organism loses control,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 and that's when it becomes a functioning cancer.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 Okay.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 Before we carry on, let's just let people know what's happening.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Galbraith 91.1 FM.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 We've got Dr. Raymond Peat on the show with us,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 and he's talking about the empirical approach to cancer

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 and how things are changing in the field of biology, thank goodness.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 And my name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 Okay, so if you live in this area, the number to call in from 7.30 to 8 p.m. for phone-ins is 923-3911,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 So, Dr. Peat, carry on with what you were saying about the environment

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 and how this is changing the way that modern biologists are looking at cancers.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 And also, sorry, Dr. Peat, before you get started there, I don't want to interrupt you later,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 but also what can we do to help create an environment in our body that will be preventing cancers

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 so that if they aren't just defective genes and there's nothing, it's completely outside of our control,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 that's a bogus theory, then what can we do to help prevent cancers from thriving in our bodies?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 Well, getting away from that idea that it's a random mutation,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 the alternative is to realize that everything you're doing is either anti-carcinogenic or carcinogenic.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 For example, if you avoid sunlight or put on sunscreens because you are afraid of getting skin cancer,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 the avoidance of sun is very carcinogenic.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 They just said in England, a report came out just the other month, I think January,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 that the appearance of rickets is becoming more and more prevalent

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 because people are using sun factor 50 on their children in an attempt to protect them from skin cancers

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 and actually they're getting rickets again now.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So that was quite shocking news.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 I know in England now the wave takes a little time to travel from the West Coast here in America over to England,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 but they're all making sure that vitamin D and calcium are being consumed

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 and that people are encouraged to get healthy doses of sun.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 Anyway, I didn't want to put that in too much.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Just for our listeners to understand that, rickets is a disease where your kid becomes knock-kneed.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 A vitamin D deficiency.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 Yes, sorry, a vitamin D deficiency where your knees are--basically it's a bone deformation

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 and your bones don't form properly and knock-kneed is kind of a common symptom of it.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Am I right in saying that?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 It's a knock-kneed deformity?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 It can go bow-legged too.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Right, both ways.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Anyway, I thought that was quite interesting, so I'm sorry to interrupt you.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Boys are more likely to be bow-legged and girls knock-kneed because of the thyroid influence causing the joint to deform in different directions.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 That's interesting.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 It isn't just the vitamin D. The penetrating light--for about 50 years now, people have been studying the effects of red light.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 One of the--probably the basic effect of penetrating red light is to activate the respiratory enzyme.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 The mitochondrial oxidase enzyme is restored by red light and it's pretty well destroyed just by 12 to 15 hours of darkness in rabbit experiments.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 So the reason mortality goes up at the end of winter is because nights are longer in the winter.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 With using lasers or incandescent lights or sunlight, it doesn't matter what kind of light you get that penetrates you,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 red light will go all the way through your body without a terribly great intensity, but sunlight is very good.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 Even intermittent exposure over a period of 12 to 15 hours of good bright light will pretty well restore the energy-producing enzymes in the mitochondrion.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And this enzyme is the crucial thing that makes a difference in cancer.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 Harburg, 1929, demonstrated that cancer differs metabolically from healthy cells in being able to turn glucose into lactic acid,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 even in the presence of oxygen, because something has gone wrong with the mitochondrion in its use of oxygen.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 All that you have to do to create the metabolism is to knock out the cytochrome oxidase enzyme.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 And that happens to be a very fragile enzyme that Harburg was studying.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 He didn't finish the explanation of how it works, but he was the one that showed that cancer is a metabolic disease, not a genetic disease.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Everything that is carcinogenic happens to weaken the function of that crucial enzyme, so that the wrong kind of fat in the diet,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 the wrong balance of estrogen to progesterone, a deficiency of thyroid hormone, or the wrong kind of radiation, ultraviolet or x-rays,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 will destroy that as far as they can reach it.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Ultraviolet only affects the skin, so the sunlight is still unbalanced because the red light restores the enzyme that ultraviolet is destroying.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 If you avoid sunburn, the sun is going to be a pure benefit.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 So, especially this time of year when it's much easier to get more sun without burning,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 are you talking about intermittent exposure, like you said, over a 12-hour period in a day?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Yeah, ideally, from animal experiments, this enzyme tends to get damaged just by eight hours of darkness.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 So, we shouldn't be in total darkness for longer than it takes to sleep.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Another question is these low-energy light bulbs, those vary from incandescent bulbs?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Those little fluorescent things are going to cause an epidemic of cancer.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Right, so basically the red light is coming from incandescent bulbs only and sunlight.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 Yeah, and the incandescent bulbs have to be several hundred watts to really be protective.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 So, I know you've recommended for people that have office jobs to have 250 to 300 watts of light from an incandescent bulb shining over their workstation,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 but how much of their skin would you recommend that they have exposed to that 300 watts?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 As much as possible, but for people with brain disease and motor neuron disease and such,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 just shining it on their neck and head and back if possible, that's the crucial thing.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 But getting the whole body exposed is really the best thing,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 because even though your feet, parts covered up with clothes, aren't going to be exposed,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 you're sending remedial signals through your nervous system that help to stabilize those enzymes and cells that aren't getting the direct light exposure.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 But ideally, we should have light exposure all over.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Right, so bald men with short hair are going to get more if they work in an office than a woman with long hair covering her neck, basically.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 So, the more skin exposure, the better.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Okay, so in terms of inflammation, we all hear and I think we all pretty much understand that inflammation is not a good thing.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 The body does everything it can to keep inflammation down.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Given that inflammation, not necessarily be understood in terms of heat inflammation, but irritation that just causes an inflammation,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 that inflammation is a very important part of cancer progression, isn't it?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Yeah, everything that is stressful promotes inflammation.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Right.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Even things like hives.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Okay.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 Some people get hives just from getting cold or from exercising or from not eating soon enough.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Just dropping your blood sugar works the same as cutting off the oxygen supply.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 It keeps that crucial oxidative enzyme from getting the energy from the glucose and the carbon dioxide which should be produced from burning the carbohydrate.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 And in the absence of sugar, oxygen, or carbon dioxide, that enzyme is going to fail and that causes the cell to produce lactic acid defensively.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 The lactic acid then triggers chain reactions, causes fat to break down, and if you have eaten unsaturated fats, that's going to produce the prostaglandins

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 which cause chain reactions of more inflammation, more lactic acid production.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 One thing leads to another, but basically it's keeping your energy up so that you can oxidize, respire to produce energy efficiently.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 So frequent meals, small frequent meals will help to prevent that chain reaction of inflammation.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 We do have a caller on the line, so let's take this first caller.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 Actually, I'm asking the question for them because it was simple and combined with another one, which is,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 what about red LEDs, tanning beds, and far infrared saunas?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 Red LEDs are demonstrated to reverse many of the changes of cancer.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 They're being used to treat cancer experimentally, but lasers, incandescent light, and sunlight, as well as LEDs, activate that enzyme very efficiently.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 Most of the work has been done with the 630, I think it is, helium neon laser frequency or the LEDs in that range, but between 600 and 700 nanometers wavelength,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 the light is restorative to that.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 So how about a far infrared sauna?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 There is some benefit from some of the, mostly around 700 to 800 nanometer wavelength, but just the heat is beneficial,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 but the really specific restoration of that crucial enzyme happens in the far red or from orange to red spectrum.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 So the far infrared is too far.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 And then a tanning bed would be just pure ultraviolet with no beneficial and therefore harmful, correctly?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 Well, yeah, basically you're getting your vitamin D, but without the protective red and orange light,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 they're going to have a slight immune suppressive effect.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 Because your white blood cells run through your skin, they're subject to a slight sunburn themselves.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 So until you get so tanned that your white blood cells aren't exposed to ultraviolet, it's better to get your suntan in the real sunlight.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Hub Doctor, KMED Galbraithville, 91.1 FM.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 And from now until 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated to this month's topic of the approach

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 and the misunderstandings in the approach to cancer.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 So Dr. Raymond Peat's joining us and we're live.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 So Dr. Peat, getting back to excitation, cell excitation and cancer.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 We normally look at an excited state of a cell to be a beneficial state, correct?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 Well, I mean energetically, sorry.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 The energized cell is really relaxed.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 If you imagine your muscles that are ready to work, they're soft and flexible and have energy reserves so that you can do a lot of work with them.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 But if you work to fatigue, they swell up and start tending to cramp.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 That's because the presence of adequate energy relaxes nerves and muscles and other cells.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 And if you are deficient in the production of energy because your mitochondrial enzyme is impaired

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 or because your thyroid is low and not activating that enzyme system,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 it doesn't take much stress to de-energize the cell.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 And just like your muscle that you overwork, the cell that has had more stimulation than it can meet with its energy production,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 that cell is going to swell up just like a tired muscle.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 And in that state, it's releasing lactic acid and histamine and prostaglandins.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 And in the case of an overworked muscle, it's usually just that your muscle is sore for a couple of days.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 But if you're chronically low energy, not getting enough light, exposed to things that are impairing the respiratory enzymes,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 then you're going to be susceptible to, in various tissues, a breast or uterus or liver or kidney or brain that is experiencing hormonal or nervous or other stimulus.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 Mild chemical toxins, for example, will stimulate and excite cells.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 And if you're near that threshold where your cell is barely producing enough energy to return to its relaxed state,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 it's going to shift over to glycolysis and produce lactic acid.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 And the lactic acid then sets off chain reactions that make the swelling worse.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 So is that basically how you would describe a seizure and someone having a seizure as well?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 Yeah.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 The cell's over excited, it's too excited?

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 Yeah, and it can't relax. A cramp is the same thing.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 Right. So a truly energetic cell is a perfectly relaxed cell.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Yeah. And a lot of people, if they tend to have seizures, they're more likely to have seizures at night

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 and more likely to get cramps at night because in the darkness, our respiratory enzymes are gradually being impaired.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 And so we're closer to the threshold where excitation can't be turned off by producing energy.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 Okay. Moving on to perhaps a controversial point, I think that most people don't understand correctly,

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 but looking at a cancer directly, if somebody gets a diagnosis of cancer

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 and they haven't actually had any surgical intervention, but they've been visualized as having a tumor somewhere,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 what's your understanding of the rationale that cutting into or around that area or biopsying is actually pretty dangerous?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 Well, just the evidence.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 Yeah.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 It's very seldom been looked at, but a professor at the University of California about 60 years ago

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:21.000
 compared people who declined medical treatment and those who got the best available

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 and they lived longer if they declined the treatment.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 And there have been a few other little studies like that.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 There's a website, a man named Gershom Zajacek, Z-A-J-I-C-E-K,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 who gives some of the evidence for how cutting out a tumor activates metastases that had been sitting harmlessly.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 And there's quite a lot of evidence for that.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 Even some doctors, you can find people on the Internet, professors who are acknowledging that cutting out a tumor

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 very often causes metastatic growths to spring up.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:28.000
 And there have been published studies on that showing that people get recurrences much sooner if they have surgery than if they don't.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 Okay. We do have another caller on the line, so let's take this next caller. You're on the air.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Hello.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 I'll follow up on that last. How about the cutting out of polyps during routine colonoscopies?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Do you have comments that you care to make about that? And I'll take my answer off the air.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Thank you so very much.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 I think that's pretty harmless.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 In fact, I think polyps, if you didn't look for them, I think they would fall off by themselves.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 And so I think cutting them off the body doesn't really notice that much has happened because they aren't deeply entrenched.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 They're ready to fall off all by themselves.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 And what about the cutting off of moles?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 That's one of the things that's well established to cause others to pop up.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 Zajacic talks about that on his website.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Would you just, I think most people that are listening now would probably want to be scribbling down this name again.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 So I know it's pretty ethnic European or whatever, but would you spell the name out again?

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000
 Yeah, the last name is Z-A-J-I-C-E-K.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 Okay.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 The initial is G.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 Okay, good.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 So people can go and check him out on the internet and Google search him.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Okay, so intervention in terms of what you're saying so far, that the body itself, when it is energy depleted,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 either from poor diet or radiation exposure or environmental damage, toxins in pesticides

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 or just poor air quality or living in buildings that don't have access to fresh air and sunlight.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 It's all a way of dragging the organism's energy down to a point where the body can lose the battle against things

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 that are slowly being incorrectly formed but normally get dealt with.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 And in the presence of enough metabolic energy, that kind of thing doesn't ever allow itself to become overwhelmed.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 Yeah, and I think the idea of the bystander effect that they've been seeing in vitro studies with cancer cells,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 for 50 years they believed that radiation caused cancer because it mutated the gene by radiation hitting DNA and breaking it.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 But in the last 10 or 12 years, they've noticed that if you irradiate cells in a dish and then take those cells out

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 and put new cells in the dish, the new cells mutate.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 Or if you mutate one cell with a beam of radiation, it sends out substances like serotonin and nitric oxide and carbon monoxide.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 Just the same way the fish did the same thing.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Yeah, that will mutate other cells.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 And in your body, that same thing happens.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 You don't have to mutate a cell by a gene by hitting it with radiation.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 You just have to stress it with these substances that are emitted so that your whole body is experiencing bystander effects

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 going in all directions.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 A study in Seattle found that a set of dental x-rays would cause a pregnant woman to have an underdeveloped baby,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 even if they shielded her abdomen with heavy lead aprons.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:36.000
 It was the bystander effect from what was happening to her face and brain from the dental x-rays poisoning everything else in her body.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 We do have another caller on the line, Dr. Peet.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 So let's see this. Let's hear this next caller.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 Actually, he was shy. So I'm asking, what about Taxol?

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
 I don't know what.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
 Talk about Taxol, please.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 I think it has some anti-inflammatory effects, which I think probably account for the good it does.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
 But there are some less toxic things that I think do more good.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 So Taxol is from the yew tree.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Yeah.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 It's a compound from the yew tree.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 I think there are probably about a thousand herbal compounds, anti-inflammatory things.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 Could you comment on the Essiac formula?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 I don't know it specifically, but I'm sure it has some of those same anti-inflammatory effects.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 Yeah. It also has a lot of liver herbs in it, so that helps your liver clear excess hormones,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
 like you mentioned, if you have an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 I'm imagining that due to the improved liver function, you'd be clearing more waste from the system and excess hormones.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Let's not ignore the estrogen, which you've also implicated as a big cause of inflammation.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 And just coming back to inflammation, and it always comes back to inflammation,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 that that is the major cause of any mutation arising.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:16.000
 Yeah. I mentioned that the crucial respiratory enzyme is protected by progesterone and inactivated by estrogen.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 But one of the oldest bystander effects known, at least 50 years ago,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 they discovered that if you irradiate any part of an animal, it'll go into heat as if it had been given a shot of estrogen.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 It can be its foot or its head or any part, but the bystander substances spread out,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 and any inflammation activates the aromatase enzyme, which makes estrogen.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 So in studies of monkeys trying to measure the output of estrogen from its ovaries,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 they found that its arms were producing at least as much estrogen as the ovaries.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 Wow. Amazing.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 So a person isn't protected against estrogen just because they have menopause or have had ovaries removed.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 Every part of your body that's irritated or stressed or depleted of energy is going to become an estrogen factory.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 And that's in men and women. But we do have another caller here.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 Actually, another shy person.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 So assuming you were going through chemo and radiation and you were excreting those from your body,

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 what danger is that to people around you?

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:54.000
 They're starting to recommend that people who are taking radioactive iodine as a thyroid treatment not fly or ride on buses

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 because they're irradiating people around them.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 Goodness. Wow.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 So what about like if someone's having radiation for lymphoma?

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 If you get it at the factory, it's not going to hurt anyone else. It's just going to hurt you.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 It would just have to be like the radioactive iodine that people might take.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 They actually have that in their system and they're radioactive.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 Yeah.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Okay.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:33.000
 Do you have any comments to make on metastases of cancer that haven't been surgically intervened with

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 and how that metastasis would occur?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 Oh, well, they're great for business because now they're saying that maybe breast cancer starts in utero.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 First they were saying if you cut off the breasts when a woman is 20, she can't get breast cancer.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 True. But now they're saying that maybe that's even too late for some cases that it might have really started in infancy or before.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 Wow.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 And so the idea of metastatic little aliens, it's a tremendous business because you can never prove they aren't there.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 And if you injure a person enough, you're going to find some even if they weren't there.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:40.000
 Wasn't there a study done that showed like over 90% of people that were over the age of 50, correct me if I'm wrong, Karen.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 100%.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:50.000
 100% of people over the age of 50 that died in accidents or had autopsies done, they all had some form of abdominal cancer?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:57.000
 Yeah, that was what Harry Rubin was told by a pathologist friend of his.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 But since then there have been a couple of similar studies that even looking at people over 35, they find a very high percentage of them.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 If you look at just two or three organs, breast, uterus, prostate, very likely to find cancer in a high percentage.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 But by the age of 50, everyone can have it diagnosed.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 So I think that means be careful about getting a diagnosis.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 Dentists a couple of times when I was about 30 or so told me with a very grave expression that I had a precancerous leukoplakia

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 and I should have it biopsied.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 But since I had already experienced that lumpy development inside my cheeks whenever I was deficient in vitamin A,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 instead of going to a cancer specialist and having a biopsy, I took vitamin A.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 Each time a dentist told me that, I cured it in a week.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 And then since I knew that leukoplakia of the cervix is biologically almost indistinguishable from leukoplakia inside the cheek,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
 I told women who had the --

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
 Abnormal pap snares.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 And biopsies showing so-called carcinoma in situ.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 I told them about that and they tried applying vitamin A topically and such.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 And I kept track of three dozen women who had that experience.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 All of them told their doctors when they went back two or three months later with no evidence of abnormality.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 Doctor lost out.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 Good hysterectomy.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000
 But the doctors in every case didn't want to know what they had done.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 Wow.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
 Okay, so you've mentioned vitamin A before, haven't you, for cervical --

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
 well, people when they get told they have cervical dysplasia.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 The sources of vitamin A are eggs and liver.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
 I mean, there is beta carotene, but that then relies on a conversion.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000
 And that conversion, Dr. Peet, you're saying is not very efficient between beta carotene and vitamin A?

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Yeah, if you're deficient in either thyroid hormone or vitamin B12, you don't convert it.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 From beta carotene into?

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
 Into vitamin A.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 Okay, well, I know we've got three minutes left, so we're getting close to the top of the hour.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 And we need to make sure that we're done by 8 o'clock.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 So let's spend the next couple of minutes just letting people know a little bit more about you, Dr. Peet,

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 and how you can be contacted.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 I know that you've in the past always been willing to let people know that your website exists and that they can visit that.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 There's lots of articles that are fully referenced,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 lots of kind of brain-stretching articles that help you think about things that we've been brainwashed into believing are happening one way,

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 and see them in a different way.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 It's always a very good exercise to see more than one side of any particular argument.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 So Dr. Peet's website is raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 And he's also just said that we can give out his e-mail address, folks.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 So people would like to contact Ray Peet.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 They have the option to the first time in, oh, two and a half or three years.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 Well, you could contact him through his contact page on his website.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 No, I took that off because I was getting too many book orders.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 Okay, good.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 Okay, well, listen, folks.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000
 It's supposed to be good.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:59.000
 Dr. Raymond Peet's e-mail address, if you want to shoot him any questions, it's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T@gmail.com.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 So raypeat@gmail.com.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 Good luck, Dr. Peet.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 Okay.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 You're probably going to get lots of people contacting you.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 If you live inside -- gosh, what are you pointing that for?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 Okay.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
 Anyway, so we've got two minutes to go before the end of the show.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
 We're very nearly there.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:25.000
 So we can be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-ERB for any other questions during normal business hours, Monday through Friday.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
 Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Peet, and sharing your wisdom.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 People can go visit his site, raypeat.com.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
 And his e-mail address is raypeat@gmail.com.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 So until next month.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
 Until March 16th.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
 Thank you for listening.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 Good night.
