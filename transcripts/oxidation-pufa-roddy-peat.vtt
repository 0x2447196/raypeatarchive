When PUFA is present and oxidation is going on, you're tending to be torn up with free radical lipid peroxidation and such.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.680
So the PUFA does feed oxidation and can help with weight loss, but that turns out to be almost purely destructive.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.680
You don't want to lose weight that way.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.340
The excess of thyroid, when you have a moderate excess of thyroid and DHEA, which increase the wasteful use of oxygen, that waste is protective.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.340
Animals which are uncoupled, and especially those which have a low PUFA in their tissues, are longer lives.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.120
The saturation index, if an animal's fats are highly saturated, it has a longer life.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.640
And that means that it can run its oxidative metabolism at a much higher rate being uncoupled and living longer because its fats aren't set to explode or catch fire with the free radical activity going on.
