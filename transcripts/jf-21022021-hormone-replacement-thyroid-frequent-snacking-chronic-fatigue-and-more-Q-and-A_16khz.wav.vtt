00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell podcast. I am as usual Jodell and as usual, or at least

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.560
 once every month or so, I like to have Dr. Ray Pete on and so he's joining me today here

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.720
 again to answer your questions. If you're not familiar with Dr. Pete, well, then you're

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 missing out. Why don't you check out raypeet.com. That's his website and you can, you can check

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.120
 out who this amazing person is and his wealth of expertise and his immense articles and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.860
 publications that have been put out. I highly recommend this individual. So without further

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.280
 ado, Dr. Pete, thank you so much for joining me. How are you?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.840
 Okay. Very good.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.920
 Awesome. Well, I've, I reached out to our listeners. I got a slew of questions here

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.400
 again today, so we're just going to jump right into those. Um, first things first, as far

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.720
 as like you feel about what's going on right now in the world, what are your thoughts on

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 like the, the new variants of the COVID strain that are coming out? Can I ask your just recent

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.280
 opinion on things?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 I haven't seen any evidence of the new properties that they are ascribing to the new variant.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.760
 There's one website I've been looking at occasionally that is posting the actual RNA code of all

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:42.880
 of the base pairs that make up the code. And the first time I looked, there were 3,400

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:53.600
 variants. A few days ago, someone reported that that website now lists 6,000 variants.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 But for some reason I've picked out one or two of those strains and claimed that they

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.760
 are highly infectious, but I haven't seen any, any information supporting that. And that

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 is nothing new. There are several lawyers showing state and national health information

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 for refusing to reveal the scientific evidence that would support their mandated lockdown

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:39.760
 and mask wearing and vaccination and all of that. The government is just acting while

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.960
 keeping secret anything they really know. And so everything they're saying could just

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:56.960
 be pure fantasy. And for people to respond to that and obey the instructions on the basis

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.960
 of secret evidence, it's an extension of something governments have been getting away with for

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:12.960
 decades. They say the information the government has is too sensitive for the people to know.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:27.360
 And so you have to trust the government. And a friend of mine in Germany said she afraid

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:37.560
 that the people in Germany are now reacting just as obediently and foolishly as they did

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:48.360
 during the 1930s, accepting his words without any criticism. She says she sees exactly that

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.360
 kind of blind obedience in the population of the present.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:01.960
 Yeah, it's such a weird world we live in for sure. And your thoughts on like the vaccine,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.360
 you know, I haven't seen a lot of research. And so what are your thoughts on this vaccine

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.160
 and how people are changing it?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:21.160
 The first thing is that an entirely new principle that doesn't meet any of the standard definitions

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.560
 of vaccination, the whole history to really understand that you have to go back at least

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.960
 120 years to get a picture of what was meant by vaccination and how the immune system was

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:50.960
 understood to react to disease. And the basic doctrine of the immune system as primarily

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:04.960
 an antibody response, this was produced in reaction to Paul Ehrlich's sales of an arsenic

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:17.760
 compound to treat syphilis. And his claims sort of hit a magic button in the consuming

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:27.560
 population. He called the substance a magic bullet. But there never was any magic bullet

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:37.560
 defect involved in Paul Ehrlich's treatments. But what caught on was the idea that our immune

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:48.360
 system works like a bunch of magic bullets, which are called antibodies. That's the extent

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.360
 of the investigation of what the immune system is. Sharing the Nobel Prize in 1908 with Paul

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:07.160
 Ehrlich was Elliot Metzenkopf, who had been the critic of Ehrlich's simplified reduced

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:19.160
 concept of immunity. Metzenkopf was an embryologist who saw multilayer defensive processes working

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:28.960
 in the organism starting with phagocytosis. And that actual scientific investigation of

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:38.960
 what's going on when an organism reacts to the environment, that has been horribly neglected

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:46.960
 in science. And what bounces along, Nobel Prize after Nobel Prize, is this silly doctrine

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.760
 that our immune system is primarily based on antibodies. And that just isn't a scientific

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:06.760
 idea. So, first of all, the metaphysics or philosophy behind the stuff that Fauci and

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:15.760
 others are talking about, it's all a metaphysical system that has built up in these 110 years.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:30.560
 So, the criticism has to start with looking at what immunity really is. And then the idea

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:41.560
 that came up just a few years ago was not to use a whole killed or weakened pathogen

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:51.360
 to arouse immunity, but to reduce it for some reason to the extremely simplified nucleic

00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:02.360
 acid, the messenger RNA. And it happens that they chose the messenger RNA that produces

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:12.160
 the pathogenic effect. You don't need the pathogenic effect to have specificity for

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:19.160
 a certain type of virus. But for some reason they've settled on that, probably because

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:28.160
 they got the code for the RNA and they can manufacture that synthetically just from the

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:38.560
 code number without ever having a natural virus to experiment with. So, it can go right

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:47.560
 from picking a number off the internet in the laboratory to manufacture a substance

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.560
 that will make the pathogenic component of the virus. It happens to be the component

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:06.560
 that inactivates our anti-inflammatory enzyme system because the virus sticks to that and

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:21.560
 inactivates it, kills our defensive anti-inflammatory process, leaving the remaining part the inflammatory

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:35.560
 system without control. So, if we produce this particular protein, the spike protein, and

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:43.560
 if that takes over and regularly comes out of our cells that have assimilated the so-called

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:57.560
 vaccine RNA, our bodies will then be producing a pro-inflammatory material. And labs in Boston,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:08.560
 White's Head lab and one of the Harvard labs, people there have tested in vitro and demonstrated

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:20.560
 that our natural enzymes are able to incorporate the RNA of the vaccine into our own genome,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:28.560
 into the human genome, which means that on the basis of this in vitro study, we have

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:38.560
 the capacity to pass on that genetic information to offspring forever.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:45.560
 Well, you mentioned the immune system and my concern is that we're going to see a

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:53.560
 repercussion across the globe of that broken immune system is based on all of the lack

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.560
 of bacteria. We're sterilizing everything. Everyone is using hand sanitizer everywhere.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.560
 No one touches anyone anymore. And we need bacteria like our entire body has different

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.560
 microbiomes in the eye, in the gut, in the breast tissue. And so, what are your thoughts

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.560
 on just this dampening of the immune system and the over-sterilization?

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:26.560
 I think the active promotion of inflammation is a great first danger. And I suspect that

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:38.560
 the drug companies are now worried about that because it's a lab-synthesized material that

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:45.560
 makes it easy to produce in vast amounts. So they promised that millions of doses would

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:53.560
 be available almost immediately. But December 22nd, in the county of New York that hadn't

00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:03.560
 had a pace in the whole county of COVID for that month, they vaccinated in one nursing

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:14.560
 home system. They vaccinated 198 people. And of those vaccinated within, I think it was

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:25.560
 about a week, 24 people had died, an astounding percentage of them vaccinated. And the explanation

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:33.560
 of the nursing home was that at the end of the vaccine people was that suddenly there

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:42.560
 had been a resurgence of the COVID virus and that by chance killed the people who had been

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:52.560
 vaccinated. And I think with an experience like that, a vast increase in mortality followed

00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:01.560
 by around the world, people collapsing with anaphylactic shock, I think the drug companies

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:10.560
 all suddenly realized that until the government gives them special immunity beyond even what

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:18.560
 they have been given for ordinary vaccine damage, until they get that new special immunity,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:27.560
 I think they are going to find it hard to deliver the promised number of vaccines. I think the

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:39.560
 awareness immediately was there in the industry making it because of the possibility of great

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.560
 liability killing tens of millions of people.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.560
 And what about mental health? I mean, are you concerned about the mental health of people

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:58.560
 having to deal with all of this lockdown and isolation and then not touching, not hugging?

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:15.560
 Yeah, that was projected years in advance that social dislocation, unemployment in particular,

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:26.560
 but any kind of interference with normal social interactions will increase drug addiction,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:38.560
 depression, suicide, violence, violent crimes. Everything goes wrong when you damage someone's

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:47.560
 likelihood and thousands and thousands of people are losing their businesses as well as their

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:56.560
 opportunity to work. And so it was absolutely foreseeable that you would have much greater

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:08.560
 damage from the lockdown and the stupid mandated behavior than any influenza season ever produced.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:17.560
 And in accepting the current numbers of deaths given out by the CDC, you have to take into

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:27.560
 account the fact that there is a most glaring history of misrepresentation of flu season

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:41.560
 mortality. Some years have declared that influenza was killing as high as 50, even 80,000 people

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:52.560
 during the flu season and in a good year it might be 30,000. Then on the basis of actual

00:15:52.560 --> 00:16:01.560
 testing for influenza virus, they found that the influenza virus was present maybe only

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:13.560
 in two or three thousand of those 50 or 60,000 deaths from pneumonia, something 95% or more

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:23.560
 of the deaths from pneumonia in the hospitals during the winter season or had an unknown

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:32.560
 cause, definitely not influenza. And it came out that they were knowingly calling those

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:41.560
 tens of thousands of winter deaths pneumonia influenza deaths just to scare people to get

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:51.560
 their influenza vaccine absolute lying to the public to manipulate them into getting

00:16:51.560 --> 00:17:00.560
 the influenza vaccine with its very ambiguous history. And so now when we look at their

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:09.560
 figures for total mortality, there have only been a few people starting last winter who

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:20.560
 were keeping track of the normal annual pneumonia mortality and of any changes that were occurring

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:30.560
 in 2019 or in 2020 over preceding years. And right from the start, anyone who was looking

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:42.560
 at their numbers could see that something very unbiological was happening. And one person

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:53.560
 later in 2020 summed up those observations and the numbers that were continuing to be

00:17:53.560 --> 00:18:06.560
 put out by the CDC. Genevieve Breond, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, has an article

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:17.560
 on the internet on the mortality from, based entirely on CDC's figures. And what she found

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:27.560
 was no real increase in mortality, despite that huge surge in April, supposedly from

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:40.560
 COVID, that followed the instructions to diagnose COVID whenever a positive test for the presence

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:49.560
 of the virus, which is not a good way to diagnose a disease. But anyway, they instructed people

00:18:49.560 --> 00:19:01.560
 to diagnose many things as COVID that previously wouldn't have been diagnosed, and the money

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:12.560
 distribution to compensate for the shutdown, that included $14,000 per patient diagnosed

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:26.560
 with COVID. And then if they were put on force oxygen inhalation, another $44,000, according

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:36.560
 to the Kaiser Family Foundation website. So they were paying hospitals to diagnose and

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:44.560
 treat COVID patients. But anyway, at the same early part of April, when the so-called death

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:56.560
 from COVID increased so astronomically, there was an equal opposite decline in influenza.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:07.560
 And since then, people around the world have commented on the historical unique event of

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:15.560
 the disappearance of influenza everywhere in the world. And in Genevieve Breon's article,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:24.560
 she also notes that the numbers that make up for the supposed increase in COVID, there

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:35.560
 was also a great decrease in deaths from heart attacks and several other normal diseases.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:45.560
 So anyone just looking at CDC's own figures in detail should make their own conclusion

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.560
 that nothing has happened.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.560
 You know, as far as like the mental health, that's what I've seen the most too, I think

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.560
 on the call before we started recording, I had told you about an EMT that I know that

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.560
 I'd asked him how much, you know, COVID have you seen in our area? And he said, Oh, not

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.560
 very much. I keep seeing mental health issues. That's the biggest issue. And so, you know,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.560
 for me being a practitioner, I really want to offer people that have to isolate or have

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.560
 to quarantine or, you know, or just are just staying at home. But go out in nature. If

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.560
 there's nothing else, if you can't be with the ones you love, there's something really

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 healing and comforting about nature, about forest bathing and being in the woods. Dr.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.560
 Pete, what would you offer people that are, you know, they live alone and they're not

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.560
 in a position where they can go out and about very much? What would you say to them? Just

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:48.560
 stay healthy. Immediately after the great lockdown for the new Wuhan virus in China,

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:56.560
 just a couple of weeks after they declared that they had contained the infection, I think

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:07.560
 it was towards the end of 2019, there were pictures on the internet of people in public

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:16.560
 swimming pools in Wuhan crowded together at two or three feet apart playing in this giant

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:27.560
 swimming pool, hundreds of people having fun. China had the best experience, best knowledge

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:40.560
 of it, but they considered it absolutely harmless once the confinement had done its job and

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:52.560
 went back to normal behavior. Having fun, getting together, socializing, working, doing everything

00:22:52.560 --> 00:23:03.560
 normally. I think that's the only real solution is to realize that the government has seriously

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:12.560
 misbehaved. Yeah, so on that, we will jump into the questioner, Brandon, Trine's question.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:19.560
 He said, "I'd be curious about Dr. Pete's thoughts surrounding bile acid salt and its

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:26.560
 use mixed with glycine to potentiate significant motility in cases where migrating motor complex

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.560
 and peristalsis were deficient. This is really strong stuff and not something I would recommend

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.560
 to just anybody." He said, "As well as what are his thoughts on the top suggestions for

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:50.560
 someone with spinal pain?" Yeah, bile has been used very traditionally as an aid to

00:23:50.560 --> 00:24:02.560
 digestion, and they can be dangerous, but I think with moderate use with a meal, for

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:09.560
 some people, they can improve digestion. And your top suggestions for someone with spinal

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:24.560
 pain? Oh, the back is full of cartil intramus joints, and so it's one of the, because it's

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:36.560
 constantly flexing and under pressure, it's one of the first places that cartilage metabolism

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:47.560
 problem shows up. But I don't think there's anything in most situations unique to the

00:24:47.560 --> 00:25:01.560
 spinal pain over other joints. There are specific sensitivities, like the backbone is a focus

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:13.560
 of joint pain, mostly in women, and the spondylitis, and close segments spondylitis, I think fits

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:28.560
 in more often, and the inflammation in that case can be traced to deranged bacteria balances

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:40.560
 in the intestine so fastly, typically alleviated. But the general problem of cartilage inflammation

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:53.560
 and distortion and pain, for example, prolonged back problems during growth can lead to scoliosis

00:25:53.560 --> 00:26:03.560
 or crooked growth of the back, but that same process shows up sometimes in knock knees

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:12.560
 or arms that turn out of the elbow, knees that turn in so the thighs are together when the

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:24.560
 feet are spread, and the main cause of weak and swollen cartilage leading to those use

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:38.560
 aggravated pain and distortion, the main cause of that is thyroid deficiency. The classic

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:47.560
 thyroid textbooks showed typical joint deformations because the low thyroid function leads to

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.560
 swelling of the cartilage.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.560
 That makes sense. So he may want to get his thyroid checked out and see if maybe some

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.560
 natural desiccated thyroid would work for the spine.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:15.560
 I've seen several people who were completely incapacitated by disc problems included, all

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:24.560
 kinds of joint problems. When they hit the back, they compress on nerves and cause real

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:37.560
 total disability. But I've seen people very thoroughly knocked out by those swollen back

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:47.560
 joints in just a few weeks essentially supplementing thyroid and correcting nutritional

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:55.560
 deficiencies and go from bedridden to perfectly healthy.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.560
 Okay. The next few questions we have, apparently hormone issues are running rampant and we've

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.560
 got a lot of hormone questions, especially about bioidentical hormones. So Veronica Aiella

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:13.560
 asks, "What does Ray Peat think about bioidentical hormones for women like the testosterone

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:20.560
 pellet or creams? Also, if you're deficient in estrogen, what does he think is a good

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.560
 idea to replace that hormone with as well?"

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:36.560
 First, how do you test the deficiency of estrogen? There have only been a few studies

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:45.560
 of this, but for example, starting with rat studies, there have been hundreds of thousands

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:54.560
 of studies of hormone effects in rats. But I only know of two publications in which they

00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:04.560
 remove the ovaries. Classically, they say that creates a menopause like estrogen deficiency.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:15.560
 But in these studies who actually measured the rat's serum estrogen a week after removing

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:23.560
 the ovaries, although there was an extreme progesterone deficiency, their estrogen level

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:34.560
 was right back to normal. Absolutely no ovaries, but perfectly normal estrogen, but lacking

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:46.560
 the balance of progesterone because that largely comes from the ovaries. If you measure a person

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:57.560
 under different conditions in the presence of progesterone, there's one group that has

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:05.560
 looked at all of the enzymes activated or inactivated by progesterone, and there are

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:16.560
 about 10 or 11 such enzymes that are controlled in an on and off light by progesterone, which

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:28.560
 have to do with the activation or inactivation of estrogen. When estrogen is inactivated

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:38.560
 by attaching sulfuric acid or an acidic sugar to the estrogen molecule, it becomes water

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:49.560
 soluble and is no longer soluble in cell substance, and so it enters the bloodstream from which

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:59.560
 it exists via the kidneys. It happens that progesterone activates the enzymes that inactivate

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:10.560
 estrogen, causing it to be lost from cells, no longer active inside cells. In the progesterone

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:22.560
 deficiency, you have a reverse enzyme pattern, leaving estrogen in its active, oil-soluble

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:33.560
 form where it stays inside cells and can't get out because it can't be water-solubleized.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:44.560
 So, in the progesterone deficiency, tested in humans as well as animals, the serum estrogen

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:58.560
 seems to be practically zero, but the intracellular estrogen, it even can be newly synthesized,

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:07.560
 not to see a formulae circulating estrogen being activated on kept-in cells, but cells

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:17.560
 in this progesterone deficient state actually begin producing their own new estrogen inside

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:24.560
 the breast, for example, or inside the uterus. So, it doesn't matter that you don't have

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:33.560
 any estrogen circulating from the ovaries. In the absence of progesterone, there will

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:45.560
 be no estrogen to speak of in the bloodstream, while the relevant breast, brain, kidney,

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:56.560
 and uterine tissues are beginning to make their own estrogen. And so, with aging, when

00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:04.560
 they talk about the shutdown of the ovaries at menopause, they talk about whether it's

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:12.560
 an estrogen deficient state, but it's exactly the things I was talking about. The first

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:22.560
 thing that disappears when you stop having periods at age 45 or 50 or whatever, the estrogen

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:33.560
 is no longer available to pass into the bloodstream on the way to leading the body and the kidneys.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:41.560
 So, immediately, with the disappearance of progesterone, you begin to experience unopposed

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:55.560
 estrogen, and any increasing accumulated stress is going to exacerbate that or make the symptoms

00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:04.560
 worse and worse, keeping serum estrogen low while increasing the amount of the relevant

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:17.560
 tissues. The whole idea of where estrogen comes from is absolutely contrary to the science.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:26.560
 Someone who is measuring the amount of estrogen produced by the healthy ovaries in healthy

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:36.560
 menopause wanted to compare the blood coming out of the ovarian vein to other blood in

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:45.560
 the body, so they took an arm vein and analyzed the amount of estrogen in the blood from the

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:55.560
 arm and from the ovary, and the arm vein contained just as much estrogen as the ovary, and so

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:05.560
 when you add up blades and arms and other tissues, you can't help but conclude that the ovaries

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:14.560
 are an insignificant or relatively small source of body estrogen. So, scientifically, there

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:23.560
 is absolutely no reason to think that an estrogen deficiency can ever exist.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:30.560
 What about your feelings on the bioidentical creams for testosterone? A lot of people I

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.560
 know are doing bioidentical testosterone. What are your thoughts on that?

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:47.560
 When you're under stress, such as menopause, stress caused by unbalanced estrogen and leading

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:57.560
 to low thyroid function and very low progesterone, during stress, even small amounts of testosterone

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:04.560
 will be converted to more estrogen. So, it's going to be very dangerous unless you correct

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:16.560
 your progesterone and thyroid function to add testosterone equally with added progesterone.

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:22.560
 Yeah, it's really about addressing the thyroid first, correct, and then, if needed, addressing

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.560
 the hormones, yeah? Yeah, because when you correct the thyroid, you're lowering the stress

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:38.560
 hormones, lowering estrogen by accelerating the liver's detoxifying of it, and promoting

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:48.560
 very directly activating the production of progesterone from cholesterol. When your thyroid

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:58.560
 is low, your cholesterol is invariably high, except in a few specific disease states, but

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:09.560
 there's a mirror image relationship between thyroid function and cholesterol level. And

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:17.560
 the reason cholesterol goes up when your thyroid goes down is that it's no longer being converted

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:28.560
 into progesterone. Thyroid is massively activating the conversion of cholesterol into progesterone

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:36.560
 and pregnant alone, primarily, as basic protective hormones.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:43.560
 Okay. So, Stephen Mitchell asks, you know, he's talking about bioidentical, too, does

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:49.560
 Ray Peat believe that suppression caused from the use of bioidentical hormones, such as

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:55.560
 testosterone, is mostly an issue with the lack of pregnant alone, which you kind of

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:01.560
 already answered that. For example, if pregnant alone is supplied exogenously, suppression

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:07.560
 of the pituitary hormones, such as LH, can that be a good thing, or would this idea be

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:22.560
 completely wrong? As far as I know, there's no strong influence of pregnant alone on LH,

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:33.560
 but too much testosterone can, the normal function of high testosterone is to turn off

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:43.560
 luteinizing hormone, and with that decrease, progesterone decreases. So, just taking too

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:52.560
 much natural, good testosterone tends to turn off your progesterone, and since progesterone

00:38:52.560 --> 00:39:04.560
 is a major anti-arromatase, an aromatase inhibitor, if you lower progesterone, you're going

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:14.560
 to release aromatase action to convert testosterone to estrogen. So, taking testosterone by itself

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:21.560
 is a risk in multiple ways of increasing your estrogen balance.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:27.560
 So, if somebody was taking testosterone, even like you said, a good kind, you would want

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.560
 them to also be taking, obviously, if they're working on their thyroid, they're taking

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.560
 a thyroid supplement, but also progesterone, or how would you say to help that individual

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:59.560
 not convert the testosterone to estrogen? Progesterone and thyroid both tend to inhibit

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:07.560
 a healthy man in his teens and twenties that might produce four or five milligrams per

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:20.560
 day of testosterone, and ten or fifteen milligrams of DHEA. Medical treatments very often are

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:31.560
 providing plenty milligrams a day, for example, instead of normal four or five. So, that's

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:39.560
 almost certain to suppress progesterone while increasing estrogen.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:48.560
 TMC asks prolactinoma, "Is it possible to reverse those without surgery? What could

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.560
 cause them in the first place?"

00:40:51.560 --> 00:41:01.560
 Just recently, someone was a mysterious, extremely high prolactin level, just by changing other

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:08.560
 things in this diet, caused something like a hundred point decrease down to absolutely

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:17.560
 normal prolactin. But those are strongly influenced by thyroid and by vitamin D and calcium in

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:28.560
 the diet. The parathyroid hormone that there are surgeons who have created their own series

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:37.560
 of vitamin D metabolism and calcium metabolism, they're the worst people to listen to, to

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:49.560
 understand vitamin D. They're making, for example, just for a fifteen minute surgery,

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.560
 they're making something like fifteen thousand dollars, about a thousand dollars a minute,

00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:03.560
 which justifies their inventing a new series of what vitamin D is. But they essentially

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:15.560
 are saying that the prolactinoma has nothing to do with your diet or the parathyroid tumor.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:24.560
 Both of them are absolutely dependent on the diet. You can turn off your parathyroid hormone

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:34.560
 with a proper amount of calcium in your diet, vitamin D, and supporting factors such as

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:44.560
 thyroid hormone. Both of those tumors are a response to a defect in the calcium handling

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:53.560
 system and the thyroid and vitamin D are usually responsible.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:43:03.560
 Okay, so get out in the sunshine, TMC, and get that vitamin D too. Butch843 asks, "I

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:09.560
 want to know the use of nicotine gum for cognitive enhancement and alertness. Does repeat recommend

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:18.560
 the use of nicotine gum?" It's a very interesting idea. I've been following it for years and

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:28.560
 people have found that in middle age animals and older, if they don't start using nicotine

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:38.560
 at a young age, there doesn't seem to be an addiction problem. But there can be directly

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:47.560
 toxic effects from nicotine and that still hasn't been. We're right in the middle of

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:57.560
 understanding what the nicotinic receptor system so-called is really doing. So I think

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:06.560
 it's dangerous, but that does have a definite cognitive promoting effect. But I think it's

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.560
 safer to do it with other things such as thyroid and caffeine.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:19.560
 I agree, yeah, for sure. Okay, this is an interesting question from Ms. Foster. "The best way to

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:25.560
 treat an adrenal body type and lower cortisol because my sleep is very poor quality due

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:31.560
 to a hiatal hernia. I wake up tired and have muscle wastage. I've tried everything I can

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.560
 think of to sleep, such as getting outside during the day, dimming the lights at night,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:42.560
 mindfulness, yoga, taking Valerian, seeing a chiropractor, nothing works. I have symptoms

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:49.560
 of low thyroid." So she's wondering what you would recommend Dr. Pete as far as this

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.560
 lowering cortisol. It sounds to me like she definitely needs some thyroid, but also maybe

00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:07.560
 gesturone. What would you say? Yeah, I was a problem sleeper from puberty until I think

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:18.560
 I was about 46 when I finally tried supplementing thyroid. The tiniest little click in the wall

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:30.560
 would instantly wake me up during those years. Traveling around a lot, doing talks, I would

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:41.560
 get very tired and have trouble going to sleep. After I started realizing that for other reasons

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:54.560
 I needed a thyroid supplement, once I tried a 10 microgram tablet of T3 at bedtime when

00:45:54.560 --> 00:46:08.560
 I was in that fatigued traveling state. Instantly I went to sleep and slept soundly. Shortly

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:19.560
 after that I was visiting a doctor who was going to introduce talks the next night. He

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:26.560
 was haggard looking and said he hadn't slept for about four nights. Nothing worked to help

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:35.560
 him get to sleep. I had a bottle of Cytomil in my pocket and gave him some. The next night

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:41.560
 I got to the talk late and he was already starting the introduction. When I got up to

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:51.560
 the microphone he pulled me aside and said that stuff is better than opium. There is

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:57.560
 the power in getting that thyroid regulated in order to improve sleep for sure because

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:05.560
 I also was one that suffered sleep for many years. Thyroid was the major thing that helped

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.560
 me get it under control.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:19.560
 Hyhistamine is one of the classical wakefulness activators. That's why antihistamines put

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:30.560
 you to sleep because the stress of hypothyroidism increases estrogen and so on which increases

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:40.560
 your mast cell and other release of histamine. The thyroid increases your energy over the

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:47.560
 estrogen and histamine and lets you sleep normally.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:55.560
 Young mad dog asks, "Is it possible to get rid of gynomastia after fixing estrogen, prolactin,

00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:01.560
 serotonin, cortisol?" It's been almost two years avoiding PUFA and I'm just wondering

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.560
 what to do about the gynomastia.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:20.560
 Thyroid is the main thing. There's an inverse relationship in general between thyroid hormone

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:32.560
 and prolactin. The same release hormone controls both TSH and prolactin. If your TSH is up

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:43.560
 even within the normal range, activating release hormones are probably also causing an excess

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:52.560
 of prolactin and lowering your TSH with a supplement is probably going to lower your

00:48:52.560 --> 00:49:06.560
 prolactin and estrogen gradually. With T3, it can stop breast pain in 10 minutes. Women

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:16.560
 I've known with 10 micrograms of Cytomil in 10 minutes, they're agonizing breast pain,

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:26.560
 have totally stopped. A woman's breast pain is hormonally very closely connected to male

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.560
 gynomastia.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:34.560
 I love sugar is one of our big listeners. We get a lot of questions from this individual.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:39.560
 On one of his interviews, Dr. Pete mentioned that nibbling food throughout the day is the

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:45.560
 best frequency to eat food. Assuming one would consume milk and orange juice based on

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:51.560
 appetite, does this mean sipping them every 10 to 20 minutes or so is okay? Or would that

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:56.560
 have any negative effects? How frequently does Dr. Pete sip milk and orange juice? Thanks,

00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.560
 Dr. Pete and Jodell.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:08.560
 The main problem with that is that it's probably bad for your teeth to let bacteria keep growing

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:17.560
 by having food in your mouth. If your thyroid and progesterone functions are very good, your

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:27.560
 liver and muscles are going to store a huge amount of glucose. When those are good, you

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:37.560
 have no stress at all from skipping a meal. You can easily go six or eight hours without

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:47.560
 eating and without experiencing a drop in energy or increase of stress. For someone

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:57.560
 who is under stress, keeping your blood sugar up with frequent doses of nutrients, especially

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:01.560
 carbohydrates and salt.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:07.560
 I would say not every 10 to 20 minutes, but more like every couple of hours just to let

00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:13.560
 that insulin spike relax if for some reason they have blood sugar handling problems. Is

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.560
 that true?

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.560
 That's good.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:27.560
 Crescent Moon asks, how should one treat chronic fatigue syndrome? Any recommendations for

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:34.560
 using antibiotics? Should I take an approved antibiotic for weeks at a time if that's not

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.560
 what's required to reduce symptoms?

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:48.560
 Historically, for at least 25 years, many people have been observing that those symptoms

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:58.560
 go along with above normal prolactin. Since above normal prolactin is tightly related to

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:08.560
 below normal thyroid function, I think the usual approach should be getting your energy

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:18.560
 system working again, running at a higher temperature, higher body temperature, using the more efficient

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:30.560
 oxidative metabolism, producing the anti-inflammatory carbon dioxide rather than the pro-inflammatory

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:46.560
 carbon dioxide. All of these things that interfere with calcium, vitamin D metabolism, all of

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:57.560
 these create inflammation by way of lactic acid and decrease the carbon dioxide production

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:05.560
 as a good thyroid activation of metabolism.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:14.560
 Turkish Postman asks, can we rub caffeine directly on our scalp to prevent or be an antagonist

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:20.560
 to hair loss or should we use it with a shampoo to dissolve it?

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:30.560
 No, it is poorly soluble in water, but some other substances like aspirin can increase

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:43.560
 the amount in the solution. And for many types of skin irritation, chronic mysterious rashes

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:56.560
 sometimes quickly disappear to a lotion of caffeine. When there is some kind of a disease

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:06.560
 process going on, it doesn't hurt to test caffeine lotion on the scalp, but the whole

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:17.560
 energy-providing system of the hair follicle again centers closely on calcium, vitamin D,

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:40.560
 parathyroid hormone and prolactin. So you want to keep your parathyroid and prolactin low,

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:59.560
 which increases the growth and likelihood of the hair follicle.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:04.560
 They have a question regarding toxic black mold, which I can relate to. For several years

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:13.560
 ago, I was exposed to black toxic mold. What would Dr. Pete recommend to detoxify from

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:19.560
 black toxic mold? Would activated charcoal be effective and how much and for how long?

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:37.560
 Thank you, Jodell and Dr. Pete. You guys are awesome.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:49.560
 I think there is any evidence that propagates itself in the body. A lot of 10 or 15 years

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:58.560
 ago, interest in black mold was being promoted by the construction industry, convincing people

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.560
 that they needed to tear down their house and build a new one. It had to cure the mold

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:15.560
 problem. If you have a persisting mold problem, getting the chronic humidity of the hair below

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:27.560
 55% relative humidity will limit or prevent black mold growth. If you want to be sure

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:37.560
 that you have killed the mold and spores, you can either direct a strong ultraviolet

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:49.560
 light on the moldy area or close the room with a good strong ozone generator. If you

00:56:49.560 --> 00:57:00.560
 have fancy colored upholstery or drapes, you don't want to expose the toes to prolonged

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:11.560
 ozone exposure because they will fade. UV light and the ozone generators will do a good

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:22.560
 job. The ozone penetrates below the surface in the wood and plastic to kill the spores.

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:29.560
 I had a couple of questions. On breath work, I have been really intrigued by breath work

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:34.560
 and understanding that sometimes we hyperventilate. We breathe too much. What are your thoughts

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:41.560
 on that? Should we do more of a relaxed, slow style of breath, or are you a fan of deep

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:51.560
 breathing? When you're anxious, you tend to turn on over-breathing and over-breathing

00:57:51.560 --> 00:58:02.560
 quickly activates the lactic acid production and creates a vicious circle. The breathing

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:17.560
 training or exercise can gradually relax you enough that you can expel your breath effortlessly.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:31.560
 Just relax and the air falls out of you. Then the diaphragm will cause your abdomen to rise

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:40.560
 as you inhale without having to expand your chest. That's the normal, relaxed way to

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:51.560
 breathe. If you notice your chest having to expand, that's probably a stress state. When

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:57.560
 you're thoroughly relaxed, for example, when you're just waking up in the morning, you

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:08.560
 might notice that you have very fast, shallow breathing. That's normal breathing, where

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:20.560
 the diaphragm is reacting to the accumulated carbon dioxide and causing just enough inhalation

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:30.560
 to bring in the oxygen you need without blowing out too much of the protective CO2. I think

00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:38.560
 the best way to do it is by making sure your thyroid function and progesterone levels are

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:46.560
 adequate. That will produce the shift away from lactic acid towards CO2, and you don't

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:57.560
 have to go through weeks of forced remembering not to breathe too much.

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:03.560
 I love that. I love that you talked about the calming the breath down, like that we

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:09.560
 should be doing the breath work. But in addition to, like all things, we really have to address

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:15.560
 the thyroid and the progesterone. As far as someone who's a mouth breather and maybe a

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.560
 adjusting to nasal breathing, because I'm trying to get several of my clients to become

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:26.560
 nasal breathers, is that something that you think also calms down the stress response

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:29.560
 in the body, becoming more of a nasal breather?

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:49.560
 The thyroid itself will usually take care of that, and it involves things like bowel irritation

01:00:49.560 --> 01:01:00.560
 that create a conscious deficiency of oxygen, making new gas for breath. Just a good laxative

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:09.560
 and adding fiber to the diet temporarily and antibiotic can help to clean up. But thyroid

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:17.560
 should be the thing that maintains good bowel health, and good bowel health will make it

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:27.560
 much easier to have relaxed, un-anxious abdominal or diaphragm breathing.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:33.560
 Very cool. Okay, now my daughter who's six, she likes to ask you questions too, and so

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.560
 she had a question about brain fog. She's heard me talk about it, like about clients

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.560
 and stuff that have it, and she says, "What is brain fog, and how do we get brain fog,

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.560
 and how can we get rid of it?" Because the other day she said she felt like her brain

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:56.560
 was foggy.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:03.560
 No one is really very clear about what it means, but partly it means that they have no

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:13.560
 short-term memory to speak of. They can just move across the room and not remember why

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:25.560
 they went there. So the fog is something that limits your range of vision, and in that sense

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:36.560
 if you don't have the short-term instantaneous memory that is necessary to get from one moment

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:45.560
 to the next, then you feel like you're muddled and don't know what to do.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:54.560
 When I was about 12 or 13 experiencing early puberty changes, I happened to have a bottle

01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:02.560
 of vitamin B1 tablets, and didn't know why I would be taking it, but I just chewed up

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:15.560
 one, and immediately, like three or four minutes, I suddenly had a broader range of perspective

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:26.560
 and focused behavior, and I realized that that had been what people would call a brain fog.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:36.560
 Just feeling like you're oppressed, but for no particular reason, and when that clears

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:46.560
 away, suddenly you can acutely see what you want to do and should be doing and have been

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:56.560
 doing. So it places you in time and space in a clear way, and that's simple brain energy

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:05.560
 and thyroid and sugar metabolism are the basic source of your available brain energy.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:16.560
 It happens that vitamin B1 and caffeine are things that can momentarily give you a boost

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:24.560
 of metabolic energy. That work says brain energy is serving up the fogginess.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.560
 Okay, I'll be sure to tell her, but I don't think I'll give her any caffeine. She already

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:36.560
 bounces off the walls as it is. Alright, well that concludes our questions. This has been

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.560
 fun as usual, and you're so generous. I just hope that people will return the generosity

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:48.560
 and check out your newsletter, which they can get via the mail or via their email, and

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:55.560
 that's at Ray Pete's, that's plural, Pete's with an S newsletter at gmail.com, and I really

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:01.560
 encourage it because I love it. I look forward to each article that comes out. So yeah, I

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:10.560
 appreciate you doing that as well, Dr. Pete. Okay, thank you. Alright, well we will let

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:20.560
 you go for now, and thanks once again. Appreciate your time. Okay, bye. Thank you so much. Have

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:31.560
 a good evening. Is your gut right? Are your hormones in check? Well, ATP Science is my

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:36.560
 new go-to brand when it comes to lowering estrogen and getting your gut right. In fact,

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.560
 their product, Gut Right, is on the top of my list with regard to an all-around supplement

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.560
 that I would recommend to almost any client I work with. It's so imperative that we get

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.560
 our guts right in order to absorb all the nutrients from our foods that we're taking

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:55.560
 in. Our guts are under so much stress from our food system, from the stress of the system

01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.560
 we live in as a whole, to dangerous radiation we're bombarded with. When you hold your cell

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.560
 phone right in front of your stomach, you're actually radiating your internal organs and

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.560
 kind of breaking down the gut lining, so to speak. So alongside with that, social pressures

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.560
 from social media. Yeah, guys, Facebook and Instagram totally affect your gut because

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:19.560
 it affects you on an anxiety and nervous level of, you know, you're seeing all the pressures

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.560
 of what your peers are doing and can you live up to that. So it puts pressure on you. So

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:29.560
 you might want to consider getting your gut right by doing a 10-day protocol of the gut

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.560
 right. So simply order yours today. Use the link in the description as well as my code

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:42.560
 JODEL, J-O-D-E-L-L-E, which gives you 10% off, and take gut right for three times a day for

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:48.560
 10 days. Then begin balancing your hormones with my favorite product, Alpha Prime. And

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:54.560
 can I just say that I've had several clients that have lowered their estrogen by half within

01:06:54.560 --> 01:07:00.560
 almost six weeks' time. They've lowered their estrogen from astronomical numbers in half

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.560
 by just taking the Alpha Prime. So this is a JODEL approved product that everybody that's

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:11.560
 dealing with hormonal imbalances or excess estrogen should be on. So order yours today.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.560
 Start moving the needle in the right direction and feel better fast.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:20.560
 Who's got your back day and night? Well, not very many people have our backs day and night,

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.560
 but I'll tell you a company that does, and that's Swanwick Sleep. So they have day blockers

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:32.560
 for the daytime computer use, and then they have the nighttime blockers for the TV use

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.560
 or Words with Friends or whatever it is you're doing on a device that you really shouldn't

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:42.560
 be doing at night. They've got light blockers for that. We've got to block that dangerous

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.560
 blue light. Did you know that right after the sun goes down, within an hour of the sun

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.560
 going down, if you're not blocking that blue light, you will elevate insulin. We don't

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.560
 want to do that. We don't want to elevate insulin. So they've got your back day or night. Check

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:05.560
 them out. SwanwickSleep.com and you can use my code GETFIT to save 10% on either day or

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.560
 nighttime. Check them out.
