WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.160
 Okay, and we're live, Georgie DeKalb, Ray Peat.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.940
 Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.940
 Thank you, Georgie.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.940
 Thank you, Ray.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.520
 And we're just going to rifle through a bunch of questions, but before we do that, how are

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520
 you, Ray?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520
 Very good.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.520
 Yeah?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.120
 So the weather had gotten a little bit sunnier in Eugene, so that's always a positive.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.520
 It's going to be in the hundreds, over a hundred this weekend.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.120
 And then how do you, do you go sit in the sun or what do you do?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.800
 No, I'm going to stay inside all day, tomorrow at least.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.680
 We open the door at about 1 a.m. when it cools off, blow in some cooler air and then close

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200
 it up for the day.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.520
 The house is concrete, so it holds its temperature for about a day.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.400
 And blocking that 5G as well.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.320
 Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.880
 Okay, and then Georgie, how are you, sir?

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.160
 I really like your elevator music that you put at the start of the show.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 It was very soothing.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.000
 Did you hear it through my headphones?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.600
 No, I heard the music.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000
 Was I not supposed to hear it?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Oh, no, you weren't.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Okay, that's a little bit weird.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.440
 Ray, did you hear the music too?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.440
 Yeah.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 Oh, okay, weird.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 Okay, that's a new...

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.440
 I thought it was kind of interesting.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.240
 You tried to hold a conversation over this really loud music and I thought, "Wow, that

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 must be a new feature."

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 That's one of the...

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 In conference call music.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 That's one of the reasons we're upgrading equipment, because when I'm talking to you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.400
 guys before the show, I'm always hearing music and it's obnoxious.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.880
 Okay, enough of that.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.960
 This show, like I said, told you guys before, I don't feel like it's for me or necessarily

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 per se Georgie, although Ray and Georgie, you guys' interfacing and bouncing ideas off

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.400
 each other is, I think, what the people are here to listen to.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.360
 Okay, so I'm just going to go through these questions and read them.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.400
 And Ray, some of this stuff is going to be redundant and answer as much or as little

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.000
 as you want for all of this.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 So our first one is from Drew F. and he says, "Trestosterone/MENT is not 5-alpha reduced,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 but bodybuilders and some post-finasteride sufferers experience benefits in terms of

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 mood, anabolism, et cetera.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.240
 Is androgen receptor agonism a likely explanation for the effects?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.320
 It is a much stronger androgen than testosterone."

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.040
 Which reduced testosterone is it?

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040
 Georgie, do you know what this is?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 It's...

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.040
 Yes, I know.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440
 It's a new steroid.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.640
 It's 7-alpha-methylated version of nendrolone, which is a carbon-18 steroid of the estrein

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.640
 family.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 So it was...

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.040
 I was always suspicious when they add the methyl group.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.360
 Yeah, it's actually very hepatotoxic.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.160
 As you know, Ray, methyl groups at position 17, 7, and potentially others, they've all

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.440
 been proven to have severe hepatotoxicity.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.400
 But bodybuilders like it because I guess they don't value their liver that much, but also

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.600
 it's the steroid that can achieve the same with lower doses and they think it's worth

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.960
 it instead of abusing the testosterone in higher dosages.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.440
 That steroid was developed as a male contraceptive candidate, and I think it's still in clinical

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.560
 trials for that.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.160
 But even the company that developed it and is running the clinical trials got discouraged

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 given the hepatotoxicity.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.040
 Ray, do you want to clarify the methyl group?

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.280
 So adding a methyl group to a steroid is risky, you said?

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.640
 Yeah, it just sends it off on unknown pathways.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.080
 The liver never had to deal with such things, and so I think it's extremely unpredictable

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080
 and dangerous.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.080
 Good stuff.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.920
 And then we've talked about post-finasteride a bunch, so I want to kind of get into that

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920
 again.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.920
 I kind of want to...

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.080
 I think his main question was, "Is activation of the androgen receptor a plausible explanation

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:54.280
 of the antidepressant and general feelings of well-being from using these androgenic

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280
 steroids?"

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.280
 I think it's plausible.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.280
 Great stuff.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.280
 Thank you for that, guys.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 Okay, Marcelo, this is just kind of a statement.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.000
 Thank you, Danny, for your contributions to the community.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.400
 You are a big reason why Ray's work...

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.800
 Wealth of knowledge is available to us.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.440
 Thank you so much, Georgie, for his continuing curiosity and dedicating his life's work towards

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.840
 advancements in this space.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840
 Hope this helps.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840
 Thank you, Marcelo.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 Sincerely appreciate that.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.560
 Thank you to Ray for being humble and inspiration for all things.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.200
 Andrew Wallace says, "What would you do if you had Crohn's?

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.680
 What would be your protocol?"

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 Me?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 Yeah, Ray, I always assume...

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.920
 I guess I'm just asking you, and then Georgie can chime in at any point.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.040
 Pretty much what I do anyway.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.280
 Assume that the intestine is my contact with the world, and I have to protect it, and so

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:47.160
 I don't want to offend it in any way, and Crohn's disease is a seriously offended intestine.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.660
 And from what I've read, it seems like you've dealt with a lot of serious intestinal things

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080
 over the years, as one would in this environment.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.760
 And so it's not like you're speaking from reading...

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.200
 I know you read, obviously, a lot, but you're speaking from personal experience.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.200
 Is that right?

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.200
 Yeah.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:09.560
 I had Crohn's as a baby with migraines, which recurred every time I would do certain things

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.760
 wrong up until my mid-40s.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.760
 I would still...

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.520
 The last one, for example, was when I was visiting in San Francisco and didn't realize

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.960
 that they had fluoridated water, and I would occasionally drink some of that water, and

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.240
 I was taking Sinoplus or Sino-Male orally, and within two or three days, I had a tremendous

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.440
 migraine, and that started me thinking about it, and fluoride can totally wipe out the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:53.760
 activity of T3 if it happens to be present in your stomach and the T3 is exposed to it.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760
 Amazing stuff.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760
 Okay, so obviously...

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.720
 I have a question in regards to Crohn's disease.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.160
 Ray, have you seen some of the more recent studies claiming that Crohn's disease may

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.120
 be caused by a type of mycobacteria, which is known to cause Crohn's disease in animals,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.080
 and now they're saying the same thing may be true in humans?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:18.760
 Yeah, but the inflammation and poor digestion are set up to conditions for such things to

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.600
 accumulate and multiply.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.640
 So basically making sure that you don't irritate your intestine more than absolutely necessary

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.520
 is at the basis of a protocol for keeping...

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.680
 You can find a mycoplasm in just about any sick person.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.420
 It's sort of opportunistic and looks for a sort of place to live.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.920
 So maybe this antibiotic therapy that they're now trying in Europe for this potentially...

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.400
 They're treating it as a bacteria infection, but it's really destroying the microbiome

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.960
 and keeping the intestine sterile, which reduces the inflammation.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960
 Not necessarily...

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.200
 It's not only one bacteria, it's just...

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.160
 This is helping because it's reducing the amount of bacteria in the intestine anyways.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:06.920
 Yeah, just taking a series of penicillin doses or eating raw carrots, for example, can have

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.760
 very similar effects.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:16.440
 And in both rats and people, it turns out that anything that cleans up your intestine

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.880
 will lower your cortisol and estrogen and increase your progesterone just because the

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.840
 intestine is such a chronic drain and source of stress.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.600
 In regards to the carrot salad and in general fiber, what are your thoughts on supplementing

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.800
 with pure cellulose if one could find a pure source?

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800
 It would be interesting.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.600
 They used to sell basically a cellulose tablet for weight loss.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:49.080
 I've never tried one, but it seemed like a good idea because cellulose doesn't have the

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.200
 estrogen-promoting symptoms that a lot of other fibers do.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.880
 Yeah, the reason I'm mentioning is I was reading some studies.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.600
 They're using various cellulose esters as binders for drugs for developing pharmaceutical

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:06.200
 drugs and some of these esters, like for example, ethyl cellulose, showed remarkable antibacterial

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.640
 effects in animals and reduced inflammation.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.880
 So I thought maybe it's because it's clearing out their intestines somehow.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.680
 It was a very popular laxative effect as well as weight loss.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.360
 Was this in the past, like in the maybe '60s or '70s?

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.200
 I used to see the ads for it on TV as recently as 1986, I think it was.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.200
 Interesting, very interesting.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.000
 Speaking of cortisol, okay, this one's from New Health and they say good cortisol blocker

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.680
 supplements for weight loss.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.000
 What is your thoughts on that, Ray?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 What blocker?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.680
 Like a cortisol blocker.

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:44.480
 Progesterone and pregnenolone are the best ones I know of, but working at the pituitary

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:55.160
 level, a lot of things, sugar, aspirin, probably sodium, anything that stabilizes your blood

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:01.160
 sugar and metabolism, reduces inflammation, will defend you against cortisol.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 Thanks for that.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.200
 New Health says, "There's now a spinoff of the Ray Peat community with Morley Robbins

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.880
 ideas, aka Ceruloplasmin.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.440
 Would you be willing to do a show on this from a Ray Peat perspective?"

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.520
 I think these were when they originally thought that Georgie and I were just going to do a

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.520
 Q&A.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.640
 Ray, what are your thoughts on Ceruloplasmin?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.400
 It's an acute phase reactant, so do you want to be increasing Ceruloplasmin?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.960
 Is that a goal of a diet or lifestyle or supplement routine?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.720
 Not my goal.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.240
 Do you want to comment on Morley Robbins?

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.240
 You know who that is?

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.240
 Are you familiar with their work?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240
 No, no.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240
 I have a question.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.120
 If somebody has low Ceruloplasmin, some of the studies claim that this is a sign of low

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.120
 thyroid function.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.120
 In a situation like that, considering that Ceruloplasmin apparently takes care of the

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.440
 copper and makes sure it doesn't become toxic to the various organs, would somebody be potentially

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.960
 at risk if they have low Ceruloplasmin and low thyroid?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.120
 Would they be at risk when eating high copper foods like liver and shellfish?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.320
 I think so.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:07.640
 Did you ever read Carl Pfeiffer's books?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:13.680
 I think he caused himself to lose pigment by being so obsessive about keeping copper

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.680
 down.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.520
 He was very concentrated on the risk of too much copper, probably having seen some people

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.120
 with Ceruloplasmin deficiency.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:31.200
 Ann Louise Gittleman, Andy Cutler, and Carl Pfeiffer were all about copper toxicity.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:38.200
 It seems like from reading your work that they were misled in what they thought was

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200
 going on.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200
 Yeah.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.200
 He took a little capsule of flowers of sulfur every day for many, many years.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.520
 He had no trace of skin or hair pigment left.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.520
 Okay, great stuff.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.320
 This one's from Joseph.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.320
 He says, "Can you speak about nitric oxide and the word on the street that it's good

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:58.360
 for Cialis or Viagra, so that it works like those substances?"

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:04.680
 I'm afraid there is quite a bit of overlap.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:12.920
 The initial, as soon as nitric oxide was discovered to be produced in the body, they were seeing

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.000
 its involvement in everything degenerative and harmful.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.280
 Then when the Viagra came on the market, suddenly for about five or six years, everything published

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:31.120
 was how great nitric oxide is, it prevents hypertension and protects you against everything.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:38.520
 Thousands of articles came out suddenly reversing it from a dangerous free radical to a cure-all.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:47.200
 Then about 10 or 15 years ago, there was a gradual return to sanity and realizing that

00:11:47.200 --> 00:12:04.120
 it's one of the very central things to degeneration, aging, the follow-up of trauma, estrogen interactions,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:12.080
 everything stress-related and degeneration-related involves the pro-inflammatory effects of ethanol.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.080
 Two follow-up questions.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.760
 One says, "Is aspirin safe to take every day and also is lactose-free milk?"

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:24.800
 It doesn't taste very good, but I think it's safe enough.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:33.880
 It probably doesn't let you absorb nutrients quite as well as natural lactose-containing

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.680
 milk, but I don't think it's harmful.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.440
 Then your thoughts on using aspirin every day?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:48.160
 Yeah, when I had a good supply, I was taking it every day very consistently, but sometimes

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:55.680
 I forget to take it when it isn't in a convenient form, like some of it is powdered so fine

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.520
 it's choking when you try to take it just on your tongue.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.720
 Georgie, interrupt me at any time.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.000
 Okay, this one's a little bit long, so bear with me for a second.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 "I've been trying to have a baby for more than a year, but I have azuspermia.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.960
 Found after three semen analyses and undetectable levels of spurn after a testicular ultrasound,

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:20.120
 they found a small varicocele in both testicles.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.880
 I've been taking seven to eight milligrams of extremistain for three weeks.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.120
 For how much longer is it safe to take?"

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.360
 So this is the first question.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.800
 "Will continued extremistain use help me fix the varicocele as well as the azus-"

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800
 What's she taking?

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800
 Exemistain.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.600
 It's a steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.520
 I'll just finish up this question.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.240
 It's like there's two more sentences here and we can go through it.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.920
 "If exemistain doesn't fix the azuspermia, what else can I do?

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.280
 I'd like to avoid having a varicocele ectomy or even worse, surgical sperm extraction from

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.440
 IVF.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.120
 After three weeks of exemistain, my total testosterone went from 400 to 756.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.080
 Exemistain has also increased my FSH and LH and are now above standard range.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.240
 I thought FSH and LH would go down as testosterone goes up."

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.120
 So were there bits of that question that you have comments on, Rick?

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:17.760
 Yeah, I think you can get a safer inhibition of aromatase using aspirin, progesterone,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.720
 completely safe things.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:27.440
 Thyroid is very important, but just with aspirin, progesterone, and thyroid, you can get your

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:34.680
 ratio back, testosterone, pregnenolone up and estrogen down.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:43.440
 Supplementing pregnenolone and thyroxine historically was very effective for correcting infertility

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.920
 and enlivening inactive sperms.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.960
 And so the azuspermia, if the cholesterol is high and the person wasn't taking enough

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.520
 thyroid, that would be a result of that with high estrogen?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:04.640
 Yeah, the thyroid and pregnenolone make their energy-producing system revive.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.640
 Great stuff, thanks for that.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.440
 Okay, Peggy says, "Question for the Q&A.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:15.520
 Thoughts on ivermectin for COVID, prophylaxis, and any alternative as it is almost impossible

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.280
 to get a prescription for it.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.280
 Thank you."

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:24.320
 Prophylaxis suggests you would be taking some every day for an indefinite time until you

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:34.520
 didn't get the infection, and the normal use of it is a very short course.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:41.760
 About one person in a thousand in the studies of using it to treat parasites will show signs

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760
 of brain damage.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:50.200
 I don't think it's a good idea to take maybe thousands of daily doses, even a moderate

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.160
 amount of something that once in a while is known to cause brain damage.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.200
 There was some podcast that was talking about ivermectin and a bunch of people emailed me

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.920
 about it the exact same time.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.640
 Again, Georgie, interrupt at any time.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.160
 Okay, so this person says-

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.680
 I can give a few more, I mean, based on the studies that recently came out.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.960
 Methylene blue, a well-known antiviral, at least four studies came out in the last month

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.840
 saying it can both prevent and treat COVID-19.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.840
 Of course, there's no medical advice, but that's what the study said.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.920
 Another hydroxychloroquine, you can try plain old quinine.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.600
 My personal favorite, hydroxychloroquine is just a patented, more liver-toxic version

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600
 of quinine.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.920
 Naringenin, also a few good studies.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.920
 So drinking orange juice should have similar effect than taking the isolated version.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.520
 And aspirin, vitamin C and vitamin D, I mean, all of these now have quite a few studies

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.520
 behind them.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.800
 Unfortunately, everything is being censored by mainstream media, so you have to go to

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.920
 PubMed to find them.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.920
 But I wouldn't say-

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.080
 Ivermectin would be one of the last things I would try considering all the other safer

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.720
 alternatives that are out there.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.360
 Cyproheptadine, famotidine, which is an acid blocker, but apparently is also a potent anti-serotonin

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360
 agent as well.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.080
 Really, I don't know where the Ivermectin craze is coming from.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:11.160
 Maybe that's the only thing that hit the mainstream news, but tons of other chemicals, safer and

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.160
 cheaper and available over the counter that can do just as well, if not better, than Ivermectin

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.720
 with fewer side effects.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.160
 Vitamin D is very effective.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:29.400
 There was a study done in Spain in a hospital which was withdrawn after a lot of doctors

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.480
 wrote ignorant letters to the publisher.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.480
 For some reason, the editor caved in and had it withdrawn.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.720
 But it was very clear that they gave, I think it was 6,000 units, something like that, per

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.720
 day.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:54.080
 Maybe it was 8,000 first dose and then 6,000 units a day to people who were admitted to

00:17:54.080 --> 00:18:00.040
 hospital intensive care, very sick with COVID.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:07.440
 Simply that treatment with vitamin D reduced mortality by about, I think it was 60%, just

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:14.520
 an absolutely clear difference, but the readers who didn't like vitamin D quibbled that they

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.400
 hadn't done statistics quite right.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.560
 But you can't miss a 60% disappearance of dead patients.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:30.400
 I would like to see a doctor argue that 60% more live people is statistically insignificant.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.360
 Very stupid people who are complaining.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.720
 A shout out to the Kate Deering and Kitty Blomfield podcast you did with them.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.640
 I thought it was like a tour de force and you at least, I thought you cleared up every

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.360
 single anti-vitamin D argument that exists on the internet right now.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.560
 I was very thankful for that podcast and I think you can type in Kitty Blomfield, a win

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.120
 at life podcast, vitamin D, Ray Peet, and a person can find it instantaneously.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.120
 Okay.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.120
 Hi, Danny.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.120
 Hi, Georgie.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120
 Hi, Ray Peet.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120
 Many thanks for the show.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.120
 Please keep going.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120
 I have one question.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.880
 My 10 year old daughter has hypothyroid symptoms, low energy, weight gain, digestive problems.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.480
 Her TSH is between four and five and her free T4 is around 12.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.400
 Doctors here don't test for other markers, unfortunately.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.800
 Doctor says everything is okay and no need to worry.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.320
 Do you have any suggestions what we can do?

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.840
 Preferably nutritional plus lifestyle.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.840
 Thanks again, Timo.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.840
 P.S.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.200
 I'm lucky you could take my question.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.720
 What do you think about that?

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.080
 Very important to get the TSH down.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:40.400
 TSH at that level itself is causing symptoms, pro-inflammatory symptoms and it's going to

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:50.560
 disturb her puberty development, all kinds of development and the history of that bizarre

00:19:50.560 --> 00:20:00.680
 attitude towards TSH, I think it's on my website, 50 Years of Fraud is part of the title.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:08.280
 There's just no scientific basis for relying on TSH, especially at such very high levels

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.880
 as five.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.600
 And you know, just my limited understanding of things of reading through hypothyroidism,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.360
 the unsuspected illness, like he wrote, it talks about childhood hypothyroidism and it's

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.680
 not crazy to investigate a thyroid supplement for a child, right?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.640
 Oh, not at all.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.920
 Sometimes it has started at a very young age.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:34.200
 It's increasingly important around seven or eight or nine when the first signs of puberty

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.440
 are coming on because the estrogen is going to slow down the thyroid function.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.440
 Great stuff.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.440
 Okay.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440
 This one's from JV Marketing and they say, "Hi guys.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:47.200
 I recently started taking thyroid 12.5 micrograms of T3 and 37.5 micrograms of T4.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.440
 I am day three into this and my waking temperature has been slightly lower than usual.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.040
 Is it normal for a slight dip in temperature before improvements are made?

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.840
 Could this be a nutritional deficiency?"

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:04.480
 You know, very low thyroid people will have, especially during the night, high cortisol

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.600
 and adrenaline usually.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.680
 And you should check your pulse at the same time when you wake up along with the temperature.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.920
 And then after having a breakfast with, for example, a lot of orange juice, the stress

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:25.800
 hormones are going to be decreased when you get your glucose level up.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.240
 The adrenaline goes down, the cortisol will go down.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:37.420
 Both of those have kept your temperature, both of them, and pulse rate kept up by high

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.360
 adrenaline during the night.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:48.320
 And so by which of those changes the most, you can tell what night stress was responsible

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:56.680
 for them and when you get your thyroid gradually improving your carbon dioxide production and

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:04.600
 stabilizing your glycogen stores, your nocturnal stress goes down and so you're revealing the

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:10.520
 hypothyroid condition that was hidden under the stress hormones.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:21.600
 During daytime testing, people who were very hypothyroid such as a 5 or 6 on the TSH level

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:31.400
 have been very hyper and normal seeming, not fat or edematous or sluggish or anything,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:38.840
 but they were found to have 30 to 40 times the daily output of adrenaline making up for

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.120
 the low thyroid production.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:49.680
 And so it's pretty common to have extreme slowdown when you start on your thyroid.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:57.920
 That's why it's so important to keep a chart marked off for at least 2 or 3 weeks showing

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:04.000
 your temperature and pulse rate both on the same chart so that you can draw a line and

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:11.280
 where it should with an ideal starting dose of thyroid, you should see the lines rising

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:18.000
 steadily towards the goal of pulse rate and temperature at the end of 2 or 3 weeks.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 But if at first you see the numbers going down, that's evidence that you're getting

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 out of the stress.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Great stuff.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 Thank you for that, Ray.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.640
 Okay, this one's from Jean, mega super supporter of the show and she says, "I wanted to..."

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.720
 A lot of these people are mega super supporters, "but I wanted to ask and hear more about why

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.800
 people who are vaccinated are getting colds and flus right now.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.600
 There seems to be a lot of discussion in my neighborhood that people are out sick at work

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.520
 and feeling flu/cold symptoms, even though it's extremely warm here."

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:57.680
 The purpose of any vaccine is to create a systemic inflammation and in general that

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:05.480
 weakens your overall immune system, even though it pumps up your specific antibodies, the

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:12.520
 general inflammation is a weakness at least during the time you're having symptoms and

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:19.440
 unfortunately sometimes for a much longer time such as the year after people have an

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:27.640
 influenza vaccination, their rate of coronavirus infection was greatly increased, 50% of the

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:33.240
 people were infected, 60% more likely to get infected by a different virus because they

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.240
 were protected against influenza virus.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:43.680
 So the idea, the officials actually say stupid things like, "Get vaccinated, it'll make

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.680
 you healthy."

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680
 Thanks for that.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.400
 And we'll take a break here, Ray, like, I don't know, like maybe 20 minutes or so because

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.800
 I know this, I don't want to give you like a lobotomy from just asking you a hundred

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800
 questions, but I know...

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.680
 I have a question about the vaccines.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.600
 Is there any truth to saying that basically the vaccines are sacrificing general immunity

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.560
 in order to boost specific resistance to a very specific virus while at the same time

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.920
 making you vulnerable just as you mentioned, you also mentioned influenza and corona, but

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.720
 I think this applies to any virus, right?

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.480
 If you shift the immune response, protecting from only one virus, you're exposing yourself,

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.120
 becoming more compromisable to all the other viruses.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.440
 Yeah, there were, I think, 10 studies showing that with influenza.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:34.760
 Follow up, the whole doctrine, going back to Ehrlich's time, it's a drug industry-centered

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.880
 theory of what immunity amounts to.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:46.120
 Paul Ehrlich was selling his patent drugs and he shared the Nobel Prize with Metchnikoff,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:56.760
 who was an embryologist who saw immunity as the whole organism maintaining itself, a total

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.800
 inclusive concept of what immunity or resistance is.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:09.600
 Ehrlich proposed a theory that was ideal for selling magic bullet drugs.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:17.280
 The concept of magic bullet was converted to the antibody theory of immunity that your

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:22.560
 B cells produce the specific immunity.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:30.240
 So logically, if you don't have a specific drug for every conceivable disease, then you're

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:40.080
 going to need a vaccine for every existing or possible disease because the antibody theory

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:46.840
 of immunity is really just a silver bullet, one drug to sell for one disease.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840
 Great stuff.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.880
 Okay, this one's from James B. and he says, "Question," okay, this kind of trends on the

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.200
 first question we talked about.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.440
 He says, "Question, if your lab rat was supplementing with pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHE,

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:02.320
 and you had the task of building the most amount of muscle while somewhat preserving

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.520
 your health, could you outline a potential stack you would use?

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.840
 I was thinking about 50 milligrams of testosterone base along with 25 milligrams of masteron.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:16.600
 I know these aren't hepatoxic, but would you dissolve these in tocopherol and take sublingually

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.520
 before swallowing for maximal effect?

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520
 P.S.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.360
 Your thoughts on low-dose trenbolone base?"

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:29.920
 Even with natural testosterone, I think people are generally getting overdosed.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:36.400
 Very healthy, very young man might produce four or five milligrams of testosterone per

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:44.520
 day and so one or two milligrams well-assimilated should give you a tremendous boost of virility

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.640
 and muscle strength.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:57.280
 And with DHEA, the teenage production is 12 to 15 milligrams and so it goes steadily down

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.680
 with aging similar to testosterone.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:07.800
 But by the time a person is 30 or 40, five milligrams will still bring them up to a normal

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.800
 level of DHEA.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:18.280
 And the others, the overdose is apparently the desired state.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.680
 I have a question about the amounts of steroids.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.560
 Yes, a younger, young, virile man will produce four to five milligrams of testosterone, but

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.800
 they also clear estrogen much more effectively than an older person.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.720
 So their testosterone to estrogen ratio or testosterone to cortisol ratio is pretty high.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:41.640
 An older person basically tends to be overloaded with both estrogen and cortisol while having

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.440
 their testosterone levels.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.440
 So the four to five milligrams, yes, they will potentially bring up the testosterone

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.560
 levels up to the levels of a young, virile man, but they won't necessarily fix the issue

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.360
 with the high estrogen and high cortisol.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:59.320
 So that person may not be necessarily feeling the same anabolic or mood boosting or whatnot

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.040
 effects that a younger person would get from such a dosage simply because their stress

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.680
 hormones are too high.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.880
 And I think that may be why older people and bodybuilders in general, they're overdosing

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:14.640
 these steroids simply because they're not addressing the thyroid angle and they're trying

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.480
 to shut down their stress hormones by simply over flooding them and overcrowding them with

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.200
 these androgens.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.360
 That's why that may be one reason why they're using such high doses.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.200
 For several reasons, thyroid is our basic anabolic hormone.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:38.040
 It directly activates protein synthesis, lowers cortisol and the breakdown of protein and

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:45.160
 inhibits the effect of cortisol and inflammatory things on aromatase.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.840
 It's an aromatase and cortisol antagonist.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:55.680
 So basically an anabolic approach with steroids should always take into account thyroid, right?

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.080
 Or at least some other option of blocking cortisol in a safe manner.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.760
 Yeah, as a basic anabolic substance.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:13.000
 The muscles, if they're under stress or in forced idleness, will cause the muscle to

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.880
 actually produce and secrete cortisol and estrogen.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:26.600
 And when they're properly activated with thyroid and activity, they will be a source of testosterone

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.560
 and a sink for cortisol.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.040
 Okay, great stuff.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040
 Thanks for that guys.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.160
 Okay, so this one's from Craig.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.640
 He says, "Craig Doe, I've been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea induced by arterial

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.960
 fibrillation.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.120
 I'm on meds that make me feel terrible.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.200
 Tried cardioversion, didn't work.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.780
 I'm 53 fit.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:47.780
 Use a CPAP.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.440
 Any ideas how to get off meds?

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.480
 Thank you."

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:59.000
 People who are using CPAP are almost always hypothyroid and low in progesterone.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:09.200
 For many years, they've been curing sleep apnea with prothyroid things and progesterone.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:17.360
 Progesterone lowers the stress hormones, improves the depth of sleep and maintains regular breathing

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.480
 and prevents hyperventilation.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:29.520
 The real problem in sleep apnea is cyclic hyperventilation followed by cessation.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:39.440
 When you go deficient in carbon dioxide, your breathing stops and you could even die from

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.760
 respiratory arrest if you are producing so little carbon dioxide.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:50.480
 So thyroid and progesterone directly corrects the problem.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:59.120
 Acetazolamide has been used, I think, for 50 or 60 years to treat sleep apnea and it

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:05.400
 indirectly raises your carbon dioxide level and keeps stimulating your breathing through

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.400
 the night.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.400
 Amazing.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400
 Thank you for that, Ray.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400
 This next one's from-

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.400
 I have something to add.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.080
 Most drugs on the market currently for AFib, which is the common name for atrial fibrillation,

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080
 are blood thinners.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.680
 And the flagship drug known as Xarelto was approved by the FDA with the FDA's knowledge

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.920
 that the clinical trials conducted in Mexico and other Latin American countries were 100%

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.920
 fraudulent.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.600
 There's a famous article by the Slate magazine, which came out in, I think it was 2016 or

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:37.680
 '17, where they did an exposé of how FDA knew that the trials were fraudulent, not

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.480
 simply deficient, but fraudulent.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.880
 Data was made up to support the approval of the drug.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:49.040
 And when Slate and other journalists tried to contact FDA, basically FDA refused to comment

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.000
 on it and threatened the journalists that they will sue them and impose a gag order

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.600
 if they continue walking around and talking how Xarelto is a dangerous, potentially murderous

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 drug.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.800
 So I would try to get off that drug because there are many other safer blood thinners.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:08.240
 A subsequent trial was done outside of the United States, I forgot where, but it compared

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.720
 aspirin to Xarelto and found aspirin to be more effective and safer.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:18.000
 So I think Xarelto may be causing a lot of these problems, especially with the lowering

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.360
 of carbon dioxide.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.680
 It's really not a safe drug.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.040
 Wait, you're saying the pharmaceutical companies are corrupt, Georgie?

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.720
 I'm saying the FDA is corrupt.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.720
 Okay.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.720
 I had never heard that before.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.720
 Okay.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720
 That is wild.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.720
 Okay.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.720
 Thank you for that, Georgie.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720
 Thank you, Ray.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.720
 Where was I?

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.720
 Okay.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.720
 Okay.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.720
 This was from Mohammed and he says, "Question for Dr. Ray Peet.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.840
 My mom is borderline diabetic, removed thyroid, and has pain in her feet that bothers her

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840
 a lot.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840
 What can she do to treat this?"

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.360
 What was her thyroid condition?

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.520
 I think she had it removed, he said.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:56.040
 Oh, well, the doctors likely prescribe thyroxine, and in women, thyroxine fails to be activated

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:04.000
 properly because of estrogen interfering with liver function, which should account for about

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.880
 two thirds of your active thyroid function.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:13.880
 So for most women, thyroxine being what doctors like to prescribe just isn't correcting the

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.880
 problem.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:22.080
 And so getting on a real thyroid supplement is essential when you've had the gland removed.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.560
 And maybe you feel confident in ARMR in the US right now?

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:31.000
 I haven't tried any ARMR in recent years, but I haven't heard any new bad things about

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 it.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.320
 For several years, they were going back and forth, failing FDA tests and so on.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.720
 But for several years now, I haven't heard bad things about it.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:44.720
 So it's the only glandular right now that I would trust.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:54.560
 But during the time that ARMR was being reformulated in the early '90s, I shifted to the synthetics.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:02.800
 First, Thyrol-R formulated by ARMR to exactly imitate natural ARMR thyroid, and then Sinoplus,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:10.280
 which exactly imitated the Thyrol-R formula, and made by the same company that makes Sino-Mal

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.360
 or Pure T3.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:18.320
 And so those have been very reliable now for at least 30 years.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.320
 Thank you for that.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.320
 Amazing stuff.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.140
 Okay, we're coming up on 45 minutes or so.

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140
 Thank you, Ray.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.140
 Thank you, Georgie.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.280
 I sincerely appreciate you guys making this show possible.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.560
 Harrison, huge, gigantic donation.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.180
 Thank you so much, Harrison.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.180
 Thank you.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.180
 Thank you for making all this possible.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.840
 Matthew T., also another extremely generous donation.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840
 Thank you, guys.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.040
 And then we'll move on to these super chats.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.120
 Maybe we'll take a quick break here, Ray.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.600
 And maybe we can talk about Progest-E, just a millisecond.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:53.440
 So 3,400 milligrams of progesterone per bottle dissolved in vitamin E. You can email Keenogen@gmail.com,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.440
 aka Catherine.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:56.440
 And you can...

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.440
 She'll ship it extremely fast.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.360
 She just shipped me 12 bottles of it.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.360
 It's sitting in my refrigerator right now.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.640
 And Ray, do you want to dip into your gigantic bag of positive progesterone stories and say

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640
 anything about it?

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.640
 Oh, no.

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.400
 Nothing occurs to me right now.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.400
 Okay.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.440
 One thing you said on the vitamin D with Kate Dearing and Kitty was you didn't really think

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.520
 of it like a hormone.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.400
 It's just this generalized stabilizing factor in cells.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.440
 And so I think you've said that before, but that resonated when you talked about it.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.040
 That was like a...

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:35.240
 The brain is a major source and goal of progesterone.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:40.000
 And men have just as much in their brain, or should, as women.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:48.880
 And it's involved in the cell division process all the way up to nerve and muscle function.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.880
 Every conceivable thing in higher animals depends on progesterone.

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.880
 Great stuff.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.880
 Thank you for that.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.560
 And if you're at gmail.com, you can message Catherine and she's very nice and she'll send

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.160
 out the progesterone very quickly.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.600
 So thanks to Catherine.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600
 Thanks to Keenogen.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.600
 Okay.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.780
 Nick P174 just donates $10.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:07.780
 Thank you for that, Nick.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:13.640
 Rising Stronger for 999 says, "For Dr. Pete, I've heard you mention milk and fruit as the

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.880
 cosmic diet and wonder if there is an ethical component to how you view and structure your

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.880
 nutrition.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880
 Thanks to the three of you."

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.880
 Yeah.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.640
 It has to do with cosmic entropy, actually.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:41.200
 It's why the whole energy concept of existence involves the cephalization process in all

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.680
 animate beings.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:52.880
 And you can trace those processes of increasing consciousness and brain development through

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.440
 the physics of the universe.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:01.200
 It all has to do with creating order, maintaining order.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:12.880
 And it happens that milk and fruits are the simplest and most order-preserving way to

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.160
 integrate your life with the cosmos.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160
 I love it.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.160
 Thanks for that, Ray.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160
 Okay.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.160
 This one's from Umar.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:24.160
 And they say, "Does a benign tumor have a similar metabolism to a cancerous one?

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:30.880
 I have had a benign osteochondrodroma on my upper femur since childhood.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.960
 What ways/supplementing can help in removing it?"

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960
 Thank you all.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:41.640
 If it's quiescent, not inflamed or growing, no, it doesn't have the cancer metabolism.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.640
 It's just a structural defect.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:51.680
 But any inflammation, according to the degree of the inflammation, is going to start having

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.680
 the cancer metabolism.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680
 Great stuff.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.680
 Thanks.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:59.920
 I wanted to mention rubbing progesterone on it, since it's simply a fibrotic structure,

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.600
 may help a lot.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.420
 There's some older studies that seem to have stopped around the '70s that kept calling

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.120
 progesterone the most potent anti-fibrotic chemical known to man.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120
 And they suddenly stopped.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.120
 I guess the pharmaceutical industry got involved.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:17.160
 But they had success in animal studies by applying progesterone topically or subcutaneously

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:23.760
 and managing to dissolve multiple metastases of much worse and malignant tumors.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:29.200
 So I don't see a reason why it couldn't be applied in this case as well.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.600
 The anti-fibrotic effect, I've seen examples of hundreds of times.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:42.320
 I think the reason they stopped talking about that effect is that the mechanism involves

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:49.880
 interfering with estrogen's pro-fibrotic effect, activating nitric oxide and serotonin.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:58.080
 That group of inflammatory things, estrogen, nitric oxide, and serotonin, are all blocked

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.000
 by progesterone.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.480
 And those are the pro-degenerative, pro-fibrotic substances.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.480
 Great stuff.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.480
 Thanks for that, guys.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.480
 This one's from James.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.960
 "Guys, I've had man boobs for years, which recently developed into gynecomastia, but

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.400
 only on my left breast.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.040
 Is there a way to reverse this?"

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040
 Thank you.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:25.040
 Just today I got an email saying that his chest fat and gynecomastia regressed thoroughly

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.200
 from taking quite a bit of progesterone.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:36.200
 But I think it's essential to use vitamin D and thyroid and all of the anti-aromatase

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:41.480
 substances, including some aspirin, to keep it under control.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.480
 Amazing.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.480
 Great stuff.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.480
 This one's from another James.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:49.120
 They say, "When approximately did the United States transform from a constitutional republic

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:53.760
 into an empire, or was the USA always set up to be one from the beginning?"

00:40:53.760 --> 00:41:00.960
 Well, the spreading from the colonies across the continent, taking the Western United States

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:08.520
 away from Mexico and then following that up with war against Spain to take the Philippines

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:17.640
 and Cuba, the imperial mentality goes back right almost to the beginning.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:30.160
 But the 20th century has been steady imperialism with the banana republics being kept in line

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:38.920
 with sending battleships every year so they would threaten another country in the hemisphere.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:46.600
 And there was a temporary let up with FDR's good neighbor policy, or as good as we are.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.600
 Ray, are you still there?

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.600
 I just actually—

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.600
 Yeah, he's there.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.600
 Okay, I just lost everything.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.600
 Okay, we're back.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.600
 Sorry about that.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:54.600
 Go ahead, Ray.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.600
 Sorry.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:02.280
 Well, it has just grown in its intensity.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:09.720
 Starting right at FDR's death, policies were absolutely 180 degrees reversed where he had

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.040
 planned a post-war anti-imperialist policy.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.520
 He had a conference with Wendell Wilkie.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:27.080
 They agreed that whichever party won after his term was up would follow the decolonization

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.320
 anti-imperialist world policy.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:38.160
 But it happens that Wilkie got a cold and died at a very young age.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.960
 And then just before Roosevelt could find out that Alan Dulles was committing treason

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:55.160
 and outlying himself with the German intelligence, Galen system, to take over the world, Roosevelt

00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:00.400
 died just before he could learn that fact.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:08.360
 And so immediately with his death, the Dulles faction took over with a single-minded imperialism

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.000
 that had been followed steadily.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
 Great stuff.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.920
 I'm getting told that the audio is a little bit wonky, but I guess we're just going to

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.920
 have to keep going here.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.920
 I don't know what's wrong.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.120
 This is why we're trying to buy new equipment.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.720
 Okay.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.720
 Where was I here?

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:25.720
 Okay.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:31.640
 Nick says, "Hey guys, say a guy lost the ability to ejaculate and then also slowly over a period

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.200
 of a couple of years was also basically unable to get an erection.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.200
 What things would be the most important to look into?"

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:44.320
 Doing blood tests would be very useful to see what your cortisol and estrogen, DHEA,

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.120
 testosterone and thyroid and testosterone are doing.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.120
 Great.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:54.720
 Yeah, I want to add to that that sometimes doctors will just test the testosterone, but

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:59.040
 several large human studies show that you can have erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:04.840
 problems and fertility problems, even in men with normal levels of testosterone and DHEA,

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.640
 as long as either prolactin or estradiol are either elevated or in the top 25th percentile

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.280
 of the "normal" range, which we know it's not really normal.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:15.280
 Great stuff, guys.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.280
 Thank you.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.280
 Okay.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:23.480
 This one's another from Nick and he says, "My heart rate is in the low 50s while sitting,

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.040
 but while standing and also resting, it's in the 80s.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.840
 Should the sitting be close to the 80s causes?"

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:32.480
 I think it should be higher than that, unless there's some reason.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:40.800
 If you have a really big heart, it can pump a lot of blood with pulses as low as 50, but

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:47.320
 ordinarily you aren't pumping enough blood to keep things in very good health if it's

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.320
 running that slow.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.480
 And that would just be a general sign of hypothyroidism?

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.480
 I think so.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.480
 Great stuff.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:58.280
 Okay, Space 99 Yak says, "Is the herb Boutilla Superba Root good for DHT?"

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.840
 I've never heard of it.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.840
 Any thoughts, Dr. Ray?

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.840
 I'd have to look it up.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840
 I mean, I don't know.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:07.200
 I've heard of the herb, but I don't know through what mechanism it would be good for

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200
 DHT.

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.920
 I know nettle root is actually a drug in Germany and they're using it to treat prostate problems.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.120
 And they kept saying for years that, "Oh, it's because it lowers the androgens."

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:22.260
 And then it turned out it actually contains aromatase inhibitors and is raising DHT instead

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.260
 of lowering it.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.260
 Great stuff.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.260
 Okay.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:29.800
 This one's from Gaza Mongo and they say, "Can the thyroid be damaged with exogenous T3?

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.880
 Is the feedback loop shutting the thyroid down activated by a certain amount daily or

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880
 per dose?

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.360
 I.e., could small doses be additive rather than a replacement?"

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:46.400
 If you get as much thyroid function as you need, the gland should adjust itself.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:55.560
 It's always responsive to signals such as adrenaline and TSH.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:46:02.760
 You can shut the TSH down completely and then if you stop shutting it down with the large

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.720
 doses, it pops back very quickly.

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:13.120
 I've seen my own thyroid gland when I was taking 50 micrograms of T3 per day.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:20.440
 I developed holes about as big as my index finger on each side of my Adam's apple between

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:23.320
 that and the muscles.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:31.920
 And so I stopped taking the T3 for just a day or two and immediately within 24 hours,

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.280
 my neck had leveled out.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.880
 The gland swells and shrinks according to need.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:48.160
 So a lot of doctors will talk about suppressing or damaging your thyroid gland by supplementing

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:55.720
 because their reasoning from what happens to your adrenals or testicles if you overdose

00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:06.200
 on one of the hormones, high cortisol or glucocorticoid use can cause your adrenals to shrink to

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:13.960
 the point that if you suddenly stop the supplement, you might die from the absence of adrenal

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:14.960
 production.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:23.040
 But the adrenals will gradually over about a month recover if you are well nourished

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:27.840
 after you've totally suppressed them with too much cortisol.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.840
 The thyroid gland only takes a day or so to completely recover.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.840
 Thanks for that, Ray.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.840
 Kana?

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.200
 I have a question about pregnenolone and the adrenals.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.160
 As you know, Ray, the older studies in the early 20th century showed that when you give

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:46.880
 people under stress pregnenolone, it decreases their output of 17 ketosteroids.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.920
 Isn't that a sign of potential partial adrenal suppression by pregnenolone or is it simply

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:51.920
 giving them a break?

00:47:51.920 --> 00:48:01.520
 I think it's applying whatever function they were producing so they aren't needed.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:09.080
 In the study of rats, they measured their cortisol production and other hormones and

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.080
 found a normal variation.

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.080
 Most of them were normal.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:21.200
 A few were hyperproducers of cortisol but they gave them, I think it was 10 grams of

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:29.880
 injected, a stomach full of powdered pregnenolone and then studied their hormones.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.360
 There were no endocrine changes that they could detect except in those which had been

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.000
 under stress with high cortisol production.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.960
 Their cortisol went down to normal receiving those gigantic doses of pregnenolone.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:49.000
 So the person basically that's under a lot of stress, pregnenolone, doesn't just have

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.960
 an anti-cortisol effect but it also gives the adrenals what they need, gives the adrenals

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.680
 a break, I guess for lack of a better word.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:02.440
 Yeah, the adrenals and gonads are potentially self-regulating.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:07.520
 The pituitary is just there for an additional boost.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:17.360
 When Han Selye was experimenting with removing adrenals, he found that after the tissue-stored

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:24.840
 steroids had dissipated, just a moderate amount of stress would kill the animals because they

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:34.160
 didn't have the adrenal resilience to meet the stress where the ordinary rat would die

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.560
 from a little bit of a stressful situation.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:47.280
 He noticed that the pregnant rats didn't even notice, had no ill effects from an increased

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:56.120
 adaptive stress and so he experimented removing the adrenals and supplementing progesterone

00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:03.080
 and they lived a normal lifespan with no adrenal hormones at all.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:12.080
 Progesterone supplement totally replaced all of the adrenal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.000
 in particular.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.200
 Have you seen any studies that discuss the effects of pregnenolone specifically on the

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200
 pituitary?

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.400
 I know there are a lot of studies by Selye and others.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:28.520
 Only that old 1950s study in which cortisol was corrected.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.040
 So you think pregnenolone does have a direct effect on the pituitary?

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:40.560
 Yeah, the same way that any anti-stress substance, progesterone or sugar or aspirin for example

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.480
 will stop the exaggerated pituitary activity.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.480
 Great stuff, thanks for that guys.

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:49.440
 Okay, this one's from Joshua and he says, "My wife is 24 years old experiencing low

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.500
 libido and hot flashes after having our second child.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.840
 What can be done to bring her sex drive and energy back?"

00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:02.400
 Generally, thyroid is the thing that you have to check the whole nutritional pattern.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:10.280
 Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D interferes with your mitochondrial energy production

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.840
 regardless of your thyroid status.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:21.280
 So drinking milk, taking vitamin D, drinking orange juice and maybe supplementing thyroid

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.160
 would be the usual thing to do.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.160
 Thanks for that, Ray.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.840
 This is from Kana for 2,440 yen and she provides a sticker and I can't really tell what's

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.840
 going on there.

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.520
 Thank you for that, Kana.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.520
 No question there.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:41.720
 Okay, so Space 99 Yak says, "Your thoughts on how to reverse the aging process and increase

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:42.720
 health span.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.340
 The basics and advanced stuff that you might not talk about as much."

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:53.720
 Carbon dioxide, very important for stopping the stress and degenerative processes and

00:51:53.720 --> 00:52:02.600
 vitamin D, calcium and thyroid and progesterone are part of their function is to normalize,

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.360
 optimize the balance between carbon dioxide and lactic acid.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.080
 I have a question about carbon dioxide.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:14.880
 You talk about in your articles, it's actually a Lewis acid and you also talk about partial

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.040
 oxidation, putting the cell in an oxidized state.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.120
 It has a structure similar to the quinones.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.360
 It's much simpler but it does have those two carbonyl groups.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:29.120
 I'm not aware of any direct reaction in the organism where carbon dioxide actually directly

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.680
 takes an electron and becomes reduced in the process.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:36.720
 How does its electron withdrawing function work in the organism?

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:45.720
 The inductive effect, wherever it's attracted to an electron rich area, those electrons

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:54.440
 sort of bulge towards the Lewis acid that has an electron attracting effect.

00:52:54.440 --> 00:53:04.040
 The bulging of those electrons by induction through the carbon chain reduces the electron

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.560
 availability two or three carbons down the line.

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:19.200
 The whole electronic quality of the whole protein molecule is affected in a shift towards

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:24.440
 positivity or relative electron deficiency.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:32.280
 When you're full of CO2, all of your proteins have that shift and the flavonoids from orange

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:43.440
 juice and milk and lots of fruits and vegetables, they can, by partial oxidation, like vitamin

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:50.680
 C inside the cell, becomes oxidized and then becomes an electron recipient.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:58.960
 The flavonoids become similar electron attractors and shift the whole structure of the cell

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:05.160
 into that relatively partial electron deficient state.

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:12.920
 That affects, through the inductive effect, one protein has its influence on surrounding

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.920
 proteins.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:23.800
 So the whole system is a cooperative electron slightly deficient condition, an acidic condition.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.360
 In other words, the whole cell turns into an acid.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:33.800
 So a more specific example, let's say you have a molecule of NADH, the reduced version

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.560
 of NAD, it's the electron carrier.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.760
 So the presence of high amounts of carbon dioxide, would they be able to directly oxidize

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:44.480
 NADH back into NAD or would they have a more indirect effect?

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:53.000
 Indirect, shifting the whole system, activating the electron transport chain, turning off

00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:00.760
 lactic acid production, shifting the balances everywhere towards reducing lactic acid and

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:07.840
 NADH and glutathione, shifting it towards the oxidized balance.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:12.160
 And the flavonoids, looking at their structure, they actually are capable of becoming fully

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.680
 electron withdrawing agents, right?

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.280
 They will actually be able to oxidize the NADH back to NAD.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:22.960
 Yeah, that seems to be why things like fisetin have an anti-aging effect.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:30.480
 They turn off the inflammation and stress excess of electron production.

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:37.560
 And one of the ways you have to think about it is that this isn't a static condition,

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.480
 it's a pressure of electrons flowing.

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:49.240
 There are electrons in motion between the energy source and the electron consuming cytochrome

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.240
 oxidase.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:59.320
 So if you think of the Venturi effect in gas or water, the pressure goes down as the speed

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.640
 of flow increases.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:11.160
 And so what thyroid and these pro-oxidative substances do is to accelerate the flow of

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:18.600
 electrons, decreasing the risk of random lipid proxidation by escaped electrons because

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:23.080
 as the flow increases, the pressure, electronic pressure decreases.

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.840
 So the whole cell becomes shifted away from electrons towards oxidation.

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:33.640
 So in theory, combining carbon dioxide, whether, I mean, raising carbon dioxide and having

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.800
 the presence of these direct electron withdrawing agents would be even more therapeutic.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:46.520
 Yeah, so I don't think anyone knows what the upper limit of oxygen consumption is, but

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:56.040
 health and longevity, as far as anyone has tested, will increase as that flow rate increases.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.720
 Have you seen that recent study on fisetin being a very effective senolytic, I think

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.360
 is the word, senolytic chemical?

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.720
 Yeah, I think it's more than that.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:12.400
 I think it can actually correct the inflammatory process and not have to kill the cells.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:17.400
 Do you think things like naringenin, apigenin, other similar flavonoids would have similar

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.400
 effect?

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.960
 Yeah, a lot of them have been tested, for example, for preventing or treating radiation

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:30.320
 sickness, the ultimate in electron excess disease.

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:35.800
 And they're very powerful in protecting against or curing radiation injury.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.040
 So it sounds like a glass of orange juice and a little bit of vitamin B1 would be a

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:43.120
 great combination as an anti-aging agent.

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:47.160
 Yeah, probably every few minutes a glass of orange juice.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.160
 Great stuff.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.160
 Thanks for that, guys.

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.600
 Okay, Space99Yak, or you know what, there's another one about ivermectin.

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:56.240
 We kind of already talked about that, but they say, "Can ivermectin help protect against

00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:01.200
 the harms of the spike proteins modified by the AstraZeneca DNA vaccine by occupying spike

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:04.200
 protein receptors?"

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:10.080
 I don't know if that connects between ivermectin and the receptors.

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.520
 We said earlier that was a risky substance, and so it's like combining two risky substances

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.880
 together, basically.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:21.160
 I think a safer method would be trying to raise the levels of the ACE2 enzyme, because

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.720
 that's what the spike protein binds to, if I'm not mistaken.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:32.920
 Right, that's the medical establishment got it exactly backward, and the things that increase

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:44.160
 the ACE2 substance and the 1-7-antitransfer fragment, which is the result of ACE2 action.

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:51.080
 Those are increasingly recognized as the therapeutic and curative agents.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:58.160
 And so everything that we know of as protective against COVID involves the increase of the

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.440
 1-7-antitransfer and the ACE2 enzyme that produces it.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:07.360
 I found a very interesting study showing that progesterone directly increases, and quite

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:12.200
 dramatically, the levels of ACE2, while at the same time lowering the amount of ACE.

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.520
 So it should have like a double punch effect, like protecting both from COVID and potentially

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.520
 the spike protein.

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:23.160
 Of course, there are many other bad things in the vaccine, but I think progesterone seems

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.120
 promising based on that study for protection against at least the virus.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.240
 Yeah, and it's safe to use all the time, preventively.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.240
 Do you think it may help?

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.280
 I mean, I know there are studies about progesterone and influenza.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.200
 Have you seen any studies about progesterone and other viral particles?

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:47.960
 Yeah, it actually has some antiviral or anti-replication effects, stabilizing the cell, makes the virus

00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.000
 not have any support for replicating.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
 Thanks for that.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.880
 Okay, Space 99 Yak says, "Any way of getting rid of acne scars?"

00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:06.080
 Depends on the scars, like if it's still inflamed, sort of like a slight keloid, vitamin E and

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.840
 progesterone applied to it can shut off the production of inflammatory things like estrogen

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:20.080
 and nitric oxide and restore the tissue to more or less normal so it loses the inflamed

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.080
 appearance.

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.200
 I have another thing to add.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.200
 There's a human study showing that a 4% niacinamide solution, separate studies actually, one used

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.000
 4% niacinamide solution in water.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.440
 The other one used 1% aspirin solution in water.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.960
 Both of these help to reduce the formation of scars, even in severe acne.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.920
 I think combining them into one solution, 4% and 1% would probably work even better.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.920
 Great stuff.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:50.260
 Okay, this is from Ellie and they say, "Morning temps not budging, but day temps improves

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.260
 on thyroid."

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.260
 Why?

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.240
 Morning temps not budging, but day temps improves on thyroid.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.840
 So they're taking thyroid, they're...

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:56.840
 Go ahead.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.840
 That's pretty good.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:03.480
 While you're lying in bed, hypothyroidism isn't doing so much damage.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:08.640
 So the important thing is to keep the numbers optimal and steady during the daytime.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640
 Thanks for that.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640
 Thanks Ellie.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.640
 Thanks Ray.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.640
 Janet Pack, again, another...

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.480
 A lot of these people are chronic supporters of the show, but she just sent a sticker for

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480
 $50.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480
 Thank you so much, Janet.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.840
 DBO514 for $10 says, "Get yourself some gear, son."

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.840
 Thank you so much, DBO514.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:28.280
 Kirk says, "What's the best strategy for someone with diabetes with swollen purple legs and

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.960
 significant water retention?"

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.960
 Thank you all.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:38.000
 I would start with vitamin D, getting adequate calcium, normalizing thyroid progesterone

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
 and pregnenolone.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:49.720
 And then when you get your metabolism steady and some of the edema reduced, then shifting

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:58.320
 the diet chronically, probably decreasing total protein somewhat to keep your total

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.200
 fat intake lower.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:09.680
 Any kind of reliance on fat for energy is going to interfere with your sugar use and

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:17.920
 the thyroid and calcium and vitamin D are going to help restore your ability to oxidize

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920
 glucose.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.920
 Thanks Kirk.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.920
 Thanks Ray.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.200
 Teresa and Diana both sent super chats, but no questions.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.200
 Thank you, Diana.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.200
 Thank you, Teresa.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:27.200
 Another one from Space Jack.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.240
 They say, "Best med/supplements to increase mitochondria and mitochondrial function."

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:36.200
 Carbon dioxide is essential and very powerful for that.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:42.680
 And so all of the things that support oxidative metabolism are going to shift you towards

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.880
 the better supply of carbon dioxide.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:54.360
 And the antitension inhibitors are starting to be recognized as supporting mitochondrial

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.120
 energy production, reducing inflammation and degeneration.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.320
 So the boutique supplement of breathing into a bag.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
 Yeah.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320
 Okay.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.680
 Kirk has another question here.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:12.600
 He says, "My 67 year old mother has one 1.2 centimeter nodule on her thyroid.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.040
 Her TSH is 2.5, free T4 1.0.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:23.100
 However, her TPOAB is 32.9 IU/ML, which is well beyond the 5.5 limit.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.160
 What would you suggest to correct the nodule?"

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.160
 Thank you.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160
 Which one was high?

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.800
 TPOAB, thyroid peroxidase.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800
 Is that what it is?

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800
 TPOAB, 32.9.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:40.960
 Oh, correcting the, getting the TSH down to something like 0.4 would be tremendously helpful.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.960
 Thanks, Kirk.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.780
 Cornelius says, "Any thoughts on how to treat excess saliva?

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.280
 It happens whenever I eat, I get massive excess saliva.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.480
 Foods high in choline, eggs, et cetera, are a lot worse, I think.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.520
 It is a cholinergic crisis."

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:02.160
 Often getting your thyroid going helps to shift your balance towards sympathetic adrenaline

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.240
 activity and suppress the parasympathetic.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.240
 Thanks for that, Cornelius.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.240
 Thanks, Ray.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:14.880
 Zachary says, "16 year old, breast cancer, received radiation, had a lupine, lumpenectomy,

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:20.160
 had a couple, had a couple lump scars since now, lump scars since.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.480
 Now 19, what remedies would you recommend to help prevent it coming back?"

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:25.480
 Lower estrogen/corazole?

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.480
 Sure.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:37.720
 Thyroid, vitamin D, and aspirin are very powerful protectants against estrogen and cancer development.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:38.720
 Thanks for that, Zachary.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:39.720
 Thanks, Ray.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720
 Cornelius has another one.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.200
 He says, "Does Ray have any thoughts as to why taking supplemental T3 may cause a negative

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.080
 change in body odor?"

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.080
 Negative being worsening?

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.640
 That's what I assume.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.600
 Yeah, it can increase your sweat production.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:05:04.440
 Just taking one or two showers with 10% sulfur soap can eliminate permanently a bad balance

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:13.000
 of bacteria on your skin and can make a difference in the odor of your body, the sweat for a

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
 long time.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
 Thanks, Cornelius.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.040
 David says, "What are your opinions on nicotine as a pro-metabolic substance and is there

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.760
 some overlap with nicotinamide?"

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:28.680
 No, I don't think there's any overlap that I've ever run across.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.680
 What about you, Georgi?

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.520
 Do you know of any overlap?

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.680
 I don't know of any overlap.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:38.320
 I think there is some evidence that nicotine in low-dose, well, actually, there's some

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.420
 studies showing that it's a powerful aromatase inhibitor and there's some other components

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:47.320
 of tobacco leaves such as cotinine, which is structurally similar to nicotine, but they

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:53.280
 all seem to activate the adrenergic, the sympathetic system when overdone.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.440
 The animal studies that I've seen that showed protection for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:02.800
 disease, heart disease, and cancers, they use the equivalent of one to two milligrams

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.560
 daily, which is half a cigarette.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.720
 I think most people that use the nicotine gums or the patches, they consume drastically

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.280
 more and it becomes very quickly becomes a stress agent.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.840
 At least that's what I've seen.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:20.200
 On the excess saliva question, I should have mentioned that the things that promote the

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:30.680
 sympathetic system, such as atropine or even the anticholinergic effects of ciproheptadine

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.840
 and the antihistamines are likely to help.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.840
 Great stuff.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:35.840
 Thanks for that, guys.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.840
 Awesome.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.800
 Okay, Victoria says, "How do I lengthen my menstrual cycle, both follicular and luteal

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.800
 phase?

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:47.600
 I'm 26 years old and my cycle ranges from 23 to 29 days with 26 being the average."

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:56.840
 That seems close enough, but increasing the thyroid level will lower the estrogen and

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:01.640
 sometimes that will make it click into a very standard 28-day cycle.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:09.600
 I've never seen any bad effects associated with a variation of only 26 to 29 days.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.600
 Great stuff.

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.600
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:15.560
 Okay, our buddy Comrade James for $30, "US, but no question."

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.400
 Thank you, Comrade James.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:23.440
 Francis Bacon Cheeseburger says, "Recommendations for daily progesterone routine for a male

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.500
 in their 30s?"

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:32.020
 If you don't have any symptoms, I think just a drop or two of progesterone or maybe 5 milligrams

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:38.140
 has a probably protective general stamina increasing effect.

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:42.740
 We get a lot of people saying they're taking, men taking 20, 30 milligrams, you know, like

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.940
 in they seem to be doing really well on it and that seems to be some, George and I are

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.340
 both constantly inundated with that anecdote.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.540
 So that is very interesting.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:08:00.380
 Yes, sometimes that's enough to shrink a man's penis temporarily, but for others, because

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:06.540
 it inhibits conversion of testosterone to estrogen, sometimes it's powerfully libido

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:11.340
 promoting pro-testosterone, but it's very individual.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.580
 I get emails all the time from men over 50 saying that they're using 100 milligrams from

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:22.020
 progesterone and they recovered their morning erections, which they had lost like 20 years

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.020
 ago.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.020
 Very good.

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:25.020
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.340
 And thank you, Francis Bacon Cheeseburger.

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.020
 Okay, I think that's the same question we already talked about with James.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:36.220
 Zach says, "Do people typically experience negative symptoms during the process of reducing

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:41.820
 endotoxin, cortisol, serotonin, or estrogen, i.e. getting worse before they get better?"

01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:43.700
 I always doubted that.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.460
 That's an old medical trick.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:54.420
 I give you my personally compounded drug and you get very sick.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:57.380
 That's evidence that it's curing you.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.820
 When you get sick after a vaccine, that's evidence that it's working, they are saying

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:02.820
 now.

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:10.100
 But that's been a constant, centuries-old ploy of the medical industry to say you have

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.740
 to get worse before you get better.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:15.860
 Yeah, when they cut, burn, or poison you, you're going to get worse first.

01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:19.460
 Or at least they're saying, "Look, we actually gave you something that does have an effect.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.460
 It's not a placebo."

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.700
 Isn't there like a name for this?

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.700
 I think it's called like a Hertzheimer reaction or something like that?

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:34.380
 Yeah, that's basically the same thing, a medical invention to defend the harm they do.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.100
 So the heroic therapy for cancer is basically an extreme version of that.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.300
 They kill you in order to save you.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:51.500
 Yeah, the statistics show that the survival rate has never been improved by surgery, radiation,

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.900
 or chemotherapy as a whole.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:57.860
 Individual studies are constantly showing it.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:05.380
 But if you added up the thousands of individual evidence of benefit, it would be very strange

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:11.780
 that on the whole population you see, if anything, a slightly worsening of the outcome.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:15.180
 I'm just refreshing my page here so I can get more of the super chats.

01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:19.340
 Who was the guy, Harry Rubin, Henry Rubin, the guy that went across the world and he

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:24.620
 found that treating cancer was of no value at all, at least by standard medical procedures?

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:33.180
 Yeah, I was at a seminar, 1969 I think, a world conference on the immune system.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:42.420
 He and a beginning Oregon instructor in biology were the only truth-oriented people there.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:47.180
 All of the big shots from around the world were there and they were all doing their phony

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:48.180
 thing.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:55.700
 And Harry Rubin and this young professor, no one listened to them very much, but they

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:07.820
 actually had facts and supported evidence and interesting stories that showed the falseness

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:11.580
 of what all of the immunologists were doing.

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.580
 Amazing.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.380
 We have about 30 more minutes here, so we'll rush through these, not rush through, we'll

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.460
 try to get through as many questions as possible.

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:19.900
 Ray, Pete, thank you so much for doing this.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:20.900
 Sincerely appreciate it.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.740
 Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much for being my partner in crime and always doing all of

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.260
 these and making the show what it is.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.780
 So thank you to both of you guys.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:32.220
 Thank you for our amazing listenership, which is extremely dedicated and loyal and sincerely

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:33.660
 appreciate all of you guys so much.

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.780
 Okay, so Jordan for $5, no message.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.780
 Thank you so much, Jordan.

01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:43.100
 Elliot Cactus says, "How is THC and CBD understood in the bioenergetic view of health?

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:49.540
 Any recommendations, dietary supplements/drugs/lifestyle for regular marijuana users?"

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.500
 Oh, THC, was that the question?

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.300
 Yeah, how is THC and CBD understood in a bioenergetic view?

01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:03.540
 I've been looking for the real beneficial effects and it's always very ambiguous as

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.340
 far as I can see.

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:12.220
 It is sedative and in some circumstances anti-inflammatory, but not always.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:20.580
 And for many years I haven't been able to resolve the ambiguity to have a definite opinion.

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.580
 Thanks for that.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.580
 Elliot, go ahead.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.580
 One more thing for me to add.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:30.900
 A study from 2017 came out, demonstrated that pregnenolone can antagonize most of the intoxicating

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:34.020
 effects of marijuana, which is probably not what people are looking for.

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.920
 They're trying to get high on it.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.140
 But also animal studies subsequently show that it can protect from some of the anti-androgenic

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:44.420
 effects and estrogenic effects of marijuana as well.

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:50.060
 So I guess if somebody is using heavily marijuana and wants to continue to use it, which I don't

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:55.340
 think is a good idea, but if that's their thing, the human equivalent of about 30 to

01:12:55.340 --> 01:13:00.300
 50 milligrams of pregnenolone based on the mouse study seems to be able to block most

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:04.140
 of the negative effects and some of the positive if sedation is your thing.

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:05.140
 Thanks for that guys.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.140
 Appreciate it.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.300
 Okay, David, boy for $4.99.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.300
 No message.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.300
 Thank you, David.

01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:11.300
 Jordan.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.300
 Okay, this might've been his question.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.860
 He says, "Preparing for dark days ahead, what supplements should my wife and I have on hand

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:22.300
 and how do you recommend storing us dogs, chickens living in MN?"

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.300
 Is that in Minnesota?

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.300
 Minnesota.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.300
 Yeah.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.300
 Dark, dark days in what sense?

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:33.420
 IE, cyber attacks, BLM infiltration in your home.

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:36.020
 You know, I guess all the things we're chronically talking about.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.020
 Food chain.

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.100
 Yeah, food chain disruptions and things like that.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:47.140
 Having some stable calorie supplies and some protein, if the crisis comes, you're going

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:53.780
 to want to share your supplies with the people who didn't stock up so the quantity that you

01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.820
 put away should be economical and long lasting.

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:05.140
 We happen to have a barrel or two of coconut oil and it's always good to have a few 20-pound

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:10.740
 bags of sugar and maybe 40 pounds of gelatin powder on hand.

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:11.740
 Great stuff.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:12.740
 Great suggestions.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.740
 KBP.

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.740
 Quick question about the food.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.500
 Have you seen, Ray, have you seen that Walmart sells this thing called Astronaut food supply

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:24.220
 and they're basically commercializing what NASA did in the '70s.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:29.460
 Basically it's powdered eggs, dehydrated milk, sugar, and I think they have some kind of

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:33.500
 a starch, which I don't remember what the source of that was, but basically they claim

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:40.580
 it's a complete diet that can last for a century at room temperature and they're selling three

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.540
 months, six months, 12-month supplies.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:46.300
 Do you think there's any value in getting those dehydrated eggs and milk or do you think

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.300
 it's dangerous?

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:53.700
 I've always wanted to have a good supply of powdered milk on hand, but I've been having

01:14:53.700 --> 01:15:02.180
 trouble finding out exactly how they prepare the particles that don't clump and I've been

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:09.020
 afraid that they're using nanoparticles as anti-clumping agents and so for the present

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:12.860
 I would not rely too heavily on that.

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:16.780
 What about evaporated/condensed milk, which is sold in cans?

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:19.940
 You're basically getting the equivalent of a gallon of milk in a small can?

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.340
 Yeah, I think that's good to have.

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:30.900
 The can might eventually deteriorate, but it'll last quite a while and maybe some canned

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:31.900
 sardines.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.860
 Great stuff, thanks for that.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.660
 Okay, KBB for $9.99, no message, thank you so much KBB.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:44.340
 New Health again says, "I seem to get a low, a lump in my throat feeling and itchy spots/hives

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.900
 on my body from Sinomel/Sinoplus.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.420
 Any solutions?"

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.140
 How fast was it taken?

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.100
 That's sometimes the problem.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:58.780
 If you try to correct the problem in just a few days or a week, that can cause the gland

01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:03.180
 to shrink so much that you get discomfort in your throat.

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.180
 Interesting.

01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.980
 And we talked about it a little bit earlier, I think this is probably worth clarifying,

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.940
 how much do you think is too much at one time with food?

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.940
 For a T3?

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.940
 Yeah, T3.

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:19.500
 With a meal, 10 micrograms is probably the maximum that you want.

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:24.380
 Otherwise it shouldn't be over 5 micrograms at a time.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.780
 The meal will spread it out quite a bit and make it a steadier supply.

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.620
 And last question for me, would you feel confident swallowing that tablet that it would dissolve

01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.860
 in the stomach or would you chew it?

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.860
 Oh, I always chew any tablet.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:41.220
 It helps you know somewhat what it's made of.

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:45.860
 Is there any benefit in taking thyroid with fat, the long chain fats, in order to go through

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:49.300
 the lymphatic system instead of mostly going to the liver?

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:54.140
 I think as it digests, it's going to distribute itself.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:17:01.660
 The amino acids that are more hydrophobic might get taken up in the chylomicrons.

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.660
 Great stuff.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.660
 Thanks for that, guys.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:08.940
 Okay, Tom says, "I've had numerous people note the development of varicose veins with

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.700
 pregnenolone and progesterone use.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.220
 Please could Ray comment on this?

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.220
 Thanks all."

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:20.260
 I would question the quality of the supplement used first because their biological functions

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:21.900
 are just the opposite.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:31.740
 I've seen horribly bulging veins normalize in an hour with a big dose of progesterone

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:39.780
 and more slowly with many big doses of pregnenolone.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:47.660
 I think someone who got bad products reported that and started people thinking about it

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:54.380
 and then if they don't get immediate improvement, they think they might be getting worse.

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.100
 I wanted to add something to that.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:02.380
 It's very important to make the distinction between varicose veins and more well-defined

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.380
 veins.

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:08.300
 Sometimes people when they have edema, you can't even see the veins, even the contours

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:12.540
 on their hand or their legs and when they take progesterone or pregnenolone, the edema

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:16.700
 rapidly decreases and then the veins become more visible.

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.740
 That's not the same as varicose veins.

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:23.460
 I've never seen a person develop varicose veins from pregnenolone or progesterone.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:28.500
 Yeah, the effect when you get enough is exactly the opposite.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:37.500
 For example, a big vein known to be so bulging that it can't possibly have any valve action

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:43.620
 with a very big dose of progesterone, the muscle can be activated to the point that

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:50.740
 the vein narrows and the flaps of the valve on each side of the vein can then reach each

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.140
 other and close off the flow.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.620
 What would you consider a big dose in that context?

01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:00.100
 It depends on how high your estrogen is.

01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:07.660
 If a person has very high estrogen, it might take 400 milligrams of progesterone, but that

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.060
 amount would knock some people out.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.460
 And we're talking orally, right?

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.460
 Yeah.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.460
 Okay.

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.780
 Do you think there's any benefit in taking a lower dose orally to avoid the sedation

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.620
 and rubbing, I guess, the other half on the actual vein?

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:20.620
 Yeah.

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:25.220
 Putting it optically on while taking a moderate dose is probably the best approach.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.220
 Great stuff.

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.180
 Andy Congo says, "Any critique on the croissant diet?

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:33.500
 Claims SCD1 causes obesity and sugar raises that.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.620
 It's a low PUFA, super high saturated fat diet."

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:37.620
 Whose diet?

01:19:37.620 --> 01:19:38.620
 What diet?

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:43.260
 There was a study showing eating a ton of French croissants, which basically were baked

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:47.660
 with almost fully saturated fat, but also, of course, a lot of starch in them, led to

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.260
 a drastic weight loss and improvement in health.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:57.020
 The sucrose itself, some experiments show that you can increase the metabolic rate by

01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:00.060
 20% just with sucrose.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:08.140
 And so when you do it just right, sugar is a very powerful weight loss instrument.

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.140
 Great stuff.

01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:10.140
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:13.860
 Okay, we're heading to the end of our time here, but I'll keep reading these.

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.140
 KT has no message.

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.980
 Thank you so much, KT, for your donation.

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:23.740
 Yodi the Wodol says, "Alcohol in terms of capitalizing on the social libidinal economy.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:26.540
 I recently realized I wasn't drinking enough.

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:30.220
 What amount is best for lipofuscin?"

01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:31.220
 I wasn't drinking enough.

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:32.220
 That's great.

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:39.940
 Vitamin E is known to be fairly effective at clearing up lipofuscin.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:42.300
 Progesterone is effective.

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:47.660
 The amount of alcohol that can clear it up is very small.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:53.540
 Something like a gram or two a day is enough to have a helpful effect on lipofuscin.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:59.740
 Space99yak again says, "Georgie said the outer layer of the adrenal gland atrophy.

01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:07.860
 Is there any way to reverse that if that happens to someone and any way of knowing if it has?"

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:14.060
 Adrenaline and progesterone both help to protect the adrenals so they can regenerate.

01:21:14.060 --> 01:21:18.940
 What I meant by that comment was that with aging, the layer that produces DHEA and pregnenolone

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:23.060
 tends to atrophy and then the only one that remains is the cortisol producing one.

01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.060
 Ray, what was that guy?

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:26.380
 He has a series of excellent papers on this subject.

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.540
 I think Parker, do you know who I'm talking about?

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.540
 He studied this in depth.

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:30.980
 He doesn't ring a bell.

01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:31.980
 No worries.

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.300
 Okay, last few questions here.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:41.740
 Spencer says, "30 male, low total cholesterol, 116 to 119 and low DHEA for the last 10 years.

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:47.140
 Got the cholesterol up to 166, cutting starch, using the carrot salad, increasing sugar,

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.220
 fructose and calcium.

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:51.540
 Have all hypo symptoms, but my temps and pulses are normal.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.540
 Any advice?"

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:53.540
 Why?

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:54.540
 Not on any thyroid.

01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:56.540
 What kind of symptoms are hyper?

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.620
 I'm not sure what that means.

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:00.620
 Maybe I misspoke.

01:22:00.620 --> 01:22:01.620
 He said hypo.

01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:03.140
 I think this person had gynecomastia.

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:08.420
 I think he had thinning hair and I think he had a kind of classical, I can't remember,

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:12.660
 maybe constipation as well, but kind of like classical types of hypo symptoms.

01:22:12.660 --> 01:22:14.600
 And temperature was normalized?

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:20.300
 I think he was reading them on a, they were higher like through the day, but in general,

01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:23.820
 I think this person felt terrible.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:30.020
 Checking for anything pro-inflammatory in the diet would be a first step to see if the inflammation

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.500
 was interfering with their function.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:37.660
 Wouldn't sometimes very high cortisol and serotonin produce like a high body temperature

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:40.860
 at the expense of destroying the muscles and everything else?

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.860
 Yeah.

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:48.220
 The stress hormones generally rise when your thyroid is low and it takes quite a while

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:53.660
 when you're under stress to adapt fully to the thyroid supplement.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:23:01.780
 So Bruno Barnes over his career learned that it was best to aim for three or four months

01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:09.320
 for full correction with thyroid and people got so impatient, they think of correcting

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:17.940
 efficiency as sort of a matter of a day or two, but it really, since the whole system

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:25.440
 has to evolve in a different direction under the better energy supply, you should look

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.860
 at the timescale of something like three months.

01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:28.860
 Yeah.

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:32.260
 I think he has a whole section on that in his book, like what to expect and when, and

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.860
 when changes will occur and when they won't.

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:35.860
 Great stuff.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.860
 Okay.

01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:37.860
 Andrew Gassile says, "Thank you.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:38.980
 Tyromax is the bomb.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:39.980
 I can sweat again."

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:40.980
 Thanks, Andrew.

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:42.900
 Oscar Gomez for $5, but no message.

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:43.900
 Thank you, Oscar.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.940
 MercyMe for $9.99, but no message.

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:46.940
 Thank you, MercyMe.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.300
 Ben, he says, "Take more of my money."

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.980
 Thanks, Ben.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.940
 Carlos Rangel for just a sticker, but no message.

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.220
 Thank you, Carlos.

01:23:55.220 --> 01:23:57.700
 Carlin Brooks for $25, but no message.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:58.940
 Thank you so much, Carlin.

01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:01.540
 And let me just refresh this page really quick.

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:04.140
 And while I'm doing that, Ray, what are you working on right now?

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:10.700
 Not working on anything, but thinking about some of the old themes, giving them a new

01:24:10.700 --> 01:24:11.700
 perspective.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:17.660
 So, atherosclerosis and estrogen, for example, something related to that is going to be my

01:24:17.660 --> 01:24:18.660
 next newsletter.

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:24.580
 Speaking of the older views, since Metchikoff was an embryologist, do you know of any field

01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:28.060
 in medicine or science in general that's still retaining some of those views and teaching

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.500
 them to the younger generations?

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:37.580
 No, they were all effectively erased from the profession by the mid-1950s.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:44.820
 And so, a few of the very young people are starting to look around and might be hope

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:45.820
 for the future.

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:46.820
 I can't believe this.

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.820
 We're probably going to get through the questions here.

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:50.060
 So, guys, we have 187 people watching.

01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:51.140
 Please give this episode a like.

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.740
 I know it's arbitrary, but it really helps with the show.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:58.860
 Again, thank you to Ray for sitting here and being barraged by questions for two hours.

01:24:58.860 --> 01:24:59.860
 Sincerely appreciate it.

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:02.860
 Thank you, Georgie Dinkov, again, my partner in crime, making this all possible.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:03.860
 So there's just a few more questions.

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:06.100
 Maybe we can get through these and just call it a night.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.780
 Okay, so I mentioned Karlin.

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.940
 This one's a scout.

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:13.780
 And they say, "Do you think magnetofection could have been added to the COVID vaccine

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.060
 to facilitate the mRNA getting into the cell?

01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:20.100
 Could that explain all the magnetic videos on the internet?"

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:24.380
 I don't think they had to add anything.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.900
 The naked nucleic acids have no problem getting into cells.

01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:35.660
 I think they were calling the lipid coat a necessary way to get it into cells.

01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:45.260
 But when they've compared lipid-encapsulated DNA molecules with free DNA, in some situations,

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:51.700
 the free DNA works better than the lipid-encapsulated forms.

01:25:51.700 --> 01:26:00.700
 And I think the real situation is likely to be that the so-called lipid carrier is really

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:04.980
 a powerful adjuvant, a source of inflammation.

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:05.980
 Thanks for that.

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:08.540
 Another sticker from Fuhiha.

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:09.540
 Thank you so much for that.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:10.540
 Peggy.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.540
 Hey, Peggy.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.700
 She says, "How to use progesterone to postpone menopause."

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:14.700
 Thank you.

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:19.980
 Oh, just using it cyclically is the important thing so that your liver doesn't get in the

01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:22.140
 habit of excreting it too fast.

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:28.940
 So you have to lay off for one or two weeks every month and stay on cycle with it.

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:36.500
 I've mentioned before that I met a gynecologist who was in his 70s and he had this very young-looking

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.500
 wife.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:43.220
 He said that I've been giving her progesterone every month for 20 years and she's still menstruating

01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.260
 at the age of 63.

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:46.260
 That's amazing.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:47.260
 Okay.

01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:48.260
 This one's from Nancy.

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.700
 She just sends a sticker.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.700
 Thank you so much, Nancy.

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:53.060
 Space99, yuck, again for...

01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:54.560
 He says, "The benefits..."

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.900
 Talk about the benefits of allopregnanolone.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:01.100
 It's mostly what progesterone does.

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:07.940
 It's one of the important conversion products in the brain, a neurosteroid.

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:15.180
 And so everything we think of progesterone doing to mood perception, stability, stopping

01:27:15.180 --> 01:27:24.300
 seizures, helping with psychosis, it's really partly the effect of the allopregnanolone.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:25.300
 Amazing.

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.300
 Thanks, Space99.

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:27.300
 Thank you, Ray.

01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:28.300
 And the last...

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.660
 All right, maybe we have three questions left.

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.780
 This one's from Gregory and...

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.780
 What is the time here?

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780
 Okay.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.420
 This one, Gregory says, "For the last few years, my father has developed excessively

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.500
 dry palms to the point they crack and the flesh is exposed.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:44.600
 Doctors don't know what the cause is and just prescribe ointments.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.600
 Any ideas?"

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.600
 Thank you, Ray.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.460
 Check his thyroid.

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:54.740
 It's responsible for both sebum and sweat production in the skin.

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:59.540
 If your thyroid is low, your skin almost invariably gets dry.

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:04.460
 Okay, the absolute last two questions here, and then maybe we can talk about some cultural

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.200
 stuff if you don't have to go, Ray.

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.500
 But this is from Zach.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:12.740
 He says, "How to tell sugar is converting into carbon dioxide versus lactic acid?"

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:16.980
 You feel very good.

01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:23.200
 You might feel panic and anxiety to the extent that it's turning to lactic acid.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.580
 Thanks for that, Ray.

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.580
 Thank you, Zach.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:26.780
 Okay, the last question here.

01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.780
 Kirk, he says, "Hi, Ray.

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:33.180
 I think I have heard you mentioned in a talk that 1,000 calories a day while still getting

01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:38.180
 all the RDA protein as well as for vitamins and minerals is an effective short-term way

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.860
 to lose weight in the short term.

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:40.860
 Any truth to this?"

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:45.380
 Yeah, it isn't good for your health if you have to lose weight.

01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:48.580
 Keeping the minerals up is very important.

01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:56.660
 Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium are very protective against too much of the

01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.660
 stress reaction.

01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:59.660
 I just have a related question.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:05.420
 They're now starting human studies with the drug RU486, which you have an article about

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.340
 mentioning that drug, Ray.

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.300
 And it's basically, even though it's known as the abortion pill, it was developed as

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:11.580
 a cortisol blocker.

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.780
 That was its original design and purpose.

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:18.300
 And now they're having several clinical trials showing sustained, rapid and sustained weight

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:23.540
 loss by using anywhere between 300 to 600 milligrams of that thing daily.

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:28.780
 Do you think something similar can be achieved with progesterone instead of messing with

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.620
 the diet and drastically reducing the calories?

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:32.620
 Yeah.

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:40.900
 Carefully adjusting your thyroid and progesterone and DHEA, pregnenolone, those can sustain

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:46.500
 a very high metabolic rate, increased body temperature so that you burn calories much

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:47.500
 faster.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:52.940
 So Dr. Bagniewski basically said, "How to burn fat while eating the Ray P. inspired

01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.500
 diet I gained 10 pounds."

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.180
 And so it kind of intersects with what we were just talking about.

01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.740
 What should be the focus if a person is gaining weight?

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:08.100
 Not to eat too many calories first and then to gradually shift towards a lower fat intake,

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:14.140
 whatever keeps your temperature up without having an excess of calories.

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:22.580
 And as your temperature stays higher, you'll be burning more calories and able to eat more

01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:30.660
 and more up to maybe 3000 calories a day for a sedentary person without getting fat.

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:31.660
 Thanks for that.

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.060
 And Goalie Ag doesn't have a question, but they donated $20.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:35.060
 Thank you Goalie.

01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:37.620
 And then Space Yak again donated more cash.

01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:38.620
 Thank you so much Space Yak.

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.620
 We're going to call it there.

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:41.340
 Ray, I don't like keeping you more than two hours.

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:46.020
 Is there anything specifically interesting that you feel like needs a spotlight shined

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:50.260
 on that's happened through medical or cultural or anything like that?

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.660
 Or do you have to go and we can also just let you go?

01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:59.820
 Well, more and more kids are dying right after getting vaccinated.

01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:07.500
 So I think more people are starting to think in terms of murder rather than coincidental

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:14.780
 deaths when they get sudden swelling of the heart that kills them.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.260
 I think the public is slowly starting to wake up.

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:22.320
 Didn't the CDC like stealth edit their page or something and say that kids actually did

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.140
 not need vaccine when they had been promoting the idea for a period of months or so?

01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:29.180
 Yeah, they said that very openly.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:36.940
 And then the reaction from the press was such that they erased it from their website.

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:45.460
 And someone who mentioned the original statement that kids don't need the vaccination, his

01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:50.740
 comment was censored as contrary to Facebook's policy.

01:31:50.740 --> 01:31:55.660
 So in effect, the World Health Organization was censored by Facebook.

01:31:55.660 --> 01:32:01.060
 And people might not tolerate kids dying as much as they would just older adults.

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:08.860
 Yeah, everyone is fine with when 80 or 100 percent of the people in the nursing home

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.100
 die right after getting vaccinated.

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:18.620
 But when a 13-year-old kid dies suddenly three days after his second vaccination, people

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:21.580
 are starting to question authority.

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:25.060
 And then this is not won't be surprising to you, but I did peruse a paper.

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:30.340
 It was something like 84-year-old man autopsy after first Pfizer vaccine.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:34.740
 And the gist of the paper was something like all of his vital organs contained the, what

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:38.300
 is it, like the RNA, the viral, the spike protein or something.

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:43.220
 And so again, just more confirmation of everything you've been saying since March of 2020, that

01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.980
 this whole thing is a total charade and it's not localized and that it likely killed this

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.700
 person like 18 days after.

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:52.220
 And I guess this was like a landmark because it was the first autopsy of somebody who'd

01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:53.220
 been vaccinated.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:54.220
 Yeah.

01:32:54.220 --> 01:33:02.180
 And people should keep remembering that influenza was effectively wiped out by the surge in

01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:08.980
 so-called COVID deaths, meaning that the total pneumonia deaths didn't change.

01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.620
 Do you think, have you seen some of the new proposals in Congress and Senate to break

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.020
 up and rein in big tech?

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:18.940
 Do you think there's any, I don't know, honesty to these efforts or do you think it's all

01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:19.940
 a game?

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:20.940
 To rein in what?

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.860
 The big technology companies censoring people left and right and basically destroying society

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:26.860
 as we know it?

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:36.860
 It's hard to imagine that person surviving a breakup of the computer industry and Facebook

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.740
 and Amazon.

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:43.660
 That's such a totalitarian system.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:47.580
 I doubt that she's going to be able to accomplish anything.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:54.020
 So basically the empire really depends on for its survival on the big tech complex.

01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:57.580
 So any attempt to subvert that will probably be met with brutality.

01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.780
 I would guess so.

01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:04.500
 And then last question, any thoughts on impending cyber attack, you know, cyber polygon, the

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:08.540
 world economic forum, it's going to happen next month and it's not rare for these things

01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:13.700
 to go live after a month or two, you know, is there anything you're doing right?

01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:18.540
 Like how would you survive if infrastructure and things collapsed?

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:23.340
 After a while, I'm sure I would end up in Mexico.

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:27.020
 But you don't really depend on the internet to live a productive life, do you?

01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.060
 No, not at all.

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.780
 So it may be a blessing in disguise.

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:34.300
 You'll simply go back to pen and paper and calling people on the phone and meeting them

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:35.300
 in person.

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:38.940
 Yeah, sort of hoping that that will happen actually.

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:43.140
 Yeah, it'd be kind of counterintuitive for the system that sustains the ignorance to

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:44.280
 be turned off.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:47.300
 But some people are saying people would go like psychotic within a week or two.

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:48.860
 Do you think there's any truth to that?

01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:49.860
 No.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:55.460
 Well, unless you define psychotic as contact reality.

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:59.620
 There may be a withdrawal period, a period of like abstinence or something.

01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:01.140
 But I also agree.

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:05.140
 I think people will quickly discover how much they've been duped and how much they don't

01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:07.260
 want their internet connection back.

01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:10.180
 Yeah, including throwing away their cell phones.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.180
 Okay, great stuff.

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.860
 I won't hold you any a bit longer.

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:13.860
 Stay on the line.

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.140
 We'll just say thank you again.

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:16.820
 So Ray, thank you so much for doing this.

01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.060
 Georgie, thank you so much.

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:22.020
 And we have an amazing listenership and I'll stay up after this and I'll do timestamps

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:25.640
 for all these questions and things and sincerely appreciate all the support.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.340
 When you see us again, I think we'll have a souped up system and it will be very nice

01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:34.300
 and my computer won't be overheating and on the verge of collapse every single time we

01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.300
 do this.

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:36.300
 So guys, thank you so much.

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:39.860
 A special appreciation to Ray for just two hours answering questions.

01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:43.180
 And Georgie, thank you again and thank you to our amazing listenership and audience.

01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:45.540
 Have a safe weekend everybody and we'll talk to you guys soon.

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:46.540
 Okay, take care.
