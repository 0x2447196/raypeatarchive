 Okay, okay, and we're live. Georgie DeKalb, Ray Peet. Guys, thank you so much for joining us today.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.900
 Thank you, Georgie. Thank you, Ray. And we're just going to rifle through a bunch of questions,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.220
 but before we do that, how are you, Ray?

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.900
 Very good.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.260
 Yeah. You said the weather had gotten a little bit sunnier in Eugene, so that's always a positive.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.380
 It's going to be in the hundreds, over a hundred this weekend.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.060
 And then how do you, do you go sit in the sun or what do you do?

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:39.420
 I'm not going to stay inside all day tomorrow, at least. We open the door at about 1am when it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.660
 cools off, blow in some cooler air, and then close it up for the day. The house is concrete, so it

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.620
 holds its temperature for about a day.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.260
 And blocking that 5G as well.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.220
 Yeah, a little bit.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.540
 Okay. And then Georgie, how are you, sir?

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.660
 I really liked your elevator music that you put at the start of the show. It was very soothing.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.580
 Did you hear it through my headphones?

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.540
 No, I heard the music. Was I not supposed to hear it?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.740
 Oh, no, you weren't. Okay. That's a little bit weird. Ray, did you hear the music too?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.020
 Yeah.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.940
 Oh, okay. Weird. Okay.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.140
 I thought it was kind of interesting. You tried to hold a conversation

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.260
 over this really loud music and I thought, wow, that must be a new feature.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.660
 In-conference call music.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.820
 That's one of the reasons we're upgrading equipment, because when I'm talking to you guys

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.940
 before the show, I'm always hearing music and it's obnoxious. Okay, enough of that. This show,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.180
 like I said, I told you guys before, I don't feel like it's for me or necessarily per se,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.300
 Georgie, although Ray and Georgie, you guys' interfacing and bouncing ideas off each other is

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.580
 I think what the people are here to listen to.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.420
 Okay. So I'm just going to go through these questions and read them. And Ray, some of this

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.100
 stuff is going to be redundant and answer as much or as little as you want for all of this. So our

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:10.060
 first one is from Drew F. And he says, "Trestosterone/MENT is not 5-alpha reduced,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.460
 but bodybuilders and some post-finasteride sufferers experience benefits in terms of mood,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.860
 animalism, et cetera. Is androgen receptor agonism a likely explanation for the effects?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.180
 It is a much stronger androgen than testosterone."

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.580
 Which reduced testosterone is it?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.540
 Georgie, do you know what this is?

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.020
 Yes, I know. It's a new steroid. It's 7-alpha-methylated version of nendrolone,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.500
 which is a carbon-18 steroid of the estrein family. So it was...

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.780
 I'm always suspicious when they add a methyl group.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.020
 Yes, it's actually very hepatotoxic. As you know, Ray, methyl groups at position 17,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:04.380
 7, and potentially others, they've all been proven to have severe hepatotoxicity.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.580
 But bodybuilders like it because I guess they don't value their liver that much, but also

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.940
 it's the steroid that can achieve the same with lower doses. And they think it's worth it instead

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.700
 of abusing the testosterone in higher dosages. That steroid was developed as a male contraceptive

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.620
 candidate. And I think it's still in clinical trials for that. But even the company that

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.980
 developed it and is running the clinical trials got discouraged given the hepatotoxicity.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:41.180
 Ray, do you want to clarify the methyl group? So adding a methyl group to a steroid is risky,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.500
 you said?

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:51.980
 Yeah, it just sends it off on unknown pathways. The liver never had to deal with such things.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:57.100
 And so I think it's extremely unpredictable and dangerous.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.100
 Good stuff. And then we've talked about post-finasteride a bunch, so I don't want to

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.700
 kind of get into that again.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:10.700
 I think his main question was, "Is activation of the androgen receptor

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:18.540
 a plausible explanation of the antidepressant and general feelings of well-being

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.580
 from using these androgenic steroids?"

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.220
 I think it's plausible.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.900
 Great stuff. Thank you for that, guys. Okay, Marcel, this is just kind of a statement.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.860
 Thank you, Danny, for your contributions to the community. You are a big reason why Ray's work,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.020
 wealth of knowledge is available to us. Thank you so much, Georgie, for his continuing curiosity

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.700
 and dedicating his life's work towards advancements in this space. I hope this helps.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.420
 Thank you, Marcel. I sincerely appreciate that. Thank you to Ray for being

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:51.900
 humble inspiration for all things. Andrew Wallace says, "What would you do if you had

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.980
 Crohn's? What would be your protocol?"

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.660
 Me?

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:04.540
 Ray, I guess I'm just asking you, and then Georgie can chime in at any point.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:15.340
 Pretty much what I do anyway. Assume the intestine is my contact with the world,

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:21.500
 and I have to protect it, and so I don't want to offend it in any way.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.940
 And Crohn's disease is a seriously offended intestine.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.620
 And from what I've read, you know, it seems like you've dealt with a lot of, like, serious

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:37.420
 intestinal things over the years, as one would in this environment. And so it's not like you're

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.540
 speaking from reading—I know you read, obviously, a lot, but you're speaking from personal

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.740
 experience, is that right? Yeah, starting as a baby with migraines,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:09:00.540
 which recurred every time I would do certain things wrong, up until my mid-40s. I would feel

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:08.540
 the last one, for example, was when I was visiting in San Francisco and didn't realize

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:16.300
 that they had fluoridated water, and I would occasionally drink some of that water,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:26.940
 and I was taking Sinoplus or Sino-Mal orally, and within two or three days, I had a tremendous

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:37.260
 migraine, and that started me thinking about it, and fluoride can totally wipe out the activity of

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:46.780
 T3 if it happens to be present in your stomach and the T3 is exposed to it.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:53.420
 Amazing stuff. Okay, so obviously— I have a question in regards to Crohn's disease.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:59.020
 Henry, have you seen some of the more recent studies claiming that Crohn's disease may be caused

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.620
 by a type of mycobacteria, which is known to cause Crohn's disease in animals,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.260
 and now they're saying the same thing may be true in humans?

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:17.900
 Yeah, but the inflammation and poor digestion set up the conditions for such things to

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:26.620
 accumulate and multiply. So basically, making sure that you don't irritate your intestine more

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.420
 than absolutely necessary is at the basis of a protocol for keeping—

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.060
 Yeah, you can find the mycoplasm in just about any sick person.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:41.980
 It's sort of opportunistic and looks for a sort of place to live.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:49.020
 So maybe this antibiotic therapy that they're now trying in Europe for this,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.380
 potentially, they're treating it as a bacteria infection, but it's really

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.420
 destroying the microbiome and keeping the intestine sterile, which reduces the inflammation.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.420
 Not necessarily, it's not only one bacteria, it's just this is helping because it's reducing the

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.540
 amount of bacteria in the intestine anyways.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:14.700
 Yeah, just taking a series of penicillin doses or eating raw carrots, for example,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:24.540
 can have very similar effects. In both rats and people, it turns out that anything that

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:33.100
 cleans up your intestine will lower your cortisol and estrogen and increase your progesterone,

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:40.780
 just because the intestine is such a chronic drain and source of stress.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.740
 In regards to the carrot salad and in general fiber,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:51.100
 what are your thoughts on supplementing with pure cellulose if one could find a pure source?

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:59.980
 It would be interesting. They used to sell basically a cellulose tablet for weight loss.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:07.420
 I've never tried one, but it seemed like a good idea because cellulose doesn't have the

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.460
 estrogen-promoting symptoms that a lot of other fibers do.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.980
 The reason I'm mentioning this is I was reading some studies. They're using various cellulose

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:23.180
 esters as binders for drugs for developing pharmaceutical drugs. Some of these esters,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:28.700
 like for example, ethyl cellulose, showed remarkable antibacterial effects in animals

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.260
 and reduced inflammation. So I thought maybe it's because it's clearing out their intestines somehow.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:40.780
 Oh yeah, it was a very popular laxative effect as well as weight loss.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.180
 Was this in the past, like in the 60s or 70s?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:51.820
 I used to see the ads for it on TV as recently as 1986, I think it was.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.700
 Interesting, very interesting.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.380
 Speaking of cortisol, this one's from New Health and they say good cortisol

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.460
 blocker supplements for weight loss. What is your thoughts on that, Ray?

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.460
 What blocker?

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.220
 Like a cortisol blocker.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:14.940
 Progesterone and pregnenolone are the best ones I know of.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:28.140
 But working at the pituitary level, a lot of things, sugar, aspirin, probably sodium,

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:37.340
 anything that stabilizes your blood sugar and metabolism, reduces inflammation, will

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.100
 defend you against cortisol.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.700
 Thanks for that. New Health says, "There's now a spin-off of the Ray Peet community with

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:52.460
 Morley Robbins ideas, aka ceruloplasmin. Would you be willing to do a show on this

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.500
 from a Ray Peet perspective?" I think these were when they originally thought that Georgie and I

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:03.020
 were just going to do a Q&A. So Ray, what are your thoughts on ceruloplasmin? It's an acute

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.820
 phase reactant. So do you want to be increasing ceruloplasmin? Is that a goal of a diet or

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.300
 lifestyle or supplement routine?

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.540
 Not my goal.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:20.700
 Hey, do you want to comment on Morley Robbins? Do you know who that is? Are you familiar

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.180
 with their work?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.780
 No, no.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:23.020
 Okay.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:30.140
 I have a question. So if somebody has low ceruloplasmin, some of the studies claim that

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.980
 this is a sign of low thyroid function. In a situation like that, considering that ceruloplasmin

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.380
 apparently takes care of the copper and makes sure it doesn't become toxic to the various organs,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.460
 would somebody be potentially at risk if they have low ceruloplasmin and low thyroid?

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.620
 Would they be at risk when eating high copper foods like liver and shellfish?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:15:08.460
 I think so. Did you ever read Carl Pfeiffer's books? I think he caused himself to lose pigment

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:18.300
 by being so obsessive about keeping copper down. He was very concentrated on the risk of too much

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:25.100
 copper, probably having seen some people with ceruloplasm deficiency.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:31.340
 Anne Louise Gittleman, Andy Cutler, and Carl Hoffer or Pfeiffer or whatever, they were all

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:37.740
 about copper toxicity being this humongous problem. It seems like from reading your work

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.500
 that they were just misled in what they thought was going on.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:47.900
 Yeah. He took a little capsule of flowers of sulfur every day for many, many years,

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.620
 and he had no trace of skin or hair pigment left.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:59.180
 Okay, great stuff. Okay, this one's from Joseph, and he says, "Can you speak about nitric oxide

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.860
 and the word on the street that it's good for Cialis or Viagra, so that it works like those

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:19.980
 substances?" I'm afraid there is quite a bit of overlap. As soon as nitric oxide was discovered

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:28.220
 to be produced in the body, they were seeing its involvement in everything degenerative and

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:39.340
 harmful. Then when Viagra came on the market, suddenly for about five or six years, everything

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:46.220
 published was how great nitric oxide is. It prevents hypertension and protects against

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:53.580
 everything. Thousands of articles came out suddenly reversing it from a dangerous free radical

00:16:53.580 --> 00:17:03.340
 to a cure-all. Then about 10 or 15 years ago, there was a gradual return to sanity and

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:21.500
 realizing that it's one of the very central things to degeneration, aging, the follow-up of trauma,

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:31.660
 estrogen interactions, everything stress-related and degeneration-related involves

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:39.980
 the pro-inflammatory effect of ethanol. Two follow-up questions, he says,

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.140
 "Is aspirin safe to take every day, and also is lactose-free milk good?"

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:58.300
 It doesn't taste very good, but I think it's safe enough. It probably doesn't let you absorb

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:09.020
 nutrients quite as well as natural lactose-containing milk, but I don't think it's

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.500
 harmful. "And then your thoughts on using aspirin every day?"

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:26.700
 When I had a good supply, I was taking it every day very consistently, but sometimes I forget to

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:36.140
 take it when it isn't in a convenient form, like some of it is powdered so fine it's choking

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.540
 when you try to take it just on your tongue.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.060
 Georgie, interrupt me at any time. Okay, this one's a little bit long, so bear with me for a

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:51.180
 second. "I've been trying to have a baby for more than a year, but I have azuspermia, confirmed after

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:56.780
 three semen analyses and undetectable levels of sperm after a testicular ultrasound. They found a

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:07.500
 small varicocele in both testicles. I've been taking 7 to 8 mg of extremistain for three weeks.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:13.340
 For how much longer is it safe to take?" So this is the first question. "Will continued

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.140
 extremistain use help me fix the varicocele as well as the azuspermia?"

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.220
 What's she taking?

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.980
 Exemistain. It's a steroidal aromatase inhibitor.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:31.340
 I'll just finish up this question. There's two more sentences here, and we can go through it.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.700
 "If exemistain doesn't fix the azuspermia, what else can I do? I'd like to avoid having

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:43.500
 a varicocele ectomy or even worse, surgical sperm extraction from IVF. After three weeks

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:49.500
 of exemistain, my total testosterone went from 400 to 756. Exemistain has also increased my FSH

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:55.180
 and LH and are now above standard range. I thought FSH and LH would go down as testosterone goes up."

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:59.580
 So were there bits of that question that you have comments on, Ray?

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:11.660
 Yeah, I think you can get a safer inhibition of aromatase using aspirin, progesterone,

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:23.500
 completely safe things. Thyroid is very important, but just with aspirin,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:31.260
 progesterone and thyroid, you can get your ratio back, testosterone, pregnenolone.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:42.860
 And estrogen down and supplementing pregnenolone and thyroxine historically

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:53.580
 was very effective for correcting infertility and enlivening inactive sperms.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.740
 And so the azuspermia, if the cholesterol is high and the person wasn't taking enough thyroid,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.780
 that would be a result of that with high estrogen?

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:14.940
 Yeah, the thyroid and pregnenolone make their energy producing system revive.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:23.100
 Great stuff. Thanks for that. Okay, Peggy says, "Question for the Q&A. Thoughts on ivermectin for

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:30.140
 COVID, prophylaxis, and any alternative as it is almost impossible to get a prescription for it.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:34.780
 Thank you." Prophylaxis suggests you would be taking

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:47.100
 it some everyday for an indefinite time until you didn't get the infection. And the normal use of it

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:57.980
 is a very short course. And about one person in a thousand in the studies of using it to treat

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:07.260
 parasites will show signs of brain damage. And I don't think it's a good idea to take maybe

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.740
 thousands of daily doses, even a moderate amount of something that

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.020
 once in a while is known to cause brain damage.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.860
 There was some podcast that was talking about ivermectin and a bunch of people emailed me about

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:26.540
 it the exact same time. Again, George, you interrupted any time. Okay, so this person says-

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:33.260
 I can give a few more, I mean, based on the studies that recently came out. Methylene blue,

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:39.100
 a well-known antiviral, at least four studies came out in the last month saying it can both prevent

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.500
 and treat COVID-19. Of course, there's no medical advice, but that's what the study said.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:50.300
 Instead of hydroxychloroquine, you can try plain old quinine. My personal favorite,

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.340
 hydroxychloroquine is just a patented, more liver toxic version of quinine.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:02.940
 Naringenin, also a few good studies. So drinking orange juice should have similar effect than

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:10.780
 taking the isolated version. And aspirin, vitamin C and vitamin D, I mean, all of these now have

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.500
 quite a few studies behind them. Unfortunately, everything is being censored by mainstream media,

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:21.500
 so you have to go to PubMed to find them. But I wouldn't say- Ivermectin would be one of the last

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.780
 things I would try considering all the other safer alternatives that are out there. Cyproheptadine,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.420
 famotidine, which is an acid blocker, but apparently is also a potent anti-serotonin

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:37.500
 agent as well. Really, I don't know where the ivermectin craze is coming from. Maybe that's

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:44.700
 the only thing that hit the mainstream news, but tons of other chemicals, safer and cheaper and

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.820
 available over the counter that can do just as well, if not better, than ivermectin with

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:58.540
 fewer side effects. And vitamin D is very effective. There was a study done in Spain in a

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:09.820
 hospital which was withdrawn after a lot of doctors wrote ignorant letters to the publisher.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:23.900
 For some reason, the editor caved in and had it withdrawn, but it was very clear that they gave,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:31.820
 I think it was 6,000 units, something like that, per day. Maybe it was 8,000 first dose and then

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:41.100
 6,000 units a day to people who were admitted to hospital intensive care, very sick with COVID.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:55.180
 Simply, that treatment with vitamin D reduced mortality by about 60%. Just an absolutely

00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:02.700
 clear difference, but the readers who didn't like vitamin D quibbled that they hadn't done

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:10.620
 statistics quite right, but you can't miss a 60% disappearance of dead patients.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:19.020
 I would like to see a doctor argue that 60% more live people is statistically insignificant.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:24.940
 Very stupid people who are complaining.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:30.940
 Shout out to the Kate Deering and Kitty Blumfield podcast you did with them. I thought it was like

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:37.180
 a tour de force and you at least, I thought you cleared up every single anti-vitamin D argument

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:42.460
 that exists on the internet right now. I was very thankful for that podcast. I think you can type in

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:48.300
 Kitty Blumfield, a win at life podcast, vitamin D, Ray Peet, and a person can find it instantaneously.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:55.500
 Hi, Danny. Hi, Georgie. Hi, Ray Peet. Many thanks for the show. Please keep going. I have one

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.100
 question. My seven-year-old daughter has hypothyroid symptoms, low energy, weight gain,

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:06.380
 digestive problems. Her TSH is between four and five and her free T4 is around 12. Doctors here

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:10.780
 don't test for other markers, unfortunately. Doctor says everything is okay and no need to worry.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:19.500
 Do you have any suggestions what we can do? Preferably nutritional plus lifestyle. Thanks

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.500
 again, Timo. P.S. I'm lucky you take my question. Okay. What do you think about that?

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:34.940
 Very important to get the TSH down. The TSH at that level itself is causing symptoms,

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:43.100
 pro-inflammatory symptoms, and it's going to disturb her puberty development,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:55.580
 all kinds of development. The history of that bizarre attitude towards TSH,

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:03.820
 I think it's on my website, 50 Years of Fraud is part of the title,

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:15.820
 that there's just no scientific basis for relying on TSH, especially at such very high levels as

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:22.540
 five. And just my limited understanding of things of reading through hypothyroidism,

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.420
 the unsuspected illness, like he wrote a talk about childhood hypothyroidism, and it's not

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.500
 crazy to investigate a thyroid supplement for a child, right?

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:43.100
 Oh, not at all. Sometimes it has to start at a very young age. It's increasingly important around

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:50.540
 seven or eight or nine when the first signs of puberty are coming on because the estrogen is

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.580
 going to slow down the thyroid function. Great stuff. Okay. This one's from JV Marketing,

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:01.420
 and they say, "Hi guys. I recently started taking thyroid 12.5 micrograms of T3 and 37.5

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:07.580
 micrograms of T4. I am day three into this and my waking temperature has been slightly lower than

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.860
 usual. Is it normal for a slight dip in temperature before improvements are made? Could this be a

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:20.940
 nutritional deficiency?" Very low thyroid people will have, especially during the night,

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:28.780
 high cortisol and adrenaline usually. And you should check your pulse at the same time

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:38.060
 when you wake up along with the temperature. And then after having a breakfast with, for example,

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:47.340
 a lot of orange juice, the stress hormones are going to be decreased when you get your

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:55.980
 glucose level up. So the adrenaline goes down, the cortisol will go down. Both of those have

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:05.180
 kept your temperature, both of them, and pulse rate kept up by high adrenaline during the night.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:17.580
 And so by which of those changes the most, you can tell what night stress was responsible for them.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:27.180
 And when you get your thyroid gradually improving your carbon dioxide production and

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:34.300
 stabilizing your glycogen stores, your nocturnal stress goes down. And so you're

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:42.060
 revealing the hypothyroid condition that was hidden under the stress hormones.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:54.460
 During daytime testing, people who are very hypothyroid, such as a five or six on the TSH level

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:10.300
 have been very hyper and normal, not fat or edematous or sluggish or anything, but they were

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:20.780
 found to have 30 to 40 times the daily output of adrenaline making up for the low thyroid production.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:31.980
 So it's pretty common to have extreme slowdown when you start on your thyroid. That's why it's

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:39.580
 so important to keep a chart marked off for at least two or three weeks showing

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:49.740
 your temperature and pulse rate both on the same chart so that you can draw a line where it should

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:59.420
 with an ideal starting dose of thyroid, you should see the lines rising steadily towards the

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.860
 goal of pulse rate and temperature at the end of two or three weeks.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:15.420
 But if at first you see the numbers going down, that's evidence that you're getting out of the

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:21.500
 stress. Great stuff. Thank you for that, Ray. Okay. This one's from Jean, mega super supporter

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:26.620
 of the show. And she says, I wanted a lot of these people are mega super supporters, but I wanted to

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.980
 ask and hear more about why people who are vaccinated are getting colds and flus right now.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.980
 There seems to be a lot of discussion in my neighborhood that people are out sick at work

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.060
 and feeling flu/cold symptoms, even though it's extremely warm here.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:52.780
 The purpose of any vaccine is to create a systemic inflammation. And in general,

00:31:52.780 --> 00:32:03.100
 that weakens your overall immune system, even though it pumps up your specific antibodies,

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:12.460
 the general inflammation is a weakness at least during the time you're having symptoms.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:22.300
 And unfortunately, sometimes for a much longer time, such as the year after people had an

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:33.180
 influenza vaccination, their rate of coronavirus infection was greatly increased 50 or 60% more

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:41.420
 likely to get infected by a different virus because they were protected against influenza virus.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:51.260
 So the idea, the officials actually say stupid things like get vaccinated. It'll make you healthy.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:59.900
 Thanks for that. And we'll take a break here, Ray, like, I don't know, like maybe 20 minutes or so,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.060
 because I know this, I don't give you like a lobotomy from this, ask you a hundred questions.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:09.420
 But I know a question about the vaccines. Is there any truth to saying that basically

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:17.820
 the vaccines are sacrificing general immunity in order to boost specific resistance to a very

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.700
 specific virus, while at the same time making you vulnerable, just as you mentioned,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.340
 they also mentioned influenza and Corona, but I think this applies to any virus, right? If you

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:32.140
 shift the immune response, protecting from only one virus, you're exposing yourself, becoming

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:38.300
 more compromisable to all the other viruses. Yeah, there were, I think, 10 studies showing

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:48.060
 that with influenza follow-up, but the whole doctrine going back to Ehrlich's time,

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:58.780
 it's a drug industry centered theory of what immunity amounts to. Paul Ehrlich was selling

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:07.340
 his patent drugs and he shared the Nobel prize with Metchnikoff, who was an embryologist

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:21.260
 who saw immunity as the whole organism maintaining itself, a total inclusive concept of what

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:29.900
 immunity or resistance is, where Ehrlich proposed a theory that was ideal for selling

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:38.700
 magic bullet drugs. The concept of magic bullet was converted to the

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:47.740
 antibody theory of immunity that your B cells produced a specific immunity.

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:56.700
 So logically, if you don't have a specific drug for every conceivable disease,

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:05.820
 then you're going to need a vaccine for every existing or possible disease, because

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:17.260
 the antibody theory of immunity is really just a silver bullet, one drug to sell for one disease.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:23.900
 Great stuff. Okay, this one's from James B. and he says, "Question," okay, this kind of

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.820
 trends on the first question we talked about. He says, "Question, if your lab rat was supplementing

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:33.020
 with pregnenolone, progesterone, and DHE, and you had the task of building the most amount of muscle

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:38.780
 while somewhat preserving your health, could you outline a potential stack you would use?

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:44.460
 I was thinking about 50 milligrams of testosterone base along with 25 milligrams of masteron.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:51.580
 I know these aren't hepatoxic, but would you dissolve these into tocopherol and take sublingually

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.220
 before swallowing for maximal effect? P.S., your thoughts on low-dose Trenblone base?"

00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:07.580
 Even with natural testosterone, I think people are generally getting overdosed.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:17.820
 Very healthy, very young man might produce four or five milligrams of testosterone per day,

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:27.420
 and so one or two milligrams well-assimilated should give you a tremendous boost of virility

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:39.420
 and muscle strength. With DHEA, the teenage production is 12 to 15 milligrams, and so

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:50.540
 it goes steadily down with aging similar to testosterone, but by the time a person is 30

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:59.660
 or 40, five milligrams will still bring them up to a normal level of DHEA. The

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:07.580
 overdose is apparently the desired state.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:17.580
 I have a question about the amounts of steroids. Yes, a young, virile man will produce four to

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.060
 five milligrams of testosterone, but they also clear estrogen much more effectively than an

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:27.820
 older person, so their testosterone to estrogen ratio or testosterone to cortisol ratio is pretty

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:35.020
 high. An older person basically tends to be overloaded with both estrogen and cortisol

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:41.180
 while having their testosterone levels drop. So the four to five milligrams, yes, they will

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.380
 potentially bring up the testosterone levels up to the levels of a young, virile man, but they won't

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:51.100
 necessarily fix the issue with the high estrogen and high cortisol. So that person may not be

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:57.740
 necessarily feeling the same anabolic or mood boosting or whatnot effects that a younger person

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.700
 would get from such a dosage simply because their stress hormones are too high, and I think that

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:09.500
 may be why older people and bodybuilders in general, they're overdosing these steroids simply

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:14.300
 because they're not addressing the thyroid angle and they're trying to shut down their stress

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.940
 hormones by simply over flooding them and overcrowding them with these androgens.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.180
 That's why that may be one reason why they're using such high doses.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:34.060
 For several reasons, thyroid is our basic anabolic hormone. It directly activates protein synthesis,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:47.500
 lowers cortisol and the breakdown of protein and inhibits the effective cortisol and inflammatory

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:56.060
 things on aromatase. So it's aromatase and cortisol antagonist.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:03.660
 So basically an anabolic approach with steroids should always take into account thyroid, right?

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.100
 Or at least some other option of blocking cortisol in a safe manner.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:20.700
 Yeah, as a basic anabolic substance, the muscles, if they're under stress or

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:32.620
 enforced idleness, will cause the muscle to actually produce and secrete cortisol and estrogen.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:42.860
 And when they're properly activated with thyroid and activity, they will be a source of testosterone

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:47.820
 and a sink for cortisol.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:54.060
 Okay, great stuff. Thanks for that, guys. Okay, so this one's from Craig. He says,

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.540
 "Craig Doe, I've been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea induced by arterial

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:08.220
 ablation. I'm on meds that make me feel terrible. Tried cardioversion, didn't work.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:12.780
 I'm 53, fit, use a CPAP. Any ideas how to get off meds? Thank you."

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:24.060
 People who are using that CPAP are almost always hypothyroid and low in progesterone.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:35.980
 For many years, they've been curing sleep apnea with prothyroid things and progesterone.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:45.820
 Progesterone lowers the stress hormones, improves the depth of sleep, and maintains

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:58.300
 regular breathing and prevents hyperventilation. The real problem in sleep apnea is cyclic

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:08.300
 hyperventilation followed by cessation. When you go deficient in carbon dioxide,

00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:21.180
 your breathing stops and you could even die from respiratory arrest if you are producing so little

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:30.220
 carbon dioxide. So thyroid and progesterone directly correct the problem. Acetazolamide

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:40.620
 has been used, I think, for 50 or 60 years to treat sleep apnea. It indirectly raises your

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:46.700
 carbon dioxide level and keeps stimulating your breathing through the night.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.460
 Amazing. Thank you for that, Ray. This next one is from…

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:55.100
 I have something to add. Most drugs on the market currently for AFib, which is the

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:01.820
 common name for atrial fibrillation, are blood thinners. The flagship drug known as Xarelto

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:08.220
 was approved by the FDA with the FDA's knowledge that the clinical trials conducted in Mexico and

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:13.260
 other Latin American countries were 100% fraudulent. There's a famous article by

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:19.900
 the Slate magazine, which came out in, I think it was 2016 or 2017, where they did an exposé of how

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:25.900
 FDA knew that the trials were fraudulent. Not simply deficient, but fraudulent. Data was made up

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:32.140
 to support the approval of the drug. When Slate and other journalists tried to contact

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:38.220
 FDA, basically FDA refused to comment on it and threatened the journalists that they will sue

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:43.660
 them and impose a gag order if they continue walking around and talking how Xarelto is a

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:49.820
 dangerous, potentially murderous drug. So I would try to get off that drug because there are many

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:56.300
 other safer blood thinners. A subsequent trial was done outside of the United States. I forgot

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.660
 where, but it compared aspirin to Xarelto and found aspirin to be more effective and safer.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:09.980
 So I think Xarelto may be causing a lot of these problems, especially with the lowering of carbon

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.140
 dioxide. It's really not a safe drug. Wait, you're saying the pharmaceutical

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:19.020
 companies are corrupt, Georgie? I'm saying the FDA is corrupt.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:24.220
 Okay. I had never heard that before. Okay. That is wild. Okay. Thank you for that, Georgie. Thank

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:32.300
 you, Ray. Okay. This was from Mohammed and he says, "Question for Dr. Ray Peet. My mom is borderline

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:39.180
 diabetic, removed thyroid and has pain in her feet that bothers her a lot. What can she do to treat

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:45.900
 this?" What was her thyroid condition? I think she had it removed, he said.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:55.500
 Oh, well, the doctors likely prescribe thyroxine and in women, thyroxine

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:03.740
 fails to be activated properly because of estrogen interfering with liver function,

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:10.700
 which should account for about two-thirds of your active thyroid function. So

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:20.460
 for most women, thyroxine being what doctors like to prescribe just isn't correcting the problem.

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:29.340
 And so getting on a real thyroid supplement is essential when you've had the gland removed.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.380
 And maybe you feel confident in armor in the U.S. right now?

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:44.140
 I haven't tried any armor in recent years, but I haven't heard any new bad things about it. For

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:50.300
 several years, they were going back and forth, failing FDA tests and so on. But for several

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:59.340
 years now, I haven't heard bad things about it. So it's the only glandular right now that I would

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:11.340
 trust. But during the time that armor was being reformulated in the early 90s, I shifted to

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:21.020
 the synthetics, first thyrol-R formulated by Armor to exactly imitate natural armor thyroid

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:27.260
 and then Sinoplus, which exactly imitated the thyrol-R formula,

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:33.820
 and made by the same company that makes Sino-Mal or Pure T3.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:41.740
 And so those have been very reliable now for at least 30 years.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:49.420
 Thank you for that amazing stuff. Okay, we're coming up on 45 minutes or so. Thank you, Ray.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:54.380
 Thank you, Georgie. I sincerely appreciate you guys making this show possible. Harrison, huge,

00:45:54.380 --> 00:46:01.100
 gigantic donation. Thank you so much, Harrison. Thank you. Make all this possible. Matthew T.,

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:06.300
 also another extremely generous donation. Thank you, guys. And then we'll move on to these super

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:13.420
 chats. Maybe we'll take a quick break here, Ray, and maybe we can talk about Progest-E for just a

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:21.020
 millisecond. So 3,400 milligrams of progesterone per bottle dissolved in vitamin E. You can email

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:28.940
 Keenogen@gmail.com, aka Catherine, and you can... She'll ship it extremely fast. She just shipped

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:33.100
 me 12 bottles of it. It's sitting in my refrigerator right now. And Ray, do you want

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:40.060
 to dip into your gigantic bag of positive progesterone stories and say anything about it?

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.500
 Oh, no, nothing occurs to me right now.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:53.900
 Okay, one thing you said on the vitamin D with Kate Deering and Kitty was you didn't really

00:46:53.900 --> 00:47:01.180
 think of it like a hormone. It's just this generalized stabilizing factor in cells. And so

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:06.140
 I think you said that before, but that resonated when you talked about it. That was like a...

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:18.380
 The brain is a major source and goal of progesterone, and men have just as much in their

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:29.820
 brain or should as women. And it's involved in the cell division process all the way up to

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:39.740
 nerve and muscle function. Every conceivable thing in higher animals depends on progesterone.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:45.980
 Great stuff. Thank you for that. So Keenogen@gmail.com. You can message Catherine,

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.020
 and she's very nice, and she'll send out the progesterone very quickly. So

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:55.660
 thanks to Catherine. Thanks to Keenogen. Okay, Nick P174 just donates $10. Thank you for that,

00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:02.860
 Nick. RisingStronger4999 says, "For Dr. Pete, I've heard you mention milk and fruit as the

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:08.300
 cosmic diet and wonder if there is an ethical component to how you view and structure your

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:17.180
 nutrition. Thanks to the three of you." Yeah, it has to do with cosmic entropy, actually.

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:33.340
 It's why the whole energy concept of existence involves the

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:48.060
 cephalization process in all animate beings, and you can trace those processes of increasing

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:58.460
 consciousness and brain development through the physics of the universe. It all has to do with

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:14.700
 maintaining order, and it happens that milk and fruits are the simplest and

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:22.460
 most order-preserving way to integrate your life with the cosmos.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:32.140
 I love it. Thanks for that, Ray. Okay, this one's from Umar, and they say, "Does a benign tumor have

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:42.700
 a similar metabolism to a cancerous one? I have had a benign osteochondrodroma on my upper femur

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:47.740
 since childhood. What ways/supplementing can help in removing it? Thank you all."

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:57.740
 If it's quiescent, not inflamed or growing, no, it doesn't have the cancer metabolism. It's

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:06.940
 just a structural defect, but any inflammation, according to the degree of the inflammation,

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.700
 is going to start having the cancer metabolism.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:15.820
 Great stuff. Thanks, Dr. Vian. I wanted to mention,

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:22.620
 rubbing progesterone on it, since it's simply a fibrotic structure, may help a lot. There are some

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:27.340
 older studies that seem to have stopped around the '70s that kept calling progesterone the most

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:32.860
 potent anti-fibrotic chemical known to man, and they suddenly stopped. I guess the pharmaceutical

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:38.140
 industry got involved, but they had success in animal studies by applying progesterone topically

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:46.620
 or subcutaneously and managing to dissolve multiple metastases of much worse and malignant tumors.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:52.140
 I don't see a reason why it couldn't be applied in this case as well.

00:50:53.100 --> 00:51:01.820
 Yes, the anti-fibrotic effect I've seen examples of hundreds of times. I think the reason they

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:11.900
 stopped talking about that effect is that the mechanism involves interfering with estrogens,

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:21.340
 pro-fibrotic effect activating nitric oxide and serotonin. That group of inflammatory

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:31.260
 things, estrogen, nitric oxide, and serotonin, are all blocked by progesterone, and those are the

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:37.340
 degenerative pro-fibrotic substances.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.500
 Great stuff. Thanks for that, guys. This one's from James. He says, "Hi, guys. I've had man boobs

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:48.620
 for years, which recently developed into gynecomastia, but only on my left breast.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.540
 Is there a way to reverse this? Thank you."

00:51:50.540 --> 00:52:02.540
 Just today, I got an email saying that his chest fat and gynecomastia regressed thoroughly

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:09.180
 from taking quite a bit of progesterone, but I think it's essential to

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:16.620
 use vitamin D and thyroid and all of the anti-aromatase

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:23.100
 substances, including some aspirin, to keep it under control.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:28.940
 Amazing. Great stuff. This one's from another James. They say, "When approximately did the

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:34.860
 United States transform from a constitutional republic into an empire, or was the USA always

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:42.780
 set up to be one from the beginning?" Well, the spreading from the colonies across the continent,

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:50.540
 taking the western United States away from Mexico and then following that up with

00:52:52.220 --> 00:53:03.260
 war against Spain to take the Philippines and Cuba, the imperial mentality goes back

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:17.820
 almost to the beginning, but the 20th century has been steady imperialism with the

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:32.060
 banana republics being kept in line with sending battleships every year so they would

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:41.580
 threaten another country in the hemisphere. There was a temporary let up with FDR's good

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:58.060
 neighbor policy. We're as good as we are. Ray, are you still there? I just actually—

00:53:58.060 --> 00:53:58.620
 Yeah, he's there.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:03.100
 Okay, I just lost everything. Okay, we're back. Sorry about that. Go ahead, Ray. Sorry.

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:21.340
 It has just grown in its intensity. Starting right at FDR's death, policies were absolutely

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:28.700
 180 degrees reversed where he had planned a post-war anti-imperialist policy.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:40.540
 He had a conference with Wendell Willkie. They agreed that whichever party won after his term was

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:54.300
 up would follow the decolonization anti-imperialist world policy, but it happens that Willkie got a

00:54:54.300 --> 00:55:05.740
 cold and died at a very young age. Then just before Roosevelt could find out that Alan Dulles

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:17.020
 was committing treason and aligning himself with the German intelligence system to take over the

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:27.420
 world, Roosevelt died just before he could learn that fact, and so immediately with his death,

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:35.020
 the Dulles faction took over with a single-minded imperialism

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:41.500
 that has been followed steadily.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:47.500
 Great stuff. Thanks for that. I'm getting told that the audio is a little bit wonky,

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:51.020
 but I guess we're just going to have to keep going here. I don't know what's wrong. This

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:59.660
 is why we're trying to buy new equipment. Okay, where was I here? Okay, Nick says, "Hey guys,

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:06.140
 say a guy lost the ability to ejaculate and then also slowly over a period of a couple years

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:11.420
 was also basically unable to get an erection. What things would be the most important to look into?"

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:19.420
 Having blood tests would be very useful to see what your cortisol and estrogen,

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:25.180
 DHEA, progesterone and thyroid, and testosterone are doing.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:35.260
 I want to add to that that sometimes doctors will just test the testosterone, but several

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:40.140
 large human studies show that you can have erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:45.100
 and fertility problems even in men with normal levels of testosterone and DHEA,

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:51.980
 as long as either prolactin or estradiol are either elevated or in the top 25th percentile

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:55.420
 of the "normal" range, which we know is not really normal.

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:05.980
 Great stuff, guys. Thank you. Okay, this one's another from Nick, and he says, "My heart rate

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.780
 is in the low 50s while sitting, but while standing and also resting, it's in the 80s.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.900
 Should the sitting be close to the 80s causes?"

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:22.940
 I think it should be higher than that unless there's some reason. If you have a really big

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:34.140
 heart, it can pump a lot of blood with the pulses as low as 50, but ordinarily, you aren't pumping

00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:40.620
 enough blood to keep things in very good health if it's running that slow.

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:45.020
 And that would just be a general sign of hypothyroidism, right?

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.620
 I think so.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:55.500
 Great stuff. Okay, Space 99 Yak says, "Is the herb Bouttia superba root good for DHT?"

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.620
 I've never heard of it.

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:00.700
 Any thoughts, George?

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:07.660
 I have to look it up. I've heard of the herb, but I don't know through what mechanism it would be

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:14.140
 good for DHT. I know nettle root is actually a drug in Germany, and they're using it to treat

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:19.740
 prostate problems. And they kept saying for years that, "Oh, it's because it lowers the androgens."

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:25.420
 And then it turned out it actually contains aromatase inhibitors and is raising DHT instead

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:25.980
 of lowering it.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:34.220
 Great stuff. Okay, this one's from Gazamongo, and they say, "Can the thyroid be damaged with

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:41.100
 exogenous T3? Is the feedback loop shutting the thyroid down activated by a certain amount daily

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:46.940
 or per dose? I.e., could small doses be additive rather than a replacement?"

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:58.460
 If you get as much thyroid function as you need, the gland should adjust itself. It's always

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:16.460
 responsive to signals such as adrenaline and TSH. You can shut the TSH down completely,

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:24.780
 and then if you stop shutting it down with the large doses, it pops back very quickly.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:36.140
 I've seen my own thyroid gland when I was taking 50 micrograms of T3 per day. I developed

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:46.220
 holes about as big as my index finger on each side of my Adam's apple. Between that and the

00:59:47.020 --> 01:00:00.540
 muscles. So I stopped taking the T3 for just a day or two, and immediately within 24 hours,

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:10.940
 my neck had leveled out. The gland swells and shrinks according to need.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:21.660
 So a lot of doctors will talk about suppressing or damaging your thyroid gland by supplementing

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:30.460
 because their reasoning from what happens to your adrenals or testicles if you overdose

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:41.820
 on one of the hormones, high cortisol or glucocorticoid use can cause your adrenals to

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:52.060
 shrink to the point that if you suddenly stop the supplement, you might die from the absence of

01:00:52.060 --> 01:01:01.580
 adrenal production. But the adrenals will gradually, over about a month, recover if you

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:07.820
 are well-nourished after you've totally suppressed them with too much cortisol.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:13.980
 The thyroid gland only takes a day or so to completely recover.

01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:17.260
 Thanks for that, Ray. Kana?

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:22.300
 I have a question about pregnenolone and the adrenals. As you know, Ray, the older studies

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:26.700
 in the early 20th century showed that when you give people under stress pregnenolone,

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:33.340
 it decreases their output of 17-kilo steroids. Isn't that a sign of potential partial adrenal

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.060
 suppression by pregnenolone, or is it simply giving them a break?

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:51.340
 I think it's supplying whatever function they were producing so they aren't needed. In the study of

01:01:51.340 --> 01:02:03.580
 rats, they measured their cortisol production and other hormones and found a normal variation.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:12.860
 Most of them weren't normal. A few were hyperproducers of cortisol, but they gave them,

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:25.660
 I think it was 10 grams, injected a stomach full of powdered pregnenolone and then studied their

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:34.060
 hormones. There were no endocrine changes that they could detect except in those which had been

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:43.180
 under stress with high cortisol production. Their cortisol went down to normal, receiving those

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:51.660
 gigantic doses of pregnenolone. So the person that's under a lot of stress, pregnenolone

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:57.580
 doesn't just have an anti-cortisol effect, but it also gives the adrenals what they need,

01:02:57.580 --> 01:03:00.460
 gives the adrenals a break, I guess, for lack of a better word.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:10.060
 Yeah, the adrenals and gonads are potentially self-regulating. The pituitary is just

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:22.140
 there for an additional boost. When Han Selye was experimenting with removing adrenals,

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:34.620
 he found that after the tissue-stored steroids had dissipated, just a moderate amount of stress

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:44.460
 would kill the animals because they didn't have the adrenal resilience to meet the stress.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:56.780
 But where the ordinary rat would die from a little bit of a stressful situation, he noticed that the

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:07.900
 pregnant rats didn't even notice, had no ill effects from an increased adaptive stress.

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:20.220
 And so he experimented removing the adrenals and supplementing progesterone, and they lived

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:29.980
 a normal lifespan with no adrenal hormones at all. Progesterone supplement totally replaced

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:39.900
 all of the adrenal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol in particular.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:46.540
 Have you seen any studies that discuss the effects of pregnenolone specifically on the

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.740
 pituitary? I know there are a lot of studies by Selye and others.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:06.940
 Only that old 1950s study in which the cortisol was corrected.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:11.580
 So you think pregnenolone does have a direct effect on the pituitary?

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:22.140
 Yeah, the same way that any anti-stress substance, progesterone or sugar or aspirin, for example,

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:27.020
 will stop the exaggerated pituitary activity. Okay.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.300
 Great stuff. Thanks for that, guys. Okay, this one's from Joshua, and he says, "My wife is 24

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:37.020
 years old, experiencing low libido and hot flashes after having our second child. What

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:46.140
 can be done to bring her sex drive and energy back?" Generally, thyroid is the thing, but

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:53.340
 you have to check the whole nutritional pattern. Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D

01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:04.300
 interferes with your mitochondrial energy production, regardless of your thyroid status.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:13.820
 Drinking milk, taking vitamin D, drinking orange juice, and maybe supplementing

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:23.900
 thyroid would be the usual thing to do. Thanks for that, Ray. Okay, Kana for 2,440 yen,

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.140
 and she provides a sticker, and I can't really tell what's going on there. Thank you for that,

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:37.500
 Kana. No question there. Okay, so Space99yak says, "Your thoughts on how to reverse the aging

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:43.740
 process and increase healthspan. The basics and advanced stuff that you might not talk about as

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:59.340
 much." Carbon dioxide, very important for stopping the stress and degenerative processes, and

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:11.660
 vitamin D, calcium, and thyroid, and progesterone, part of their function is to normalize, optimize

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:19.980
 the balance between carbon dioxide and lactic acid. I have a question about carbon dioxide.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:28.380
 You talk about it in your articles. It is a Lewis acid, and you also talk about partial oxidation,

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:34.540
 putting the cell in an oxidized state. It has a structure similar to the quinones. It's much

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:40.380
 simpler, but it does have those two carbonyl groups. I'm not aware of any direct reaction

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:45.900
 in the organism where carbon dioxide actually directly takes an electron and becomes reduced

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:51.340
 in the process. How does its electron-withdrawing function work in the organism?

01:07:51.340 --> 01:08:04.860
 The inductive effect, wherever it's attracted to an electron-rich area, those electrons

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:18.300
 sort of bulge towards the Lewis acid that has an electron-attracting effect. The bulging of those

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:32.060
 electrons by induction through the carbon chain reduces the electron availability two or three

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:43.500
 carbons down the line. So the whole electronic quality of the whole protein molecule is affected

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:55.820
 in a shift towards positivity or relative electron deficiency. When you're full of CO2,

01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:07.500
 all of your proteins have that shift. The flavonoids from orange juice and milk and lots of

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:20.140
 fruits and vegetables, they can, by partial oxidation, like vitamin C inside the cell

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:32.540
 becomes oxidized and then becomes an electron recipient. The flavonoids become similar electron

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:42.780
 tractors and shift the whole structure of the cell into that relatively partial electron

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:54.940
 deficient state. That affects, through the inductive effect, one protein has its influence

01:09:54.940 --> 01:10:05.980
 on surrounding proteins. So the whole system is a cooperative electron slightly deficient

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:14.220
 condition, an acidic condition. In other words, the whole cell turns into an acid.

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:23.340
 So a more specific example, let's say you have a molecule of NADH, the reduced version of NAD,

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:27.580
 it's the electron carrier. So the presence of high amounts of carbon dioxide, would they be

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:33.580
 able to directly oxidize NADH back into NAD or would they have a more indirect effect?

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:41.100
 Indirect, shifting the whole system, activating the electron transport chain,

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:51.580
 turning off lactic acid production, shifting the balances everywhere towards

01:10:54.300 --> 01:11:04.380
 reducing lactic acid and NADH and glutathione, shifting it towards the oxidized balance.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:10.140
 And the flavonoids, looking at their structure, they actually are capable of becoming fully

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:15.180
 electron withdrawing agents, right? They will actually be able to oxidize the NADH back to NAD.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:25.260
 Yeah, that seems to be why things like fisetin have an anti-aging effect. They turn off the

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:34.940
 inflammation and stress excess of electron production. And one of the ways you have to

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:42.940
 think about it is that this isn't a static condition. It's a pressure of electrons

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:54.620
 flowing. There are electrons in motion between the energy source and the electron consuming

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:04.780
 cytochrome oxidase. So if you think of the Venturi effect in gas or water,

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:14.940
 the pressure goes down as the speed of flow increases. So what thyroid and these

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:24.060
 substances, peroxidative substances do is to accelerate the flow of electrons,

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:34.540
 decreasing the risk of random lipid peroxidation by escaped electrons because as the flow increases

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:42.380
 the pressure, the electronic pressure decreases. So the whole cell becomes shifted away from

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:52.460
 electrons towards oxidation. So in theory, raising carbon dioxide and having the presence of these

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:56.060
 direct electron withdrawing agents would be even more therapeutic?

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:07.260
 Yeah. I don't think anyone knows what the upper limit of oxygen consumption is, but

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:21.180
 health and longevity, as far as anyone has tested, will increase as that flow rate increases.

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:30.540
 Have you seen that recent study on Fisetin being a very effective senolytic chemical?

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:40.060
 Yeah, I think it's more than that. I think it can actually correct the inflammatory process and not

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:46.140
 have to kill the cells. Do you think things like naringenin, apigenin, and other similar

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:52.940
 flavonoids would have similar effects? Yeah, a lot of them have been tested, for example, for

01:13:52.940 --> 01:14:03.580
 preventing or treating radiation sickness, the ultimate in electron excess disease.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:11.500
 They're very powerful in protecting against or curing radiation injury.

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:16.700
 So it sounds like a glass of orange juice and a little bit of vitamin B1 would be a

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:24.300
 great combination as an anti-aging agent. Yeah, probably every few minutes a glass of orange

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:31.180
 juice. Great stuff. Thanks for that, guys. Okay, Space99Yak. Or you know what? This is another one

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.340
 about ivermectin. We kind of already talked about that, but they say, "Can ivermectin help protect

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:41.260
 against the harms of the spike proteins modified by the AstraZeneca DNA vaccine by occupying spike

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:53.740
 protein receptors?" I don't know if that connects between ivermectin and the receptors.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:58.780
 We said earlier that was a risky substance, and so it's like combining

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:05.500
 two risky substances together, basically. I think a safer method would be trying to

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:10.380
 raise the levels of the ACE2 enzyme because that's what the spike protein binds to,

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:22.220
 if I'm not mistaken. Right. The medical establishment got it exactly backward

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:35.180
 and the things that increase the ACE2 substance and the 1-7-antitensin fragment, which

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:43.100
 is the result of ACE2 action, those are increasingly recognized as the therapeutic and

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:55.420
 curative agents. And so everything that we know of as protective against COVID involves the increase

01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:03.180
 of the 1-7-antitensin and the ACE2 enzyme that produces it. Thanks for that. I found a very

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:08.540
 interesting study showing that progesterone directly increases quite dramatically the levels

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:14.700
 of ACE2 while at the same time lowering the amount of ACE. So it should have a double

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:20.700
 punch effect, like protecting both from COVID and potentially the spike protein. Of course,

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:26.220
 there are many other bad things in the vaccine, but I think progesterone seems promising based

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:33.020
 on that study for protection against at least the virus. Yeah, and it's safe to use all the time

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:39.180
 preventively. Do you think it may help? I mean, I know there are studies about progesterone and

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:44.380
 influenza. Have you seen any studies about progesterone and other viral particles?

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:54.860
 Yeah, it actually has some antiviral or anti-replication effects, stabilizing the cell

01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:02.540
 that makes the virus not have any support for replicating.

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:08.620
 Thanks for that. Okay, Space 99 Yak says, "Any way of getting rid of acne scars?"

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:22.140
 Depends on what the scar is like. If it's still inflamed, sort of like a slight keloid,

01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:32.700
 vitamin E and progesterone applied to it can shut off the production of inflammatory things like

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:39.500
 estrogen and nitric oxide and restore the tissue to more or less normal,

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:47.420
 so it loses the inflamed appearance. I have another thing to add. There's a human

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:52.700
 study showing that a 4% niacinamide solution—separate studies, actually. One used 4%

01:17:52.700 --> 01:18:00.060
 niacinamide solution in water. The other one used 1% aspirin solution in water. Both of these help

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:06.860
 to reduce the formation of scars, even in severe acne. I think combining them into one solution,

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:13.660
 4% and 1% would probably work even better. Great stuff. Okay, this is from Ellie, and they say,

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:20.220
 "Morning temps not budging, but day temps improves on thyroid. Why?"

01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:33.260
 So they're taking thyroid—go ahead. That's pretty good. While you're lying in bed,

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:42.060
 hypothyroidism isn't doing so much damage, so the important thing is to keep the numbers

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:48.700
 optimal and steady during the daytime. Thanks for that. Thanks, Ellie. Thanks, Ray.

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:52.860
 Janet Pack, again, another—a lot of these people are chronic supporters of the show,

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:58.860
 but she just sent a sticker for $50. Thank you so much, Janet. DBO514 for $10 says,

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:05.340
 "Get yourself some gear, son." Thank you so much, DBO514. Kirk says, "What's the best strategy for

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:10.700
 someone with diabetes with swollen purple legs and significant water retention?" Thank you all.

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:23.980
 I would start with vitamin D, getting adequate calcium, normalizing thyroid, progesterone,

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:36.380
 and pregnenolone, and then when you get your metabolism steady and some of the edema reduced,

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:51.020
 then shifting the diet chronically, probably decreasing total protein somewhat to keep your

01:19:51.020 --> 01:20:03.420
 total fat intake lower. Any kind of reliance on fat for energy is going to interfere with your

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:14.940
 sugar use, and the thyroid and calcium and vitamin D are going to help restore your ability to

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:22.540
 oxidize glucose. Thanks, Kirk. Thanks, Ray. Teresa and Diana both

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:27.820
 sent super chats, but no questions. Thank you, Diana. Thank you, Teresa. Another one from

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:33.100
 SpaceX. They say, "Best med/supplements to increase mitochondria and mitochondrial function."

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:45.980
 Carbon dioxide is essential and very powerful for that, and so all of the things that support

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:55.740
 oxidative metabolism are going to shift you towards the better supply of carbon dioxide,

01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:04.780
 and the antitension inhibitors are starting to be recognized as supporting mitochondrial

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:10.220
 energy production, reducing inflammation and degeneration.

01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:14.140
 So the boutique supplement of breathing into a bag, right?

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:24.940
 Yeah. Okay. Kirk has another question here. He says, "My 67-year-old mother has one 1.2-centimeter

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:35.660
 nodule on her thyroid. Her TSH is 2.5, free T4 1.0. However, her TPOAB is 32.9 IU/ML,

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:40.700
 which is well beyond the 5.5 limit. What would you suggest to correct the nodule?" Thank you.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:49.340
 Which one was high? TPOAB, thyroid peroxidase. Is that what it is? TPOAB, 32.9.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:22:00.780
 Correcting, getting the TSH down to something like 0.4 would be tremendously helpful.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:06.940
 Thanks for that, Ray. Thanks, Kirk. Cornelius says, "Any thoughts on how to treat excess

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:13.020
 saliva? It happens whenever I eat, I get massive excess saliva. Foods high in choline,

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:17.020
 eggs, etc. are a lot worse, I think. It is a cholinergic crisis."

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:27.580
 Often, getting your thyroid going helps to shift your balance towards sympathetic

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:33.020
 adrenaline activity and suppress the parasympathetic.

01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:40.460
 Thanks for that, Cornelius. Thanks, Ray. Zachary says, "16-year-old, breast cancer,

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:55.420
 received radiation, had a lump enectomy, had a couple lump scars since. Now 19,

01:22:55.420 --> 01:23:00.460
 what remedies would you recommend to help prevent it coming back? Lower estrogen/corazol?"

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:14.140
 Sure. Thyroid, vitamin D, and aspirin are very powerful protectants against

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.580
 estrogen and cancer development.

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:23.740
 Thanks for that, Zachary. Thanks, Ray. Cornelius has another one. He says, "Does Ray have any

01:23:23.740 --> 01:23:28.700
 thoughts as to why taking supplemental T3 may cause a negative change in body odor?"

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:34.940
 Negative being worsening? That's what I assume.

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:49.900
 Yeah, it can increase your sweat production. And just taking one or two showers with 10% sulfur

01:23:49.900 --> 01:24:01.260
 soap can eliminate permanently a bad balance of bacteria on your skin and can make a difference in

01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:09.100
 the odor of your body, the sweat, for a long time.

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:15.900
 Thanks for that, Ray. Thanks, Cornelius. Simon says, "What are your opinions on nicotine as a

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:20.700
 pro-metabolic substance, and is there some overlap with nicotinamide?"

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:27.740
 No, I don't think there's any overlap that I've ever run across.

01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:33.180
 What about you, George? Do you know of any overlap?

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:39.340
 I don't know of any overlap. I think there's some evidence that nicotine in low-dose—well,

01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:44.780
 actually, there's some studies showing that it's a powerful aromatase inhibitor, and there's some

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:50.300
 other components of tobacco leaves, such as cotinine, which is structurally similar to

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:56.140
 nicotine, but they all seem to activate the adrenergic, the sympathetic system when overdone.

01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:01.980
 So the animal studies that I've seen that show protection for Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's

01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:08.380
 disease, heart disease, and cancers, they use the equivalent of one to two milligrams daily,

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:13.180
 which is half a cigarette. And I think most people that use the nicotine gums or the patches, they

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:19.580
 consume drastically more, and it very quickly becomes a stress agent. At least that's what I've

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:28.860
 seen. On the excess saliva question, I should have mentioned that the things that promote

01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:41.180
 the sympathetic system, such as atropine or even the anticholinergic effects of ciproheptadine

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:51.980
 and the antihistamines, are likely to help. Great stuff. Thanks for that, guys. Okay,

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:58.140
 Victoria says, "How do I lengthen my menstrual cycle, both follicular and luteal phase? I'm

01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:03.500
 26 years old, and my cycle ranges from 23 to 29 days, with 26 being the average."

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:17.740
 That seems close enough, but increasing the thyroid level will lower the estrogen,

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:27.900
 and sometimes that will make it click into a very standard 28-day cycle. But I've never seen any bad

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:35.340
 effects associated with a variation of only 26 to 29 days.

01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:41.900
 Great stuff. Thanks for that, Ray. Okay, our buddy Comrade James for $30,

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:48.540
 you asked, but no question. Thank you, Comrade James. Francis Bacon Cheeseburger says,

01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:53.500
 "Recommendations for daily progesterone routine for a male in their 30s?"

01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:07.180
 If you don't have any symptoms, I think just a drop or two of progesterone or maybe 5 mg

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:16.860
 has probably a protective general stamina increasing effect.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:24.940
 We get a lot of people saying they're taking, men taking 20, 30 mg, you know, like and they seem to

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:30.700
 be doing really well on it, and that seems to be some, George and I are both constantly inundated

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:35.740
 with that anecdote, so that is very interesting. Go ahead.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:44.460
 Yes, sometimes that's enough to shrink a man's penis temporarily, but for others,

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:52.060
 because it inhibits the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, sometimes it's powerfully

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:59.100
 libido promoting protestosterone, but it's very individual.

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:07.100
 I get emails all the time from men over 50 saying that they're using 100 mg from progeste

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.740
 and they recovered their morning erections, which they had lost like 20 years ago.

01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:13.180
 Very good.

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:19.020
 Thanks for that, Ray, and thank you, Francis Bacon Cheeseburger. Okay,

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.940
 I think that's the same question we already talked about with James. Zach says, "Do people

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:30.380
 typically experience negative symptoms during the process of reducing endotoxin, cortisol,

01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:34.380
 serotonin, or estrogen, i.e. getting worse before they get better?"

01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:48.460
 I always doubted that's an old medical trick. I give you my personally compounded drug and

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:58.620
 you get very sick. That's evidence that it's curing you. When you get sick after a vaccine,

01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:05.980
 that's evidence that it's working, they are saying now, but that's been a constant,

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:14.540
 centuries-old ploy of the medical industry to say you have to get worse before you get better.

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:17.660
 Yeah, when they cut, burn, or poison you, you're going to get worse first.

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:22.060
 Or at least they're saying, "Look, we actually gave you something that does have an effect,

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:29.180
 it's not a placebo." Isn't there a name for this? I think it's called a Hertzheimer reaction?

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:40.940
 Yeah, that's basically the same thing, a medical intention to defend the harm they do.

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:47.980
 So the heroic therapy for cancer is basically an extreme version of that,

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:56.220
 they kill you in order to save you. Yeah, the statistics show that the

01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:06.620
 survival rate has never been improved by surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy as a whole.

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:16.700
 Individual studies are constantly showing it, but if you added up the thousands of individual

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:25.500
 evidence of benefit, it would be very strange that on the whole population you see,

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:30.940
 if anything, a slightly worsening of the outcome.

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:37.420
 I'm just refreshing my page here so I can get more of the super chats. Who was the guy,

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:43.500
 Harry Rubin, Henry Rubin, the guy that went across the world and he found that treating cancer was of

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.620
 no value at all, at least by standard medical procedures?

01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:58.140
 Yeah, I was at a seminar, 1969 I think, a world conference on the immune system,

01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:11.420
 and he and a beginning Oregon instructor in biology was the only truth-oriented people there.

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:17.580
 All of the big shots from around the world were there and they were all doing their phony thing,

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:25.740
 and Harry Rubin and this young professor, no one listened to them very much, but

01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:39.180
 they actually had facts and supported evidence and interesting stories that

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:47.500
 showed the falseness of what all the immunologists were doing.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:52.940
 Amazing. We have about 30 more minutes here, so we'll rush through these, not rush through,

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:56.780
 we'll try to get through as many questions as possible. Ray, Pete, thank you so much for doing

01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:01.420
 this. I sincerely appreciate it. Georgie Dinkov, thank you so much for being my partner in crime

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:06.220
 and always doing all of these and making the show what it is. Thank you to both of you guys. Thank

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:10.780
 you for our amazing listenership, which is extremely dedicated and loyal and sincerely

01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:15.900
 appreciate all of you guys so much. Jordan for $5, no message. Thank you so much, Jordan.

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:23.020
 Elliot Cactus says, "How is THC and CBD understood in the bioenergetic view of health? Any

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:29.820
 recommendations, dietary supplements/drugs/lifestyle for regular marijuana users?"

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:37.660
 Oh, THC, was that the question?

01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:41.500
 Yeah, how is THC and CBD understood in a bioenergetic view?

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:52.940
 I've been looking for the real beneficial effects, and it's always very ambiguous as far as I can

01:32:52.940 --> 01:33:05.500
 see. It is sedative and in some circumstances anti-inflammatory, but not always. And for many

01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:13.340
 years, I haven't been able to resolve the ambiguity to have a definite opinion.

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.980
 Thanks for that. Thank you, Elliot.

01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:22.140
 One more thing for me to add. A study from 2017 came out, demonstrated that pregnenolone can

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:28.620
 antagonize most of the intoxicating effects of marijuana, which is probably not what people are

01:33:28.620 --> 01:33:33.740
 looking for. They're trying to get high on it. But also animal studies subsequently showed that

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:40.300
 it can protect from some of the anti-androgenic effects and estrogenic effects of marijuana as

01:33:40.300 --> 01:33:46.380
 well. So I guess if somebody's using heavily marijuana and wants to continue to use it, which

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:53.020
 I don't think is a good idea, but if that's their thing, the human equivalent of about 30 to 50

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:58.300
 milligrams of pregnenolone based on the mouse study seems to be able to block most of the

01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:01.180
 negative effects and some of the positive if sedation is your thing.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:08.540
 Thanks for that, guys. Appreciate it. Okay, David Boye for 499. Thank you. No message. Thank you,

01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:12.780
 David. Jordan, okay, this might have been his question. He says, "Preparing for dark days

01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:19.100
 ahead, what supplements should my wife and I have on hand and how do you recommend storing

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:26.380
 us dogs, chickens living in MN?" Is that in Minnesota? Minnesota. Yeah.

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:38.460
 Dark days in what sense? IE, cyber attacks, BLM infiltration in your home.

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:44.140
 I guess all the things we're chronically talking about. Food chain. Yeah, food chain disruptions

01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:53.500
 and things like that. Having some stable calorie supplies and some protein,

01:34:53.500 --> 01:35:04.780
 if the crisis comes, you're going to want to share your supplies with the people who didn't stock up.

01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:14.380
 The quantity that you put away should be economical and long-lasting. We happen to have

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:23.420
 a barrel or two of coconut oil and it's always good to have a few 20-pound bags of sugar

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:33.980
 and maybe 40 pounds of gelatin powder on hand. Great stuff. Great suggestions. KBP.

01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:39.020
 Quick question about the food. Ray, have you seen that Walmart sells this thing called

01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:44.860
 Astronaut Food Supply? They're basically commercializing what NASA did in the '70s.

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:52.780
 Basically, it's powdered eggs, dehydrated milk, sugar. I think they have some kind of a starch,

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:57.580
 which I don't remember what the source of that was. Basically, they claim it's a complete diet

01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:05.260
 that can last for a century at room temperature. They're selling three-month, six-month,

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.500
 12-month supplies. Do you think there's any value in getting those dehydrated eggs and milk,

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:17.420
 or do you think it's dangerous? I've always wanted to have a good supply of powdered milk on hand,

01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:28.380
 but I've been having trouble finding out exactly how they prepare the particles that don't clump.

01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:35.500
 I've been afraid that they're using nanoparticles as anti-clumping agents.

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:42.860
 For the present, I would not rely too heavily on that.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:49.180
 What about evaporated/condensed milk, which is sold in cans? You're basically getting the

01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:57.420
 equivalent of a gallon of milk in a small can? Yeah, I think that's good to have. The can

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:08.300
 might eventually deteriorate, but it'll last quite a while. Maybe some canned sardines.

01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:16.300
 Great stuff. Thanks for that. KBB for $9.99, no message. Thank you so much, KBB.

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:27.580
 New Health again says, "I seem to get a lump in my throat feeling and itchy spots/hives on my body

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:30.220
 from Sinomel/Sinoplus. Any solutions?"

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:40.540
 How fast was it taken? That's sometimes the problem. If you try to correct the problem

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:50.540
 in just a few days or a week, that can cause the gland to shrink so much that you get discomfort

01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:56.540
 in your throat. Interesting. We talked about it a little bit earlier. I think this is probably

01:37:56.540 --> 01:38:00.700
 worth clarifying. How much do you think is too much at one time with food?

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.820
 For a T3? Yeah, T3.

01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:17.660
 With a meal, 10 micrograms is probably the maximum that you want. Otherwise, it shouldn't be over 5

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:26.060
 micrograms at a time. The meal will spread it out quite a bit and make it a steadier supply.

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:31.340
 And last question for me, would you feel confident swallowing that tablet that it

01:38:31.340 --> 01:38:33.180
 would dissolve in the stomach or would you chew it?

01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:42.780
 Oh, I always chew. And the tablet helps you know somewhat what it's made of.

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:49.500
 Great stuff. Is there any benefit in taking thyroid with fat, long-chain fats, in order to

01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:53.180
 go through the lymphatic system instead of mostly going to the liver?

01:38:55.580 --> 01:39:05.980
 I think as it digests, it's going to distribute itself. The amino acids that are more

01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:12.220
 hydrophobic might get taken up in the chylomicrons.

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:21.660
 Great stuff. Thanks for that, guys. Okay, Tom says, "I've had numerous people note that

01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:25.660
 the development of varicose veins with pregnenolone and progesterone use."

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:27.580
 Please could Ray comment on this? Thanks all.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:35.020
 I would question the quality of the supplement used first

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:45.740
 because their biological functions are just the opposite. I've seen horribly bulging veins

01:39:47.500 --> 01:40:01.020
 normalize in an hour with a big dose of progesterone and more slowly with many big doses

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:12.140
 of pregnenolone. I think someone who got bad products reported that and started people

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:20.460
 thinking about it. If they don't get immediate improvement, they think they might be getting

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:27.580
 worse. I wanted to add something to that. It's very important to make the distinction between

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:33.100
 varicose veins and more well-defined veins. Sometimes people, when they have edema,

01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:39.660
 you can't even see the veins, even the contours on their hand or their legs. When they take

01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:46.220
 progesterone or pregnenolone, the edema rapidly decreases and then the veins become more visible.

01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:52.380
 That's not the same as varicose veins. I've never seen a person develop varicose veins from

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:59.580
 pregnenolone or progesterone. The effect when you get enough is exactly the opposite.

01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:11.820
 For example, a big vein known to be so bulging that it can't possibly have any valve action,

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:22.780
 with a very big dose of progesterone, the muscle can be activated to the point that the vein narrows

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:32.860
 and the flaps of the valve on each side of the vein can then reach each other and close off the flow.

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:38.300
 What would you consider a big dose in that context?

01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:47.660
 It depends on how high your estrogen is. If a person has very high estrogen, it might take

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:55.660
 400 milligrams of progesterone, but that amount would knock some people out.

01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:57.660
 We're talking orally, right?

01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:58.960
 Yeah.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.580
 Okay. Do you think there's any benefit in taking a lower dose orally to avoid the sedation and

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.780
 rubbing the other half on the actual vein?

01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:13.980
 Yeah. Putting it topically while taking a moderate dose is probably the best approach.

01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:20.620
 Great stuff. Okay. Gaza Mungo says, "Any critique on the croissant diet? Claims

01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:27.740
 SCD1 causes obesity and sugar raises that. It's a low PUFA, super high saturated fat diet."

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:34.780
 Whose diet? What diet?

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:39.580
 There was a study showing eating a ton of French croissants, which basically were baked with

01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:43.420
 almost fully saturated fat, but also, of course, a lot of starch in them,

01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:46.620
 led to a drastic weight loss and improvement in health.

01:42:46.620 --> 01:43:02.460
 The sucrose itself, some experiments show that you can increase the metabolic rate by 20%

01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:13.740
 just with sucrose. When you do it just right, sugar is a very powerful weight loss

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.140
 instrument.

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:24.140
 Great stuff. Thanks for that, Ray. Okay. We're heading to the end of our time here,

01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:28.460
 but I'll keep reading these. KT has no message. Thank you so much, KT, for your donation.

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:33.420
 Yodi the Wodol says, "Alcohol in terms of capitalizing on the social

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:42.620
 libidinal economy. I recently realized I wasn't drinking enough. What amount is best for

01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:47.820
 lipofuscin?" I wasn't drinking enough. That's great.

01:43:47.820 --> 01:44:01.420
 Vitamin E is known to be fairly effective at clearing up lipofuscin. Progesterone is effective,

01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:11.180
 and the amount of alcohol that can clear it up is very small. Something like a gram or two a day

01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:15.900
 is enough to have a helpful effect on lipofuscin.

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:22.060
 Okay. Space99Yak again says, "Georgie said the outer layer of the adrenal gland

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:29.340
 atrophy. Is there any way to reverse that if that happens to someone, and any way of knowing if it

01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:41.180
 has?" So, go ahead. Pregnenolone and progesterone both help to protect the adrenals so they can

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:47.260
 regenerate. What I meant by that comment was that with aging, the layer that produces DHEA

01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:51.900
 and pregnenolone tends to atrophy, and then the only one that remains is the cortisol-producing

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:58.460
 one. Ray, what was that guy? He has a series of excellent papers on this subject. I think Parker.

01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:03.020
 Do you know who I'm talking about? He studied this in depth.

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:14.060
 No. It doesn't ring a bell. No worries. Okay. Last few questions here. Spencer says, "30 male,

01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:22.540
 low total cholesterol, 116 to 119, and low DHEA for the last 10 years. Got the cholesterol up to

01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:29.100
 166, cutting starch, using the carrot salad, increasing sugar, fructose, and calcium. Have

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:35.820
 all hypo symptoms, but my temps and pulses are normal. Any advice why? Not on any thyroid."

01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:43.340
 What kind of symptoms are hyper? I'm not sure what that means.

01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:48.860
 Maybe I misspoke. He said hypo. So, I think this person had gynecomastia. I think he had

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:53.260
 thinning hair, and I think he had a kind of classical—I

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:58.380
 can't remember, maybe constipation as well, but kind of like classical types of hypo symptoms.

01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:10.940
 And temperature was normalized? I think he was reading them on a—they were higher,

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:15.500
 like through the day, but in general, I think this person felt terrible.

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:30.460
 The checking for anything pro-inflammatory in the diet would be a first step to see if

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:37.420
 inflammation was interfering with their function. Wouldn't sometimes very high cortisol and

01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:42.780
 serotonin produce like a high body temperature at the expense of destroying the muscles and

01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:50.460
 everything else? Yeah. The stress hormones generally rise when your thyroid is low, and

01:46:50.460 --> 01:47:01.180
 it takes quite a while when you're under stress to adapt fully to the thyroid supplement. So,

01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:12.060
 Bruno Barnes, over his career, learned that it was best to aim for three or four months

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:22.780
 for full correction with thyroid, and people got so impatient, they think of correcting efficiency

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:33.900
 as sort of a matter of a day or two, but it really—since the whole system has to evolve

01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:43.100
 in a different direction under the better energy supply, you should look at the time scale of

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:48.380
 something like three months. Yeah, I think he has a whole section on that in his book, like

01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:53.660
 what to expect and when, and when changes will occur and when they won't. Great stuff.

01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:59.820
 Okay, Andrew Gassile says, "Thank you. Tyromax is the bomb. I can sweat again." Thanks, Andrew.

01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:04.860
 Oscar Gomez for $5 but no message. Thank you, Oscar. MercyMe for $9.99 but no message. Thank

01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:12.460
 you, MercyMe. Ben says, "Take more of my money." Thanks, Ben. Carlos Rangel for just a sticker

01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:18.940
 but no message. Thank you, Carlos. Karlyn Brooks for $25 but no message. Thank you so much, Karlyn.

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:23.500
 And let me just refresh this page really quick, and while I'm doing that, Ray, what are you working

01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:32.060
 on right now? I'm not working on anything but thinking about some of the old themes,

01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:40.460
 giving them a new perspective. Atherosclerosis and estrogen, for example,

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:45.020
 something related to that is going to be my next newsletter.

01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:52.940
 Speaking of the older views, since Metchikoff was an embryologist, do you know of any field

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:56.620
 in medicine or science in general that's still retaining some of those views and teaching them

01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:04.940
 to the younger generations? No, they were all effectively erased from the profession

01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:15.660
 by the mid-1950s, and so a few of the very young people are starting to look around

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:23.340
 and might be hope for the future. I can't believe this. We're probably going to get through the

01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:27.260
 questions here. So guys, we have 187 people watching. Please give this episode a like. I

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:33.180
 know it's arbitrary but it really helps with the show. Again, thank you to Ray for sitting here and

01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:37.580
 being barraged by questions for two hours. Sincerely appreciate it. Thank you, Georgie Dinkov,

01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:40.940
 again, my partner in crime, making this all possible. So there's just a few more questions.

01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:45.820
 Maybe we can get through these and just call it a night. Okay, so I mentioned Karlin. This one's

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:52.220
 a scout, and they say, "Do you think magnetofection could have been added to the COVID vaccine to

01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:58.620
 facilitate the mRNA getting into the cell? Could that explain all the magnetic videos on the

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:10.380
 internet?" I don't think they had to add anything. The naked nucleic acids have no problem getting

01:50:10.380 --> 01:50:19.500
 into cells. I think they were calling the lipid coat a necessary way to get it in the cells,

01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:31.100
 but when they've compared lipid-encapsulated DNA molecules with free DNA, in some situations,

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:41.580
 the free DNA works better than the lipid-encapsulated forms. I think the real

01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:52.460
 situation is likely to be that the so-called lipid carrier is really a powerful adjuvant,

01:50:52.460 --> 01:51:02.540
 a source of inflammation. Thanks for that. Another sticker from Fuhiha. Thank you so much for that.

01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:08.060
 Peggy—hey, Peggy—she says, "How to use progesterone to postpone menopause. Thank you."

01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:17.500
 Oh, just using it cyclically is the important thing so that your liver doesn't get in the habit

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:26.380
 of excreting it too fast. You have to lay off for one or two weeks every month and stay on cycle

01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:35.660
 with it. I've mentioned before that I met a gynecologist who was in his 70s, and he had this

01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:41.740
 very young-looking wife. He said that I've been giving her progesterone every month for

01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:46.460
 20 years, and she's still menstruating at the age of 63.

01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:54.540
 That's amazing. Okay, this one's from Nancy. She just sends a sticker. Thank you so much, Nancy.

01:51:54.540 --> 01:52:01.020
 Space99yak again for—he says, "The benefits—talk about the benefits of allopregnanolone."

01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:17.500
 It's mostly what progesterone does. It's one of the important conversion products in the brain,

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:27.980
 a neurosteroid. And so everything we think of progesterone doing to mood perception, stability,

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:39.980
 stopping seizures, helping with psychosis, it's really partly the effect of the allopregnanolone.

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:48.220
 Amazing. Thanks, Space99yak. Thank you, Ray. And the last—maybe we have three questions left.

01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:53.500
 This one's from Gregory, and—what is the time here? Okay.

01:52:54.940 --> 01:52:59.260
 Gregory says, "For the last few years, my father has developed excessively dry palms to the point

01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:03.580
 they crack and the flesh is exposed. Doctors don't know what the cause is and just prescribe

01:53:03.580 --> 01:53:13.420
 ointments. Any ideas?" Thank you, Ray. Check his thyroid. It's responsible for both sebum

01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:20.940
 and sweat production in the skin. If your thyroid is low, your skin

01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:29.180
 almost invariably gets dry. Okay, the absolute last two questions here,

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:34.380
 then maybe we can talk about some cultural stuff, if you don't have to go, Ray. But this is from

01:53:34.380 --> 01:53:39.820
 Zach. He says, "How to tell sugar is converting into carbon dioxide versus lactic acid?"

01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:52.060
 You feel very good. And you might feel panic and anxiety to the extent that it's turning

01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:58.940
 to lactic acid. Thanks for that, Ray. Thank you, Zach. Okay,

01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:04.060
 last question here. Kirk, he says, "Hi, Ray. I think I have heard you mentioned in a talk that

01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:10.220
 1,000 calories a day while still getting all the RDA protein as well as for vitamins and minerals

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:14.300
 is an effective short-term way to lose weight in the short term. Any truth to this?"

01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:23.820
 Yeah, it isn't good for your health, but if you have to lose weight, keeping the minerals

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:35.020
 up is very important. Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium are very protective against

01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:42.860
 too much of the stress reaction. I have a related question. They're now

01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:50.060
 starting human studies with the drug RU486, which you have an article about mentioning,

01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:54.220
 the drug, Ray. And it's basically, even though it's known as the abortion pill, it was developed

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:59.260
 as a cortisol blocker. That was its original design and purpose. And now they're having

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:05.820
 several clinical trials showing sustained, rapid and sustained weight loss by using anywhere between

01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:11.580
 300 to 600 milligrams of that thing daily. Do you think something similar can be achieved with

01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:16.780
 progesterone instead of messing with the diet and drastically reducing the calories?

01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:28.380
 Yeah, carefully adjusting your thyroid and progesterone and DHEA, pregnenolone, those

01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:37.500
 can sustain a very high metabolic rate, increased body temperature, so that you burn calories

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:46.540
 much faster. And Piotr Bagniewski basically said, "How to burn fat while eating the Ray P inspired

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:51.580
 diet, I gained 10 pounds." And so it kind of intersects with what we were just talking about.

01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:53.740
 What should be the focus if a person is gaining weight?

01:55:53.740 --> 01:56:05.500
 Not to eat so many calories first, and then to gradually shift towards a lower fat intake,

01:56:07.180 --> 01:56:13.580
 whatever keeps your temperature up without having an excess of calories.

01:56:13.580 --> 01:56:21.580
 Then as your temperature stays higher, you'll be burning more calories and

01:56:21.580 --> 01:56:35.980
 able to eat more and more, up to maybe 3000 calories a day for a sedentary person

01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:37.580
 without getting fat.

01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:42.700
 Thanks for that. And Goalie Ag doesn't have a question, but they donated $20. Thank you,

01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:47.020
 Goalie. And then Space Yak again donated more cash. Thank you so much, Space Yak. We're going

01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:51.100
 to call it there. Ray, I don't like keeping you more than two hours. Is there anything

01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:55.740
 specifically interesting that you feel like needs a spotlight shined on that's happened

01:56:55.740 --> 01:57:01.340
 through medical or cultural or anything like that? Or do you have to go and we can also just let you

01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:01.840
 go?

01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:14.860
 Well, more and more kids are dying right after getting vaccinated. So I think more people are

01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:25.660
 starting to think in terms of murder rather than coincidental deaths when they get sudden

01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:36.940
 swelling of the heart that kills them. I think the public is slowly starting to wake up.

01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:43.260
 Didn't the CDC like stealth edit their page or something and say that kids actually did not need

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:47.340
 vaccine when they had been promoting the idea for a period of months or so?

01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:55.820
 Yeah, they said that very openly. And then the reaction from the press was such that they

01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:04.540
 erased it from their website. And someone who mentioned the original statement that kids

01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:14.620
 don't need the vaccination, his comment was censored as contrary to Facebook's policy.

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:21.340
 So in effect, the World Health Organization was censored by Facebook.

01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:28.220
 And people might not tolerate kids dying as much as they would just older adults.

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:36.380
 Yeah, everyone is fine with when 80 or 100 percent of the people in the

01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:43.180
 nursing home die right after getting vaccinated. But when a 13-year-old kid

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:51.580
 dies suddenly three days after his second vaccination, people are starting to question

01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:56.780
 authority. And then this won't be surprising to you, but I did peruse a paper. It was something

01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:03.660
 like 84-year-old man autopsy after first Pfizer vaccine. And the gist of the paper was something

01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:09.740
 like all of his vital organs contained the RNA, the viral, the spike protein or something.

01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:14.540
 And so again, just more confirmation of everything you've been saying since

01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:21.180
 March of 2020 that this whole thing is a total charade and it's not localized and that it likely

01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:25.340
 killed this person like 18 days after. And I guess this was like a landmark because it

01:59:25.340 --> 01:59:32.140
 was the first autopsy of somebody who'd been vaccinated. Yeah. And people should keep

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:42.060
 remembering that influenza was effectively wiped out by the surge in so-called COVID deaths,

01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:48.620
 meaning that the total pneumonia deaths didn't change.

01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:55.100
 Have you seen some of the new proposals in Congress and Senate to break up and rein in

01:59:55.100 --> 02:00:01.420
 big tech? Do you think there's any honesty to these efforts or do you think it's all a game?

02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:02.860
 To rein in what?

02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:07.340
 The big technology companies censoring people left and right and basically

02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:08.940
 destroying society as we know it.

02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:23.020
 It's hard to imagine that person surviving a breakup of the computer industry and Facebook

02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:36.220
 and Amazon. That's such a totalitarian system. I doubt that she's going to be able to

02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:41.100
 accomplish anything.

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:49.340
 Basically, the empire really depends on its survival on the big tech complex. So,

02:00:49.340 --> 02:00:53.020
 any attempt to subvert that will probably be met with brutality.

02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.580
 I would guess so.

02:00:55.580 --> 02:01:03.020
 And then last question, any thoughts on impending cyber attack? The cyber polygon,

02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:06.860
 the World Economic Forum, it's going to happen next month and it's not rare for

02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:13.100
 these things to go live after a month or two. Is there anything you're doing, Ray?

02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:18.860
 How would you survive if infrastructure and things collapsed?

02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:26.860
 After a while, I'm sure I would end up in Mexico.

02:01:26.860 --> 02:01:33.100
 But you don't really depend on the internet to live a productive life, do you?

02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.180
 No, not at all.

02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:41.100
 So, it may be a blessing in disguise. You'll simply go back to pen and paper and calling

02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:42.860
 people on the phone and meeting them in person?

02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.900
 Yeah, sort of hoping that that will happen, actually.

02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:53.580
 Yeah, it'd be kind of counterintuitive for the system that sustains the ignorance to be

02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:57.900
 turned off. But some people are saying people would go psychotic within a week or two. Do

02:01:57.900 --> 02:01:58.860
 you think there's any truth to that?

02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:00.720
 No.

02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:07.660
 Well, unless you define psychotic as contact reality.

02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:15.500
 There may be a withdrawal period, a period of abstinence or something. But I also agree,

02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:19.740
 I think people will quickly discover how much they've been duped and how much they don't

02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:21.180
 want their internet connection back.

02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:27.660
 Yeah, including throwing away their cell phones.

02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:33.180
 Okay, great stuff. I won't hold you any a bit longer. Stay on the line. We'll just say

02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:37.340
 thank you again. So, Ray, thank you so much for doing this. Georgie, thank you so much.

02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.740
 And we have an amazing listenership and I'll stay up after this and I'll do timestamps

02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:45.740
 for all these questions and things and sincerely appreciate all the support. When you see us

02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:51.340
 again, I think we'll have a souped up system and it will be very nice and my computer won't

02:02:51.340 --> 02:02:55.660
 be overheating and on the verge of collapse every single time we do this. So, guys, thank

02:02:55.660 --> 02:03:01.180
 you so much. Special appreciation to Ray for just two hours answering questions. And Georgie,

02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:04.940
 thank you again. And thank you to our amazing listenership and audience. Have a safe weekend,

02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:09.500
 everybody. And we'll talk to you guys soon. Okay, take care. Bye, everyone.
