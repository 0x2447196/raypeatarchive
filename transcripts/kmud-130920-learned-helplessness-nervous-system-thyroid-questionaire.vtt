 Welcome once again to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 which runs every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 my wife and I were both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 which are either grown on our CCUF certified herb farm

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU DeGarboville 91.1 FM

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 you are invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 to this month's subject of learned helplessness, nervous system,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 and a generalized thyroid questionnaire about certain things that I've come to be asked over time

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 that very much come from misconceptions.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So I just want to clear up some of those too.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 If you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 And we can also be reached incidentally toll-free on 1888 WBMER

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Once again, this is becoming very usual.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 We're very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat to share his wisdom with us

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 and to find out some of the latest work that he's been doing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 So thank you so much for joining us again, Dr. Peat.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Okay, so as always, for people who perhaps have never heard you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 or never listened to the show even, it does happen for sure,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 would you just please give an outline of your academic background?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 In biology, I studied mostly at the University of Oregon 1968 to '72,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 did my PhD dissertation on reproductive aging

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 and how the physiology of oxidative metabolism changes with aging

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 and interacts with changes in all of the hormones.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And since then, I've been developing some of the central ideas

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 that were involved in both aging and reproduction.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Okay, good.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 As I know that a lot of your research has been fairly revelational

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 in terms of work that is being done both in academic universities

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 and other private research, but which doesn't always come to the fore

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 or if at least it does, it takes quite a significant time to reach the medical industry.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 I think tonight's kind of beginning introduction anyway at least

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 for the nervous system has got some fairly new ideas attached to it, if you like.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 But I think rather than getting too technical for most people perhaps who are listening,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 because it is a very interesting subject and physiologically it's pretty intricate,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 but for those people who perhaps don't have a very large amount of science background,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 especially in physiology, I think it would be really good just to discuss briefly

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 the two arms of the nervous system, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 before we actually get into the subject of tonight.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 The general way doctors still think about them was a set of ideas established

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 just about 100 years ago with opposition between the relaxing side

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 and the mobilizing emergency side.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 That has tended to be called the fight or flight reaction for the sympathetic nervous system

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 that is based largely on adrenaline.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 The relaxing parasympathetic side is based mostly on acetylcholine.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 But in the last 30 or 40 years a lot of complexity has turned up

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 even though in the general sense those oppositions are still accurate,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 but it turns out there's a lot of overlap.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Each part of the nervous system does things that can also be done by the other side,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 and each one has more repertoire than just adrenaline or acetylcholine.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 They can interact in various ways with serotonin, histamine, and so on.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 The relaxing side of the nervous system supposedly,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 the 100-year-old idea is that it takes care of peristalsis and secretion largely.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 It slows the heart rate for relaxation and weakens the strength of the heart contraction,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 but it strengthens the peristalsis movement of the intestine and wall of the bladder and ureters

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 and stimulates secretion of a lot of glands.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 But it relaxes the sphincters of the intestine and the bladder and gallbladder and such

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 so that it goes with secretion, digestion, and excretion,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 all of the basically vegetative processes.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Right. So that's the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 It's all about what happens after you eat a meal, for example.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 You relax, you take it easy, you digest your food.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Everything's being produced by the glands that are secreting enzymes into the intestine

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 or the stomach to digest your food.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 The heart rate slows down.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 You always think of the parasympathetic as being fairly peaceful and wet, if you like.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 And it tends to take over at night.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 It helps a person go to sleep by slowing the heart rate.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 At least it should slow things down during the night.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 But with problems such as diabetes or hypoglycemia or various metabolic disorders,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 it can get overactive.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 And instead of just calming things down, slowing the metabolism,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 lowering blood sugar because you don't need so much,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 it can cause too much insulin secretion and other glandular secretions,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 for example, causing too much mucus formation.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 And the increased insulin can lower your blood sugar too much.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And that can lead to intensified activity of the nerves,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 intensifying both contraction and relaxation where it shouldn't be happening.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 Okay.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 So I guess this first question, in the light of what we understand as the sympathetics and parasympathetics,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 under the effects of stress, and I think when most people think about stress,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 they talk about stressful situations, stressful job deadlines,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 and all of those kinds of things that can raise your blood pressure or raise your heart rate,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 make you angry, I don't know, stressful situations.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 The excitotoxic, so this is the state of a cell where it's being stimulated so much,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 the excitation, that stimulation can lead to that toxic effect and that cell death.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 And this is something that I know you've written about in one of your newsletters recently

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 about the stress-induced excitotoxic effects of the parasympathetics,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 and it's something I've never really heard about before in terms of what you've just mentioned about over secretion.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 Would you describe that a little more?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 The place that it started to be understood was in the learned helplessness situation.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 They saw that when an animal believed it couldn't escape from a stressful situation,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 its heart slowed down instead of accelerating.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 The very same signal that would make an animal's heart race if it was wandering around freely

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 and had the possibility of escaping, if it was in a trapped situation,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 its heart would slow down and it would, given a little too much stress and threat,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 its heart would actually stop in a relaxed position

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 where without that belief in the impossibility of escape,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 it would go on struggling for days, swimming in a tank, for example,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 with the expectation that it wouldn't be able to escape.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 It might drown in five or six minutes.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 Wow.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 So this is a kind of rationale for the explanation of hope being something that can keep a person alive.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 In the 1950s, a biologist shocked a lot of other biologists

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 by talking about the rat's hopelessness causing death.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Wow.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Okay, so I know you mentioned some part about the old,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 I won't say old, but kind of the standard treatment for Alzheimer's

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 and how the method by which the approach to Alzheimer's was used is actually pretty bad science

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 in terms of what's understood now about the two arms of the nervous system

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 and how the drugs they're currently using to treat Alzheimer's are actually probably making it worse.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 Yes, the brain processes that allow learning and intelligent behavior,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 the cholinergic nerves of the brain are very important in that

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 as well as the serotonin, adrenaline, and several other types of nerves have to be functioning.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 But several types of evidence have made doctors concentrate on the loss of the cholinergic system.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 And if you stimulate the cholinergic nerves, you can improve learning and behavior.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 But if you aren't increasing energy to keep up with that increased stimulation,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 you put the cell in a stress between having to work harder but not having the fuel to do it.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 So if your cortisol is high, for example, interfering with your ability to use sugar,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 or if your blood sugar is simply low and you're being stimulated, then the cell tends to die.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And the reasoning that the Alzheimer's disease was simply a wasting away of the cholinergic nerves

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 led to treating it for the first 10 or 15 years

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 just with chemicals to increase excitation of the cholinergic nerves.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And that wasn't working at all.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 People were dying at a higher rate with liver disease and such.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 But from the 1950s, people were already suggesting treating dementia

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 and other brain degenerative diseases with atropine

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 and other chemicals that block the cholinergic nerves.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 And amandadine, which is now used for treating Parkinson's disease,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 was one of the chemicals considered anti-cholinergic in the '50s, '60s, and '70s.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And since people were seeing actual improvement with the anti-cholinergic chemicals

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 someone said, "Why not try adding that to the treatment

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 instead of stopping the excitatory cholinergic drugs?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 Why not add one of these?"

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 So they reclassified them as acting against another excitatory nervous system,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 the system that causes glutamate, MSG nerve toxicity.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 So they now call it an anti-NMDA chemical,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 memantine, which is similar to amandadine.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 So it's a very similar chemical which used to be called anti-cholinergic

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 that's being used for both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 But they still go on with the doctrine that they have to stimulate the cholinergic system too,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 even though that has never shown improvement.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Oh, my goodness.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 Okay, well, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Gallivoo, 91.1 FM.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And from 7.30 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's subjects of learned helplessness, nervous system control,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 and a generalized discussion on thyroid, et cetera.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 Or if you live outside the area, there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 So I just wanted to ask you a little question about estrogen.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 I know we've talked about estrogen and progesterone and the opposing effects of each

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 and the perceived beneficial effects of estrogen being so widely adopted in the '70s and '80s,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 '90s even with hormone replacement therapy.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 But now how the revelations are that estrogen is extremely damaging.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 I know you've always said it's been that way from the very beginning.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 But how do you look at estrogen as its destructive features?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Why is it so bad for you?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 A lot of people by now have heard that there's a premenstrual-related epilepsy that results from an excess of estrogen in relation to progesterone

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 because estrogen is excitatory while progesterone is calming.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 And it happens that estrogen intensifies the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system while progesterone tends to relax that.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 You can see that parasympathetic function of estrogen in the uterus.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 If there's too much estrogen in pregnancy, it will cause strong contractions of the uterus and can cause miscarriage.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 And it's activating -- if you give the drug they give to treat Alzheimer's, which is a procholinergic drug,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 it will cause spasms of the uterus just like estrogen.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 The estrogen is acting with or through that part of the nervous system.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And for about 50 years, there was a puzzle about how acetylcholine or the cholinergic nerves could inhibit the heart and the sphincters

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 while causing contractions of the various ducts and intestines and so on.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 And they proposed that something was being released in the cells that combined with acetylcholine to determine whether it was excitatory or inhibitory.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 The main thing that happens there is that acetylcholine causes cells to produce nitric oxide,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 the chemical that became famous with Viagra and Rogaine, which causes vasodilation.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 People always also abuse nitrous oxide, don't they, as a kind of --

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 That's a different chemical.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 That's actually just an anesthetic, pretty safe chemical, nitrous oxide.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 But nitric oxide is the free radical that you find in smog.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 And it's produced by any cell that's excited too strongly.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 And in the situation where the cholinergic stimulation is causing relaxation in blood vessels where it causes vasodilation,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 it's acting by way of increased nitric oxide.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 And what the nitric oxide is doing is blocking energy production so the smooth muscle of the blood vessel or sphincter,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 wherever it is, simply doesn't have the energy to contract.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 It actually steals oxygen from the mitochondrion and blocks the use of any oxygen that's there.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 And estrogen happens to activate the enzyme that forms nitric oxide.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 So it works with the cholinergic system, and both of them act partly through increasing the amount of nitric oxide.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 And progesterone, with its quieting effect, inhibits the enzyme that forms nitric oxide.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Okay, good. Now I wanted to ask you, in the presence of adequate metabolic energy in the form of sufficient thyroid,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 would nitric oxide still be able to do this?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 No. In situations where they were studying learned helplessness,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 which produces increased acetylcholine and nitric oxide,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 they found that either progesterone or thyroid, T3, would block the formation of that behavior.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 It would keep them from dying prematurely.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 And the thyroid and progesterone both interfere with the production of nitric oxide.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 And in a situation of under function of the thyroid gland or system,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 it's now pretty well established that high blood pressure in a very high proportion of the cases is produced by hypothyroidism.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 And because of the belief that nitric oxide has a beneficial effect of increasing circulation,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 as with Viagra and Rogaine, the thought was that hypothyroidism must be lowering nitric oxide,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 but in fact it increases it while still causing contraction of the blood vessels and tightening up increasing blood pressure.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 So the effect of thyroid is to stop excess nitric oxide or excess cholinergic function or excess estrogen.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 But the medical ideas that have been built up on the idea that estrogen is a therapeutic thing across the spectrum

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 and that nitric oxide is beneficial because it's produced by multi-billion dollar drugs,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 these interlock so that they argue that if estrogen produces nitric oxide, then nitric oxide is good and so on.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 Each thing is used as an argument for the other, but when you put them in the context of thyroid and progesterone,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 you see that the actual problem such as high blood pressure can involve increased nitric oxide,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 even though that goes against the doctrine.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 It's a kind of a rabbit hole that's unfortunately clouded by a lot of money and advertising thereof to make sure it stays in the forefront of people's belief systems.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Some of the changes with aging besides high blood pressure, for example, incontinence and edema,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 swelling up of the extremities, constipation or at least slow movement of the digestive system,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 leakiness of blood vessels, letting fluids swell out,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 and then sluggishness of the lymphatic system allowing the edema to accumulate,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 these things are all able to be produced and relieved by either increasing or decreasing the amount of nitric oxide in the system.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 So an excess of the cholinergic function leading to overproduction of nitric oxide will cause constipation, incontinence,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 swelling of the feet, just about all of the typical symptoms of aging, stress and shock and so on.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 And they're all alleviated by thyroid and progesterone as the kind of opposites.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Yeah.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Yeah. Okay. All right.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 So another question that I had actually was from an interaction with another person

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 who was potentially going to be using the product.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 And this was a little bit, it's almost outside of the realm of the topic, but it's kind of similar.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 And they were using DHEA.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 They wanted to use DHEA.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 And on the bottle of the DHEA, it gave a warning about increasing, possibly increasing estrogen.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And again, I think this is very similar to what you're saying about the stress-induced excitatory or excitotoxic,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 effects of that.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 The estrogen itself possibly would be produced in a person taking DHEA if they were under stress.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 And if they weren't under stress, if they were using progesterone and they had adequate thyroid and, you know,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 their diet was good with sugars, you know, fruit sugars, et cetera, in their diet, and they had enough metabolic energy,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 they wouldn't produce estrogen from DHEA because of that.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Right.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And DHEA and progesterone both will break the learned helplessness pattern of too much nitric oxide.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 But what causes DHEA and testosterone to be turned into estrogen excessively is anything basically causing stress,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 irritation, inflammation.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 The enzyme that makes estrogen, aromatase, is activated by anything that stresses cells.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And the processes that are reversed by thyroid and progesterone are activated by, for example, prostaglandins,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 which are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, which happen to synergize with estrogen in many ways.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 The prostaglandins activate the formation of estrogen and progesterone, thyroid, and aspirin too,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 will turn off aromatase by, among other things, inhibiting the activity of the enzyme that makes polyunsaturated fats turn into prostaglandins.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 I'm going to hold you there very briefly, Dr. Peat. We do have a couple of callers on the line already.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 So let's go ahead and take this first caller. You're on the air?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 Hey, my name's Jackie. I live right here. I live in Well Gulch.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Okay. Hey, Jackie.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 I have that premenstrual seizure problem, but it's actually not just premenstrual.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 In my experience, it's been about, more recently, it's been like a week before and after my period.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 There's definitely hormonal cycles dictating that. That's clear.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 How long have you had this for?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Oh, about three years now.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 And how old are you?

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 I'm 28.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Okay.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 So I have like a grand mal seizure once a month.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Wow.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 I have a real memory problem because of that.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 But I'm calling because I'm wondering, you talk about having more thyroid hormone,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 but how do you promote the production of more thyroid hormone?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 And does vitamin B6 have anything to do with that? I have more questions beyond this.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, just if perhaps you'd answer your way of approaching seizures,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 as you mentioned at the very beginning of the show, it's pertinent that she's called.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 I'm happy you did call in because I have lots of good advice for you,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 and also your approach to its treatment.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Well, in an emergency situation,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 you can have a good probability of either stopping or reducing the severity of seizures just with progesterone.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 But in the long run, you want to stop the intake of the polyunsaturated fats that activate estrogen and inhibit thyroid.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 The degree of unsaturation of the fat corresponds to the degree of interference with thyroid hormone.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 So fish oil is more antithyroid than the seed oils.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 And the singly unsaturated fat in olive oil, for example, is very weakly antithyroid.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 Butter, coconut oil, cream, beef, and lamb fat, for example, are not antithyroid.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 The traditional diets before 1940, even in the industrial countries,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 people commonly got quite a bit of thyroid in their food.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 If you would stew a chicken or a fish, for example,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 the thyroid would always break up and be consumed as part of the food.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 And with that traditional diet,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 a person probably averaged about the equivalent of maybe 30 milligrams a day of armor thyroid

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 in the natural, fresh, glandular material.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 So one thing that has contributed to hypothyroidism resulting in high estrogen

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 and overactivity of the parasympathetic excitatory system,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 one factor is just the removal of natural thyroid from the food supply.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 But at the same time, the diet has been industrialized to include lots of these seed oils,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 which are both pro-estrogen and antithyroid.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 And in themselves, they are excitatory, produce edema of the brain and so on.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 Well, I've definitely had a history of the edema, right, like the swelling up.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 I thought I was fat, and they gave me an IV diuretic in the hospital.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 One day I peed out eight pounds of water.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 So I've been using dandelion root to deal with the water retention.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Beyond that, since I've cut out estrogenic foods from my diet as much as possible,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 like including soy stuff and all, like, unprocessed or improperly processed soy,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 my gut has gotten a lot flatter, and I really haven't been working out.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 But my source for progesterone is chase tree berries.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 I am under the impression that over time it can work even just like the time-released IUD,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 so that after like a year I may not even have my menstrual cycle anymore,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 but that it accumulates over time.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 That it will help rebalance my hormonal imbalance,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 and I'll have more progesterone and less estrogen.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 I wonder if you know anything about chase tree berries, if you've heard of this.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 It's also known as Vitex berries.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Yeah, Vitex has traditionally been progestogenic for sure,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 and definitely used for menstruating women to reduce the severity of symptoms of high estrogen,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 which would typically be edema, PMS, et cetera, mood swings, and long, heavy bleeding.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Just very briefly, did you say dandelion root?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Did you mean dandelion leaf?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Both of them.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Okay.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 The root is the strong diuretic, and the leaf is the mild diuretic.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Yeah, the root is actually a cologog.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 It's more of a biostimulant, and the leaf is specifically a diuretic,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 and it contains potassium, so it's better than the furosemide

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 and the other so-called potassium-sparing diuretics.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 But anyway, I'm more interested in helping you out here.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 With Dr. Peat's advice for your epilepsy,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 I think that's probably the most pertinent part of what you said.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 The minerals are very important too for getting the balance of the nervous system,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 making sure you have enough of all of the alkaline minerals, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 And fruit and milk are very important for those.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Yeah, you recommend--I know you recommend magnesium.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 A good source of that is coffee.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 And calcium, obviously, is the milk and dairy products.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 And then sodium was just from regular salt, and you do advocate people use salt,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 and that's been a whole topic of other previous shows,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 so probably best not to go in that direction.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Well, I can add to this too.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 I tried to have a vegan diet for a while, and I basically starved myself and depleted all my minerals.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 So along with the high fluid, I was regularly being diagnosed with low sodium,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 and I've just become more aware of the need for these other minerals.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 But I find that calcium and magnesium, you can get that from nettles, actually.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Yeah, or from any green, any large leafy green that you would--

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 You're emphasizing the alkaline, and you say drink coffee to get these things.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Coffee is really a good thing.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Well, for magnesium--well, Dr. Peat, what do you say about coffee and acidity?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Well, decaf is fine as a source of niacin and magnesium,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 but another good source of all the minerals, but especially magnesium, is well-cooked green leaves.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 The undercooked greens aren't digestible and can actually increase your inflammatory nitric oxide and such.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Irritation of the intestine from starchy, undercooked vegetable matter will--

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Increasing the nitric oxide, that causes water retention, causes the intestine to suck up water and put it into the bloodstream,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 but it causes the kidneys to lose sodium.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 So the problem that happens with a lot of stress and degenerative conditions is centered around the water retention,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 and the imbalance produced by losing sodium too fast.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 So first aid is just to get your minerals up.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 For example, resuscitation can be done more efficiently with extremely hyperosmotic concentrated mineral solution,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 sodium chloride, for example, six or seven times more concentrated than the physiological solution.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 Just injecting a small amount of that can bring a person out of shock because it inhibits the formation of nitric oxide,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 helps the kidneys retain sodium, and starts the system producing energy.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 But just making sure that your daily diet includes plenty of sodium and the other alkaline metals is very helpful.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Okay, we do actually have three other callers, so I don't want to--

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Well, can I just add one more thing?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 Sure, sure.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Because you're talking about Alzheimer's.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 I learned that turmeric, this herb, can be very helpful for Alzheimer's because Alzheimer's can be a result of iron deposits in the brain,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 and just as much as turmeric can remove free radical iron from the joints and blood system, it removes it from the brain.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 So just a real answer to Alzheimer's, too.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 We can leave it at that. Thank you.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 Okay, no problem. You're welcome.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 Okay, so let's get these next callers.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 You're on the air?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Yes, this is David in Missouri.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 Hey, David.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 This is a question, a very general question, about learned helplessness, and I think we can define this as learned helplessness.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 You know, I'm just looking at what's going on in the world right now, and especially in this country and Europe.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 You have all these different things occurring, such as NSA and possibly going to war in Syria when, you know, 92% of the people are against it,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 and just on and on and on, all these different things that the government are actually engaged in,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 and, you know, you have all these different people that either want to put their head in the fan, or there are people that want to fight,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 and there are all these people in between, and I'm just curious, Dr. Peat, what you think about, you know,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 I'm also saying this in the context of the rats that are, you know, put into a situation where they can't fight back,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 or they can fight back, and the difference between there being hope and then they're just giving up.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Do you think about that very much in terms of humanity?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 Oh, that was exactly why I decided to write this newsletter right now.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 I've been following the research actually since 1960, and it was especially the social behavior of the government

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 and how they have manipulated the press and the public helplessness, actually.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 It's been designed since the late 1940s.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 It's been actual government policy to manipulate the mass media and events to create helplessness in the population.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 You know, and I guess I'm just hoping that everybody listening, that we don't see this as being negative,

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 but we see this as, you know, we all have to be engaged in standing up against everything that's going on

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 because it's just awesome, the force that's being exerted against the people, you know, in Europe and here and everywhere.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 It's mass media, Floyd.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 People are surely as smart as rats, and rats just needed a little hint of a possibility of escape.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Yeah, and you know, it's almost like what we're really lacking is intelligence and creativity,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 which I know you talk about a lot.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 It's obvious that these things have been suppressed.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 I mean, like you say, it's an active program to condition and brainwash

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 and just cause us not even to really even think about resisting.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 You know, it's like, "Wow, wake up."

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 You know, it's like, "This is a very small amount of people that are in control,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 and we've got, you know, seven billion people on the planet."

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 You know, it's like, "Wow, okay. Well, I guess that's how it is, huh?"

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 So anyway, that was one of my things.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 I just keep thinking about, you know, all the dynamics of the health of the organism

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 and the psychological aspects and, you know, all these things that are going on right now.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 It's got to have a profound effect on the health of human beings, you know.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 It's just amazing.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 In one of the studies in which rats had been taught learned helplessness,

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 so they would drown in five or six minutes,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 just being able to see another rat escape would let the informed rat go for days without drowning.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 Just the recognition that someone else did it can make all the difference.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 Yep. Amen.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 Wow, that's something.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Well, I hope we all resist, whoever's listening.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 So anyway, I have one just other really quick question,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 and I know there are no definite answers to these things.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 I know there's a lot of variables, but I raise my own chickens, and I really feed them healthy.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 You know, they're pretty much free-range.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 They eat all organic, non-GMO.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
 In fact, I grow a lot of the feed that I feed them.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
 And I'm curious, if you know where that egg's coming from,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 is there a benefit to eating these raw?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 It does not bother me putting an egg in a glass and drinking it,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 but sometimes I think maybe there's a bacteria in there,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 especially what I've learned from you, that maybe we don't want that in the stomach, you know.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 I'm just curious, is the egg actually better for you raw rather than lightly cooking it

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 or a hard-boiled egg being just as good,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 or maybe all of them having different variants of nutrition depending on, you know, how it's prepared?

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 In moderate amounts, even raw eggs are fine, very digestible,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 and they're antiseptic in the raw state.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 So they've seen the raw egg yolk kill viruses that other related chemicals weren't able to destroy.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 Well, you know, they say you shouldn't wash the eggs because they will spoil quicker

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 and because there's actually a natural envelope around the egg of bacteria.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 Have you heard that?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 Oh, okay.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 So is there a benefit to eating raw eggs, overcooking them,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 because you're going to get certain types of vitamins and minerals in the fats maybe that --

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 I'm thinking they're probably polyunsaturated fats to a certain degree.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 Are those fats maybe better because they're not cooked?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 If they would be -- if the chickens were fed a more saturated diet like they used to

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 with orchard waste, apples that were spoiling and away from the cheese industry,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 then the animals eating those foods -- in Mexico,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 old tortillas are fed to the chickens regularly with chopped fruit and vegetables.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 Yeah, these guys eat everything.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 I mean, they eat fruit.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 They've been eating watermelon now for days, and they eat cantaloupe and, you know, and seeds.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 So the sugar in that instance is what's giving them the --

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 Yeah, that makes the egg fat much safer.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 And in the raw state, it has that germicidal effect.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 And I've known several people who cured their leukemia by drinking eggnogs, fruit juice, milk and raw eggs.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 And then just one other question regarding a raw product.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 And, again, I think I understand where you're coming from, you know,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 from different things that you said regarding milk.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 And there really not being a problem with it being pasteurized because it's still such a high-quality food.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 But if you're sourcing raw milk that the cows are pretty much just eating grass

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 and you're obviously not having an allergic reaction,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 is it better as far as the nutrients to drink it raw, if you can find that?

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 Yeah, slightly better.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Okay.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 But it's not that big of a deal.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 No, if you have really good milk, it's okay to pasteurize it,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 but it's slightly better in the raw state.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Okay.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 All right. I better hold you there. Thank you for your call.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Thank you.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 Yeah, you're very welcome.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 We do have another caller on the line.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 I want to make sure we get to them and anyone else who'd like to call in.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 So, next caller, you're on the air?

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Hey, this is Pat up in Bayside.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 Hi, Pat. What's your question?

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 I just had a question about 5-HTP, namely if you think it's safe to take as a supplement.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 Dr. Peat, did you hear that?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 Well, it does tend to increase serotonin,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 and serotonin, like histamine, can increase nitric oxide

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 and set those inflammatory processes in motion.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 So, 5-HTP is not a good thing to take?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 It is not?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 It's not, no. Did you hear Dr. Peat's explanation?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Well, any form of tryptophan tends to increase the serotonin,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 and the serotonin tends to increase those inflammatory things, estrogen and nitric oxide.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 Okay. So, that's not good?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 No.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 All right.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 You shouldn't take it.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Okay. You're welcome.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 Okay. So, we've got 10 minutes left.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 People would like to call in. It's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 We're joined by Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 We're talking about some generalized questions now about thyroid

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 and people's misconceptions about it.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 I think I get asked fairly frequently these days,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 "Does thyroid do this? Does it do that? What about this? What about that?"

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 I thought best just to answer some questions very quickly.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 People think about thyroid hormone as being a stimulant, Dr. Peat,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 and that they'll get problems with high blood pressure if they take thyroid.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 I know it's not true, but would you just explain that?

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 Yeah. I was just previously mentioning that hypothyroid people have increased nitric oxide,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 but at the same time, they have a tendency of too much contraction of the blood vessels

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 and high blood pressure.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 So, at least nitric oxide isn't able to maintain a good blood flow if your thyroid is low.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 I think the basic thing that relaxes the blood vessels produced by thyroid hormone is carbon dioxide.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 Hypothyroid people tend to have chronically increased lactic acid in their blood,

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 which displaces carbon dioxide.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 Carbon dioxide relaxes blood vessels in a very different way

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 than the interfering with energy supply that nitric oxide does.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:18.000
 Carbon dioxide retains a high energy level while relaxing,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 partly just by changing the electrical pH behavior of the cell.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 It acidifies the cell, which relaxes it.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 That relaxing effect of increasing carbon dioxide from higher thyroid function

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 makes your capillaries and arterioles relax and let the blood flow through,

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 providing oxygen to the tissues, which then produce more carbon dioxide

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 and keep the system active and circulating.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:12.000
 Carbon dioxide and thyroid both tend to increase the stroke volume of the heart

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 the same way progesterone does,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000
 where the parasympathetic nervous system and estrogen decrease the stroke volume

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 and weaken the heart.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 Thyroid has an energizing but relaxing function.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000
 It increases the ability of cells to retain magnesium

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:49.000
 because magnesium is bound to the ATP energy carrying molecule.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000
 By increasing the oxidation of the cell to produce ATP,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 the cell then binds magnesium and releases calcium, which is the excitatory thing.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 If you have magnesium in your system and are producing carbon dioxide,

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 your cells will retain the relaxing magnesium.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 You can see that in the way your muscles work your heart.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 It shows up in the electrocardiogram as a quick repolarization,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 getting ready and relaxed, ready for a new stimulation.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 In your brain, it shows up as a quick transition from wakefulness into sleep at night

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 without having to go through a lot of preparation.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 The brain is able to quickly relax by increasing its ATP and oxygen and carbon dioxide.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
 Excellent.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 Okay, listen, we do have a few more callers, Dr. Peat.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 So perhaps we should see if we can quickly get each one through

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 so the next person has a chance to ask their question.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 So let's take the first caller.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 Quick and easy through me.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 Are you aware of Hawthorne University in White Thorne

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
 and are you a part of that?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 You know what?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 No, I'm not.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 That's a great question.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 How about the next caller?

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 You're on the air?

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 Hello?

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 Hi.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 I have a lot of questions, so I'll ask a short one.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
 I understand that there's a Dr. Horowitz, among other people,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 who claim that listening to sounds at 528 hertz will heal DNA.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 What is your understanding of this?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:54.000
 A good person to read on that issue would be Harold Hillman,

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 who did experiments with it in England and got fired or got retired prematurely.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
 But it's definitely something.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 Russian research in the early '70s showed that certain musical tones would cause muscle

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 to increase its ATP production,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 and that was disregarded because the level of the energy in a given vibration

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 is considered to be too small to exceed the thermal agitation of the molecules of the muscle.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 But actually the muscle is organized with long-range structures in the water,

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 which form, in effect, an antenna that can receive sound waves of these very low energies.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 So it's physically very plausible and verified by Harold Hillman.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 Excellent.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 Well, as always, thanks so much for that.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Obviously you're not saying like an emphatic yes,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
 but you're saying it's totally within the realm of possibility?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Yes.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Excellent.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 We better take the next call.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 I think we've got three or four more.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
 You do well.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 Bye-bye now.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
 Yeah, thanks so much for your call.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
 Next caller.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 Do you believe in time management or energy management versus time management?

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
 And it's always easier to ask your own questions.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 I've got one last one, maybe.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 I don't know.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 I think that was a rhetorical question.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 We've got an engineer with a rhetorical question.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 No, that was an actual question from people, but people, I cannot give a complex question.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
 I can give a three-word question for you,

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 and I think we're actually out of time for callers today.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 It's 7.54, though, engineer.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 We've got plenty of time.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 If you can get a 30-second question in with a one-minute response, please call 923-3911.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 So are you saying there's no more callers on the air or not?

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 Correct.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 They dropped.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 Okay, fine.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 Okay, well, we've got five minutes left here, Dr. Peat.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 So how about a very quick breakdown of cholesterol's control by thyroid?

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
 Okay.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 In three minutes.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 In the 1930s, it was demonstrated and graphs were published showing that when a person's thyroid gland was removed,

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 as their metabolic rate declined, the blood cholesterol increased.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 And when they were given a supplement of thyroid, it was just like a mirror image.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 As the metabolic rate increased, the cholesterol declined.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 And at the time, that was just a gross empirical observation,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 but it allowed many doctors to diagnose hypothyroidism simply by looking at elevated cholesterol in the blood.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 It was one of the well-recognized signs of hypothyroidism.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 But when the essential fatty acid lowering of the cholesterol and drugs to lower cholesterol came on the scene,

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 it was discouraged, the connection between thyroid and cholesterol,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 because it was too simple to cure high cholesterol, to correct it, despite correcting the thyroid function.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 But how it works is that it activates the conversion of cholesterol to primarily pregnenolone and progesterone.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 And that was demonstrated by pumping blood into an ovary and measuring the amount of cholesterol going in

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 and the amount of progesterone coming out.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 If they decreased the cholesterol in the blood, the ovary produced less progesterone.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 Excellent.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 OK.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 Well, it is 7.57.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 We still have three minutes left, but I won't go on too much because we don't want to go over time.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 So thank you very much, Dr. Peat.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 I'll just let people know how they can get hold of your material and find out more about you.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 OK.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 Thanks so much for your time again.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 Thank you.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 I really appreciate it.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 OK.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 Well, I know we had a bunch of people there who wanted to ask questions and unfortunately didn't have enough time.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 Maybe we should open up the airways at 7.20 next time.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Who knows?

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
 You never know whether we get lots of people or just a few people.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 So www.raypeat.com.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
