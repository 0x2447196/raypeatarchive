WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
 Okay, here we go, hour two of our little show.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.960
 As I mentioned to Mr. Peat in an email,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.320
 and also to you, Adam Bergstrom,

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.560
 who's a good friend and great researcher,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.160
 and he's on our show, oh, several times a month,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.460
 even more sometimes, and he's a fan

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.080
 and knows a lot about the work of Mr. Ray Peat.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.920
 He's on the line.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.160
 Adam, are you there?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.000
 - I am here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.960
 - There you are.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.280
 Ray Peat is a PhD in biology from University of Oregon.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.320
 His specialization in physiology,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.920
 the schools he's taught in include University of Oregon,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.320
 Urbana College, Montana State University,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.620
 National College of Naturopathic Medicine.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.680
 He started his work with progesterone

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.920
 and related hormones in 1968,

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 and in papers in physiological chemistry and physics.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 I mean, he's got such an incredible background

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.180
 and very well respected around the world,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 Ray Peat, and he's on the line.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.040
 Mr. Peat, good morning.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.880
 - Good morning.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.720
 - How you doing?

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.320
 It's been a while.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.120
 - Yeah, I guess five years.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.680
 - Has it been five years?

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.520
 (Ray laughs)

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 What are you most passionate about these days,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.800
 Mr. Ray Peat, and your work?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.840
 And by the way, Ray, say hi to Adam Bergstrom.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.040
 - Oh, yeah, hi.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.240
 I've read his stuff on the yellow fat disease.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.420
 Very, very great work.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.640
 - Thank you, Ray.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 Thank you very much.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.880
 Thank you for turning me on to the concept

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.040
 because the first time I ever heard the words

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.080
 was out of your mouth.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.920
 - Oh.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.760
 - And you mentioned it on Patrick's show, too.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.600
 - Oh, really?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.320
 - The last time, yes, you did.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.040
 - When did you first get turned on

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.720
 to the yellow fat thing, Ray?

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.920
 - Oh, in the 1940s.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.800
 A family friend of ours was a chinchilla farmer,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 and he found that fish were poisoning his chinchillas.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 But that made me check the idea of essential fatty acids.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 And at that time, in the late '40s and early '50s,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 anytime someone mentioned the idea of essential fatty acids,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.520
 it was very tentative because in Texas,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.440
 one of the research institutes,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.960
 I don't remember the exact name of it,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.240
 1946 demonstrated that the so-called

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.920
 fatty acid deficiency disease

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.560
 was really a vitamin B6 deficiency

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.680
 because they could feed them a fat-free diet,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.440
 cause the scaly skin symptoms and so on,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.520
 and cure the disease with a supplement of vitamin B6

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.280
 without any fat added.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.440
 So I sort of grew up with the concept

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
 that the fatty acid essentiality is,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.960
 first it was a mistake and then it turned into a fraud.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.440
 And then in the 1970s, I saw research

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.240
 in which they fed saturated fat

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.960
 or highly polyunsaturated fats,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.400
 or a mixture to rats through their whole lifetime.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.440
 And they found that it wasn't the quantity of fat

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.440
 that made them obese, it was the degree of unsaturation,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.880
 so that the ones that ate saturated fats,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.400
 such as coconut oil, were lean at the end of their lives,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.440
 no matter how much they ate.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.240
 And the ones that ate only polyunsaturated fat

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.320
 were fat at the end of their lives,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.200
 even if they had a low-fat diet.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.120
 - Now Adam, you jump in anytime, you don't need me.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.760
 You can just jump in, we're just having a combo here.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.160
 So these are the classic things Ray P. called PUFAs,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.560
 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.800
 - Highly unsaturated fatty acids,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
 omega-3s mainly, DHA, EPA, ALA.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.400
 - Yeah, those are so sensitive to oxygen degradation

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.000
 that people have checked the blood content

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.280
 after someone eats a fatty fish

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.880
 and finds that very little of them

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.920
 even reach the bloodstream.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.280
 And when they do, they're an oxidized breakdown product.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.840
 The great majority of the fat is degraded

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.040
 by the time it gets into your bloodstream.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.440
 - Really?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.560
 So overall, then, we humans, you don't think,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.440
 Ray P., we need to be eating any fish at all?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.720
 - Only because of the trace minerals

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.200
 that are reliably in seafood.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.960
 Selenium and iodine, for example, aren't reliable.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.040
 If you eat foods grown only in one locality,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.440
 you can become deficient in a particular trace mineral.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.840
 - In your opinion, any fish better than others to eat,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.600
 if you're gonna have a little fish?

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.440
 - Oh, yeah, the low-fat fish and the shellfish.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.280
 Shellfish are great sources of copper

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.240
 because they generally don't use iron.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.280
 Oysters are high in iron, but squid is very good.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.320
 It's low in iron and high in copper

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.320
 and has selenium and iodine and other trace minerals.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.720
 Cod and sole are low-fat fish that are safe.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.440
 - Cod and sole, huh?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.120
 - Mm-hmm. - Oh, oh.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.000
 So, but these fatty fish, you eat 'em

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.400
 before they even get to where they're going,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.360
 they start causing the body a problem?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.680
 - Yeah, if you take, say, a fish oil supplement

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.580
 and then look in your bloodstream,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.600
 there's enough of the oxidized fat already

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.080
 to suppress the immune system.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.720
 That's why they use them as anti-inflammatories,

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.520
 but the trouble is that they accumulate

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 and create progressive suppression of your immune system.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.600
 And people talk about them being required

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.160
 for the brain structure because if you look

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.160
 at an adult's brain, it's full of fish oil equivalent.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.480
 But a newborn, there have been many publications

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.800
 saying that when they check the brain

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.800
 of a newly born, say, miscarriage,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.580
 they find that the brain is very low

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.320
 in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.320
 And so they say you must supplement pregnant women

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.160
 with fish oil or the equivalent

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.480
 because babies are being born with a brain deficiency

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.480
 of PUFA, but in France, there was a study

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.560
 in which they did give a PUFA supplement

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.080
 to pregnant women, figuring that they would advance

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.080
 brain development, and so they gave a sound test

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.360
 to the woman's abdomen to measure the baby's response.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.360
 They found that the babies learned more slowly

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.240
 in utero if they had extra PUFA added to the diet,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.120
 and they were born with smaller brains.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.820
 And that shouldn't have been done in humans

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.240
 because already in the 1960s and '70s,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.560
 experiments were showing that animals,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.200
 if the mother was fed a diet high in unsaturated fat,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:01.200
 the babies were born small-brained and slow learners.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.940
 If they were low in PUFA but fed, for example,

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.100
 saturated fat, the babies had bigger brains

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.640
 and learned faster.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:17.020
 - Are any of these unsaturated fats, like olive oil,

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.940
 in your opinion, are good food?

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.080
 - It's about 8% or 10% or 11% PUFA.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.820
 The rest of it is very good fat.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.500
 So if you hold it down to one or two teaspoons per day,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.340
 you're safe.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.700
 All during the growth time up to the age of 20,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.140
 the body is diluting the PUFA in the diet.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.780
 So the brain isn't seriously impaired

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.700
 until about the age of 20.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.700
 When you stop growing in size and volume,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.940
 the brain and other tissues begin increasing

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.740
 their concentration of PUFA.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.820
 So from 20 to the mid-40s,

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.660
 the brain is becoming more and more polyunsaturated

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.140
 and so more at risk of stress.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.740
 When you're under stress, you release these,

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.380
 any of the stored PUFA into the bloodstream

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.820
 where they can become oxidized and toxic.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.700
 - So in the fish oil and the APA/DHA arena,

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.060
 not only what you're talking about,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.460
 isn't there also the issues of these things being rancid,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.020
 the way they're produced and stored and such?

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.700
 - Oh yeah, that gives a head start on the problem.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.540
 - Yeah, wow.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.260
 - But even if you eat the most perfectly fresh PUFA,

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.140
 by the time it reaches your stomach, it's deteriorating.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.540
 And then when it gets into the tissue, it's farther along.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.180
 And some of it reaches your brain and is stored for years.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.260
 But then every night,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.580
 your brain is renewing itself considerably.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.140
 But unfortunately, during the night,

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.420
 your free fatty acids in the blood

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.740
 coming out of your fat tissues rise.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.820
 And so the brain is trying to renew itself.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.380
 But what it finds in your bloodstream

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.380
 by the time you're 40 is polyunsaturated fatty acids

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.920
 that add to the damage of the brain.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.740
 So that every night, when you're over the age of 40,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.020
 your brain is at risk of deteriorating faster.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.780
 - Oh great, that's all we need, right?

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.980
 (laughing)

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.940
 Ray Peat is with us,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.860
 and Adam Berkstrom's co-hosting the show today

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.940
 'cause he's done a lot of research with Mr. Peat,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.380
 Patrick Tempone, patricktempone1radionetwork.com.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.580
 If you'd like to join the show,

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:53.580
 patricktempone1radionetwork.com.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.740
 Adam, what's the most fascinating thing

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.260
 you've kind of picked up on the whole yellow fat thing

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.060
 that you were first alerted to with Ray Peat?

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.300
 - I found references of it also causing brown heart disease,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.720
 and it was known that cod liver oil was a cause of it

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.340
 at about the time of the Civil War.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.460
 And there's several references,

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.980
 maybe about a half a dozen or close to a dozen

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.420
 that I've found from that time.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.780
 So this has been known for a long time.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.620
 And also, people forget that in 1982,

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.800
 in the book "Life Extension" by Dirk Pearson and Sandy Shaw,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.420
 they basically told you to walk big circles

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.420
 around omega-3s, and mentioned specifically DHA and EPA.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:48.380
 And the author of "Never Cry Wolf", I believe,

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:53.420
 Farley Mowat, he also recommended avoiding fish,

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:57.340
 and that the Inuit avoided fish,

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.100
 and it was the government that gave them nets.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.700
 The Canadian government gave them nets,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.880
 and they wouldn't use it because they knew

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.940
 if they ate just those fish, those cold water fish,

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.900
 they would die.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.600
 And that is in his book about the Inuit,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.420
 the people of the deer, I believe it's called.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.260
 - Fascinating.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:22.180
 Ray Pede, so the DHA, EPA molecule, or whatever it is,

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.180
 do we need any of this?

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.120
 Like, just go right straight to some seaweeds,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.540
 or I don't know, something, do we need it?

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.980
 And do we get it in other places

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.180
 other than fish oils and stuff?

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.960
 - No, if we eat only sugar, for example, for calories,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.920
 we synthesize the monounsaturated fat,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:50.420
 such as is the main fat of olive oil, oleic acid.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:55.420
 And from oleic acid, whether we get it from a good food,

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.980
 like olive oil, or make it from our own sugar

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.700
 or starch in our diet, that can be unsaturated.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:08.700
 And the normal polyunsaturated fat in our brain at birth,

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.680
 is made from glucose by first making oleic acid

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.720
 and then unsaturating that.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.720
 And these are omega minus nine polyunsaturated fats.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.480
 They are natural fat.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.340
 An Australian researcher tested,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:35.340
 he found an easy source of omega minus nine fatty acids,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.480
 and found that they are very powerfully anti-inflammatory,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.620
 and they don't break down and oxidize easily

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.820
 because they have nine carbons at the end

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.700
 that are saturated, which are very stable.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.700
 And the acid at the other end is a stabilizing factor.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:03.800
 So omega minus nine fats are natural

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.620
 and concentrate in the brain

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.740
 and give good brain function

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.900
 and good stability against oxidation.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.940
 The whole concept of essential fatty acids,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:19.940
 which was disproved in Texas in 1946,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.580
 it was brought back in the 1950s,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.580
 when the food oil industry found they had lots of,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.340
 oh, cottonseed oil was the first.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.180
 It was a byproduct of the cotton industry.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.580
 And they were polluting the country

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.860
 with the waste cottonseed,

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.580
 and they found that they could extract the oil,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.580
 make people eat it as a food lubricant, basically.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:56.340
 There was a great campaign around 1950

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.080
 to sell Wesson oil, cottonseed oil.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.380
 They gave recipes for making special pastries and cakes

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.080
 using that instead of butter.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.900
 So it was all an advertising ploy, starting in the 1950s.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.740
 - Yeah.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.640
 - And people accepted the advertising,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.640
 and people grew up believing in essential fatty acid concept.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:29.340
 So when they went to medical school and did research,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.580
 it became the official doctrine.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.580
 And by the 1960s, people were already being poisoned

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:43.880
 by eating their cottonseed oil and soy oil and so on.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.820
 The medical industry had convinced itself

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.140
 that there was such a thing as essential fatty acids,

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:57.140
 and that they were protecting, was the advertising line,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.460
 they would protect you against cholesterol

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.220
 and saturated fats.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.340
 And so they put several hundred veterans in Los Angeles

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.340
 on a diet with only the vegetable polyunsaturated fats,

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:17.220
 or a fairly normal diet containing some butter

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.420
 and cream and lard and so on.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.220
 Not really a saturated fat, but just an average diet.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.060
 At the end of eight years,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.500
 there were three times as many cancer deaths

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.220
 in the group on vegetable oil as on the normal diet.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.340
 And so they stopped the study and said,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.140
 well, it doesn't protect against heart disease,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.980
 so we'll stop.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.660
 But they didn't advertise the fact

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.340
 that it greatly increased the cancer mortality,

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.260
 which had been known in animal studies already,

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.560
 but the medical industry fell

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.820
 for the food oil advertising line.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.420
 - I grew up in the '50s, and I know,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.740
 I had 'em probably did.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.980
 I don't know how old you are, Ray,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.540
 but I can remember the Western oil commercials.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.620
 Boy, they were everywhere.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.660
 Yeah. - Yeah.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.800
 - Yeah, wow, everywhere.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.980
 So in general, from good sources,

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.580
 most saturated fats are just fine to consume for us?

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:18.500
 - Yeah, and the trouble is that even the good fats,

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.820
 olive oil has eight or 10% PUFA,

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.100
 butter has two or 3%,

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.140
 even coconut oil has two or 3%.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:34.140
 And these are, the cells don't prefer to oxidize those

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.880
 because they're dangerous and poison the mitochondria,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.820
 so they're packed away in fat cells.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.820
 And so even highly selected,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.300
 so-called saturated fat diet,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.780
 we're putting some of these in the storage

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.100
 and they're getting into the brain and fat tissues.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.740
 And so by the time a person is 50,

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.880
 even if they've been reasonable in their diet choices,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.880
 they're still gonna have too much of the PUFA in their body,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.620
 and that makes you more susceptible to any stress

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.760
 when they come out and poison you more intensely.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.180
 - Wow.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.580
 - That's how you make--

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.860
 - Go ahead, Adam.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.660
 - I was gonna say, it's how you make lipofuscin too.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.660
 And lipofuscin now has been shown

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.180
 to be not just a passive waste product,

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.180
 but it groups into iron, zinc, and other toxic metals

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.580
 and uses them against the human body,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.420
 and any body, except if you're a salmon

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.760
 listening to this show, then DHA is okay.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.380
 In 1970, when I was working on my dissertation

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.140
 trying to understand why hamsters aged

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.860
 and became sterile halfway through their lifetime,

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.860
 I found that their uterus was accumulating lipofuscin,

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.940
 and so I studied it,

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:11.940
 and it becomes like a little oxygen-consuming,

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.980
 it's a brown speck in the cell,

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.660
 but it binds iron and other heavy metals, as you said,

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.660
 and that acts like an artificial hemoglobin

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:31.300
 that delivers oxygen to reducing agents,

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:36.340
 and so it produces the breakdown products peroxide

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:43.700
 and consumes oxygen before it can get to your mitochondria.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.620
 So you seem to be consuming oxygen,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.660
 but you're not using it.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.420
 When I was doing that, just for fun,

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.500
 I bought a quart of vegetable oil,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:01.300
 might have been soy oil or one of the standard liquid oils,

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.020
 and put a clear plastic tube in the neck of the bottle

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.260
 and sealed it and put the other end of the tube

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:13.100
 in a glass of water, and came back a few hours later,

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.740
 and it was sucking up water.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.300
 I'd been using that method to measure

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.700
 the oxygen consumption of hamster uterus and so on,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.340
 and I found that the bottle of vegetable oil

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:31.340
 was sucking up oxygen in the process of degrading itself.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.860
 It was consuming oxygen just like an animal would,

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.820
 so when you get it in your body,

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.660
 it competes with your mitochondria

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.620
 in a purely wasteful, destructive process.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.460
 - Wow.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.500
 Ray Peat and Adam Bergstrom and Patrick Timponi,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.940
 oneradionetwork.com.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.780
 Let's move on.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.180
 We got a lot of emails, and we're gonna get to 'em,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.100
 but I wanted to get Ray Peat's opinion,

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.420
 'cause it's been a long time since I've talked to you,

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.340
 and by the way, it's rayPeat.com.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.220
 You can check out his work, and he has a lot of stuff there.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.860
 So much has been talked about of late,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.180
 the grains and the lectins and all this stuff,

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.140
 and they're not for us, and human consumption,

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.500
 and whatever.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.860
 Give us your opinion on what you think,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.820
 just grains in general, and let's consider

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.140
 that whatever you're talking about,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.060
 we'll be talking about good, well-farmed,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.260
 organic whatever, whether it be rice or wheat or whatever.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.460
 What's your take on all the grain thing

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.940
 that's going on in the world today with all the--

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.260
 - In the 1960s, I was living and working in Mexico.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.020
 I had a school there, and I got interested

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:51.020
 in how people could be fed economically,

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:56.180
 and grains are a very cheap source of starch,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.180
 but they come with a variety of defensive toxins.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:06.620
 For a plant, its leaves are important,

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.380
 cows and insects eat their leaves,

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.220
 and so they put some toxins in their leaves,

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.260
 but they can regenerate the leaves,

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.300
 but their seeds are essential

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.260
 for the next generation to survive.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.900
 So the worst toxins that a plant can produce

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.380
 are put into the seeds as defense against predators.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:32.220
 And so the traditional societies,

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.300
 like the indigenous Mexican preparation

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.940
 of any grain was to soak it in lye,

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:47.180
 lye or lime, but in China and other countries,

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.900
 the same thing was practiced.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.900
 If they used grain, they would have ashes left over

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.420
 from their fires, and so they would put the ashes in

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.420
 and boil the grains with acid, or with lye, alkali.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:11.420
 It would break down the starches and the storage proteins,

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:16.140
 the gluten-like chemicals.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:21.140
 And so the native Mexican diet based on corn,

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.740
 no one was getting pellagra, but in the South,

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.460
 when people started growing corn,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:34.260
 they didn't know the traditional lye or lime treatment,

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.780
 and so pellagra became an epidemic

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:38.980
 through the Southern states

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.620
 because of the corn in the diet.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.500
 And corn is one of the less toxic grains.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:52.180
 Any grain should be highly processed,

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.780
 such as with lime or lye to degrade the toxins.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.780
 And just soaking a fresh grain,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.940
 if you soak it for a day or two,

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.580
 that activates enzymes,

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.220
 and turning it into basically a sprout,

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.340
 then the toxins are reduced.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.700
 The root and the shoot will have some toxins,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.860
 but the worst toxins are in the seed itself.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.580
 - So if one wants to consume a good organic brown rice

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.140
 or something like that, just soak it for 24 hours

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.620
 is the best way to do it before cooking it?

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.860
 - Yeah, it loses some of its characteristic taste,

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.300
 but it's a lot safer.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.700
 - Here's an email for you all from Lindsey.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.180
 What thyroid medication does Ray P. recommend

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.300
 for hypothyroid, and why is there such a scarcity

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.300
 of natrithroid?

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:58.380
 - It's a fairly long story.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.700
 I've got some articles on my website about it,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.220
 but until about 1940,

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:10.300
 the Agriculture Department hadn't required

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.540
 that it be removed from meats.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.060
 The waste from the slaughterhouses

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.620
 used to be put into hamburger and such.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.540
 In 1940 or '42, the Agriculture Department

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.460
 declared that the thyroid gland had to be sold

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.620
 to basically the Armour meat company

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.620
 to produce thyroid hormone by desiccating the gland,

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:45.300
 removing the fat, adding glucose to it,

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.140
 and putting it in tablets.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.900
 But until that time, anyone who was eating

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.940
 a traditional meat-based diet, for example,

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.380
 in Germany, they would put the thyroid gland

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.540
 and other parts in the sausages.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.700
 And anyone that made traditional fish or chicken soup,

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.300
 the neck and the thyroid and the head

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.540
 would go into the soup.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.060
 So everyone was getting thyroid as a natural supplement.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.060
 After 1942, it was by law not permitted in food.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:24.100
 So at that point, we became dependent

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.340
 on a supplement.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:33.860
 It's our natural antidote to the accumulation

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.540
 of polyunsaturated fats in the tissues

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.900
 because those, as they build up in the blood,

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.900
 block every function of the thyroid hormone.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.380
 They block the production of it in your gland,

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.060
 the transport in your blood,

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.940
 and the reception and use of it in your mitochondria.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.940
 So PUFA are the great enemy of thyroid.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.100
 And if we aren't allowed to get it

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.860
 in our natural chicken soup or fish soup,

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.860
 then we're dependent on getting it as a supplement.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.740
 And Armour made a great supplement

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.140
 for almost 100 years.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.180
 Then they sold their company to Revlon,

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.700
 the cosmetics company, and the price went up

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.700
 about tenfold, and in a series of sales,

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.540
 the pills went from less than one cent each

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.580
 up to close to a dollar each,

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:38.580
 simply as a matter of financial arrangements.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:44.420
 But still, Armour has gone, with the new owners,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.300
 Armour has gone through a series of problems

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.380
 because they changed the formula,

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.380
 added various junk to it, but insisted it hasn't changed

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.780
 because it's still called Armour thyroid.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:04.020
 Since then, other companies have taken over

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.220
 more or less the traditional Armour formula,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.060
 but it depends on who they are getting

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:14.660
 their glandular material from.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:20.700
 The Armour descendant, Forest Pharmaceuticals,

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.020
 said several years ago that they were using

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.060
 the raw material of the gland to extract

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.820
 thyrocalcitonin to regulate calcium.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.860
 That used to be a part of the natural thyroid supplement.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.860
 So now it's hard to know whether your thyroid glandular

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:49.020
 has been pre-extracted, losing the calcitonin component.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:54.660
 So since the 1990s, I've been using a product

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.620
 made in Mexico called CINOPLUS,

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.420
 which imitates the Armour formula.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:07.420
 The Armour company made a synthetic equivalent

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.940
 of the glandular and called it Thyrolar,

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.380
 and that formula was exactly copied

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:19.580
 by a couple other companies, but CINOPLUS continues

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.580
 to make the Armour equivalent in a synthetic form.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:29.580
 When I started buying it, 100 tablets cost 60 cents,

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.240
 and now they're selling for about $20 for a bottle,

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.800
 but still it's cheaper.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:41.780
 The equivalent made in the US

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.780
 is close to $100 for that many tablets.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.420
 - Ray Peat is with us, and Adam called back on the landline.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.700
 We were getting lots of weird noises on your Skype.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.740
 Thanks for doing that, and you know, Mr. Peat,

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.460
 I've been real curious about, let's see if I have this right.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.780
 Well, you've been kind of a proponent,

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:09.100
 and I think it has this thyroid functionality to it

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.100
 of a faster pulse rate, meaning actually been more healthful

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.060
 like a 70 beats per minute rather than 60,

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.100
 and an indication of thyroid function.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.320
 Is that correct?

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.060
 - Yeah, there were some studies in the 1980s

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.060
 of various things related to heart rate.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.660
 They found that brain function closely corresponded

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.980
 to heart rate.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.860
 They looked at kids in school, in high school,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.980
 and saw that their grade average corresponded

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.740
 to their heart rate, and that led them to look

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.180
 at people with pacemakers.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.020
 They would give a person with pacemakers set at 70 beats

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.400
 a mental test, and then they would just turn the regulator

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.300
 up and give them an 85 per minute heart rate,

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.520
 and their mental functions all improved.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:12.700
 And there were studies that showed that if your blood

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.740
 pressure and heart rate increased every year a little bit

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:21.740
 on average, you were doing well, but they saw that if,

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:26.740
 for example, at the age of 70 or so,

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.580
 your pulse rate stopped increasing

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.880
 or even started decreasing, those people

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.940
 didn't have a long life expectancy.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.780
 - Really?

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.900
 - As long as things were tightening up with age,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:44.640
 in effect compensating for the increased inefficiency

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.980
 because of the PUFA storage.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.980
 If you could keep increasing your blood delivery,

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.400
 you were making up for that inefficiency

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.060
 from the stored lipofuscin.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:58.940
 - I'll be darned.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:02.540
 Yeah, the reason I ask is 'cause mine's about 55 or 60,

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.380
 and if I get 65 or so at night, Mr. Peat,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.300
 I mean, I can tell if I'm above 60,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.380
 and I don't feel good, it feels kind of anxious

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.180
 and feels like a body doesn't wanna sleep.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.780
 It's almost, you know what I'm saying?

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.920
 - Have you checked your temperature at those times?

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.900
 If your hands are cold as you're increasing

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.420
 your heart rate, that means you're running on adrenaline,

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.580
 which is not good.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.820
 - Oh, okay.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.780
 - Your hands should be warm, and your oral temperature

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.040
 shouldn't be too much above your hand temperature.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:48.300
 Keeping your adrenaline low will let your heart rate

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.920
 correspond to your metabolic rate.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.260
 And when you get your temperature up

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.260
 so that your temperature rises to about 98 when you wake up,

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.000
 and then gets up to 98.5 or six or seven

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.200
 when you're moving around, then your heart

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.440
 will have a corresponding increase in rate.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.360
 And that goes with also an increased stroke volume

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.340
 of the heart, so it delivers more blood per beat.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:26.560
 If you're having high adrenaline or other stress hormones,

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:32.260
 your heart is going to have a short stroke,

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.980
 not deliver very much per beat,

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.100
 and so it has to beat faster.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:42.100
 And that leads to inefficiency and tissue stress.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.980
 - So if you get the body temperature up,

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.420
 am I hearing you correctly, the heart may beat

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.780
 a little faster, but you won't feel the anxiety

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:52.620
 because of it?

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.460
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.820
 - That's what you're saying?

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.420
 - Yeah, when your metabolism is going at a good high rate,

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:04.140
 you're producing carbon dioxide in proportion

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.020
 to your oxygen consumption.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.540
 And the carbon dioxide has a relaxing,

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.540
 constructive, sedative effect.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.220
 - Adam, you talk a lot about the carbon dioxide.

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.980
 - Yes, definitely.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.820
 I got the information from Dr. Ray P.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.180
 (laughing)

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.780
 And by the way, let me add that we're just discussing

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.020
 the snowflake on the tip of the iceberg

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.300
 because Dr. Ray P. is a true polymath.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.900
 He's a Renaissance man.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.540
 I recommend you go to his website

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.740
 and read his numerous blogs.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.280
 He also sells a newsletter.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:47.500
 And I don't know when his books are coming back online,

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:51.340
 but he writes books also.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.180
 - Well, good plug there.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.700
 Ray P., stay right there, Mr. P.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:57.820
 We're gonna do a couple commercials, okay?

00:34:57.820 --> 00:34:58.660
 - Okay.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.500
 - You guys stay right there.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.320
 Wow, what fun.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.940
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.020
 We have lots of emails here.

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.460
 I'm not sure how long Mr. P. can hang out.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.580
 I'll ask him when we go back.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.180
 And let's do a few things here

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.300
 and then we'll be right back.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.140
 Stay right there.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.500
 Previously, we talked with Dr. Rulan Zhu

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.140
 about using Perlcium on your teeth.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.820
 - You have to experience it.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.660
 You'll believe it.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.480
 - Yeah, you do.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.860
 That's what I've been saying to my listeners.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.700
 I keep saying, can't even explain this.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.580
 Just buy it.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.620
 Just click on it, buy some.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.460
 Trust me, just trust me.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.500
 And you're gonna like the way your teeth look.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.580
 That's what I keep telling them.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:34.180
 - Dentists, they did an experiment on their clients

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.500
 and they literally prove

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.260
 and they literally show the picture every day.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.100
 And when they take it in a few days,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.660
 their tooth literally become, like you said,

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:43.500
 like a pearl.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.340
 Like a pearl.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.900
 And it looks so beautiful

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.420
 and really white and shiny.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.860
 Yeah, it really works.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:56.220
 And it's also scientifically proven by the experiment.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.500
 And he literally proved it is not only good for your teeth,

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.980
 he also proved it's also good for your gum.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.180
 - Try some of this Perlcium.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.560
 I think you're gonna love it.

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.900
 You can try it internally as well.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.060
 Helps with sleep.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.260
 Great way to get the absorbable calcium

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.340
 and also on your face.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.020
 And you'll see the green ad there,

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.220
 the beautiful green container.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.300
 Get the capsules or the powder, Perlcium.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:23.180
 Click and order, juanradionetwork.com.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.820
 Previously with Andrew Goss,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.740
 I asked him why would someone want to buy coins

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:28.960
 from his company?

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.420
 - So if you don't know coins,

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.540
 you better know your coin dealer.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.780
 And you shouldn't buy coins

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.420
 from someone who isn't well-known registered dealer.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:40.060
 So if they're an NGC dealer,

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.500
 they're registered with NGC.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.020
 If they're a PCGS dealer,

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.660
 they're registered with PCGS.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:47.660
 Ask questions.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.700
 Don't just, oh yeah,

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.500
 here's 10 grand or 50 grand or 150 grand.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.300
 I just want to buy coins,

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.420
 let me know what I'm getting.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.720
 And no, that's not how an intelligent investor does it.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.420
 And we do not let you do that.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:02.580
 So if you're not willing to learn

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.260
 about the coins that you're buying,

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.980
 maybe you should find another coin firm.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.180
 Don't call this one.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.220
 'Cause we're gonna insist that you know why

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.420
 and how a coin is rare.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.460
 And once you know that,

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.980
 then I think you can take that knowledge

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.940
 into the marketplace

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.980
 and make intelligent investment decisions.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.300
 - Aha, what a concept,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.660
 intelligent investment decisions.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.740
 I've known Andrew for 25 years.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.980
 He's the real deal.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:30.980
 His company, STL 800-468-2646.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:33.580
 Give him a call if you're interested.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.780
 800-468-2646.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.060
 Once again, our just heartfelt thanks to all of you

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.780
 in the outpouring of love and affection

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.060
 and goodwill for Andrew Goss,

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.940
 who left us at the mortal coil, as they say,

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.860
 a few days ago of suddenly brain aneurysm

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.980
 and just hundreds of emails and all kinds of stuff.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.820
 So we really, really appreciate it.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.100
 PhD in biology, University of Oregon.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.620
 He's really well studied for a long, long time,

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.600
 as you can hear, Dr. Ray Peat.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.340
 As Adam said, his website is rayPeat.com.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.820
 You're gonna find all kinds of things there,

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.340
 a newsletter and his books and things like that.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.420
 Mr. Peat, let's stick with the temperature a minute.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.860
 So let's see if I'm hearing what you're saying.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.180
 So is the body temperature,

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.420
 so the whole Broder-Barnes idea of in the morning,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:32.420
 you wanna have it, what, 98.6 by mouth or 97.6 under the arm,

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.980
 something like that.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:39.580
 Is that a mechanism of thyroid only

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.660
 or there must be other things going on?

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.940
 Does it necessarily mean you have a pokey thyroid?

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.060
 And if you do have a pokey thyroid,

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.060
 what's your best suggestions?

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:54.100
 - Broder-Barnes spent most of his career

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.500
 up in Colorado at a high altitude

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:02.500
 where people were seldom overheated with high humidity.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.300
 And in Eugene in the summer,

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.020
 with some days were very humid and hot,

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.700
 I found that hypothyroid people

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.500
 would come in with normal temperatures.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.940
 And I realized that even a dead person

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.700
 would have a fairly good temperature

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.580
 when the environmental temperature is very high.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.300
 So I started looking at the pulse rate

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.420
 as well as the temperature.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.660
 And there were lots of experiments

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.220
 with the quality of brain function

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.580
 according to brain temperature,

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:41.860
 as well as pulse rate and delivery of blood,

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.260
 glucose and oxygen to the brain.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:49.100
 Someone devised sort of a heating pad

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.820
 integrated with a helmet

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:54.220
 so they could heat the head specifically.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:59.220
 And again, they would give people mental tests,

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.780
 mental calculation and memory and so on.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.980
 And they found that when they heated the head

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:12.980
 up to I think 101 degrees or slightly more,

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:16.020
 their mental abilities increased

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.500
 with each degree of warmer.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.500
 And if you look at some fairly small-brained animals,

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.460
 if they have a high body temperature,

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:32.420
 like crows and parrots run around

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.420
 with well over 105 degrees Fahrenheit temperature

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.860
 with a very small brain, they're extremely intelligent.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.060
 It isn't brain volume,

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.400
 it's a combination of brain volume

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.420
 plus the working temperature.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.780
 The warmer you can stand,

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:58.180
 you don't want to force yourself to get warmer

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.980
 because your liver has to keep supplying

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.940
 a good stream of glucose

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.020
 and your lungs have to regulate

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.940
 the oxygen delivery efficiently.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:14.140
 But if your system can stand it,

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.620
 the brain works better the warmer it is.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.300
 - Yeah, so again, the mechanism for cold hands and feet,

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.900
 is it totally thyroid or other things going on?

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.620
 - Yeah, you can't have cold hands and feet

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.580
 except during stress.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.980
 Emotional stress raises your adrenaline

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.860
 and will make your hands and feet and nose get cold.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.100
 But if your thyroid is low,

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.560
 you experience stress almost all the time.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.460
 So people run around doing their business

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.220
 with cold hands and feet

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.180
 and wonder why they're inefficient.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:58.140
 If you're highly stressed, for example,

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.700
 during the night, cortisol rises to a peak in the morning

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.420
 because your blood sugar is falling.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.700
 Low thyroid people have extremely high cortisol

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.100
 in the morning, as well as sometimes adrenaline.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.940
 That can make your morning temperature misleadingly warm

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.780
 because the cortisol is tearing down your protein tissues

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.260
 to turn them into glucose.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.100
 - My goodness.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.100
 - And the adrenaline will make your skin cold

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.940
 to increase your core temperature.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:31.260
 So it can be misleading unless you check

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:32.260
 all of those things.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.780
 The cortisol and adrenaline will show up

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:41.540
 as your increased morning temperature and heart rate.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.340
 But then if you have some orange juice and milk,

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.860
 for example, a couple of hours later,

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.940
 if your temperature and pulse rate are slower,

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.860
 that means you're under heavy stress during the night.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:57.000
 - So once again, it's back to our reaction

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.740
 to this world around us, what we call stress

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.740
 is a huge player in, well, everything, right, Mr. B?

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.980
 - Yeah, everything is less stressful

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.780
 when your thyroid is good.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:14.140
 - If we had a good thyroid medication possible,

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.580
 are you okay with people doing that for a little bit

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.180
 to keep your thyroid up, or you like to do other ways,

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.260
 recommend other ways to get the thyroid just working good?

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.520
 - Sure, unless you're eating chicken neck soup

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.320
 or fish head soup every week,

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.880
 everyone really needs a certain amount

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.280
 of thyroid supplement by the time they're 30 or 40.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.280
 - Chicken neck soup or fish head soup, really?

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:47.280
 - Yeah, if you're on a farm or where you get the--

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:48.720
 - The real good stuff, yeah.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.240
 - Yeah, for a while, at Safeway stores,

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.120
 I found that chicken necks contained,

00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:00.080
 about one in 10 contained the whole thyroid gland.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.300
 But when I mentioned that, everyone started buying it,

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.760
 and Safeway stopped selling their necks

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.960
 because they didn't want to get in trouble

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.640
 with the agriculture department.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.940
 - Oh, you mean, so if you could find some good,

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.120
 just chicken necks from Farmer's Market or something,

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.680
 they'd probably have a little thyroid in there

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.160
 and just cook it's soup and make some of that?

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.620
 - Yeah, that works just like the pill.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.480
 - I'll be darned.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.200
 Oh, we have so many emails here.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:34.000
 Let's see what we can do here.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.160
 Here's what I'm confused about.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.960
 Many practitioners who support Dr. Peat's ideas

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.120
 of reducing PUFAs in favor of saturated oils

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.160
 always make an amendment for people

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.800
 that carry APOE4 gene, like myself.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.040
 For this population, the advice is to lower

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.440
 the amount of saturated fats and use more mimosa

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.640
 and more, and polys, because they can't utilize

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.360
 these fats properly.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.840
 They become plaque in the arteries and brain,

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.960
 leading to Alzheimer's.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.960
 Does Mr. Peat have a comment?

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:16.160
 - My recent newsletter on cholesterol,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:20.200
 there were two of them, but I reviewed the effects

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.280
 of PUFA on plaque and cholesterol.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.280
 And with aging, the free cholesterol in the brain

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.640
 drastically decreases.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.400
 People talk about the cholesterol increasing with age,

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.440
 but free cholesterol is decreasing

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:43.240
 because it's being bound to polyunsaturated fats,

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.760
 which make it toxic, and it piles up in the brain

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.400
 and lowers brain metabolism and brain function.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.400
 And in the plaque, it's the in proportion to the PUFA

00:45:55.400 --> 00:46:00.560
 attached to the cholesterol as an ester form

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.400
 that makes the plaque.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:08.920
 In that newsletter, I go in detail over how the enzymes

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.720
 are changed under the influence of PUFA.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.720
 So the plaque is strictly a matter of excess PUFA.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.920
 About 40 years ago, people checked the lipofuscin content,

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:26.160
 basically yellow fat disease of the arteries,

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:32.320
 and found that the plaque was loaded with lipofuscin,

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.880
 the degenerated form of free fatty acids.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.520
 - So back to the PUFAs again.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.520
 Just don't eat these things.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.920
 - Yeah, they cause plaque as well as other problems.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.000
 That's in medical books too.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.520
 - What's that, Adam?

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.800
 - That is actually in medical books

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.520
 that the plaque is formed as PUFAs,

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.400
 and they wish people to believe

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.640
 that they're saturated fatty acids doing it, and it's not.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:07.320
 - For about 40 years, the agriculture department

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.800
 was listing lard as a saturated fat.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.920
 So there are hundreds of publications

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.360
 on so-called saturated fat damage,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.200
 and they were using lard as their saturated fat.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:24.120
 Two or three years ago, it came out someone measured

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:29.120
 that lard saturation found that it was about 30% PUFA.

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.120
 - Oh, you're talking about the hydrogenated classic Crisco

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.280
 or something like that.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:39.120
 - Fully hydrogenated fat is very safe.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:44.120
 There was a Russian study of using saturated peanut oil,

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:49.760
 very hard saturated fat shortening,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.640
 and they found that it reversed

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.360
 the aging changes in mitochondria.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.760
 And since that time, I've shifted

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.960
 to using hydrogenated coconut oil,

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.400
 which is now available on the internet.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.320
 - And that's okay, that's good.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.000
 - Very good, yeah, because it has zero PUFA.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.080
 - Okay, is it actually hydrogenated

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.960
 or just kind of pure or vergage in coconut oil, right?

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.480
 - No, it's actually chemically hydrogenated.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.320
 - That's okay.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.280
 - And yeah, we're looking for ways

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:27.280
 to get the pure saturated form by distillation

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:34.960
 or something other than the chemical treatment.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.840
 That isn't available yet, but it would be the ideal.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.280
 - Any advantages over like a good coconut oil like that

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.400
 or maybe a well-sourced, like an organic farmer

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.840
 that's doing pigs or something

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.200
 and you get the real pure fat that way?

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.720
 Is there any preference in your mind?

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.240
 - In Mexico, out in the country

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.760
 where you can get chickens or pork

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:05.760
 that were fed on fruit and tortillas and--

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.040
 - Yeah.

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:13.040
 - Rather than soy and corn, they're very safe to eat.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.080
 Here's an email, Patrick and Adam

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.280
 have been recently discussing Dr. Emanuel Ravisi

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.880
 and his use of the periodic table

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.200
 to correlate catabolic and adiabolic imbalances in the body.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.440
 Can Mr. P discuss how the thyroid might be an influence

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.680
 to those states and how we supplementing

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:35.160
 with thyroid extract could possibly correct the imbalances?

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.840
 - Yeah, Ravisi was very good on noticing

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:42.160
 the effect of the day-night cycle.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.160
 And I started thinking about that about 40 or 50 years ago

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:51.680
 that you have to look at the hormones in context.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:56.320
 If your liver is in very good condition

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.320
 and your muscles are working right,

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.400
 your body should store several ounces,

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.520
 maybe 10 ounces of sugar,

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.600
 which can be drawn on during the night.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.600
 And if you didn't store your sugar efficiently

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:16.600
 because you were not producing carbon dioxide

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.320
 but instead lactic acid, that wastes your sugar.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.240
 So during the night, you run out of sugar

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.880
 and that raises your adrenaline and cortisol

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.000
 and you start breaking down your tissues,

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.040
 releasing whatever fat is stored.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.840
 And that's what causes bone loss

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.400
 during the night, for example.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:44.720
 And if you can keep your body well-stocked on sugar,

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:51.920
 then you can avoid that nighttime deterioration stress.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.360
 - Well-stocked with sugar, and how do we do that?

00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.200
 - Avoiding the PUFA is the essential thing.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.640
 And eating adequate carbohydrate.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.480
 I've known people who got very sick

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.240
 when they were on a pure meat diet

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:09.400
 because of several reasons.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.160
 Poor balance of amino acids,

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.440
 but mainly the high phosphate content

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.000
 creates stress and increases the cortisol and adrenaline.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.880
 - Gail writes that sometimes I wake up

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.720
 in the middle of the night,

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.280
 and like Patrick talks about sometimes,

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.120
 it's just funny to have some kind of a carbohydrate

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.000
 and it just puts me back to sleep like a little baby.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.800
 And Gail, she wants to know,

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.720
 what's going on in my body when it reacts like that

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.120
 to a carbohydrate?

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.560
 - Salt has a similar effect

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.880
 because it's needed to absorb the sugar from your intestine.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.200
 And when you have too much PUFA in your body,

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.480
 that poisons the ability

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.160
 to produce carbon dioxide from sugar.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.480
 And so in making lactic acid from glucose,

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:04.480
 you use several times more glucose per minute

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.600
 than when you're making carbon dioxide.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.600
 It just churns through the stored glycogen in your body.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.320
 So within an hour or two of going to sleep,

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.840
 your body rings the alarm that you need more sugar.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.000
 It turns on the stress hormones.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.880
 And so if you have,

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.600
 sometimes just a little salty snack will do it

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.700
 because that makes your intestine absorb the sugar

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:33.960
 more efficiently and lowers stress hormones.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:38.440
 But for example, a tablespoon of sugar

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:43.240
 in a glass of milk, could be honey,

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.820
 will usually put a person back to sleep for a couple hours.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.900
 - But you said actually a salty snack

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.600
 would do the same thing.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:52.960
 - Very often it does.

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:56.920
 I've seen people with hyperactive kids

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.400
 who never wanted to go to bed,

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.960
 gave them a little bit of a salty consomme or something

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:06.080
 and just right out like they'd been given a shot

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.440
 of morphine or something.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.280
 - I'll be darned.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:13.120
 Here is Mark, he's in Tennessee.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.040
 Whenever I drink coffee with sugar,

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.820
 when I drink orange juice,

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.900
 I develop a slight heartburn for a short period of time.

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.680
 - How might it alleviate this problem?

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:22.980
 What could be the cause?

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:28.120
 - Good oranges are very important.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.820
 Much of the orange juice that's sold commercially

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.800
 is from unripe oranges.

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.000
 And if they accidentally happen to get ripe oranges,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 they add acid to it to make it taste like people expect.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.900
 So good sweet oranges are very easy on the stomach.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:50.760
 And coffee, the various brands vary,

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.560
 but coffee is always somewhat acidic.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.040
 And it's much easier on the stomach

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:59.880
 if you put some good heavy cream in it as well as sugar.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:03.520
 - And that kind of smooths out coffee, doesn't it?

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.360
 The heavy cream.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.640
 - Yeah, makes it taste better

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:09.000
 and is much easier on the stomach

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.840
 and you absorb the caffeine more slowly.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.160
 - Overall, you're okay generally.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.580
 I'm sorry, I haven't read a lot of your work.

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.620
 Just get so busy here,

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.900
 but just with good dairy and cheese and things like that,

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:25.900
 you think the body's okay with all those things?

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.740
 - Oh yeah, cheese and eggs and milk

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:31.720
 and occasional shellfish.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:37.780
 I think the average person benefits from having liver

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.980
 two or three times a month

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:43.140
 because so many of the foods are unreliable

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.560
 for nutritional content.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:51.160
 - Shellfish has a lot of cholesterol,

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.380
 but we want to keep our cholesterol up though,

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:54.280
 right Mr. P?

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:59.100
 - Yeah, the cosmetics companies have caught on to the fact

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:04.100
 that old people's free cholesterol decreases tremendously.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:09.420
 The skin aging is basically a cholesterol deficiency

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.940
 syndrome, the way Alzheimer's disease,

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:17.940
 it gets the fatty acid ester, which is toxic,

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:23.580
 but the real cholesterol is down by about 50% in aged skin.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:28.940
 The cosmetics companies are building on experiments

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:33.280
 which showed that if you add cholesterol to the skin,

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:37.980
 it restores the cell function.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.780
 Live cells come back, the dead flaky cells aren't produced

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.500
 when there's adequate cholesterol.

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:46.940
 So they're actually adding cholesterol

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.600
 to the cosmetic creams.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:54.300
 And that biologically is very appropriate

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:58.780
 because the reason old people need more vitamin D

00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:02.220
 is because vitamin D is made when sunlight hits

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.040
 the cholesterol in the skin.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:08.980
 And if you're old, the skin has only half as much

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:10.480
 cholesterol as a young person,

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.780
 so you produce half as much vitamin D.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.340
 So an old person just doesn't,

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.060
 they need twice as much sunlight as a young person.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:23.460
 - A lot of studies we've recently seen, Mr. P,

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.000
 out of Europe about the higher the cholesterol number

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.860
 for people 60, 70, and 80, the longer they live.

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.460
 - Yeah, there were studies in the US too

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.740
 in which people in rest homes and such,

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.180
 they looked at their cholesterol

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.260
 and checked how long they lived.

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:45.300
 250, 260 were the longest living.

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.060
 It's the same idea.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:54.420
 If you look at how much progesterone an ovary produces,

00:56:54.420 --> 00:57:00.980
 it's exactly proportional to the amount of cholesterol

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:02.860
 in the blood going into the ovary.

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.300
 Same with your adrenals and brain, any tissue.

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:11.300
 It makes its hormones like DHEA, pregnenolone,

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:15.580
 and progesterone by converting cholesterol

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.940
 straight into the steroid hormone.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.660
 And to do that, thyroid is the catalyst.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:25.780
 - Do you have a number that you go by

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.620
 that you'd like to see the minimum cholesterol

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.380
 so people can do the whole hormone thing,

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.980
 testosterone and the rest of it?

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:37.140
 - Yeah, 180 is good for a middle-aged person,

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.380
 but by the time a person is 50,

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.320
 according to the Framingham study,

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:45.900
 the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is higher

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:50.280
 in people who are not over 200 in their cholesterol.

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.060
 - Patrick, this is an interesting question from Leroy.

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:57.100
 Patrick recently had a good friend

00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:01.180
 that had a brain aneurysm and just left.

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:06.180
 Can Mr. Peate explain the overall mechanism of strokes,

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.560
 whether they be in the brain or other parts of the body?

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:15.460
 - Experimenters have produced aneurysms

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:19.900
 in as short a time as one hour

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.180
 giving the angiotensin hormone.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:26.860
 You produce angiotensin when the kidneys

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.460
 aren't getting what they need.

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.500
 Kidneys send out a signal, renin,

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:36.660
 which causes many tissues to produce angiotensin

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.740
 and the angiotensin converting enzymes,

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:44.780
 the inhibitors are used as drugs.

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:49.540
 That's one of the few drugs that has a logical basis.

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:54.540
 If you give an animal an overdose of angiotensin,

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:59.060
 it immediately damages the artery

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.780
 so much that it has an aneurysm.

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.980
 And if you block that angiotensin,

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.020
 you can reverse aneurysms,

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:13.940
 simply restoring the energy to the blood vessels.

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:18.540
 And you don't produce excess angiotensin

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:22.980
 if your kidneys are getting the blood supply they need,

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.420
 nourishment they need.

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:29.420
 And so thyroid and a diet adequate and free of PUFA

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:35.340
 is what keeps your kidneys getting the nutrients they need

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:38.180
 so they don't raise your angiotensin.

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.060
 - So that could be the connection with the kidneys

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:43.980
 and the filtration and the classic high blood pressure

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.580
 and the strokes?

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.140
 - Yeah, and salt is another thing

00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.860
 that guarantees adequate blood volume,

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:57.260
 perfusing the kidneys so they don't produce

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.540
 those toxic angiotensin reactants.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:07.700
 Salt lowers your aldosterone produced by the adrenals

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:13.660
 and aldosterone works parallel to the angiotensin

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.260
 causing tissue degeneration.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:19.100
 There are now drugs coming out to lower

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:24.100
 or oppose aldosterone to protect the failing heart.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:29.540
 High aldosterone is produced by chronic deficiency

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.540
 of sodium in your diet.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.300
 And aldosterone causes fibrosis,

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.360
 aging of all of the tissues,

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.940
 but the heart is usually the first one

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.700
 that shows up the effect as heart failure.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.700
 So the low sodium diet is one of the most dangerous things.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.700
 - And that's why some people I think have a good experience

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.900
 maybe using salt before bed,

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:58.380
 even like a half a teaspoon just straight away with sleep.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.500
 That makes sense, huh?

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.720
 - Yeah, even a fourth of a teaspoon is very helpful.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.100
 - Here's an email from Robert.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.460
 Does Ray Peat still drink three quarts of milk a day?

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:10.940
 And what are the benefits of milk?

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:13.700
 Are you still drinking three quarts of milk a day?

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.020
 - Yeah, sometimes 20, 30 years ago,

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.380
 I drank a gallon a day.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.220
 - Really?

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:28.140
 - The problem with grains and leaves

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.420
 is that the plants produce these defensive toxins.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:36.420
 And if a cow ate those and didn't process them in some way,

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:42.380
 the cow would succumb to all of those toxins.

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.620
 But the cow has an extra stomach

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:49.340
 that lets bacteria and protozoa and yeast

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.820
 process out those toxins.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:57.820
 So it's a very complex chemical detoxifying process.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:03.020
 Before the cow absorbs the protein and amino acids

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.580
 and sugars into the blood,

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:10.820
 the plant material has been very detoxified.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.020
 So you're getting all of those nutrients

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.180
 multiply filtered.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:21.540
 It's filtered before it gets into the bloodstream

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.940
 and from the bloodstream to the udder,

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.340
 it's filtered again.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.820
 So it's the most highly refined food

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.900
 that we can get economically.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.780
 - And I suspect you're talking about raw,

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.620
 really good grass-fed and all that stuff.

01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:43.140
 - Yeah, but even low-fat pasteurized milk,

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.780
 still the best food available,

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.900
 even if it isn't organic and raw.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:49.060
 - No kidding, really.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:50.580
 I'm surprised to hear you say that

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:53.660
 because there's so much negative stuff said about,

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.860
 Mr. Peat, about pasteurizing milk and all that.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.260
 - Yeah, it's better when it's unpasteurized.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.100
 - Sure.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:07.100
 - And the whole milk is superfood,

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:13.060
 but just 1% milk from the supermarket

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.700
 is better than most alternatives.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.100
 - Steve writes in, "Fats are fun.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.700
 "Nothing like butter, coconut oil.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.180
 "How about wheat germ oil?

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.700
 "I heard it helps build the myelin sheaths.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.780
 "Is that true?

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.480
 "And what are the positive or negative effects

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.660
 "of consuming wheat germ oil?

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:31.140
 "Is it actually made from wheat?

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:36.140
 "Or if so, would there be concern about the source?"

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:41.740
 - The samples that I tried 30 or 40, 50 years ago

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:46.220
 always were chokingly rancid,

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:51.220
 dark color and deteriorated by oxygen

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.780
 because it's so highly polyunsaturated.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:58.960
 I think it's a very toxic oil,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.380
 but it does have the vitamin E in it.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:07.380
 So if you've refined it to any degree,

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.340
 then it is a source of vitamin E,

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.020
 but I think it's very dangerous

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.340
 because of how easily it gets rancid.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.820
 It's the same with lecithin.

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:22.620
 Commercial lecithin generally ranges

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:25.140
 from yellow to brown to black,

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:29.340
 depending on how deteriorated it is.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.540
 Fresh lecithin is pure white,

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.180
 and it's the polyunsaturated fats

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:39.180
 turning to pre-yellow fat.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.260
 Turns yellow right in the bottle.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.820
 - Lots of lecithin in it, really good.

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.040
 Range, eggs, you like eggs?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:52.020
 - Yeah, if the chickens have been fed--

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.140
 - Good stuff, yeah.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.420
 - Good stuff, yeah.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.240
 If they range in the pasture.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:01.420
 And in Mexico, people feed their chickens tortillas

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:07.900
 and such things, vegetables, fruits, tortillas,

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:09.740
 and let them eat bugs.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.900
 Then the eggs are very saturated.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:16.900
 I've looked up the degree of polyunsaturated fats in eggs

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.420
 over the last, I think it was 80 years.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.260
 - Oh, wow.

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.300
 - And there's a tremendous,

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.020
 the commercial eggs are now,

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.020
 mostly polyunsaturated fat.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:29.860
 - Wow.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.260
 - Where 100 years ago, they were extremely saturated.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:38.260
 So I've reduced my US egg consumption to one per day,

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:45.260
 figuring that I can count on detoxifying some of the PUFA.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.260
 - Yeah, so I wonder, Ray Peat,

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.700
 farmers markets around the country,

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:53.740
 you can find farmers that range feed their chickens,

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:55.820
 but sometimes they have to supplement,

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.020
 and you can find farmers that are doing good organic grains

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.460
 with no soy even, here in Dripping Springs,

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.980
 if you can believe it, no soy.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.720
 Now are those grains,

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.540
 even if they're well-tended organic grains,

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.620
 are they adding to the PUFA in the eggs?

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:11.420
 - Yes.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.260
 - Are they?

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:14.820
 - And you want to check the box

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.900
 to see that they haven't given them flax

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.860
 or any of the omega minus three,

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.420
 because those make the egg taste fishy.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.660
 - Oh, so you want to make sure there's no flax.

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.740
 What else in the feed that they don't want?

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:34.260
 You know, just omega three stuff, right?

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.120
 - Yeah, I don't know if it's even legal to put fish meal in,

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.420
 but for a while they were getting fish additives.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.740
 - So this is a good question, yeah.

01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:47.260
 You've been talking so much about PUFAs, Mr. Peat.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.660
 Can you just list some of the most active

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:53.520
 and popular PUFAs that people are consuming?

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:59.520
 - Oh, fish oil, krill oil, fatty fish.

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:05.840
 People advocating salmon,

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.000
 but I stopped eating salmon 45 years ago, I guess.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.840
 And then the various cooking oils,

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.360
 soy, corn, safflower oil,

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.440
 all of the highly unsaturated oils

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.840
 should be avoided perfectly.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.600
 - So salmon's a fatty fish.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.280
 - Yeah.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.200
 - Oh, man.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.500
 A lot of people eat salmon.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.600
 Yeah.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.960
 Is avocado filled with PUFAs as well?

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.160
 Says Lynn, which is the best liquid oil to cook with

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.360
 and the best oil to consume on salads besides olive oil?

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.160
 Good question there.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.960
 - If the avocado oil comes from the seed,

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.120
 it's pretty saturated and safe.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.280
 But if they use a whole fruit,

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.040
 that would be very unsaturated.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:01.640
 So I think you shouldn't eat

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:07.880
 a lot of fresh avocados regularly.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.120
 - And so, and she's asking the best liquid

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.960
 that you like to cook with?

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.560
 I mean, like oil, yeah, oil, sorry.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.120
 - Yeah, I use a little olive oil for some foods,

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.600
 quite a bit of butter for frying eggs,

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.780
 and for frying chicken wings, for example,

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:32.760
 saturated hydrogenated coconut oil is ideal.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.120
 - Adam, are you familiar with what Ray and Peat

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.440
 are talking about this hydrogenation of coconut oil

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:41.480
 and how you like coconut oil?

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480
 - Yes, I am.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.880
 Definitely a lot of the coconut oils

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.840
 in the health food store are not pure oil.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:51.080
 So at the very least, you get a pure oil,

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.520
 which Ray and Peat used to get,

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.420
 if I remember right, from some company.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:59.360
 But now the hydrogenated oil,

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.700
 I understand that he's gone to.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.080
 And it may have been my experience

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.160
 because the coconut oil that's called virgin coconut oil,

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.120
 often in the health food store,

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.880
 contrary to popular belief,

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.680
 because there are some poofers in there,

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.200
 it does go rancid.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.760
 So I definitely take Dr. Peat's advice.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:27.560
 - Ghee too, right, Mr. Peat?

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:28.400
 That's a good one?

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.240
 Some ghee?

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.080
 - Some what?

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:31.960
 - Ghee?

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.120
 - Oh, ghee, yeah, that's fine.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:39.120
 Fresh butter, it's just a way of concentrating

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.440
 the fat from butter.

01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:44.000
 But I actually like the taste of fresh butter

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.800
 better than ghee, but ghee is nutritionally good.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.040
 - Does Mr. Peat have an opinion about the TSH level?

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.960
 So many people vary on their numbers that they go by.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.020
 That would be a determination for a low thyroid.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:05.760
 - The problem with TSH is that

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.960
 the medical profession practically,

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.260
 totally ignores the factors that regulate TSH.

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:21.460
 When you're under stress, the stress hormones lower it.

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:24.660
 So you can look like you're hyperthyroid.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:29.660
 You can have 0.005 on your TSH

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:32.860
 and seem to be a hyperthyroid person.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.100
 But it could be your stress hormones lowering it.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.820
 And if you don't measure the stress hormones

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:44.820
 and your T3, reverse T3 is also increased

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.300
 by those same stress hormones.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:53.140
 So people are being diagnosed as hyperthyroid

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:56.380
 when they're extremely stressed and hypothyroid

01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:01.100
 with very low real T3 relative to reverse T3.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:06.120
 So you have to measure several things at the same time

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.500
 to know what the TSH means.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.620
 I've never seen a person who really felt good

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:17.620
 whose TSH was as high as 2.0.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:24.460
 And people are healthiest when their TSH is 0.4 or less.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:31.740
 - Wow, that's pretty low, wow.

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:36.740
 - Yeah, the range has been adjusted down over the years.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.300
 But then a couple of years ago,

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:44.020
 some pressure was exerted and they reversed

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.860
 and went back up for a while.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:50.860
 But the safe range seems to be now recognized

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:56.180
 by quite a few experts as 0.2 to 2.0.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:01.020
 - Oh, be darned, that's pretty low.

01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.540
 This is a good question.

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.140
 John says, "Patrick has talked from time to time

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.340
 "and had an interview a fellow up in Pennsylvania,

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.740
 "from Birmingham, Pennsylvania, Amos Miller,

01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:15.660
 "where you can actually buy fresh thyroid

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.900
 "from well-tended cows."

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:22.640
 Would Mr. Peat think it's a good idea to eat some of those?

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:27.500
 - Yeah, you want to recognize the potency, though.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.580
 - Yeah, why be strong?

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:33.860
 - Yeah, one gram of dehydrated gland

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:37.600
 is equal to 15 grains of thyroid.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.140
 I knew someone who liked chicken necks

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:42.780
 when he worked on the farm.

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:47.700
 And on the day they had chicken, he would eat five necks.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.300
 And he said that afternoon,

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:53.040
 he was always too hot to work very well.

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.420
 (laughing)

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:59.260
 He was getting about five grains in one meal.

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.780
 And that can make you overheat.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:05.220
 So one grain would be 15,

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:09.500
 one gram of dehydrated beef thyroid

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.460
 would be equal to 15 grains of the medical--

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.300
 - Oh, I see.

01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:17.500
 So one gram of like a beef thyroid,

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.580
 if it's fresh or whatever it was,

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:22.220
 equals 15 grains?

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.660
 - Yeah. - Of desiccated, right.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:24.500
 Of desiccated.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.820
 - Yeah, so you want to divide it into 15 portions.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.620
 - Yeah, be pretty careful there, yeah.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.700
 - Yeah. - Wow.

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.300
 Please ask Mr. P what a person should do

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.580
 who's had their thyroid radiated.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.140
 - Oh, boy.

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:40.760
 - Then you need to take thyroid.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:46.060
 Probably the healthy young person's gland

01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:51.060
 produces about four grains of thyroid per day,

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:54.460
 the equivalent.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:59.460
 And doctors will often supply only thyroxine,

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:05.980
 only T4, and that will suppress your TSH down to zero,

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.380
 but you aren't necessarily getting

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.060
 any thyroid function from that

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:15.580
 because it depends on good sugar supply

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:19.540
 and selenium for your tissues to convert T4

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.580
 to the active T3.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:28.140
 So using a glandular thyroid or the equivalent,

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.220
 such as Cynoplus or Thyrolar,

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:37.780
 you should think in terms of a healthy person

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:42.120
 being able to produce four grains per day.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:48.660
 You can usually maintain good function at two grains,

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:53.120
 but just in case symptoms show up,

01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:58.900
 you shouldn't resist taking the full four-grain supplement.

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:03.900
 Armour Company used to make lots of five-grain tablets,

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:08.620
 and veterinarians generally recognized

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:13.340
 that cocker spaniels often needed a five-grain tablet,

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:16.320
 even though they weighed maybe 50 pounds.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:23.420
 And lots of human patients required five grains.

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:26.380
 I knew a couple people,

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:31.380
 one woman who was very sick for about 30 years.

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.420
 Her hips were about a yard wide,

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:40.420
 and she had to use a walker, could barely get around.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:44.340
 She found a doctor who would prescribe five grains,

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:48.140
 and she improved so much over a couple of months,

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.780
 she went to another doctor and got an additional five grains

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.940
 and on 10-grains supplement, she was almost well.

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.940
 She found a third doctor,

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:03.940
 and taking 15 grains a day in just two or three weeks,

01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:07.860
 she was totally healthy and got a job.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:12.860
 And after 30 years of extreme hypothyroidism,

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:18.820
 that was apparently because her liver had been poisoned

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:23.020
 so that she wasn't able to convert the T4 component.

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:26.940
 And with 15 grains of Armour thyroid,

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.700
 she was really getting the equivalent

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:33.260
 of a good four-grain function.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.740
 - Now, do I understand, is a grain, that's 60 milligrams?

01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:38.900
 - 60 or 61.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.260
 - Wow, I mean, so the body makes, what,

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.860
 240 milligrams of healthy thyroid?

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.540
 - Yeah, when a healthy person is working well,

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:50.740
 it can make that much.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:55.420
 - What does Mr. Peat think about collagen from bone broth?

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.320
 Good for us?

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.980
 - Yeah, if you don't use the marrow,

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.820
 avoid the long bones, use just the joints,

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.820
 so that there's a lot of cartilage and ligaments.

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:13.100
 Those are the source of the gelatin.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:15.300
 Very little comes out of the bone itself.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.220
 - Oh, you mean like chicken feed and stuff like that,

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:19.900
 they have a lot of collagen.

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:23.780
 - Yeah, chicken backs and necks and skin and wings,

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:27.420
 those are the greatest chicken soup.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.840
 - Are the cosmetic companies that Mr. Peat talked about

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:34.060
 adding LDL, HDL, or a combination to their skin creams?

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:39.300
 - I don't, I assumed that they were just using

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:42.740
 a fairly refined cholesterol,

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:47.240
 rather than the actual stuff out of the bloodstream.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.620
 - Here's from Don in New Jersey.

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:54.180
 Do you think NAD IV treatment is safe, NAD?

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:55.860
 Never heard of that one.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:56.700
 Never heard?

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.860
 - NAD?

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.900
 - NAD IV treatment, right.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:06.500
 - No, niacinamide raises your cellular NAD,

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.020
 and that's what you want.

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:15.760
 But if you inject things intravenously,

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:22.300
 I think you're risking reactions en route to the cell.

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:26.780
 Niacinamide is taken up,

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:29.760
 and the cell does no harm in the cell,

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.860
 and it's converted to NAD,

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:36.900
 so you can raise it in a safe way.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:39.780
 - Leslie is in Sacramento.

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.420
 Supposing we're on a good, well-balanced,

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:44.220
 totally organic diet,

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:48.220
 are there supplements that Mr. Ray Peat suggested

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:51.460
 that we should be taking just because we need them?

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.300
 Good question.

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:55.160
 - It depends on what's in your diet.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:00.500
 Often people will include green salad

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.420
 and whole grain bread,

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:08.420
 and maybe legumes and some things that are high in toxins.

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:14.140
 The number of people who are chronically sick

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.960
 because they're eating green salads, it's amazing.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:25.340
 I've seen people get well from chronic problems

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.460
 just by leaving out their green salads.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:28.500
 - Well, what's with the lettuce?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:29.900
 What's going on?

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:33.820
 - It's the defensive chemicals in the leaf.

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.280
 They aren't as intense as in the seed,

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:41.280
 but they are designed to block digestive enzymes

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.720
 in the grazers.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.980
 Cows, goats, and insects, and worms,

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:50.040
 and things that would eat their leaves get poisoned,

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:56.220
 unless they, like a cow, have a rumen to detoxify those.

01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:00.020
 And people don't have the detoxifying system,

01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:04.460
 and so their digestive enzymes are simply blocked

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.700
 by the chemicals in the leafy greens.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.300
 Unless you cook them thoroughly,

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.500
 that breaks down a lot of the toxins.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.940
 - So that's the argument for a lot of people,

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:18.260
 Ray Peat, of cooking vegetables rather than raw.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:20.860
 I know my grandma used to, she'd say,

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.740
 "Oh yeah, you should cook your lettuce.

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:24.580
 "Don't eat raw, cook your lettuce."

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:27.280
 She lived to 96 and never was sick a day in her life.

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.700
 - Yeah, she-- - She knew.

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:34.420
 - Yeah, she knew, even without reading the research,

01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.900
 apparently. - Yeah, yeah.

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.640
 Well, it's funny.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:43.340
 Here's a lady that, she's got swollen ankles,

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:47.660
 a lot of knees, and both knees have knobs sticking out.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.500
 I also have a pregnant-looking belly fat,

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:54.100
 and the wrists and knees are about two years old,

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:59.100
 and I'm wondering if Mr. Peat would suggest

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.580
 like progesterone and maybe thyroid product

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.980
 for potential benefit.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:07.100
 - Yeah, the basic problem is usually

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:11.780
 that a low thyroid person has slow digestion,

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:15.980
 and so foods are feeding bacteria in the intestine.

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:18.900
 Bacteria produce endotoxin,

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.800
 and if your intestine is irritated and hypothyroid,

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.960
 you absorb that endotoxin into the system

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.140
 along with some allergens,

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:32.940
 and so the combination of low thyroid and slow digestion

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:37.940
 will cause various inflammatory degenerative processes.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.420
 And when you're low thyroid,

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.660
 you aren't converting cholesterol

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:45.980
 to the protective hormones,

01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:50.540
 and so if your cholesterol is very high,

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.500
 that means you're probably deficient

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:58.780
 in those protective hormones like progesterone

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.040
 and pregnenolone and DHEA.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.100
 And I've seen people supplement,

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:08.060
 like a woman came visiting from Sweden

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:12.020
 to give lectures in Eugene,

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:16.700
 and she had had, I think it was two joints replaced,

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:21.700
 and was about to have knee and shoulder replacements

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:27.400
 because all of her joints were getting so deformed.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:32.600
 She spread progesterone over all of her body

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:37.200
 and spent two or three days in Eugene

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:40.000
 walking around seeing the sights

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.040
 with absolutely no joint pain.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:47.020
 - Gail writes in, "I'm taking 90 milligrams of pig thyroid

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.940
 "and I feel good.

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:52.360
 "I just wonder if I take it ongoing that it's harmful

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.740
 "or will my thyroid ever get back to doing things normally

01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.900
 "without the pig thyroid?"

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:01.300
 - People have experimented with that,

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:05.020
 experimentally giving higher and higher doses

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:08.620
 of a supplement, watching what is happening

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.460
 with the glands output.

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:12.300
 And they would increase the dose

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:17.100
 until the thyroid shrank and stopped producing.

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:21.960
 And then they would stop the dosing and measure the return.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.280
 And it's almost immediate.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:30.280
 I've seen people who could feel a stretching sensation

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:35.040
 when they were changing their thyroid dose.

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.620
 Once I was supplementing a full four-grain dose,

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:43.980
 and I noticed that I had indentations

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:48.580
 beside my Adam's apple where my thyroid had been.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.260
 So I stopped taking it.

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:53.060
 The very next morning, my neck was smooth.

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:55.260
 The glands had enlarged enough

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.620
 to fill out those empty spaces.

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:01.280
 So it's extremely fast at coming back when it's needed.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.620
 - So what are some of the key things

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:06.120
 that people should do in lifestyle or diet

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.220
 if they wanna start trying to cut down on the pig thyroid

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:11.140
 and get this baby working again?

01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:14.640
 What would be some things that they would play with

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.780
 so they don't feel terrible during the process?

01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:21.180
 - Vitamin D is extremely important.

01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:26.140
 It works right along with the thyroid to regulate sugar

01:24:26.140 --> 01:24:29.220
 because calcium regulates everything.

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:33.020
 And vitamin D is an important calcium regulator

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:34.900
 along with thyroid.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:38.860
 And people sometimes are depressed

01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:41.580
 or have other nervous symptoms

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:44.240
 just because they're vitamin D deficient.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.420
 But vitamin D, part of what it does

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:51.660
 is to suppress the parathyroid hormone.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:54.700
 When you're low in calcium and vitamin D,

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:59.000
 the parathyroid hormone tears the calcium out of your bones

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000
 to keep your blood level where it should be or higher.

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:09.060
 And that causes many degenerative symptoms.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:14.420
 And eating about 2000 milligrams of calcium per day

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:17.620
 I think is pretty close to ideal

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.500
 if your vitamin D is also up around the middle

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.780
 of the range on the blood level.

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:26.940
 - So what else?

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:30.060
 Can we get enough vitamin D from the sun in your opinion?

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:33.860
 - Yeah, but if you're over 50,

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:37.900
 your time in the sun has to be much longer

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.780
 than when you were younger.

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:44.780
 And it takes from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the United States

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:49.720
 is usually the only time that you're gonna get

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:51.500
 like a whole body exposure.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:56.140
 In 30 minutes, you can do it right at the middle of the day.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.620
 - And you wanna get on the skin, right?

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.540
 - Yeah, it has to be directly onto the skin.

01:26:00.540 --> 01:26:02.300
 - So to boost up thyroid function

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.980
 while you're cutting back,

01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.620
 you just mentioned vitamin D, calcium, anything else?

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:10.740
 - Enough good sugar in the diet.

01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:12.620
 That's why I recommend orange juice.

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.140
 A quarter or two of orange juice

01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:18.180
 is very supportive to your thyroid.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.020
 - Oh, be done.

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:19.860
 Adam, what's your,

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:23.620
 didn't you say orange juice at a certain time

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:25.580
 is the best thing for the thyroid?

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.820
 What was it, nine o'clock at night or midnight?

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.540
 - Well, I usually take it in the morning,

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.020
 but it's good anytime.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.340
 And I can tell you one thing,

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.820
 that oranges, I won't go into details, changed my life.

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.700
 It was one of the most important things

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.180
 I learned from Ray Peat.

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:43.980
 I've been eating one almost every day for six years

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.980
 since I first heard Ray Peat.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:46.820
 - I'll be darned.

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:49.780
 - A couple of people have told me

01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:54.660
 that their melanoma disappeared or got under control

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:57.860
 when they started drinking a lot of orange juice.

01:26:57.860 --> 01:26:59.540
 - But see, I've always heard, you guys,

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:02.060
 that, oh, there's just so much sugar in orange juice.

01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:04.260
 You don't wanna drink orange juice, you know?

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:09.460
 - Yeah, they're advertising conspiracies

01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.940
 against salt and sugar.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:12.780
 - Yeah.

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.900
 Does Ray Peat have any opinion on John Elliswater

01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:18.380
 from Maggie in New York?

01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.020
 - No, I don't know what it is.

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.260
 - I don't know what that is either.

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:24.340
 Do you know what that is, Adam, John Elliswater?

01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.180
 - No.

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:27.780
 By the way, on a kind of a offbeat question,

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.900
 a friend of mine will not forgive me if I don't ask this.

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:34.380
 What does Ray Peat think about pleomorphism?

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.180
 - Pleomorphism?

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.980
 Is that like another thing,

01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:41.020
 another other than earthly being, you know,

01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:44.140
 on Prime Video, or what is pleomorphism?

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.820
 - Apparently, a bacteria can change into a virus,

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.980
 vice versa, and other things like that.

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:52.780
 And anyway, a friend of mine would like the answer to that.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:57.100
 - Yeah, there is a lot to that,

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:00.660
 but the particular practitioners,

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:03.460
 I think, drove it into the ground

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:08.100
 by trying to sell their particular treatments.

01:28:08.100 --> 01:28:13.100
 But yeah, there are various alternative forms.

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:20.500
 And it relates to a bigger question.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.580
 We actually have pleomorphic cells,

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:27.260
 stem cells in our tissues,

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:30.140
 which are pleomorphic in the sense that they

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.620
 are pluripotent.

01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:36.420
 They can develop into what we need

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:38.980
 unless we're poisoning them with PUFA

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.300
 and heavy metals and radiation.

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:47.340
 And our tissues should be able to change form as needed.

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:54.300
 And incidentally, when you eat a particular food,

01:28:55.140 --> 01:28:58.980
 like beef or chicken or fruit,

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:03.980
 you are absorbing and integrating some of their DNA

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.140
 into your own structure.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:11.100
 And that increases, I think, in the long run,

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:16.100
 our capacity to produce the changes that we need.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:22.020
 We have only about 5% of our DNA is really in use.

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.580
 And we have that big reserve

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:29.500
 that we can draw on under stress.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.780
 - Interesting.

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.820
 - I've heard that they call that horizontal DNA

01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:37.020
 versus the vertical DNA.

01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:37.860
 - Yeah.

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:40.980
 - You guys are geeks with horizontal and vertical, man.

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.180
 I tell you.

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.960
 - Horizontal transmission of DNA.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:48.060
 - Here's a good question.

01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:50.420
 Leon, late at night,

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:53.860
 I have a very, very slight teeth chattering.

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.420
 And not because I'm cold.

01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:58.540
 Does Ray Peed have an opinion on what could be the cause

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:00.580
 and the cure of that one?

01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:02.860
 - I think that's, again, the adrenaline.

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.460
 - Ah, the adrenaline.

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:09.140
 - Yeah, and sugar and salt and calcium,

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:14.140
 milk and vitamin D are behind the thyroid function

01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:16.860
 to keep your blood sugar steady.

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:17.700
 - So let's see.

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.780
 So he could increase the sugar and salt

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:22.180
 and that would lower adrenaline,

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:25.980
 which would increase thyroid and then lower that down.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:27.660
 So you think it's the adrenaline hit

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.380
 that's the teeth chattering?

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:32.060
 - Yeah, I think it is.

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.420
 - Interesting.

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:37.520
 Lynn wants to know what digestive enzymes would be helpful

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.780
 for eating more raw foods or even cooked foods?

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:46.540
 - Nothing, well, you could eat fungal enzymes

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:48.380
 to break down cellulose and such,

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:52.820
 but the problem is that you get traces of the fungus

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:55.140
 along with the enzyme.

01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:59.140
 So I think it's better to try to not break down cellulose

01:30:59.140 --> 01:30:59.980
 in your intestine.

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:02.540
 The cellulose is having a good function

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:05.300
 to sort of sweep things along,

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.980
 help them not be reabsorbed.

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:12.900
 Your liver excretes toxins into the bile.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.940
 And if you have fiber moving through your intestine,

01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:19.860
 that will prevent that toxin being reabsorbed

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.180
 so you can excrete it.

01:31:21.180 --> 01:31:23.300
 - Interesting.

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.500
 Oh, here's a good...

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:30.260
 People are hearing a lot of,

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.580
 so much about too much stomach acid,

01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:33.820
 not enough stomach acid.

01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.180
 You know, after Jonathan Wright did his whole thing,

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:38.660
 well, everybody over 50 doesn't have enough stomach acid.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.620
 They should take HCL or apple cider vinegar.

01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:43.620
 What's your experience with it in research?

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:45.940
 And would there be a reason why,

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:49.940
 just because somebody is 50, 60, or 70,

01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:52.140
 revolutions around the sun or age,

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.740
 that they would just not have enough stomach acid

01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.740
 to do their thing?

01:31:55.740 --> 01:32:01.900
 - Yeah, the thyroid is really the source of acid.

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:03.740
 - There you go back to the thyroid again.

01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:08.740
 - Yeah, oxygen is named, means the source of acid.

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:13.620
 And thyroid acidifies your tissue

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:18.140
 with carbon dioxide production, carbonic acid.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:23.140
 And that should keep your cells inside acidic

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:26.900
 and outside relatively basic.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:32.940
 And the stomach depends on that carbon dioxide production

01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:35.700
 to produce the hydrochloric acid.

01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:36.540
 - Fascinating.

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:40.060
 - In ability to use oxygen and thyroid,

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.860
 increases with age because of the PUFA

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:45.740
 and heavy metal accumulation.

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:50.740
 And so getting your thyroid metabolism right

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:54.060
 will usually improve all of your digestion,

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.540
 including the acid.

01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:56.660
 - Interesting.

01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:59.900
 So maybe a lot of this low acid stuff that we're hearing

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:03.820
 is all coming back to this plethora,

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:07.300
 just epidemic proportions of underactive thyroid.

01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.780
 - Yeah. - Yeah, wow.

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:15.420
 - By the tests that were used up to 1940,

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:20.500
 easily 40% of the American population is hypothyroid,

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.700
 just by the medical standards up to 1940.

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.940
 Then the drug companies got involved,

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.260
 sold their phony tests,

01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:33.260
 like the protein bound iodine test in the late 1940s,

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:37.820
 convinced everyone who had been taking thyroid,

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:40.420
 they showed normal on that test.

01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:42.620
 And so they stopped taking thyroid.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.700
 Doctors taught everyone that the reason

01:33:44.700 --> 01:33:49.700
 they're fat and lethargic is because of their bad character

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.620
 rather than low thyroid,

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.740
 because the tests showed they were normal.

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:56.740
 20 years later, that test was shown to be

01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:00.900
 absolutely unrelated to thyroid function.

01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:05.740
 So for 20 years, people were indoctrinated

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:08.980
 to believe that 95% of the population

01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:13.220
 has good thyroid function, where it was a phony test.

01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:15.780
 But on the basis of that belief

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:19.220
 that only 5% might be hypothyroid,

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:22.940
 the new tests, TSH,

01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:26.140
 is meaningfully related to thyroid,

01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.580
 although ambiguously.

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:33.340
 But those new tests were interpreted

01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:37.580
 in terms of the 95% not needing thyroid.

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:40.260
 So no matter how good a test it is,

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:43.260
 if your assumptions are wrong,

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:45.660
 the test isn't gonna do you any good.

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:51.100
 - So if we take supplemental iodine,

01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:55.260
 Lugol's or detoxify the Edgar Cayce thing,

01:34:55.260 --> 01:34:59.500
 does that help the thyroid function?

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:00.340
 - No.

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:03.860
 And over the years, it's likely to make it worse.

01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:04.700
 - Oh, good.

01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:08.380
 - Most people, iodized salt is usually,

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:13.420
 around the world where they have iodized the salt,

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:18.420
 they see increased thyroid gland degenerative conditions,

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:23.900
 increased nodules, inflammation, Hashimoto's disease,

01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.340
 and so on, you can produce it

01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:30.740
 by just a moderately excess of iodine.

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.660
 - So you're not, I take it then,

01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.940
 you're not a supporter of taking

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:37.420
 supplemental iodine at all?

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.860
 - No, seafood, once a week, eating seafood

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.980
 gives you all the iodine you can use.

01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:44.420
 - And again, you said the low-fat,

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.220
 I've written it down, but the low-fat fish

01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:48.260
 are cod and sole?

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.540
 - Sole.

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.380
 - Cod and sole.

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:54.700
 Wow.

01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:57.660
 Is there an adrenal supplement we can take

01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:02.660
 to lower the adrenal problem, writes Robert?

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:08.540
 - If you're on a farm, the adrenal gland

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.540
 is very good nutritionally.

01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:12.980
 It contains pregnenolone,

01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:15.420
 and a small supplement of pregnenolone,

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:19.420
 if you can find a safe source, which I can't.

01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:24.420
 But pregnenolone used to be a good, reliable support

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.460
 for adrenal problems.

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:29.660
 - But it's hard, you can't find a clean one, Mr. Peat?

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.860
 - Yeah, everyone is tending,

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:36.620
 women get breast pain or uterine cramps from it,

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:40.860
 which means it's probably contaminated with estrogens.

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:43.260
 - George wants to know, what's Mr. Peat's opinion

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:48.260
 on hemp plant and the hemp oils, or the hemp protein?

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:50.380
 Are these worth looking at?

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:53.980
 - Protein is okay.

01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.900
 - The hemp protein?

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:59.900
 - Yeah, but you have the seed protein problem,

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:02.900
 it should be properly processed.

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:06.580
 Lime processing would make it more digestible.

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:10.580
 But the oils are highly unsaturated,

01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:13.620
 so I think it's good to be very cautious with them.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:15.340
 - They're poofers.

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:17.060
 Linda wants to know what the negative effects

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:19.860
 of flax seeds, are there negative effects in flax seeds?

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:26.540
 - The high polyunsaturated is the main problem.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:30.900
 There are some good components, but some bad.

01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:35.780
 Most people who use the flax seed as a laxative or bulk

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:40.180
 are absorbing very little of the substance.

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:44.780
 So if you're using it as a bulk fiber, it's okay,

01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:48.380
 you aren't absorbing much of the bad stuff.

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:52.180
 - They have some good, theoretically good organic psyllium

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:56.380
 husk kind of fiber things, are those reasonable things

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.340
 to take?

01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.180
 - Yeah, some people are--

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:01.580
 - Do okay with them?

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:04.060
 - Yeah, some people do very well, others get more

01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:07.300
 constipated with it, so you have to try out the fiber.

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:13.100
 Cooked bamboo shoots are good, safe fiber for most people.

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:17.100
 Well cooked mushrooms work for fiber for lots of people.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:18.380
 - Oh, good on you.

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:21.940
 - Raw carrots worked for me for about 20 years,

01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:26.260
 but then I developed bacteria that could eat the carrots,

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:27.100
 apparently.

01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:30.580
 - Dom wants to know, is there any way to regrow

01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:31.980
 tooth enamel?

01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:37.300
 - Only in the most superficial sense.

01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:40.580
 Before it has penetrated to the dentine,

01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:45.580
 the proteins of the enamel can capture calcium

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:50.500
 from the environment and reconstitute the seal.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:54.940
 But once it has entered the dentine,

01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:59.380
 then it should be treated with a filling of some sort.

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:01.940
 - Couple more, then we'll let you go, Mr. Peat,

01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.740
 you've been very generous with your time, thank you,

01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:05.180
 we really enjoy this.

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:08.420
 So would drizzling a bit of lemon juice on a salad

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.140
 help to break down the anti-digestive toxins

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.300
 in the raw greens?

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.140
 - No.

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.300
 - No?

01:39:15.300 --> 01:39:16.460
 Doesn't do it.

01:39:16.460 --> 01:39:17.540
 - Nope.

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.900
 - You know, it's interesting you mention about

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.020
 the raw vegetables, you know, in Ayurvedic medicine,

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:23.820
 I'm kind of a fan and studied it somewhat over the years,

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:27.300
 I'm no expert, but they're not very big on raw vegetables

01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:29.540
 at all, just nothing, nothing.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.220
 Cook 'em, cook 'em, they say.

01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:33.940
 You know, 5,000 year old methods,

01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.820
 so maybe on to something.

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:40.940
 Are scrambled eggs, cooked eggs, poached eggs,

01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:43.020
 any different?

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:49.500
 - Yeah, raw eggs are nutritionally very, very good,

01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:53.700
 they have an antiviral effect in the intestine,

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:59.940
 the fresh form, but cooked, they're extremely nutritious,

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:04.620
 except for the cumulative effect of the PUFA.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:07.060
 - Oh, you mean it just depends on their diet,

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.380
 and you gotta be, really be careful about that.

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.900
 Well, Mr. Peat, it's been so much fun having you on,

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:14.820
 thanks, we won't wait so long,

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:16.780
 would you come back again sometime?

01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:18.260
 - Oh sure, any time.

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:20.420
 - Oh, that'd be great, it'd be fun to have you on.

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.940
 Adam, do you have anything else you'd like to say,

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:25.220
 or ask Mr. Peat, or whatever?

01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:27.740
 - One more thing.

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:29.260
 - Go ahead, Ray.

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:30.100
 - Go ahead.

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.020
 - Go ahead, sorry.

01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:34.500
 - One more thing about, to validate the DHA thing,

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:38.180
 is that a salmon is lucky, it's high DHA,

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:41.740
 and it's lucky if it lasts to nine years.

01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:46.300
 An orange ruffe is the lowest fish of all in DHA,

01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:49.100
 and it lives to 149 years.

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:50.260
 - Really?

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:51.540
 The orange ruffe does?

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.540
 - I've heard 300 years.

01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:58.540
 - That's, oh come on, a fish can't live 100 years, can they?

01:40:58.540 --> 01:40:59.420
 - Oh sure.

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:00.300
 - Really?

01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:04.380
 - Yeah, some of, I'm sure some are older than that.

01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:05.300
 - Isn't that amazing?

01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:07.300
 So the salmon only live to, well salmon though,

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:10.140
 they swim upstream and get girls and stuff,

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.340
 I mean, no wonder they die early, you know?

01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:14.540
 (laughing)

01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:18.060
 - When they feed fish oil,

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:22.260
 they lose endurance and age quickly.

01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:24.380
 - Oh, Peat, yeah.

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:26.460
 And boy, when you talk about fish too, folks,

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:28.140
 be careful about all this, you know,

01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:31.620
 you go to some stores and they say responsibly farmed fish,

01:41:31.620 --> 01:41:35.060
 and you have no idea what that means, right?

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:37.380
 Have no idea what they're feeding them.

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:40.260
 I think Whole Foods has some pretty good standards,

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:41.220
 but be careful.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:42.420
 I would suspect, right Peat,

01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:47.180
 that the wild fish Atlantic would be a good choice.

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:53.340
 - The southern fish around the equator

01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:56.100
 have the least pufa.

01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.780
 - Oh, and which one, oh so they're back,

01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:59.940
 is that back to the cod and the sole?

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:04.380
 - They are still pretty high in pufa,

01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:09.100
 but you pretty much have to live in the region

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:10.820
 to get the warm water fish.

01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:12.060
 - Oh, I see, yeah.

01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:18.300
 Well, Mr. Peat, thank you so much, we appreciate it.

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:20.740
 Tell folks before you leave what they might find

01:42:20.740 --> 01:42:22.460
 if they visit waryPeate.com.

01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:27.700
 - Oh, there are about 100 articles there

01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.620
 on all the subjects we've talked about.

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:32.420
 - 100 articles, and do you have your own

01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:33.860
 private kind of newsletter?

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:37.260
 - Yeah, every two months now.

01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.900
 It's $28 for two years for 12 fish.

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:42.420
 - Oh, man, I'm gonna sign up for that guy.

01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:44.500
 28 bucks for two years, God love you.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:45.340
 That's great.

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.700
 And what part of the world do you live in?

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:49.420
 - Eugene right now, Oregon.

01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:52.740
 - Ah, man, yep, down the left coast.

01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:53.580
 - Yeah.

01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:56.620
 - Eugene, Oregon.

01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:59.220
 - Oh, and a listener wants to know how old you are,

01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.340
 if you don't mind.

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:01.260
 - 82.

01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:03.540
 - No, really?

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:04.580
 - Yep.

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:06.500
 - Well, you don't sound like a day over 50.

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:07.380
 That's great.

01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:10.260
 82, 82, and you're in good health?

01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:11.700
 You feel good?

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.700
 - Yeah, I haven't been to a doctor,

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:15.740
 so I don't really know 50 years.

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:17.060
 (laughing)

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.260
 50 years without seeing one.

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:23.260
 - Our friend Adam here, he's 75 around the sun, I'm 72,

01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:25.020
 and we're always kidding people, say,

01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:26.780
 "Okay, now, when you guys start to listen

01:43:26.780 --> 01:43:30.620
 to some of us folks over 70 revolutions about longevity,

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:32.860
 that's, you know, rather than the kids on YouTube

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:35.860
 who are 30 telling you how to live a long time, it's funny."

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.780
 (laughing)

01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:39.940
 They all mean well, though, they all mean well.

01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:42.260
 - I compete as an artist, too.

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:43.780
 - Oh, you are?

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:45.380
 What do you paint?

01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:49.020
 - Oh, there are some of my pictures from 20 years ago

01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.700
 up on my website.

01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.180
 - Ah, great.

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.140
 Well, we'll keep in touch.

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:54.740
 We'd love to have you back anytime,

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:57.340
 and thanks for being here this morning.

01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:58.180
 - Okay, thank you.

01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.020
 - Thank you, thank you, Ray Pike.

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:02.020
 Well, Mr. Adam, thank you for being here.

01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.780
 That was fun, huh?

01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.820
 - It was, thanks for inviting me.

01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:08.340
 - Oh, yeah, it was great, great having you guys on.

01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.900
 And I had no idea that he was

01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:13.420
 82 revolutions around the sun, man.

01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:15.300
 - Yeah, he's doing great, too.

01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:17.380
 I like that he doesn't know how healthy he is

01:44:17.380 --> 01:44:20.340
 because he hasn't been to a doctor to get it validated.

01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.180
 - That's right, that's right.

01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:23.740
 That's the way it goes, man.

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:24.900
 All right, brother, thanks a lot.

01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:26.660
 Appreciate your ongoing support.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:30.340
 Boy, we really lost a good one with Andrew, right?

01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:32.420
 Wasn't that pretty amazing?

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:34.580
 - We did, quite a shock, quite a shock.

01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:36.980
 But like Don O'Leary said,

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:40.020
 like it or not, we all survive our decent burial.

01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:42.820
 - We all survive our decent burial, we sure do.

01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:43.860
 Okay, Adam, we love you.

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:45.260
 Say hi to Vibrant Gal.

01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:46.900
 We'll probably be connecting with you

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:49.140
 during open phones tomorrow.

01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:50.020
 - Love, you bet.

01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:51.180
 - Okay, bye-bye.

01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.180
 Patrick Timponi, Andrew, oh, no.

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:55.180
 I'm just thinking about Andrew.

01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.780
 Ray Peat and Adam Bergstrom will have this show up

01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:03.780
 on the website very soon, oh, a couple hours.

01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:06.220
 And this would be a good one to pass on

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:07.900
 to everyone that you care about,

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.100
 especially folks with a thyroid.

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:11.900
 And I think most of us have it.

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:14.100
 Just a few of us got your thyroid nuked,

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.500
 but even then, he has some ideas for you.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.620
 So I love you all very much.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.980
 Again, thank you for your outpouring of love and support

01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:25.380
 with Andrew Goss going on his cosmic vacation suddenly.

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:26.780
 It's been just amazing.

01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:30.060
 My inbox just doesn't stop, and Facebook.

01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:32.540
 And wow, it's just, I know the family

01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.240
 really, really appreciates it.

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.380
 They heard the little show we did yesterday.

01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:39.100
 They were listening, and they really appreciate

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:42.300
 all the love and support you had for Andrew.

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:45.780
 And again, I'm just, I was just so fascinated.

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:48.740
 I know he had a big impact and had a big audience,

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.940
 but to the extent that people really cared about him

01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:54.180
 and loved him and felt like they knew him was just,

01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:55.940
 you know, I should have realized that,

01:45:55.940 --> 01:45:57.380
 but boy, I sure do now.

01:45:57.380 --> 01:45:59.140
 Anyway, so I love you all very much.

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:01.980
 Thanks for your ongoing support of our website.

01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:06.980
 Don't forget there's over 1,200 hours of just Andrew Goss.

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:11.700
 1,200 one-hour shows of Andrew Goss,

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:14.340
 and that'll be available to you at no cost.

01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.500
 And you can have your education, your PhD,

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:22.500
 and financial history,

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:26.220
 and the way the money deal works.

01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:29.860
 And thanks for your support to all the products we promote.

01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:32.140
 That's how we pay the bills on our house payment.

01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:34.980
 We appreciate that you support the people

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:37.700
 that we really like, and we know so many of these people,

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.140
 and we really do know this source.

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.140
 So thanks for buying stuff through our website.

01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:43.220
 I love you all very much,

01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.180
 and I'll see you tomorrow, open phones.
