00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
 all of your different websites you mentioned on the show page.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.860
 So if folks want to try some of the products,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.560
 they can just click on there and they'll just go right there.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.240
 You take care of yourself and say hi to your wife

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.200
 and thank her for taking good care of you.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.040
 - I will, thank you.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.360
 - All right, see you soon.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.200
 - Thank you.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.080
 - Bye.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.320
 Dr. William Wong, who's a big fan of Ray Peat's

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.520
 and Ray Peat heard that.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.720
 - We are listener supported, One Radio Network.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.300
 (upbeat music)

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:50.320
 - Well, here we go.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.920
 Here it would be the third Tuesday

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.280
 and that would bring us to a time

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.840
 when we're grateful to have a lovely

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.840
 and talented Dr. Ray Peat on the air on the third Tuesday.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.360
 And as long as the creaks don't rise, he said, we'll do it.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 He's a PhD, University of Oregon,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.920
 specialization in physiology.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 Started working with hormones back in '68.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.120
 Whoa, that's when I started radio in '68

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.160
 in Armed Forces Radio.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.080
 He was starting his work on hormones.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.520
 Wrote his dissertation in '72.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.560
 He's got a great newsletter

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.200
 that comes out a couple of times a month

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.840
 that you have a little link there on the show pages.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.720
 You can get Dr. Peat's newsletter

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.120
 and it's great to talk to him from time to time.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.880
 If you have an email for him,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.120
 question patrick@oneradionetwork.com

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.200
 and out to the left coast, Dr. Peat, good morning.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.360
 - Good morning.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.480
 - How are you doing there?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.040
 - Very good, it has started raining.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.520
 Winter weather setting in already.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.120
 - You're in Oregon, right?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.960
 - Yeah.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.360
 - You get a lot of rain there?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.080
 - Yeah, the weather has been pretty variable,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 but we're back to the old continuous rain it looks like.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.800
 The ocean is warming up

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.760
 and when that happens we get extra rain.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.400
 Humid air condenses.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.320
 - I saw the, oh go ahead, go ahead.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.320
 - The nighttime rain is the traditional Northwest weather,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.360
 but we have been changing over the last 30 or 40 years

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.880
 until it looked more like a Midwest climate.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.480
 Summer rain and drier winters,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.880
 but I think we're back to the old rain in the winter,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.920
 night and winter.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.600
 - I saw with the farmers of Albinac,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.480
 they use sunspots and they're predicting

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.400
 a cold and woolly winter this year

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.240
 for a lot of the country.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.600
 We'll see how accurate that is.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.520
 - Yeah, I think the sun and the submarine volcanoes

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.880
 are really the important thing changing the weather

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.680
 over the long term rather than carbon dioxide.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.720
 - Yeah, submarine volcanoes?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.720
 - Yeah, the Pacific is really pretty full of volcanoes

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.560
 that actually are warming the ocean

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.280
 and they have cycles like sunspot cycles.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.040
 - Oh, so they put a lot of heat down there

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.680
 and they're going on and we don't really know.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.440
 They're spitting up.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.800
 - Yeah, and they're teeming with life,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.040
 primitive life forms that can live

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.880
 at extremely high temperatures.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.160
 - And so the ocean's warm and that causes

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.240
 all kinds of things to happen in the jet stream

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.720
 and weather changes more dramatically.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.480
 - Yeah, it changes the ocean currents.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.240
 - It's hard to imagine that carbon dioxide

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.480
 is like the devil.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.760
 Don't we want to keep more carbon dioxide in us

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.360
 by not breathing so fast?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 - Yeah, one of the anti-climate change people,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:43.080
 gets up on a box and lectures in London.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.080
 He has a little sign that says,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.480
 "Carbon dioxide is the gas of life."

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.480
 - Many people believe that.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.080
 Gosh, how could you make it so, I don't know,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.160
 so political stuff, who knows, right?

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.200
 What's going on with all that?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.840
 Well, Dr. Ray Peat is probably one of the few

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.680
 well-known people, well-credentialed people

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.880
 that got milk, you know, he's got that little

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.480
 white mustache thing and you've been drinking milk

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.840
 for a long time now and you do good with it.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.000
 - Yeah, there were times, like when I was living

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.800
 in Mexico City, when it was hard to get good milk,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.400
 the rich people would send their maids out at dawn

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.680
 to buy up all of the good milk and so for three

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.880
 or four years, I went very light on milk

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.080
 but the rest of my life, I've been a big milk drinker,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.840
 gallon a day.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.840
 - You're still doing that much, a gallon a day?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.040
 - No, about two and a half quarts, I think,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.200
 averaging now.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.960
 - Wow, we had an Ayurvedic doctor on a couple weeks ago

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.640
 and she's a, Ayurveda, as you know, you probably do know,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.760
 they've been a great proponent of drinking milk

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.960
 for a long time, thousands of years, right?

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.240
 - Yeah.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.800
 - I wanna read you something out of her book,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.280
 I think you'll find it fun.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.280
 Her name is Marianne Tittlebaum, she's a DC

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.360
 but we found her very, very, just, I don't know,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.520
 very credible.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.760
 She says, "Dairy is perhaps the most misunderstood

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.560
 "of all food groups.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.760
 "The ancient doctors said that every food you eat

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.760
 "spends three to five days in each tissue

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.280
 "before progressing to the next.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.860
 "There are, as discussed earlier, seven tissues,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.800
 "blood plasma, blood muscle fat bone, bone marrow,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.320
 "and reproductive fluids.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.480
 "This means that the food you eat today

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.140
 "can sometimes won't nourish everything,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.080
 "all seven tissues, for about a month or so.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.360
 "The only exception to the rule is milk.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.500
 "It nourishes all seven tissues in one day.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.600
 "This milk is seen as one of the most nourishing foods

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.720
 "of all life.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.740
 "This is why babies can live exclusively off milk

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.500
 "for the first year of their life."

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.800
 Do you think that's accurate with going through

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.820
 all the tissues like that in one day?

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.200
 - I think some of that is historical metaphor,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.040
 but there is some basis to it,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.240
 undoubtedly because it's now known that every tissue

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.780
 has its rate of protein turnover,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.780
 and as your nutrients change, the food you eat guides

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.620
 the turnover of the proteins so that you get proteins

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.260
 suitable for the type of food you're eating.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.100
 And every tissue, like bone, is extremely slow

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.100
 to turn over most of its substance.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.700
 Your liver is very fast, the skin and intestine

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.260
 are extremely fast, just a few days

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.380
 and they're completely remade.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.660
 And the heart has a slower rate of protein turnover,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.900
 but everything, the mitochondria,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.060
 the energy-producing apparatuses is turning over

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.380
 constantly at its own rate.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.380
 And I think in general, the faster a tissue turns over,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.460
 because it's kept warm and well-nourished and unstressed,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.380
 high stress will make you turn over your thymus gland

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.380
 and muscles and skin very fast, but in a destructive way.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.700
 A good, warm, well-fed condition,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.220
 you do have constant turnover and renewal of your tissues.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.760
 It's like a streaming, new cells are being born

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.460
 as the old ones are being eaten up,

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.460
 and so you clean out the debris at a regular pace

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.540
 according to the tissue.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.300
 - Interesting.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.860
 And I agree with you, I think that it's been my experience.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.460
 In the old Ayurvedic texts,

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.860
 which obviously is where this came from,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.620
 they began, at some point, they often got off

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.020
 often very poetic, right?

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.060
 And very beautiful words, and they sometimes

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.760
 would expound a bit or maybe say,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.580
 exaggerate a bit on the benefits of stuff.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.900
 You know what I'm saying?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.660
 Yeah, the historic, I think you nailed that.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.980
 Not to say it's not true, but they were very poetic

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.620
 and philosophical and spiritual

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.060
 about the approaching of different things.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.800
 And I know one thing that I read years ago,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.620
 they're big fans of ghee rather than butter,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.900
 and I read one book where this fellow said,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.820
 this sage, "Well, if you have 100-year-old ghee,

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.700
 "it'll cure anything," you know, that kind of thing.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.780
 They would make these kinds of statements.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.900
 So I think your point is well taken about the historical.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.140
 But fascinating.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.140
 Now, she's a big fan, and Ayurveda's always been a big fan

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.260
 of, not a big fan, but actually saying this is the best way,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.260
 is to boil the milk, boil the milk for several reasons.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.620
 I think it helps with the fat absorption

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.620
 and also if you have raw milk,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.500
 maybe gets rid of any little buggies.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.460
 And they put cardamom and cinnamon in there

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:31.220
 to help do some things that I'll find it in here.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.060
 What about you?

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.180
 Do you think, have you found any benefit

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.940
 in the boiling milk?

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.100
 Have you ever done that?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.740
 - Oh, sure, living outside of Mexico City

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.880
 where they have cows or goats,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.820
 that's the custom of everyone that puts a big pot

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.100
 of milk on in the morning and brings it to a boil.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:11:00.100
 And that, usually they skim off the fat that rises

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.780
 and make special dishes out of that

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.340
 or else feed it to the cats and chickens.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.420
 - I wonder why you would do that.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.420
 Wouldn't that fat be good?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.260
 - Yeah, if a person likes it,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.940
 they have dishes and puddings and things

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.780
 that they make out of it.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.100
 They use it as a sauce on tacos and such.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.860
 - Now, would there be any benefit to our listeners

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.700
 who can't have access to raw cows or goats' milk

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.780
 to boil like an organic grass-fed milk

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.140
 that could get at the Whole Foods or something?

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.740
 - Yeah, surprisingly, the damage,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.380
 nutritionally, is very small.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.580
 It oxidizes some of the vitamin A

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.300
 and a tiny bit of the vitamin C,

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.260
 but milk is still basically the best source

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.180
 of all of the nutrients when you compare it

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.180
 to the number of calories and protein in it.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.180
 It has all of the nutrients except iron.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.860
 - How about the cardamom and cinnamon thing?

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.940
 Any thoughts on that?

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.940
 - Oh, each has its medical uses.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.100
 I haven't been a big fan of them.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:20.340
 Mexicans put cinnamon on their chocolate drink generally.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.140
 What about this A1 and A2 milk?

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.700
 That's been going around for years,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.020
 and theoretically, the A2 milk, I guess,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.140
 is supposed to be the most easily digestible.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.060
 What is that from the, maybe the Jersey's?

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.900
 Or the Holstein's?

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.940
 No, A1 is found in the Holstein's,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.940
 and then A2 is more in the Jersey's or the Guernsey's.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.140
 - When I was little, we had a Holstein,

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.380
 and then when I was about eight or nine,

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.140
 we got a Jersey, which we had for 10 or 15 years.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.740
 I don't really see any difference,

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.740
 and I think a lot of it is just marketing

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.500
 to sell something for a higher price

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.780
 if you have the right kind of cow.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.940
 - And Ayurveda says that the goat's milk is good,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.020
 it's an excellent source,

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:22.020
 but it's just a little bit higher choice for cow's milk.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.020
 That's interesting.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.100
 Do you agree with that?

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.500
 Or do you know?

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.420
 Do you have a theory, opinion?

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.820
 - My own preference is for cow's milk

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.020
 just because I'm more familiar with that

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.820
 when I was in the first or second grade,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.060
 we had a Holstein and the neighbors had goats,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.100
 and their goat milk was very strong smelling,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.620
 and so I learned to prefer cow's milk.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.940
 But if you handle the goats right,

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.660
 the goat milk will taste as good as cow's milk.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:02.180
 - So you say you're drinking still a couple quarts a day.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.700
 That must be, you find that's a lot of food for you,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.620
 and that provides a lot of your nutrition?

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.500
 - Yeah, milk has always, the last 40 years,

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.140
 has been the bulk of my daily food.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.780
 When I would drink a gallon a day,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.300
 I would maybe have a couple of quarts of orange juice

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.300
 and some cheese or sardines or something

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.300
 for a supper snack and eggs for breakfast.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.900
 - And that keeps you going,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.180
 that would keep you going without losing,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.180
 keep your muscles going.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.020
 - Oh sure, yeah.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.700
 - How about you now, let's see,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.460
 if I recall your revolutions around the sun,

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.980
 which is all called age, you are 80, 83?

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.180
 - Yeah, well, in October '83.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.700
 - '83 in October, yeah, I'm gonna be 73 revolutions

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.340
 in November, we're about 10 years apart.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.100
 What has been your experience, I know you paint,

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.580
 do you have to do other things,

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.340
 have you found to keep your muscles from,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.820
 what's that word they use for it,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.540
 they always have a word, doc,

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.380
 - Atrophy.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.380
 - Sarcopenia.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.660
 - Sarcopenia, yeah.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.740
 Do you have any thoughts on that?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.580
 - Yeah, I noticed after about 10 years

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.180
 of just sitting around studying my shoulders,

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.620
 got less rounded muscles,

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:44.140
 I could see in photographs that my shoulder muscles

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.540
 were smaller because I wasn't working regularly,

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.540
 but just moving around, my leg muscles have stayed huge

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.420
 after not going skiing, for example, for 10 years,

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:07.100
 someone told me that my leg muscles must be getting weak

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.540
 from just sitting around reading all the time,

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.540
 but I tested myself doing one-legged sit-ups

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:21.060
 and every 10 years I would do 10 one-legged sit-ups

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.940
 and didn't notice a significant dropping off with time.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.060
 I haven't done it for 15 years though,

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.660
 I don't know whether I could still do 10.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.140
 - Do you do any other kind of exercise regularly?

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.700
 - No, just every 10 years I would test myself.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.420
 (laughing)

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.300
 - How often do you exercise?

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.740
 Oh, every 10 years, I knew.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:51.420
 That's great, that's great.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.260
 So you like orange juice, huh?

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.780
 You still like orange juice?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.900
 - Oh yeah, when good stuff is available,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.100
 it should be thoroughly ripened.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:06.260
 The commercial stuff, they're used to selling

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.380
 unripe oranges and so if they accidentally get ripe oranges

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.660
 they add acetic acid to it.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.820
 A lot of the, for example, the concentrated

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.820
 or canned varieties very often have acid added

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.540
 but the acid etches the enamel off your teeth

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.980
 so ripe oranges are safer in every way.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.980
 - So you would want to rinse out your mouth

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.620
 with clear water after orange juice?

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.740
 - Yeah, clear water, maybe even baking soda

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.660
 if it's very acidic.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.580
 - What do you think about taking baking soda

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.020
 regularly, some people advocate that,

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.780
 a quarter teaspoon or stuff.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.940
 Do you think there's any value to that?

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.980
 - Yeah, I know people who do as much as a teaspoon

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.100
 two or three times a day and think it improves

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:04.780
 their endurance and strength.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.460
 But even if a fourth of a teaspoon,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:14.460
 two or three times a day, people say that it helps

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.900
 reduce inflammation and I know people who used to get

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.700
 swollen legs when taking a long airplane trip

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:30.060
 when they took a teaspoon of baking soda in water

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.340
 before getting on the plane, they stopped having

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.100
 the swollen feet.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.140
 - Well what's going on there, do you, can you

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.220
 surmise what you think metabolically is happening

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.700
 with the baking soda, sodium bicarbonate?

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.700
 - Yeah, the sodium lowers your aldosterone very quickly

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:54.980
 and aldosterone is a general stress hormone

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.340
 that tends to go up with cortisol which damages tissues

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.340
 but aldosterone causes a shift towards inflammation

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.380
 and fibrosis so the chronic elevation of aldosterone

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.260
 leads to heart disease and circulatory disease

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.300
 and kidney disease so chronic intake of a little

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.300
 extra sodium such as you get with that small doses

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:30.340
 of baking soda, that has a chronic anti-stress effect

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:35.380
 keeping your aldosterone lower and that lets you

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.780
 lose the sodium fairly quickly and the bicarbonate

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:47.940
 part is quickly changed, there's an enzyme

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.780
 carbonic anhydrase that changes carbon dioxide

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:56.100
 to bicarbonate and bicarbonate back into carbon dioxide

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.900
 and at the surface of your cell when you're losing

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:05.700
 the sodium through your kidneys, your cells change

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.700
 bicarbonate into carbon dioxide which is more soluble

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.140
 in the living cell so it goes out of your blood

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.140
 more or less at the same rate that the sodium

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.420
 is leaving your blood, bicarbonate into your cells,

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.660
 sodium out of your body so what it amounts to

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.660
 is the same as breathing a little extra carbon dioxide

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.840
 and therefore failing to hyperventilate and low thyroid

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.740
 people hyperventilate and blow away the carbon dioxide

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.540
 they should be keeping in their cells and so the supplement

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.540
 of baking soda is imitating to a degree the normal

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:59.700
 thyroid function, keeping your cells more charged

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.340
 with carbon dioxide which is a stabilizing thing

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.400
 that has tremendous ramifications everywhere.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:15.100
 When you are at a high altitude there's less oxygen

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:21.140
 and the oxygen normally is in your lungs,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:26.900
 it exchanges with carbon dioxide and so at sea level

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.860
 high oxygen pressure pushes more carbon dioxide

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.740
 out of your blood, at a high altitude the lower

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.740
 oxygen tension allows you to retain more carbon dioxide

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:45.840
 and people have less dementia, heart disease and cancer

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.860
 at very high altitudes and live longer and that's

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:55.860
 very likely mostly the effect of retaining the proper

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.100
 amount of carbon dioxide and so if you at moderate

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.500
 altitude if you're breathing more carbon dioxide

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.500
 like adding a supplement it can be with baking soda

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:17.180
 that extra carbon dioxide is to some degree imitating

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.860
 a high altitude or a better thyroid functioning.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.360
 - Fascinating, so the low thyroid folks,

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.380
 do they tend to breathe more, have more breaths

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.020
 per minute and then have less carbon dioxide

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.340
 which we know is good, is that right?

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:41.340
 - Well relative to how much oxygen they need

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:46.060
 because the oxygen requirement is very low

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.460
 in a low thyroid person so they don't need to move

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.640
 very much air.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.480
 Like a quart of oxygen will last a low thyroid person

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:06.960
 maybe minutes where a high thyroid person

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.600
 would be gone in seconds.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.640
 I've seen it in labs where we were practicing

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.240
 doing the basal metabolic rate test by rate

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.240
 of consuming oxygen and for example the typical

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:35.280
 old fashioned machine contains two liters of oxygen

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.520
 and I didn't know that I was hyperthyroid.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.480
 I didn't have any signs of hyperthyroidism

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.480
 but in the standard test I emptied the machine

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.200
 in half the allotted time so it was the tracing

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.960
 on the graph paper was almost a vertical line

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.880
 where it was supposed to be about a 45 degree angle

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.880
 to the right and according to the standards

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.840
 I was about four times the normal oxygen consuming rate

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.920
 of which a doctor would say oh that's dangerous

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.840
 hyperthyroidism but I was fine, no health problems at all.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:32.120
 - Very interesting.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:37.120
 Do you put much stock in taking the temperature

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.240
 to gauge thyroid function?

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.080
 - Yeah, when you're producing energy at a high rate

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.880
 say 150% of the average, you're maintaining

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:03.040
 your blood sugar level because you're using

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.760
 the sugar efficiently, not wasting any.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.600
 The hypothyroid person wastes sugar at a terrible rate

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.080
 because they aren't using oxygen properly.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.480
 So if you're using sugar efficiently

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.800
 that means you don't experience hypoglycemia

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.080
 and so you don't produce very much adrenaline

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.080
 to regulate your blood sugar and so your adrenaline level

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:37.640
 is low, your stress level is low and everything

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.760
 metabolically is running efficiently.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.680
 You're turning over your proteins but in a renewal way

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.040
 rather than a stress produced way.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:56.960
 - Here's an email from Beth about thyroid

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.800
 so I thought I'd throw it right in there.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.420
 Dr. Rapi, do you think fluoride and chloride

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.480
 in a tap water and bromide in breads

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.100
 are having a major effect on our thyroids?

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.000
 - Yeah, I didn't know they were still putting bromide

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.840
 in bread.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.600
 - I don't think they are generally

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.720
 but maybe this lady knows.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.320
 - Yeah, it isn't good if it's there.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.360
 It should be avoided and fluoride I think,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:31.240
 I was for a while using a supplement of T3,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.160
 thyroid reactive thyroid hormone

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.520
 and when I would go to San Francisco

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.840
 or an area where they have fluoridated water,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.040
 I would get a migraine headache.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.040
 And I looked up the amount of fluoride ions in water

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:58.000
 and the amount of T3, the number of potential sites

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.600
 for the fluoride to stick to.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.600
 And a glass of fluoridated water is enough

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:17.240
 to knock out a day's portion of the active thyroid hormone.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.520
 And since I was using that active thyroid hormone,

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.200
 it was very quick and very noticeable

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.400
 that if I drank fluoridated water, for example,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.720
 in my coffee or orange juice,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.640
 I would get a migraine from extreme hypothyroidism.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.000
 - Cynthia writes in, I take 60 milligrams,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.040
 one grain of natural thyroid every day.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.520
 It seems my TSH levels are normal, one or two.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.920
 My doctor likes that.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.200
 Does Dr. Pete think that if I just keep doing this,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.760
 that my thyroid will never be able to make this

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.440
 what it needs to on its own?

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.000
 - I've seen several people who were hypothyroid

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.880
 who when they took the amount

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.880
 that brought their oxygen consumption up to the right level

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.640
 had recovery of their own thyroid function

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.840
 and could stop taking it.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.440
 It doesn't happen very often,

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.520
 but I've seen several people who cured their low thyroid

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.880
 by supplementing thyroid.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.840
 - So explain what you mean, taking the oxygen level.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.800
 How do we know?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.960
 How would you know?

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.280
 - Well, if you're sick with low thyroid,

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.960
 you have a variety of symptoms.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.960
 And these individuals responded

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.400
 to supplementing their thyroid

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.160
 the way any hypothyroid person does.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.160
 But in a few cases, they were able to maintain

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.400
 their metabolic rate and stop taking the thyroid

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.920
 because the thyroid had restored,

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.920
 the supplement had restored their anti-stress metabolism,

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.580
 lowered the adrenaline and cortisol,

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.580
 and allowed the tissue to start metabolizing by itself.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.880
 And producing its own thyroid.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.440
 But usually a person's body is loaded up

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.440
 with anti-thyroid substances, polyunsaturated fats

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.640
 built right into the structure of the cell.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.960
 Not only in the fat tissue,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.960
 but in their muscles and brain and so on.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.600
 Especially after the age of 20,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.320
 the tissues start building polyunsaturated fats

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.800
 right into the structure.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.240
 And when you're under stress,

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.440
 you release some of those polyunsaturated fats

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.080
 into your bloodstream,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.480
 where they interfere with thyroid function.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.640
 So the average person in their 20s or 30s or older

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:19.760
 needs to, if they're hypothyroid,

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.920
 they benefit from taking a supplement for

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.920
 at least a few years until they can change

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.680
 the composition of their body.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:34.760
 - Are they better off to take the lowest possible amount

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.640
 when they're doing that?

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:40.480
 I mean, just to make it work,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.280
 to help it make it work on its own?

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.960
 - Yeah.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.000
 If you happen to take too much,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.840
 you will get breathless, consume too much oxygen.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.400
 I've done it many times.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.920
 And just standing up to answer the telephone,

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.320
 I would start panting and had to cut back on my thyroid.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.480
 But I've seen people, well, on myself, for example,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:11.240
 when I was judging just by how I felt,

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.840
 I would supplement the thyroid.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:18.400
 And one morning I noticed I had dents in my throat

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.400
 beside my Adam's apple where the thyroid gland had been,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.080
 had been about the size of my finger,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.000
 pressed into my throat.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.400
 And I realized I'd shrunk my thyroid gland.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:38.920
 So I stopped taking the quick-acting T3.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.280
 The next morning, my neck was smooth.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.480
 And I've seen several people who were taking too much

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.280
 thyroid and have shrunk their gland.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:54.280
 And in just one or two days, it comes back massively.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.480
 - If one is taking some thyroid meds, as we call them,

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.880
 what's the role of taking supplemental iodine

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.960
 if you're not taking a thyroid or if you are?

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.800
 - Foods such as milk and eggs always contain thyroid

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:19.600
 even though seafood is the known reliable source

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.200
 of trace minerals, selenium and iodine particularly.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.200
 But since thyroid is a fertility hormone,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.800
 animals can't produce eggs and milk

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.760
 if they're very hypothyroid.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.520
 So you're assured that milk and eggs

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.560
 will always contain some iodine

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.560
 and some equivalent thyroid-supporting substance.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:53.600
 So there was a study back when iodine

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.760
 was sometimes used as a dough conditioner

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.040
 instead of bromine.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.320
 And at that time, the average American diet

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.320
 contained several times the ideal amount of iodine.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:15.640
 And it has been about 60 or 70 years

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.600
 since there were hypothyroid, low iodine areas

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.920
 in the United States, like the Great Lakes region

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.520
 was a famous greater belt.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:31.520
 But since food technology has started using so much iodine,

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:38.320
 there hasn't been any iodine deficiency zone in the US.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.760
 And what happens if you take even twice,

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:50.360
 two or three or four times the amount needed by the body?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:55.400
 You start interfering with the function of the gland.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.760
 And often people supplement more than a milligram

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.360
 up to as much as 10 milligrams a day,

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.320
 and that seriously damages the thyroid.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.040
 Every couple of months, I hear from someone

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.080
 who has damaged their thyroid

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.840
 by taking several milligrams a day of iodine.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.160
 - Is that a lot of milligrams?

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.600
 - Yeah, the required amount is about a tenth

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.160
 to a fifth of a milligram per day.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.800
 And taking a half a milligram per day,

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.680
 chronically looking at a big population,

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.680
 that's enough to increase the incidence of thyroiditis

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.760
 and eventually thyroid cancer.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.440
 - So it sounds like what I'm hearing you saying

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.640
 is with some good foods, milk or eggs,

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.560
 and then we're gonna get plow or fish,

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.080
 we're gonna get enough?

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:50.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:56.920
 And it's seriously dangerous in the long run

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.000
 to supplement too much iodine.

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.200
 I do really well, and others have too.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:07.440
 They've mentioned with this, you know, the salmon,

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.320
 you can get, you know, the little thin slices.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.160
 What do you call that?

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.760
 I guess smoked salmon and things like.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.680
 You think that's a generally good food?

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:20.920
 - Yeah, it's nutritious, but you can overload

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.120
 on polyunsaturated fat if you eat salmon all the time.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.240
 - Oh, there's poofas in salmon?

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.360
 - Oh yeah, a lot of poofa.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.480
 - Really, what are they doing there?

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.040
 I thought that's a fish.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:37.880
 - Yeah, the cold water fish eat algae,

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.960
 and the algae is the source of--

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.200
 - Of the poofas.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.040
 - Poofa.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.120
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.440
 So you tend to, you like to gravitate more

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.240
 towards the warm water fish.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.520
 - Yeah, as far as it's available,

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.520
 but a small amount.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.560
 There are some low-fat fish

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.680
 that come from pretty cold waters.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.320
 Cod and sole are the lowest-fat fish that I know of,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:11.080
 and I think they're safer than salmon

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.280
 if you're gonna eat fish every week.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.120
 - Oh, really?

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.960
 Okay, can you stay right there?

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.120
 We're gonna take a little break here.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.120
 Patrick Timpone on Radionetwork.com.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.960
 - One of the most powerful antioxidants ever

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.000
 is actually Brown's gas.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.720
 Well, hydrogen, and the machine that we have,

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.800
 the AquaCare machine, makes Brown's gas,

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.840
 which is, it's kind of different

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.920
 than actual molecular hydrogen, Brown's gas,

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.080
 and that's what George's machine makes,

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.880
 the one that we promote.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.040
 It's very quiet, and you can bubble in the water

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.080
 and then breathe it, and they have a whole little setup

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:56.600
 there which is digital, and depending on your body weight,

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.320
 you know exactly how much to put in there.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.920
 You just dial that in, and when you do just the water,

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.640
 you can just dial in 100% of the Brown's gas

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.040
 going into the water, drink the water,

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.000
 and then if you're gonna drink it

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 and make water at the same time, it's fine

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.760
 because you'll still make plenty of hydrogen in the water.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:20.520
 It's just a fascinating, most abundant just gas

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.880
 or thing in the universe, hydrogen.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.880
 It's just like, I think, 96% of everything

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.360
 that's out there, and so we have a great little machine

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.480
 that we promote, and if you use promo code 1RADIO,

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.240
 you get a 10%, and look upon it as an investment

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.080
 in your health.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.640
 They're a couple thousand bucks,

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.920
 but this thing has got a lifetime warranty,

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.340
 lifetime warranty, and also a one-year,

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.260
 no questions asked money back if you don't like it.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.940
 Now that's pretty cool.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:57.940
 Lots of safety features that most of the hydrogen

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.700
 Brown's gas machines do not have,

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.440
 and that's important 'cause hydrogen, molecular hydrogen,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.620
 and making Brown's gas, it's a very energetic substance.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.620
 Let me put it like that.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.160
 I mean, you can do hydrogen cars and hydrogen whatever.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.700
 It's volatile, so you gotta be careful with it,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.460
 but your body likes it.

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.700
 It's one of the biggest antioxidants and anti-inflammatory.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.100
 Good things are going in my body with lower inflammation.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.060
 I can feel it.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.820
 I can just feel it.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.640
 I don't know why.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.740
 I just feel more comfortable in my body

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.940
 after breathing this gas.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.780
 Just, it's a nice thing, and here's more on it

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.180
 from George who makes the machine.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.940
 This was previously with George Wiseman

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.000
 about his AquaCure machine making hydrogen, gas,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.660
 and water out of the same hose.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.500
 Listen.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.500
 Your body accepts that gas and uses it to heal everything.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.980
 It's like the fountain of youth.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.060
 It's astonishing the amount of ailments.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.580
 In fact, in scientific studies,

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.220
 and they have over 1,000 scientific studies now,

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.820
 they are showing that it either helps the body heal

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.780
 directly or indirectly from virtually every ailment

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.300
 that ails any water-based life form,

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.300
 but it works just as well on animals and plants

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.500
 and lizards and birds and everybody.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.620
 - And you're saying this because this machine

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.540
 called the AquaCure split into five different parts.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.460
 - Six.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.500
 - I got hydrogen, oxygen, electro, enhanced water,

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.340
 water vapors, monatomic hydrogen, what else?

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.580
 - And monatomic oxygen.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.340
 - Oh, the monooxygen.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.580
 And that's what your machine does?

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.020
 It splits it?

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.340
 - Yes, it makes that mixture inside the machine,

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.820
 and all that comes out a single hose, the same hose.

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:41.000
 - Gas?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.780
 - As a gas, in gaseous form, yes.

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.940
 - And you breathe it or you put it in water?

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.340
 - So if you bubble the browns gas into this water,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.140
 into, let's say, distilled water,

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.380
 it will go to a negative ORP,

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:56.100
 and when you drink that, it actually gives your body

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.020
 an electrical energy, these electrons.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.540
 Instead of sucking energy from you, it gives it.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.140
 So you can have water that is healthful and not healthful

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.120
 just by the energy that's in the water.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.960
 - You wanna get one?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.780
 Me too.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.320
 Ours is on the way.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.160
 Check this out.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.460
 Lifetime warranty on the machine itself,

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.420
 and then a one-year, no questions asked,

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.540
 money-back guarantee if you like the machine,

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:19.700
 within a year.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.300
 I mean, have you ever heard of a warranty like that?

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.440

 It's in our store on oneradionetwork.com.

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.580
 And keep in mind the idea of dehydration,

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.860
 surely the lack of hydrogen.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.520
 Dehydration really helps your body

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.420
 to become hydrated.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.220
 Really nice machines.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.620
 Wayne Blakely is with us,

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.700
 and he makes the Living Streams products.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.300
 There's two different bifidos.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.140
 Let's talk about the straight product that is bifido,

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.780
 and then there's bifido 2.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.420
 What is the bifido used for?

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.120
 - The bifido is used as a probiotic nutrient

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.180
 which has curcumin in it and turmeric in it,

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.860
 which has certain minerals and nutrients in it

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:08.860
 that helps the body, especially absorption of your food.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.740
 Curcumin is the most researched supplement in the world.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.780
 The researchers don't really understand

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.860
 how curcumin works in the body.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:20.580
 And curcumin is very hard to digest in the digestive tract.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.200
 So we pre-digest the curcumin,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.500
 which has, we buy our curcumin from India

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.240
 because it has a mineral in it called yttrium.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.300
 And we use the bacteria to break down the yttrium,

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.180
 the correct bacteria to break down the yttrium

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.100
 so our body can assimilate it,

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.020
 so we can absorb our food correctly

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.980
 and it stops plaque in the body.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.260
 - Pretty cool stuff, isn't it?

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:43.340
 Weighs on it.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.100
 And the lack of bacteria in the soil in this country

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.420
 is the whole issue, why yttrium is in short supply.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.500
 Very unique products, Living Streams.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.300
 He's talking about the bifido,

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:00.780
 and it's in our store on oneradionetwork.com.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.940
 The Ayurveda lady

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.340
 that was on the show,

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.340
 we're gonna have her back on, Dr. Tittlebaum.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:14.660
 She was really, really big on moringa too,

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.420
 as an incredible tree nutrient, herb,

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.980
 whatever you wanna call it.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.700
 And if you wanna get a real natural whey,

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.420
 full-fledged whey, whey has a moringa product

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.840
 that's in a probiotic.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.140
 Very easy to absorb, and you get a big bottle of it,

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.980
 and you can just, you can drink a lot of it.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:37.060
 And moringa's pretty amazing, what's going on with moringa.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:40.300
 So, fun things are all in our store.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:49.980
 Excuse me, all in our store on One Radio Network.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.460
 Had a cough there.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:55.340
 If you would like to get more information,

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.500
 you can talk to Wayne's protege or helper,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:03.500
 Marilyn, 360-912-2981.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.820
 360-912-2981.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.420
 She can give you more insights on this or that,

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.100
 or what is good for,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.140
 we have some things for perimenopause.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.900
 Wayne's very careful, he doesn't say a lot of stuff,

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:22.140
 because, oh, you know the FDNA, they get all carried away,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.060
 can't make any claims, and I understand.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.620
 But Marilyn can give you some information.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.620
 She doesn't do medical advice, neither do I,

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.580
 or nobody on our guest list ever do medical advice.

00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.620
 It's all up to you.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.660
 But anyway, these probiotics work like

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:37.380
 probiotics are supposed to.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.060
 LivingStreams, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.300
 - We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.380
 on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.140
 - Well, it's an honor to have Dr. Ray Peet on our show,

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.700
 and he's consented to come on on the third Tuesday,

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.860
 and we're here.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.780
 So, Dr. Peet, thanks so much for coming on

00:43:58.780 --> 00:43:59.700
 from time to time.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.340
 People like you.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.060
 People like you.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.980
 You're a rock star around here.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:07.980
 They just like you.

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:14.620
 What do you know about vasovagal,

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.580
 S-Y-N-C-O-P-E?

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.580
 An emailer is talking about the vagus nerve

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:25.060
 gets activated due to stressors,

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.460
 the heart rate slows, blood pressure drops,

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.260
 blood vessels in the legs can dilate,

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.620
 the blood pools in the lower part,

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.700
 flowing to the brain, and maybe nausea,

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.220
 and things like that.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.380
 And this lady, Mona, wants to know

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.820
 that what besides the stressor

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.100
 is causing the vagus nerve to react so?

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.340
 There has to be more to it than simply being a response

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.100
 to being hot, emotional, scared,

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.060
 when in a normal life setting.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:45:00.180
 - Yeah, low thyroid people tend in that direction.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.180
 And I wrote some newsletters a few years ago on shock,

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:11.100
 and the history of shock goes back a few hundred years,

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:17.660
 but it really became a major aspect of physiology

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:23.660
 just a little over a hundred years ago,

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.940
 the beginning of the 20th century,

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:33.900
 when one of the pioneers was George Washington Krile,

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:40.540
 who's a son at the Cleveland Clinic,

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.540
 which was founded by G.W. Krile I.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:50.700
 The son was a pioneer in both thyroid therapy

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.940
 and breast cancer treatment.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.900
 He innovated the lumpectomy

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.180
 rather than the horrible radical mastectomy,

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.500
 and he practically eliminated thyroid surgery,

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.740
 went from over a thousand surgeries a year in the clinic

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:13.820
 to just about a dozen,

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:18.060
 by understanding how the thyroid can be treated.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.420
 But his father was the real pioneer

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.060
 that led to that understanding of the thyroid.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:29.900
 And his thyroid work grew out of his surgical experiments

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:38.460
 in which he really explained more than anyone else

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:44.340
 what shock is and how the vagus nerve governs shock.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:50.660
 And what happens in shock is that signals are sent

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.620
 to all of your body cells,

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.620
 turning off the ability to use oxygen.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:03.900
 And the use of oxygen is what thyroid is in control of.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.980
 The more thyroid you have,

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.780
 the more oxygen your cells can use.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:15.540
 Within a broad range,

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.540
 that means that your metabolism

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:21.540
 becomes more and more efficient as you use more oxygen.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:27.420
 So the low thyroid person is wasting their energy.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:32.420
 But in shock, it's even worse than hypothyroidism.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.780
 It simply turns off the mechanism for burning,

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.840
 for using oxygen and burning any fuel.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.540
 And so it imitates death, basically.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:52.660
 But when a person in shock is cut,

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:56.200
 their blood stays bright red.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:01.540
 They aren't using the oxygen in their blood

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:06.540
 because the tissue is simply switched off metabolically.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:12.140
 It's like turning off a thyroid

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.820
 in a nervous or electrical way

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.780
 rather than a chemical way.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:22.620
 And the George Washington trial showed

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:27.540
 that stimulating the vagus nerve

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.800
 was the basic signal for turning on shock,

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:35.300
 whether it was caused by loss of blood

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.160
 or pain or fright or whatever.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.980
 The signals through the vagus system

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.860
 were able to switch off, basically,

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.880
 the life process temporarily.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:55.140
 And that process is easier to trigger

00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:00.380
 the lower your thyroid function is.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:04.820
 You become more of a vagal organism

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.460
 when your thyroid is lower.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:12.980
 But people generally,

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:17.940
 if they're going to keep functioning at all,

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:22.940
 they compensate for that exaggerated activity

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.700
 of the vagal nervous system

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:29.340
 by pumping out extra adrenaline.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:33.220
 Their adrenal glands become overactive

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.780
 and they run as much as 40 or 50 times

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.980
 the normal amount of adrenaline production,

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.860
 compensating for that abnormal activity

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.480
 of the vagal opposing system.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:50.380
 The parasympathetic system is the vagal system

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.300
 and the adrenaline system is the sympathetic nervous system.

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.540
 And so, surprisingly,

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:02.380
 many people are running with both sides

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.340
 of their autonomic nervous system

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:07.740
 running at an extremely high rate.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:12.980
 And if something interferes

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.740
 with their production of adrenaline

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.660
 and sympathetic activity,

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.380
 then they drop into the vagal state

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:26.380
 and move toward shock, fainting, for example.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:27.740
 - My goodness.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.020
 Well, a lot of questions there.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.820
 So, Kyle, is that K-Y-L-E?

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.580
 And this work seems,

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.580
 it kind of feels like this is long ago.

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.820
 - I didn't understand the question.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.900
 - Kyle, this work with GW Kyle, was this long ago?

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.660
 - Kyle, C-R-I-L-E.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.300
 - Oh, C-R-I-L-E.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.140
 Oh, Carl, okay.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.540
 - Carl. - Carl, yeah.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.260
 Long time ago?

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:57.780
 - Yeah, the senior trial died, I think, in the 1940s

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:02.900
 and the junior died not long ago in the '90s, I think.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:11.940
 - And what did he do to lower all these surgeries

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.500
 that he went from thousands to a handful?

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.700
 What did he do?

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:19.780
 - Oh, supplementing thyroid, basically.

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.140
 - Oh, he just gave supplemental thyroid.

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.860
 - Yeah, things they were calling thyroid cancer.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.340
 It was just a minor condition that he could turn off

00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:34.420
 just by giving them a full replacement dose of thyroid.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.420
 - Really?

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:38.700
 Was he using TSH and all that as a metric?

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.340
 - No, not at all.

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:46.340
 TSH measurement came in later, really,

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:53.260
 and he was measuring it enough to realize

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:58.260
 that people developing these symptoms of thyroid cancer,

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:03.260
 nodules and so on, were experiencing the same condition

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:08.420
 that iodine supplementers experience with a very high TSH.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:13.980
 And so he understood that TSH was driving

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.940
 towards thyroiditis and eventually thyroid cancer.

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.420
 And so he would give usually three or four grains

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:27.420
 of armor thyroid sufficient to lower the TSH to zero.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:33.060
 And then these people, without thyroidectomy,

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:37.520
 or maybe just partial removal of the cancerous part,

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.180
 would live a normal life.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.020
 - My goodness.

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.700
 - Just keeping their TSH down

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.260
 so that any surviving cancer cells

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.020
 wouldn't be stimulated by the TSH.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:49.860
 - My goodness.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.060
 Three or four grains.

00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.540
 Now a grain is 16 milligrams.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.260
 I mean, that's a lot, isn't it?

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:59.740
 - Well, two grains was the average dose

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.500
 for just the run of the mill.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.340
 - Was it?

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.140
 - Low thyroid, middle-aged person.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:09.140
 But sometimes just to have good functioning,

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:14.980
 some people took three or four or even five grains.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:19.980
 The armor company sold tablets of five grains.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.180
 - Really?

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:25.060
 - And veterinarians found that that was the right dose

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:28.260
 for cocker spaniels.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:33.260
 And a couple of breeds of dogs

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.780
 needed about five grains a day.

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:39.780
 And quite a few people, they sold bottles of,

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:45.860
 I think it was 500 five-grain tablets.

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:46.700
 - Wow.

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.960
 - And $10 or so.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:54.380
 And I've seen a few people who needed more than five grains,

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:59.540
 10 or 15 grains a day to cure their problem,

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.740
 and then they would settle in on four or five grains a day

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.780
 for maintenance.

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.540
 - My goodness, it seems like a very high dose,

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.460
 what we hear around, but I guess.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:14.460
 So how did this Carlisle, how did he judge the dosage

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.940
 if he wasn't using the labs?

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:23.820
 - Oh, the basal metabolic rate was still in use

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:28.500
 through the 1940s and into the '50s.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:33.180
 Then the chemical, the first test was a blood test

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:37.700
 called protein-bound iodine.

00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:40.500
 Came in just around the same time

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.900
 that Synthroid came on the market.

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.580
 - Oh, sure, yeah.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:49.580
 - And it turned out 20 years later

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:54.460
 that it was an absolute meaningless thing.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.940
 But at the time, I was in junior high at the time,

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:03.940
 and several of my fat friends said they had learned

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.660
 that they didn't have a glandular problem

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:09.540
 because the protein-bound iodine showed

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.140
 that they had a fully normal amount

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.140
 of protein-bound iodine in their blood.

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:17.380
 And so they had discovered that they were just gluttonous.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.780
 - So they brought this med thing out

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.420
 right when the Synthroid came out.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:24.380
 I mean, the test.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.220
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:26.060
 - Yeah.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.460
 - It really was part of a marketing system.

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:29.300
 - Those rascals.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.700
 - And what they did was blame the problem on the patient

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.220
 rather than supplementing with Armor Thyroid,

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.700
 which was a good, reliable product.

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.620
 - My goodness.

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.260
 So back to Mona, who brought up this whole vagus.

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:48.820
 So she might have, on both ends,

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.500
 working overtime with the sympathetic,

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.900
 with the vagus and then the adrenaline, right?

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.220
 How would then, how do you lower all that down?

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:59.740
 Is it just looking after Mr. Thyroid?

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:02.060
 - Using your temperature and pulse rate,

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:05.260
 you can come fairly close

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.980
 to the old oxygen consumption test,

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:13.980
 which that's still the ideal way to prove hypothyroidism.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.140
 But you can make a very good guess

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.900
 by taking your temperature before you get out of bed

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.580
 in the morning and checking your pulse rate

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.180
 at the same time.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.500
 If you're, lots of the low thyroid people

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.420
 are running on high adrenaline,

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.820
 which rises during the night,

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:37.520
 and that tends to push up the cortisol.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:42.020
 The adrenaline sometimes will cause

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.700
 90 or 100 beats per minute heart rate

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:49.420
 when you're waking up, sometimes following a nightmare.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:55.260
 And if the cortisol goes up higher than average,

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.820
 it always tends to rise around dawn.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:02.820
 But the higher your cortisol rises,

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:05.260
 the higher your waking temperature will be.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.540
 The adrenaline speeds your pulse at dawn,

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:13.340
 the cortisol raises the temperature

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:16.960
 and helps push the heart rate back down

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.620
 by bringing your blood sugar up.

00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:24.980
 So just that one measurement can be ambiguous,

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:29.980
 high adrenaline, high cortisol, or low, both of them.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.340
 But if you then take your temperature and pulse rate

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.940
 an hour or two after eating,

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:41.300
 the food will lower your adrenaline

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:45.620
 and the daylight and food will lower your cortisol.

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:49.460
 And very often these people who woke up

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:54.460
 seeming to have a very normal 75 beats per minute pulse rate

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.460
 and a 98 degree temperature,

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:03.460
 these people will sometimes drop to a 55 or 60 pulse rate

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:08.740
 and at 96 or 97 degree temperature

00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:10.220
 at 11 o'clock in the morning.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.060
 - And what does that tell you if that happens?

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:13.820
 - That they're super low thyroid.

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.420
 - Ah, okay.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.500
 So the Broda-Barnes thing wasn't kinda sorta right.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:23.460
 I mean, if you had a 98, according to Broda-Barnes,

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:24.380
 and you were good,

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.860
 but this whole adrenaline and cortisol thing,

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.260
 you're saying that maybe not.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.300
 - Yeah.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:40.100
 In hot, humid summers in Eugene,

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:43.940
 I first started questioning

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:46.500
 Barnes's temperature measurement.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:51.140
 He worked at Fort Collins, Colorado,

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:56.140
 where it never gets very hot and humid for very long.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:01.420
 And I saw that people in this hot and humid weather,

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:06.220
 even very hypothyroid people, kept a normal temperature.

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:10.820
 But usually with a normal temperature,

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.740
 they would get a slow pulse rate.

00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:16.500
 So I started adding the two together,

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:21.420
 but then I saw that a very stressful nighttime

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:24.820
 would make both of the indicators

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:29.140
 sometimes look normal at dawn or waking.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:32.940
 And then they would go down on a cool

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.340
