00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herbal Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show before, we do this every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who graduated in England with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 We consult with people about a wide range of conditions and basically give nutritional advice, etc., etc., about whatever it is they need help with.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 For those of you who perhaps have just tuned in and perhaps maybe have never listened to us before,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 like I said, it's a once every month, third Friday of the month, and it has become very normal now.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is our special guest and we generally cover a wide range of different subjects.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 This month I wanted to have a little break from doing the endocrine stuff that we've been doing for the last couple of months

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 and just discuss Dr. Peat's newsletter number one.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 It's a Mayday newsletter which was entitled Language and Criticism.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 That will tie in very nicely to an expose that was done by Carla Rothenberg, a Harvard graduate,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 who basically discussed the mechanism by which the estrogen industry was protected

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 and how estrogen was given good light and good press and used in HRT, contraception, etc.,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 and made billions and billions of dollars for companies like Wyeth and Lilly and Squibb,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 just to name three or so of the corporations that were involved in it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 But more to the point, that progesterone, which is the kind of...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Andrew, excuse me, I'm not sure why we're not picking you up so well.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Sarah, you were coming through quite fine on mic two. I've checked the volume levels for mic one.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 I know. I can hear Andrew. He's very quiet.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Yeah, I'm not sure why that is. I've got the volume level turned up all the way.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Would you please try mic three? Yeah, try that one.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Okay, how's this one?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Oh, that's much better. Thank you. Excuse me.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Yeah, there was a lot of interference.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Teleprompter three. Here we go.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Okay, so as I was saying, I won't go ahead and repeat everything I said,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 but ultimately this month's radio show is going to be on two subjects.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 One is Dr. Peat's newsletter, which is language and criticism,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 basically outlining the authoritarian attitude towards dissemination of information

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 and steering the public consciousness in a very controlled way,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 so just to highlight why things are the way they are and why they shouldn't be that way.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 And then the other half of the show, which may actually run over until next month,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 is exposing all the documents and all the proof and evidence that Carla Rothenberg,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 a PhD graduate, managed to find out about blatant obvious lies,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 which were included and misinformation that was included and misrepresentation that was made,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 supporting the estrogen industry, when actually the papers were there very clearly

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 outlining the negative effects of estrogen and the positive effects of progesterone.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Now, Dr. Peat is a big proponent of progesterone,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 and I think we'll see if we haven't already in the months and the years

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 that we've been doing the show with him that he's been supporting

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 and advocating the use for women and/or men in some instances to be using progesterone.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Why is such a beneficial anti-inflammatory hormone and why it is that estrogen,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 which was always maintained as the female hormone that women needed,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 especially in menopause, why it's such a dangerous chemical to even be promoting,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 especially after menopause?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 So I wanted to start the show by reading out a section that last month was going to prelude this month's talk.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 So saying it's basically not a conspiracy. It's declassified fact that the CIA, the CCF,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 and the Rockefeller and Ford foundations are all implicated in molding and steering culture

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 and belief systems to their doctrines and thereby controlling them as high priests.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 It's not surprising it happens. After all, if it wasn't them, the vacuum left would be filled by others.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 It's just a moral issue of deception and greed behind the construct, which is shameful.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 So through misrepresentation and bad science, the anti-cancer benefits of progesterone

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 were skewed and suppressed in favor of estrogen.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 And the estrogen industry's multi-billion dollar production of contraception and HRT

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 fueled massive profits and a propagandistic population reduction religion.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Because of this skewed information, progesterone was added to the California Prop 65 list of known carcinogens.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Big pharma interests and lobbying, happy to keep it this way because of financial interest,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 maintained the disinformation and academia followed compliance in doctrine and education.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So before we get into the exposÃ© surrounding the misinformation regarding the effects of estrogen versus progesterone,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 I wanted to start the show by outlining the truth regarding the criticism in that during the last 10 to 15 years,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Dr. Peat's newsletter mentioned that several people have written about the lack of major transformative ideas in science

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 since the middle of the last century and that the status quo was devoted to maintaining this.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 So let's just see if Dr. Peat is on the line now.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Okay, do we have Dr. Peat yet? Doesn't seem like we do, so we'll just...

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 I'm not sure what we're doing. What's the engineer doing? Do we have Dr. Peat with us?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 Say again?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 Do we have Dr. Peat with us?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 I guess not. I'm sorry. Let me try reaching him again.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 Okay. All right. Well, until we get Dr. Peat on the line, we'll just continue in the hope that he can be reached.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 So essentially, the newsletter that Dr. Peat wrote, and this is his May newsletter,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 outlined that the very war, and I will call it a war, against true science was being waged by a very egalitarian

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 authoritarian industry with both regulators, lobbyists, and government, and other big interests

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 at the heart of maintaining a status quo of domination of the market.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 It's not a conspiracy theory. It's just a fact that vested interests like pharmaceutical companies

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 generating billions and billions of dollars in revenue with drugs, produce reports about drugs that,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 some of which we find later on, were found to be very dangerous.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And obviously, people can think about drugs that have hit the headlines as being very damaging and dangerous products

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 that were withdrawn. But then also, there is the fact that lots of research is actually buried.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Some of the research that shows things are not that good for you are skewed.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 The reports and the results are skewed in favor of the decision that's wanted by the drug manufacturers.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 And also, evidence to show that a drug's effect is actually very negative is often buried.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Now, it's certainly a case in point of maintaining a control over an industry which is quite a monopolistic industry.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 And the FDA, again, have been implicated in being complicit in this deception.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 So his newsletter was basically comparing the academic and the sort of libertarian side of academia,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 whether it's the humanities, including philosophy, the arts, and the kind of creative thinking side of the education system

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 versus the reductionistic and scientific side of the equation, which was born out of the rapid increase in knowledge.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 But that rapid increase in knowledge itself brought its own problems because it could be seen as being steered in a certain direction.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And that direction ultimately, and I think it's fairly common normal bias,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 that it was steered in the direction of those powers that had the most control and wanted to maintain the narrative that was important for them.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 So when we do get Dr. Peat on, we'll question him about the findings that he's produced in his newsletter.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And then we'll go probably about 730 or so to open up a discussion about Carla Rothenberg.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And then as usual, we'll take callers from 730 until 8 o'clock.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And then people are very welcome to ask questions outside of the subject, but it's always good when we keep on topic.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 So if people do have questions surrounding either the estrogen industry, progesterone, estrogen's effects,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 or whether or not there are people that have direct experience with the authoritarian academic mindset that people come across.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Another thing I wanted to mention is that funding for these natural hormones that drug companies are not able to patent becomes a problem.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Because if there's no monetary incentive for them to do studies, then studies are not done on such things that are not patentable,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 such as thyroid and progesterone, because they're natural hormones.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 So are we still trying to get Dr. Peat on the line?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Yes, we are. I just had him for a second. Dr. Peat, are you there?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 Okay. You guys, I'm really sorry. There's another engineer on the way, and he should be here in just a minute, and we'll get it worked out.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Excuse me.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Okay, no problem.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Now, these things do happen. It is a live broadcast.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 And Dr. Peat, I know I spoke to him earlier on. He's certainly joining us, but whatever there is, it's a technical glitch for some reason.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Okay, so some of those things. I just wanted to mention who doesn't recognize the term MK-Ultra?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 I'm sure quite a few of you have heard the term MK-Ultra before.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 It was actually a very real exercise in producing a situational mind control to not only maintain compliance and order,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 but to physically, mentally direct the minds of those subjects that were under that influence to be basically willing pawns to do the bidding of the organizations that were controlling them.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 So we've all heard about the CIA. We've heard about the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Sounds like the Bourne movies.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 It sounds conspiracy theory, folks, but you know what? Truth really is stranger than fiction.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 It's not until people start waking up and turning around and looking over their shoulder that they start seeing things are not actually the way that they're told things are.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 That's just the kind of limited brain space that they want you in so that you don't argue and that you don't buck the system.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Question authority.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Okay. So I think, do we have Dr. Peat on the line?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Yes, I'm here.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat, thanks for joining us.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 Okay. So I've given an outline of what it is we'd like to discuss.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 The first being the newsletter that you produced on the language and criticism and how the authoritarianism within the educational system has been motivated and fueled by big business and big money, whether it's the Ford or Rockefeller Foundations or the CIA,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 and how this very much controls the narrative, especially within education, about what it is that is and isn't published and what we are or aren't expected to know.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Yeah, the gene theory is really the best basis for an authoritarian theory of society and organization of society.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 Conrad Lorenz developed the idea of genetically based behavior for Hitler, for the Nazi Party, as the ideology for the race supremacism and the elimination of inferior people and so on.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 And exactly that ideology was taken up by American biologists as soon as the war was over.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 And Chomsky's idea of generative grammar, it's really structurally identical to Conrad Lorenz's genetically based theory of behavior.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And Chomsky's research has been, since the 1950s, financed by the Pentagon for use in war making.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 But it's really the same ideology that Lorenz developed for social control and genocide.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 Okay, so I mentioned earlier on a little bit about what was brought out in the document here that the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations as well as the CIA actively identified individuals who represented particular features of their ideologies who could exert effects over organizations and people.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 And it was only the humanities, the languages, the arts, literature, philosophy, etc. that was a major obstacle to this authoritarian civilization.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 And the funding for this pro-authoritarian direction included prestigious publishing houses, major mass magazines, Hollywood, and broadcasting to dictate the position.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 I gave the example of C.P. Snow's famous article and lecture in the 1950s on the two cultures.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 The ideology was that science was the basis of the true culture and the humanities, art, philosophy, literature, religion, all of these things were obstacles to the progress of civilization.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Right, because these would have been much more altruistic, compassionate, looking for the better good of civilization and humanity and not at all vested financial interests.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Yep, that's why they were called the humanities.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 Because they were humane. So what were you saying? You said grammar was structured around this ideology?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 It started in the 1930s. Chomsky wasn't the originator of the idea. It came out of the early computer thinking that you needed a language that wasn't complex and fluid.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 If you were going to put all knowledge into computers, things had to be absolutely self-contained.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 So they developed a theory of reality in which reality was made up of self-contained units in which their position in space and time didn't affect them essentially because they wanted the language to have a one-to-one relationship to reality.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And computers could only handle absolutely discrete units of information.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 So the ideology of reality was set so that it worked in computers. And that fit with the idea that each of our units of meaning is determined genetically by a discrete molecular structure.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 And so behavior would be reduced to these discrete units. And grammar was simply one of the types of behaviors that could be genetically determined.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 And so Chomsky was just one of the people completing this theory that genes control behavior. Grammar is one of our behaviors. And so language can be reduced to these units.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Okay. I mentioned a little bit while we were getting you on here that also the program, the MKUltra program came out of the same CIA desire to control and very much through language, it was called the command and control, wasn't it? I think the tenant.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 You can read some of the Pentagon's books describing what they're doing on the internet.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 So it does go on. It always blows me away. The more outlandish something sounds, the more realistic it is to actually having happened. And it never fails to amaze me that sometime down the road, even when I am tentatively cautious about adopting that position,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 that down the road, there's more and more evidence that comes out to compel me to believe that this is actually the way it was.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 It's a little bit of an aside here, but I remember when I first came to this country in 2001, it was in 2002 and 2003 that we were starting to visit different stores and seeing what accounts we could raise to produce, send our products that we produced.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 And I was talking to one of the people in the store, probably a 23 year old female, not an older person, very kind of hip with it, young and just kind of eyes open.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 And after the end of the presentation that we gave her, she said she started going on about chemtrails. And she said, yeah, it's disgusting. You know, the chemtrails up in the sky, they're just coalescing and forming this big map cloud and they're cooling the earth down.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 And I'm starting up this coalition here in California to campaign against it. And I just looked at her and I just I didn't know what to say. I was speechless.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And I looked at Sarah and then we kind of left and we got back into the car and I said, wow, that girl is nuts. And you know what? I maintain that position here for a couple of years because I didn't really know anything about chemtrails.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 It was not something I was looking at. I wasn't really looking sideways. I was just keeping my head down working. And then slowly but surely, all the evidence was coming out.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 And I could not believe it. It sounded so outlandish, but it was so true. And so here we are today with not only chemtrails, but we've got all the GMO integration of different biological compounds that are now in the atmosphere or in the food or in the water.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Then we've got the nanoparticles that are potentially messing things up and the whole genetic basis by which tomatoes have been spliced with fish or whatever.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 The more wild, the more wild it is actually wake up, folks, and take a better look at it, because you know what? It's kind of hiding in plain sight.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 And they're just hoping that you're so dumb and you're so brainwashed and just mindless. So just watching TV and just going, obviously going to work and keeping, keeping alive, paying the bills that you don't have time to look anywhere.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 So when we first started this discussion here years ago, ask your doctor, we were looking very much on a kind of counterculture kind of way, looking at alternatives with alternative medicine being our background.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 And I'm very pleased when we met you because you were very much supporting a lot of the things that we thought about before that were very much true and a lot of other things.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 So the whole thing, MK Ultra, the CIA involvement, the Rockefeller Foundation, the whole, the end of the Second World War, the formation of these big, big councils and organizations to control the planet.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 And it's not that far fetched. It really is actually quite true, in fact. And so between the World Health Organization and the European Union, with all their influence, are very much wanting to control the narrative to tell us the way things are.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 And drugs and drug research is just another arm of that, which, again, multi-billion dollar, powerful industry with powerful lobbying in government.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 So when we do find out later on in the rare instances when we get told that some of these drugs were crippling people or causing more cancer or just doing more harm than good, we have to remember that that tenant of medicine is first do no harm.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 And I think bringing out the discussion with vaccines that the vaccine makers are indemnified against all blame really just lays it open that they are very much hiding behind a government protection that enables a system to proceed pretty much unchecked.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And part of the control system is convincing people that medicine is really good for them, covering up the actual facts of vaccination.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 But the total cancer picture, for example, I think it's been fraudulent since the turn of the century. 25 years ago, when Donna Shalala declared that the cancer war was being won, I looked at the statistics and saw that she was using fraudulent statistics to declare victory in 1994.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 And I predicted then that they weren't going to be able to keep using the present statistics to continue winning the war on cancer because the baby boomers would be reaching the cancer age in the year 2000.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 In that year, the National Statistics Bureau shifted that they no longer give raw data on cancer mortality, but only age adjusted figures.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 So it's almost impossible to put together a picture of what's really happening. But in a few situations like young women with breast cancer, there is a very great increase among young women and both incidence and mortality from breast cancer.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 So they are doing their best to cover up the figures for things like cancer, asthma, all of the degenerative diseases, the effects of vaccination and so on.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 It's follow the money. And if they're not going to fund a study, then we're not going to hear the truth. It's like the radiologist says he sees birth defects in women who use fertility treatment.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 And you ask the fertility specialist and they say, no, that's not a fact because it hasn't been studied. And why hasn't it been studied? Because there's no money to pay for the studies.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 I can. It reminds me what you were talking about, Dr. Peat, and you've mentioned it quite a few times that when you were pursuing your Ph.D., you would spend hours and hours in the library looking through abstracts and looking through chemical abstracts and database information to find, you know, you know, supporting or refuting evidence for whatever proposition you were trying to make.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 And that quite soon after that, I think you're talking about the the 50s. The library suddenly started pulling all their printed reference material out of the libraries and were starting to turn to a digitized format where those papers that were written in the nineteen hundreds and up to the 1950s showed very good science based research that was done in many different areas was suddenly not available anymore.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 Yeah, I used to use biological abstracts and chemical abstracts, which they had back to 1910 and it filled a whole huge room.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 And just each year there were about 30 or 40 pounds of books of abstracts printed. And suddenly that whole room full of abstracts disappeared about 15, 10 or 15 years ago.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And I asked the librarian where they were and they had been moved to a storage basement. And I said, well, can I ask for particular years of volumes? And they said, no, they aren't labeled.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 They're not indexed. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. All right. So that's why they call it the health care industry. Yeah, very much so.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 OK, the engineer wants to read out. I think you've got something to read out here. I do. Thanks. Just we've got to take a short, very short break here to say thanks to some underwriters.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 The time is seven. Twenty eight temperature outside is seventy seven degrees Fahrenheit. That's twenty five degrees Celsius.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Support for our voice in the Redwoods has come is coming from Chautauqua Natural Foods in Garboville, locally owned for thirty four years.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 They specialize in local and organic produce, natural groceries, nutritional supplements and body care products.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 Now announcing every day is Senior Day. Chautauqua is open Monday through Saturday, nine to seven, Sunday, ten to five.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 They're just off the town square in Garboville. More information is online at Facebook dot com slash to talk one natural.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Big thanks as well. Going out to Sage Analytics, makers of potency testing devices that give results of potency in a matter of seconds faster than sending it to a lab.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 The devices can be found at Bogart located in Eureka. More information online at Sage Analytics dot com.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 You can also telephone area code six one nine eight four seven forty four seventy seven.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And finally, heaps of gratitude going out from your voice in the Redwoods to Emerald Kingdom Greenhouse, who created the Eclipse system.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 It's an auto blackout light deprivation greenhouse and timer run. It can create an autumn darkness any time of day.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 More information on the Eclipse system is available at Emerald Kingdom Greenhouse dot com.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 And finally, the views and opinions expressed throughout the broadcast day are those of the speakers and not necessarily those of this station, its staff or underwriters.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Time will be made available for other viewpoints. Thank you for joining us.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 OK, so it's seven thirty now and from seven thirty to the end of the show, people are invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to both Dr.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 Peat's newsletter on the language and criticism.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 Basically, the authoritarian model that we've been raised with very much pro government authoritarian control of our thoughts and our minds with information they want us to know,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 hiding the information, perhaps in plain sight sometimes for those things that are counter to that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 And then we're going to carry on the rest of this show from seven thirty on now until the end of the show, breaking down Carla Rothenberg's absolutely devastating dissertation,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 showing all the facts in very, very clear, very, very clear ways to show that the lies purported by the industry was so blatant

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 and that actually the protective effects of progesterone were so hidden that it led California's proposition 65 to list progesterone as a carcinogen with some very, very, very poor science behind it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 In fact, no real science, but actually a failure to see the science for what it was. Hello. Hello. Or more all willing, inclusive attitude to maintain estrogen as the prominent drug manufactured by the markets.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 And now they classify breast tumors as progesterone dependent as well as estrogen dependent.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 So we will take we will take callers from seven thirty to the end of the show. The number here, if you're in the area, seven or seven nine two three three nine one one.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Or if you're outside the area, there's a one eight hundred number, which is one eight hundred KMUD rad.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Hello. Yeah, you're on the air. Hello. Yeah, you're on the air. Can you hear me? Oh, yes. Hello. So, yes, I have a question.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Estrogen is. Hello. Yeah, the engineer cut you off, I think.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Go ahead. OK, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Just go ahead. OK. Yeah.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 So estrogen is also a natural hormone produced by the body. Why is why is it not good?

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 And progesterone is good and also progesterone is also in birth control pills, correct?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Not not the. Well, Dr. Peate can talk about the differences, but not in its biological, not an identical form.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Yeah. So they use progestins as well as estrogens. So synthesize progesterone.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 Yeah, the body makes a variety of of hormones which are essential for acute reactions to stress.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 A histamine, for example, and antihistamines are beneficial in many,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 even though the antihistamine is a synthetic drug turning off a natural drug.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 It can be very protective, save lives. Estrogen and anthrax and some serotonin nitric oxide are other intrinsic natural hormones,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 which are very important for acute reactions to stress.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 But like histamine, when they are continued too long or at too high a concentration, they become deadly.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Estrogen was known over 100 years ago, about 1905.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 It was clearly identified as a cause of cancer.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 And I thought they knew I thought they knew in the 1800s that the chimney sweeps were developing testicular cancer from the high estrogen content of the charcoal and the coal.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. The identity of estrogen and the carcinogens,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 there wasn't clearly chemically identified until about 1935, 36, 37.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 A series of papers came out and these people warned against the use of any estrogen for treatment because they

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 the chemical work made clear that the soot carcinogenesis that was known from the 18th century and the various chemical coal tar carcinogens that were studied through the late 19th and early 20th century.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 These were seen to be essentially estrogenic, creating inflammation, fibrosis and cancer, as well as the typical estrogen symptoms.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 And in the 1930s, already progesterone was identified as the protective agent against the carcinogenic and other degenerative effects of both estrogen and the coal tar soot, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 And for 20 years, from 1935 to 1955, that work continued.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 But it was submerged. The story that Carla Rosenberg tells makes it clear what was happening.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 In 1940, the drug companies intervened to create their own story. First, estrogen was the female hormone that would support pregnancy and retard aging.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Then, in the later 1940s, progesterone, to sell products, they realized that progesterone was expensive to make and couldn't be patented.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 So each company developed a synthetic product that had some of progesterone's actions.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 But testosterone, for example, had some of progesterone's actions. It can sustain the uterine condition that's necessary for pregnancy.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 But many of the chemicals that showed one of the reactions of progesterone, most of them in the late 1940s, had also properties of estrogen.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And in fact, they would terminate pregnancy. Progesterone was named for the ability to sustain gestation, progestational.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 But the synthetic chemicals were given that name, even though they blocked, destroyed gestation, created immediate miscarriage or abortion.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 So the FDA was basically controlled by the drug companies to falsify language, use language exactly in the opposite sense,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 so that the progestins that have continued to be used in birth control pills, some of them are strongly estrogenic and all of them interfere, terminating pregnancy.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 And they're not bioidentical progesterone, they're a synthetic progesterone.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Yeah, they're anti-progesterone actually, but the FDA allows them to be called progestins.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 And worse than that, the FDA requires that natural progesterone be given the properties of the anti-progesterone.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 If a synthetic progesterone causes heart disease, for example, then they have to warn that natural progesterone might cause heart disease or deformities of the developing embryo.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 Also, I'm aware that estrogen is found in food, it leaches out of plastic bottles, hormones that are in the oral contraceptive pill are estrogenic,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 the water supply becomes contaminated with estrogens. What else is there that's estrogenic?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Bisphenol A is one of the most widespread synthetic estrogenic substances used in plastics.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 It's been known for about 120 years.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 And a man who developed diethylstilbestrol, DES, in the 1930s was warning that it shouldn't be used in treating humans,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 but the drug companies immediately put it to use as the female hormone to prevent miscarriage and retard aging,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 even though it was known to cause miscarriage and to cause cancer.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 So we're exposed to a lot of estrogens in our environment, but are we exposed to progesterone, natural bioidentical progesterone, in our foods or in our environment?

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Milk naturally contains some progesterone, and it contains a little thyroid and estrogen, but naturally,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 if the mother was providing a large amount of estrogen to the babies, natural milk would cause feminization of boy babies.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 It's obvious that natural milk contains predominantly progesterone.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 All right, so I think that wraps it up for that caller. I think the lights have not stopped flashing,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 so I'm not too sure whether or not there's people queued up or not, but let's see if there is another caller.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Okay, so I think we're having some technical difficulties here, folks. I see the lights flashing constantly.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 We'll just see if we can get those people actually to look out.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Yeah, Michael is coming back, and he should be here in a second.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 All right. Okay, so I think let's carry on with what I wanted to break down as a revelationary piece of work done by Carla Rottenberg,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 who's a Harvard PhD student who basically wrote a fairly damning expose on the estrogen industry,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 especially with reference to HRT and contraceptives that showed that the damage that was being caused was irrevocable

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 and catastrophic in a lot of cases, and that the estrogen industry was certainly being exposed for what we've already discussed

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 as a previous collusion to maintain control over the production of estrogen, where there was no financial incentive to push progesterone,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 and the two of them had a very disparate price limit, if you like.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 I think the estrogen's worth was a thousand times what progesterone's was,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 and a lot of the research was actually supporting the evidence to show that estrogen was supporting bone health,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 or it was preventing the hot flashes with HRT and how women needed estrogen, and progesterone in the meantime was buried.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 I think what I wanted to bring out, and we do have another quarter on the air here,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 but I wanted to bring out the whole reason why in California, and always California, isn't it,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:18.000
 the Proposition 65 mandate that said that chemicals known to the state of California had to be listed on the label of whatever it was you were buying,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 again, there's a little bit of a weird spin on this, and that has left the legislators and the lawyers in as much as if it's not used internally,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 you don't have to put that disclaimer on, but if it is to be used internally, you have to list it.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Now, the fact that they put progesterone on the Prop 65 list and not estrogen is beyond me.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 We'll get into that after the next caller, so let's take this next caller.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 Caller, are you there?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 We think they're there.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Okay, caller, you're on the air.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 Oh, good, hi.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Where are you from, and what's your question?

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 I have a question.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 I have called a few times.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 I'm the one that wakes up every night with a headache.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 Okay.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 And I have a question.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
 I found, or I traced it back to an injury that I sustained in the nasal cavity,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 and what I understand now is I'm leaking cerebral spinal fluid every night.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 Okay.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 So it has to do with my fluids.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 If I drink too much fluid, it can make it worse, but anyway, it oozes water.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 Interesting.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 So what I'm trying to figure out is I had handled my allergies.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 I have taken the thyroid, and I take quite a bit of it,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 and I've been on the diet religiously and very carefully, and I'm thinking, let's see, I'm 61 now.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 Okay.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 Have the doctors or the medical professionals--

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 No, I really don't want to try that.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Well, what I wanted to ask was how you identified this structure that you say is located here at the top of your nose,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 presumably here at this barrier, the CSF barrier.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 You said that it's leaking.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 It's leaking.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 So has that been visualized?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 Who told you that it was CSF that was causing the--

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 I've done a lot of studies.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 I've been at it eight years trying to figure it out.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Okay.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 Yeah, just a few weeks ago, I was talking to a girl who had been having that for at least several months,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 but her symptoms went back several years since late puberty years,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 and it's closely associated with high estrogen to progesterone ratio,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 and the pregnenolone, DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens are protective,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 so it isn't just progesterone, but estrogen makes the blood vessels leaky,

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 and various types of inflammation can set off that leakiness.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 It isn't necessarily an injury.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 This girl that I recently talked to didn't have any identified injury.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 It's just closely associated with PMS symptoms,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 and vitamin D deficiency is one of the things that can increase the leakiness of the membranes.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Has yours been tested?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Yes, it was up very high at one time, the vitamin D.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 I brought it down, I think, to more of a normal range.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 It was up in the 80s, 90s.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 So I thought maybe 50s would be safer.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 Do you watch your calcium to phosphate ratio in your diet?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Yes, I have one meat meal a day, and it's done with the gelatin,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
 so I'm very careful with that.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 I drink two quarts of milk and then, of course, the orange juice.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 Have you ever had your estrodol to progesterone ratio tested?

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 I really don't want to do any puncturing to my body,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 so I don't quite know what else to do there.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 Okay.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 I'd rather guess on that, but I will.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 I'll go ahead and --

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Have you tried supplementing pregnenolone or progesterone?

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Yes.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 It was due to an injury.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 It was a ballooning endocranial adjustment to my nose because my jaw got dislocated.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 So I wake up every night at about 2 or 3,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 and I understand that the brain or the body makes cerebral spinal fluid at that time.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 And so the best thing I can do is drink coffee and sit in a bathtub for about 40 minutes,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 and then it will drain out, and then I can go back to sleep.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 That's definitely the time of day where you're most subjected to cortisol

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 in terms of low blood sugar.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Have you experimented with making sure --

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 Definitely.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 I eat a lot of sugar now.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 What about antihistamines?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 I don't take antihistamines.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 If coffee helps, what about aspirin?

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 I take aspirin.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 I take three tablets a day.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 I space it out.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 With the K, of course.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 What about cyproheptadine, Dr. Peat?

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Yeah, that I think is the safest antihistamine because it also takes down serotonin excess.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 I tried that, and then I got restless legs.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 I could try it again, but it really didn't help me sleep very well.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Would you say, Dr. Peat, that you'd like to recommend like a tenth of the normal dose?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Yeah, after you've used a few of the typical doses of one or two milligrams,

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 it seems that you get more sensitive to it and can get a good reaction from a tenth of a milligram.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 Got it.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 Okay.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 I'm going to try it.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 Thank you so much for your help.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 I love the diet, the best diet in the world.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
 I mean, I'm very healthy, but this is quite a conundrum.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 One other substance that has some antihistamine, antileakiness effects is emodin,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 either from cascara or rhubarb root.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Okay.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 I do take cascara.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 Can I take just a bunch, a bunch, a bunch of it?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 No.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
 No.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Well, I do.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 It keeps my bowels moving very well, and I appreciate it very much.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 How much?

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 You said you are using pregnenolone, did you?

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 I do use some pregnenolone.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 I use those little scoops.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 I use two scoops.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 Is that not enough?

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 I don't know what size the scoop is.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 What is that size, please?

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Thirty, probably 150 milligrams.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 When I first tried it, I brought back a kilogram from Syntex in Mexico,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 and I felt so much better on 100 or 300 milligrams.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 I wanted to see if it was safe to recommend,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:47.000
 and so I ate about 3,000 milligrams a day for a year and felt great.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 I didn't find any side effects.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Studies on rats in which they gave a rat about 10,000 milligrams in a single dose,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 they didn't see any harmful side effects.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 I noticed personally that 100 milligrams I didn't notice anything with,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 but 350 milligrams, then I said, "Okay, now I notice an effect from this pregnenolone,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 a very positive effect."

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 It would be good, you know, despite your reservations about being punctured for phlebotomy,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 it would be good to know your progesterone to estrogen ratio,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
 to be reasonably scientific about the whole approach to it

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
 because you might have a very low progesterone to estrogen ratio,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
 which is what Dr. Peat is coming from, I think,

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
 in terms of estrogen being totally responsible for inflammation,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 and that inflammation and leakiness that is governed by estrogen's effects on the vasculature

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
 may well be a contributory factor to what you'll experience at nighttime.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 And if you look into life extension, you can get some blood work ordered.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 They'll order blood work for you without a doctor.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
 So if you don't want to go see an MD, then call Life Extension up.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
 Very good.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 They'll order you blood tests.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
 Right. I do have a doctor I can get it from.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 We have two more callers, so in order to be fair with these people, I need to--

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 I do appreciate your time. Thank you, Dr. Peat.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 You're amazing. Thank you.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Okay, next caller. Where are you from and what's your question?

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 Hi there.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 Yeah, where are you from and what's your question?

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 I can hardly hear you. Can you speak up?

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
 I said, where are you from and what's your question?

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.000
 Oh, I'm from Laytonville, and I have a question and a clarification first.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 At the beginning of the show, you mentioned Chomsky.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Were you referring to Noam Chomsky, the linguist?

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 Correct, yeah.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 Wow, okay. You didn't say his first name.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Oh, I think Dr. Peat mentioned-- I think he might have mentioned his first name.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 Oh, okay. I tuned in a little late.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 No problem.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
 My question is this.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 I'm 76. I've been on the bioidentical estrogen/progesterone for 20 years.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 Right.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:06.000
 I'm just using the E2 and E3 forms of the estrogen, not the E1, topical cream,

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 very low dose, and 50 to-- I don't know if you want the numbers-- with 50 of the progesterone.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 And I use a half a gram twice a day, and it keeps the hot flashes and night sweats away.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 And how--

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 What do you think of the bioidentical?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 How old did you say you were, 81?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 76.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
 76. Dr. Peat.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 In the 1930s and 1940s, Alexander Lipschutz tested on various animals the effects of very small doses of estrogen,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 and he saw that if that small dose was continuous, it would be carcinogenic to every tissue he looked at,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
 brain, kidney--

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 Was that bioidentical estrogen?

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 Yes, bioidentical, but he found that if you interrupted it regularly, the way the body does with the--

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
 Menstruation, yeah.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 Yeah, the monthly--

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 Ovulation.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 --progesterone, the luteal phase where you have progesterone in huge amounts for two weeks,

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 that interrupts the carcinogenic effect of estrogen.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 So even a big surge of estrogen once a month isn't carcinogenic as long as you're protecting it

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
 and knocking it out of cells with good dose of progesterone.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 So it doesn't matter that the dose of estrogen is small.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 It's the discontinuity that is protective.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 And Dr. Peat--

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 If I interrupt it--

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 Dr. Peat, would you also say that it's estrogen which is more responsible for hot flashes?

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 Yeah, actually the estrogen turns on nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator,

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000
 and causes leakiness of the blood vessels.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 Is that all three?

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 You know, there's three estrogens, and you're using them all as women.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000
 They all have the same effects, but at different doses.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 The estriol is about 10 times weaker than estradiol.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:34.000
 And so many doctors prescribe a dose such as maybe 100 micrograms

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 or up to 1 milligram of estriol to get the same effect that they would get

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 from maybe 20 or 30 micrograms of estradiol.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 But it's still harmful if you don't interrupt it.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
 Well, how long do you interrupt it for?

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 I'm not sure, but something approaching the body's two weeks is probably ideal,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 but I think a week with a progesterone supplement is probably safe enough.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000
 Okay, well, so you don't see much difference between the synthetic estrogens

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
 and the bioidentical then?

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 No, the estradiol is the powerful natural one.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.000
 The ethanol estradiol --

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 Estrone and --

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 Estriol and estrone.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 The added group makes estradiol simply stay in your body longer, 17 times longer.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 Which one is that, E1, E2, or E3?

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
 The ethanol estradiol is one used in so many birth control pills.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 No, but I mean --

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
 But the estradiol is the natural --

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
 Is that E1 or E2 or E3?

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
 That's E2.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 So what would happen if I eliminated the E2?

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 That's the strongest one, so it's safer with the lower dose.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 E3 is the weakest -- well, E1 and E3 are both weak.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 So why don't you try cutting out E2 and just using the E3 for two weeks out of the month

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
 and using the progesterone the whole cycle

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
 and see what happens with your hot flashes?

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 That's interesting.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 Well, I'll have to go through all the night sweats and hot flashes.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 Well, you might not.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 You might find that you don't have any at all.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
 That's the point.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
 You mean if I just go right on to the new regimen?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 Yeah, because the estrogen is what causes the hot flashes,

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
 and the progesterone is what stops it.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 So once your system gets used to the new regimen,

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 then maybe you won't have any more hot flashes.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 But we do have another caller on the line.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
 We could maybe squeeze in one more quick call.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 I don't know if we can.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
 We'll just try.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 Where are you from and what's your question?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 We've got to be quick.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 You've got about two minutes.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 Hello, my name is Peter.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 I'm from San Francisco.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 Go ahead, Peter.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
 Two minutes.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 All right.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
 My question is related to the estrogen research.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 I understand that there are certain substances in plastics like EPA

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 that are estrogenic in nature.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 I'm wondering if there are certain types of foods,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 maybe more acidic or more basic,

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 that are more likely to leach plastic or these substances into the food.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 Yeah.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 No, I don't know of any such effects of the pH of the food metabolism.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 But it's important to keep your protein and your B vitamins up.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 Those are the main things that deficiency will allow the liver to let estrogen

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 build up in your body.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 Protein and B1 especially are the anti-estrogen nutrients.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000
 Another research fact that my colleague, a friend from Oxford University,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 found out about plastic water bottles is that if they're room temperature,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 they leak less plasticizers into the water.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 If they're cold or frozen, they become brittle

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000
 and leach much more plastic compounds into the water.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 I think with the advent of this information of plastics leaching estrogenic mimics

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 into the food and into the liquid they carry,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 I think there's much more effort now to produce HDPE and other plastics which are not--

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 --not into go foods.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
 I mean they're not going to use that high quality of plastic into go foods.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000
 So that might apply to your food that you buy out of plastic containers.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
 If it's in the refrigerator, it's going to be leaching more plastics into the food.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
 Anyway, Dr. Peat, thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 I'm going to sign off with letting people know how to find you

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 and a bit more information about next month.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 Okay.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 Thanks a lot.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 Okay, so for those of you who tuned in this month, thanks for your calls.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 Next month we're going to continue the subject.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 We didn't really get into it too much, but we'll break it down in full detail,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Carla Rothenberg's expose on the lies purported by the estrogen industry

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.000
 and why progesterone is as anti-inflammatory, as Dr. Peat has been saying for a long time now.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
 And research has shown.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 Obviously.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Okay, so we can be reached Monday through Friday, 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 For those people who want to find out more about Dr. Peat, if they've never heard him before,

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 his website, www.rayPeat.com is full of referenced articles,

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 so plenty of different information about lots of different situations there

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
 that are referenced, and then also on YouTube.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 If people want to tune in on YouTube to listen to any of these shows,

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
 I think every one of them is on YouTube now,

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 and I'm doing my best to get the 2016 and the early 2017 programs on our website.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 Anyway, thanks for those of you who tuned in,

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 and all of you listening out there, the Pej Drive is coming up in July,

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 so if you like this kind of show, this alternative show, you know,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 it's just not the mainstream.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 If you want to keep hearing this, support the station, please.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 Thank you for listening. Good night.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 Thanks, and good night.
