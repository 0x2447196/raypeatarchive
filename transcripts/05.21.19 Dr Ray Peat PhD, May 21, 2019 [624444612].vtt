00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hello. Dr. Peat, there you are. Yes, hi. Hi, good morning. How are things with you, sir?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.920
 Pretty good. Pretty good? Pretty good? What'd you have for breakfast? Oh, I've just

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.720
 coffee and milk. Coffee and milk. Coffee and milk. It's so funny, there's so many

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.800
 people out there, Dr. Peat, that tell you, "Boy, you just shouldn't drink milk." I

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.480
 mean, milk, we're the only mammals in the world that don't drink milk after weaning,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.080
 and it's just going to kill you and all of that. It hasn't killed you.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:44.200
 Nope. It's actually one of the cleanest foods available because of the cow filtering

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:55.680
 it through many layers, chemically. The rumen processes the toxins out of the plant material.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.400
 When you eat the same leaves that a cow eats, you absorb many allergens and toxic materials

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:12.640
 that the plant puts into its leaves defensively intended to kill bugs or anyone who would

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:22.240
 damage them, eating holes in their leaves and such. So really, there are chemical pesticides

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:33.680
 naturally in plant material. Seeds are the most precious to the plant. Their whole generation

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.920
 depends on the seeds being viable and not being eaten by microorganisms or large organisms.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:54.400
 So they have the most intense toxins and blockers of the digestive system. When you look at

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:05.440
 the chemicals in seeds, it turns out that they block the digestive enzymes of mammals

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:14.480
 and insects, but they don't affect that same type of enzyme in plants. So it's obvious

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:26.760
 that they're directed towards a defense against being eaten. Unless you have very sophisticated

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.160
 lab equipment, you just can't separate the good stuff from the toxins. But the cow's

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:44.920
 rumen is such that the microorganisms do the chemistry of eliminating the bad stuff, increasing

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.680
 the good stuff.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.120
 At the local store, they have a few choices of organic milk. I didn't want to get one

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.040
 of those big, huge things because I don't drink a lot of it, but I wanted to try a little.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.560
 And I just got some half and half organic. Boy, that's pretty fun to drink, getting

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.440
 a lot of good fat in there.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:14.120
 Yeah, I use cream or half and half in my coffee.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.520
 What's with this A2 for cows? Is there anything for that if you get a Jersey A2 cow that's

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.240
 easier to digest? And talk about the difference between goat milk and cow milk.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.800
 There's a big difference between the milk of all species, but they still have in common

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:48.480
 the rumen milk. Camels, goats, sheep, cows, yamas, that type of animal produces the safest

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 milk. The reason people don't drink pig milk or bear milk or such is that they don't

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.560
 have rumens, and so all the plant toxins go into their milk.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.760
 They don't have rumens. And explain what rumens are exactly.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:16.200
 It's an extra stomach that the vegetable material goes in and soaks with. The body

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:27.200
 temperature favors the growth of microorganisms which ferment and degrade the plant material,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:39.240
 basically digesting it with protozoa, fungi, bacteria, all of the major types of microorganisms

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:48.160
 get a chance to break down the plant material. Then that broken down material goes through

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:56.840
 the regular digestive system, analogous to what we have. People and bears and pigs don't

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:07.880
 have that extra stomach, and so whatever they eat pretty much goes with minimal filtering

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.880
 through the bloodstream.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.960
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us. He has a PhD in biology, University of Oregon, specialized in physiology.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:22.800
 He taught in schools. He's taught in University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.280
 National College of Naturopathic Medicine, University of Arizona down in Mexico. He's

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.760
 done some work in Mexico. He started his work with the progesterone and related hormones

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.840
 in 1968. He goes back. If you'd like to be on the show, email wise, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.240
 Our 800 thing is not functioning today because of a long story, but we're working on that

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.160
 to get that fixed. Just use the email this morning, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:59.000
 You mentioned the pigs. I often thought about how they do these various testing on animals,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.320
 I guess rats, I guess that they use mice for doing all these different testing. Dr. Peat,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.640
 is that viable to do something on a mouse or a rat and say, "Well, then that's the

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.080
 way it is for humans too"?

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:23.440
 One great difference between mice and rats is that they are mainly nocturnal animals.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:32.560
 If the experimenter is working in the lab in the daytime and they keep the rat or mouse

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:41.280
 awake to do their experiments, they're creating intense stress in the animal. So the experimenter

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:49.000
 to do something analogous to what happens in a human has to stay up all night to work

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.720
 with the nocturnal animals and they don't do that. So automatically you have to question

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:07.520
 what time of day they were doing their experiments. Very often if someone is selling a product,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:15.440
 they'll try out very different animals so they can get the kind of results they want.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:24.440
 In the 1960s and early 70s, the estrogen industry was testing their products on dogs and they

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:39.720
 found that estrogen would damage the dog's bones. But by using a species that lives oppositely

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.240
 in the nighttime rather than daytime, they found that estrogen would strengthen the bones

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:55.240
 of mice and rats. But it happens that cortisol, which weakens dogs' and humans' bones,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:03.080
 cortisol stimulates the growth of bones in these nocturnal animals. So what they're

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.800
 doing is choosing the animal that is specific to get the kind of result they want.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.760
 And I've often thought of the idea with the mice and the rat, these little guys are

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:23.200
 probably surrounded by a huge amount of electromagnetic fields with who knows what kind of lights,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.520
 all these weird lights that are not good for you, and then who knows what they're feeding

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.720
 them to. So that would, to me, would put a fly in the ointment of results and how accurate

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.720
 they are.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:43.440
 - [Dr. Reagan] Yeah, and they commonly use a very standardized controlled diet. There

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:54.200
 are prejudices built into what they call the standard diet. Often they'll put in 6% of

00:08:54.200 --> 00:09:03.600
 so-called essential fatty acid, which isn't all essential. When someone experiments leaving

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:10.880
 out those essential fatty acids, they get super rats or super mice, very resistant to

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:25.120
 poisons, trauma, shock, venoms, aging diseases, very resistant to diabetes, all kinds of biological

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:33.720
 damage is less in the animals that are deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids. But

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:42.880
 since they build those fats into the diet, then when they compare an experimental diet

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:50.600
 to the standard diet, they're already biasing the experiment. They're making sick animals

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:57.800
 as their reference, and then if they're less sick when they change the diet, they say that

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.400
 means their recommended additive is beneficial.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.520
 - [Dr. Sinclair] I wonder who came up with the term essential fatty acids.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:24.080
 - [Dr. Reagan] That was Burr, I forget his first name, he and his wife, around the late

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:32.800
 1920s and early 1930s, got the idea that maybe fats were like a vitamin, even though two

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:40.360
 or three research groups at big universities had demonstrated that you could have a totally

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:48.520
 fat-free diet and the animals actually lived longer. I think Osburn was the name of one

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:59.200
 of the research groups. But the Burrs got this idea and created a fat-free diet, but

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.640
 at that time, the B vitamins, most of the B vitamins hadn't been discovered, and they

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:14.480
 were feeding a diet deficient in the unsaturated fats, but also deficient in several of the

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:23.240
 B vitamins. They said they had created a deficiency disease in which the animals got sore tails

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:35.960
 and areas of their face around their mouth got rashy and cracked. They said this is the

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:46.520
 fatty acid deficiency symptom. But 15 years later, Texas Research Institute, one of the

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:55.440
 universities there, demonstrated they discovered vitamin B6 and some of the other B vitamins

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:02.640
 and they created the Burr essential fatty acid deficient animals and then gave them

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:13.560
 only vitamin B6 in addition, no fat, and cured the deficiency symptom. So they, in 1945 or

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.240
 '46, proved that there was no essential fatty acid.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:30.040
 But meanwhile, the petroleum industry was working on how to make plastics and paint,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:40.560
 the synthetic plastics were being engineered at the same time. And the seed oils like linseed

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:50.080
 oil had been the bulk of plastics and paints up until that time, but petroleum chemistry

00:12:50.080 --> 00:13:00.720
 replaced the seed oils. So there was no longer a paint and plastics market for linseed oil

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:08.200
 and cotton seed oil and so on. So they had to figure out some way to dispose of their

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:17.480
 product. The crop was being grown, but no one needed it for paint. So they decided to

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:26.360
 sell it to the public as a food. The same thing happened in the '60s and '70s with

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:35.000
 fish oil. Fish oil had been primarily used as varnish or fuel, lamp fuel, but it made

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:46.200
 a good varnish because it hardens on exposure to oxygen the way linseed oil does. But the

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:52.080
 fish processing factories were throwing away the skin and the fatty parts when they were

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.320
 canning salmon or other fish, and they were causing horrible pollution of the bay areas

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:07.080
 and land areas adjacent to the factories. The EPA told them they had to figure out something

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:13.880
 to do with their waste material to reduce the pollution, and fish oil as a health food

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.480
 came on the market.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.520
 That's great. Let's just give it to the people. They'll eat it.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.960
 Yeah. I've suggested that that might be the way to dispose of used tires.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:34.800
 Yeah, that's right. Make some kind of food out of it. But I've often kind of conjectured

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.840
 that, wasn't fish oil, though, used early on, like 1800s and 1900s too? Isn't there

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.840
 some records of that?

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:52.560
 Yeah. For hundreds of years, it was known to make a good varnish, and whale oil was

00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:03.840
 a liquid that was good for lamp oil. It was a major fuel oil for a couple of hundred years.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.680
 But I've often heard that parents gave their kids cod liver oil, like in 1900 and stuff

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.680
 around there.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.480
 Oh, yeah. I got some when I was a kid.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:19.400
 Okay. So it wasn't that it wasn't consumed internally, you're saying, in the '60s, so

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.360
 when it really busted out, right? When it really, yeah, market.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.800
 That was only the liver oil, and it's very different from the regular fish oil. Fish

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:36.240
 oil has, what they're selling now, isn't from the liver, and so it has practically

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:44.640
 no vitamin value, very small contamination with vitamin D and vitamin A, but not enough

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.520
 to be therapeutic like the liver oil.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.000
 So cod liver oil is different from fish oil?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.640
 Oh, tremendously different, yeah.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.160
 Is cod liver oil then healthy?

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:05.240
 If you don't have other sources of vitamin A and vitamin D, if you live in Norway, for

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.560
 example, that's where it got started. The winters are so dark, people found that they

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:19.040
 benefited, and if they didn't like the taste of the fish liver, they could maybe stand

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.240
 the taste of the liver oil.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:27.360
 I see. But we can get plenty of A in our food and D in the sun, right?

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:34.320
 Yeah. Eggs are a good source of vitamin A, and getting sunlight is the best way to get

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.320
 your D.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.240
 So you see no reason to do even cod liver oil?

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.720
 No, only in certain areas.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:50.760
 In certain areas, yeah. Ray Peat is with us, and Patrick Timpone, Ray at OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:57.400
 Good to have you here. Please stick around. We have some good emails coming in for Dr.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.280
 Peat. If you have one, Patrick at OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:07.680
 Dr. Richard Ulrey, authority on minerals, talks about gut bacteria, making the vitamins,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.400
 and absorbing the minerals, how it all works.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:16.080
 We need vitamins from our gut bacteria so we can absorb minerals, and then minerals

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.320
 provide a resonant frequency. And those minerals carry these frequencies into the body, and

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:28.360
 multiple minerals will give you a frequency that allows all of our proteins to have individual

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.920
 distinct frequencies, giving that three-dimensional structure.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.840
 This is where Wayne's products, Living Stream, and that's the only primary products I carry.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.760
 When you do a stool test and it says you don't have any bifalbacteria, well if you don't

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.440
 have any bifalbacteria, you're not going to absorb certain minerals. If you don't have

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.880
 any lactobacillus, you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.640
 Here's an idea of a couple of the Living Streams you can take for what we're talking about

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:01.320
 here. The bifido, Living Streams Multi-Blend, and the living minerals. So again, the minerals,

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.240
 the bifido, and the lactobacillus. And these special probiotics and minerals are all in

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.200
 human DNA form, and they are living, alive.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:21.000
 In our store on oneradionetwork.com. These are creation of Wayne Blakely. Wayne has literally

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.120
 moved to Missouri and he's working with a huge piggy manufacturer, he's speaking to

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:34.200
 pigs with Dr. Peat, because he believes that with these probiotics properly given to the

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.400
 pigs, he can stop all of this weird virus, bacteria, I don't know what they're calling

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.000
 it, they've got all kinds of names for it around the world with the pigs. China has

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.080
 huge issues and the pigs are just getting really sick and their babies are coming out

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.960
 and they're being born dead. So he really thinks that with the right gut terrain in

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.040
 the pigs that he can help these people and not lose all these pigs. So it's a big deal

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.680
 and it's going to be a big experiment and we're going to keep tabs on them. But he's

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.680
 a very smart guy making these products and I think you'll enjoy trying some. They're

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.840
 in our store on oneradionetwork.com.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.880
 Starving for vitality, we're turning to energy drinks, stimulants, and pharmaceuticals to

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.120
 try to improve our focus, increase our metabolism, rescue our sex drive, and adapt to the stresses

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:36.960
 of modern day living.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.120
 Each year an elk sheds its impressive antlers, regenerating an even larger set the following

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.920
 year. These velvet antlers have been a revered traditional medicine for thousands of years.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.120
 Our elk antler harnesses the adaptogenic and highly regenerative growth factors from this

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:58.480
 natural and ethical resource into a concentrated, bioavailable extraction. Its revitalizing

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:04.200
 effects span bone, muscle, and nerve support, improve metabolism, cellular repair, sexual

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:10.080
 potency, anti-inflammation, vascular strengthening, and hormone production. Humanely harvested

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:15.800
 from free range US elk, extracted in organic alcohol, and protected in muron glass, our

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.640
 elk antler is available in three strengths to restore your vitality at any level.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:27.400
 That's Daniel Vitalis Sir Thrival, elk velvet antler. Team up with a little pine pollen,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:34.720
 you're going to have a lot of good things happen in your testosterone department, guys.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.920
 Ladies too, a lot of the ladies seem to do well with both of these, especially going

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:46.080
 through pre-menopause, perimenopause, and all that stuff. Any Sir Thrival link, you

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.120
 can check it out. Two of Ken Roller's really fun products are the Scalar Energy Device,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.840
 the Rest Shield, it's a golden pyramid. You can buy one of these guys through our website

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:03.760
 and put that right there as close as you can to your bed. They go at about 20 feet or so,

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:10.440
 and that helps to reorganize a bit. They do a good job with the cell phone towers if you

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.040
 got one coming in your home, and there's cell phones there all over the place. It's

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:21.600
 a nice investment. Also, there's some real science behind structuring water and having

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:28.120
 it become more hydrating. He has a water structuring device called the Vitaliser Plus, the same

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.640
 page when you click on the golden pyramid. You can put in your probes and other minerals

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.400
 right in there and then structure them all up there, and then give this to your dogs

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:44.160
 and cats too, the same water. It just makes them more available and they'll get dehydrated.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.480
 You can see the Scalar Energy Device, golden pyramid, right on the front page of our website.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:59.280
 We talked with Dr. Ray Peat on OneRadioNetwork.com. It's Dr. Ray Peat. It's RayPeat.com. He's

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.240
 got a place there you can sign up for his newsletter. It's a very affordable thing.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.600
 How much is your newsletter again? It's $28 by email.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.120
 $28 for a year, right? Yeah.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.160
 Cool. Cool. No, it's 12 issues, but it's two years.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:25.520
 Oh, 12 issues for $28. Wow. That's a good thing. Cool. Good job with that one. Patrick

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.280
 at OneRadioNetwork.com talking about water. What's your take on water? I don't know

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.800
 if we've ever talked to you about water. Of course, we have the Batman Gellich idea

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:42.620
 of one-half ounce of body weight for every pound. Talk a little bit about what your research

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:49.480
 shows and dehydration and keeping enough water in there.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:58.160
 Salt is one of the important factors in keeping us hydrated. In the '50s, the drug companies

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:06.080
 came out with diuretic pills, new chemicals to make you lose water, and they sold them

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:16.960
 to pregnant women to prevent water retention. It turns out that that's a very bad idea because

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.040
 during pregnancy, you have to retain water in your bloodstream, expand your blood volume

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:33.360
 tremendously so it can take care of the growing fetus as well as some other circulation. Whole

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:41.920
 new systems of blood vessels have to be supported, so you need more blood volume. To do that,

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:52.880
 what retains the water in the bloodstream is largely the protein albumin, but the albumin

00:23:52.880 --> 00:24:01.880
 doesn't retain water unless there is an associated sort of a cloud of sodium atoms associated

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:12.880
 with the negative charges on the albumin protein. The combination of sodium albumin retains

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:23.160
 water right within this system of atoms and molecules. If you don't have enough sodium,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:32.600
 if you take a diuretic that makes you lose sodium, the water that goes with the sodium

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:43.600
 does not just reduce the blood volume, but it reduces the ability of the albumin to pull

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:52.000
 water to keep water from going out into your tissues. So the albumin, instead of pulling

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.960
 water out of your tissues into the bloodstream, the albumin itself goes out of the blood vessels

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:10.000
 into your tissues, creating a kind of edema and swelling that isn't the typical pitting

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:21.200
 edema. It's a very firm resembling mixed edema of hypothyroidism, but it's simply caused

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:29.520
 by the lack of sodium, which is needed to keep water in the proper compartments. So

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:39.000
 without sodium, you dehydrate your circulatory system, but waterlog the functioning tissues

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.760
 so they don't work very well. So it's putting the water in the wrong place. In experiments,

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:53.560
 two different groups gave women with toxemia of pregnancy great water retention and high

00:25:53.560 --> 00:26:01.360
 blood pressure. They gave them extra salt instead of diuretics to make them lose salt.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.520
 And with this supplement, in one case, I think it was six grams a day. In the other group,

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:15.160
 they gave them 20 or 21 grams a day of extra salt. In both cases, their blood pressure

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:22.880
 quickly came down to normal and their toxemia was cured just by getting that considerably

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.760
 big dose of daily salt.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:31.280
 So the edema, puffiness around the ankles or lower legs, and I think, like you said,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:39.160
 there's two different kinds. The kind that you press in and it keeps that little indentation

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.200
 in there, and then there's some. What's the difference between those two?

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:55.040
 If you have protein leaked out of your blood vessels among the tissue cells, that protein

00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:04.600
 is slow to move under pressure. And if it's from the salt deficiency causing leakage of

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:17.360
 albumin or if it's from hypothyroidism causing accumulation of sugar-containing protein,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:26.640
 either of those makes the water stick around your tissue cells and it doesn't get easily

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:34.960
 pushed back into your blood vessels under pressure. So it tends to stay once it gets

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:42.040
 into your feet, for example, by gravity. Then it doesn't all come out during the night.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:51.120
 A simple edema will correct itself during the night just because the pressure is less

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:58.600
 extreme. But when you stand up, if you don't have enough sodium and albumin, your blood

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:09.360
 loses water into your lower extremities and they swell up.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.480
 So people that they get the puffy ankles, they could actually just try taking more salt

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.400
 and seeing if that doesn't clear it?

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:24.040
 Yeah. You want to make sure your protein intake is adequate. And when you increase your protein,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:33.840
 you want to make sure that you're not overloading on phosphate. Phosphate is now being recognized

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:43.520
 as a kidney toxin in kidney failure. Just too much phosphate is one of the most toxic

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:53.320
 things that damages the kidneys. So if you're going to increase your protein, use forms

00:28:53.320 --> 00:29:02.720
 that are not overloaded with phosphate. Meat, fish, and seed proteins are the highest in

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:08.400
 phosphate. Leaves and milk and cheese are the lowest in phosphate.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:13.720
 So you can get over phosphate if you're doing too much meat.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:24.520
 Yeah, definitely. Pure meat eaters eventually, like the Eskimos, when they were on a largely

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:34.400
 meat-eating diet, they aged quickly beyond the age of 40 and their bones had 10 or 15%

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:42.280
 less mass than people in the same region who were not eating a pure meat diet.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.520
 Here's an email. This is a good one. Eric, he wants to build more muscle. Who doesn't?

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:54.600
 What are some foods that we can eat to help muscle building? That's a good question.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:01.600
 Protein is an essential thing, but you have to make sure, again, that it is not excessive

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:12.440
 in phosphate and that it has the B vitamins, vitamin D. Vitamin A is essential for making

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:19.960
 protein, but you don't want to get too much carotene. Carotene turns off your metabolism,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:27.400
 blocks your testosterone production, for example. So you want natural animal vitamin A, such

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:34.160
 as you get in eggs and liver. And not too much of that either, because that also is

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:43.280
 toxic to your thyroid. But it's needed for making muscle protein, other proteins, and

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.880
 the steroid hormones, progesterone and testosterone.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:55.280
 We had a fellow on the other day who's a weightlifter kind of guy and talking about hormones and

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.600
 said that guys could do safely a little bit of progesterone from the wild, yam, you know,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.080
 on your little dab of it. Do you agree with that?

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:16.080
 Oh yeah. If you take the amount a woman would use to replace after menopause, that's about

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:25.800
 30 milligrams a day, that can antagonize a man's testosterone and create a momentary

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:32.680
 testosterone deficiency. But if you take 5 or 10 milligrams, that's more in the range

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:40.160
 that's normal for a man and it can actually, by reducing estrogen production in a man,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:48.240
 it can make the testosterone effect much more potent. Both testosterone and progesterone

00:31:48.240 --> 00:32:00.060
 are capable of reducing the synthesis of estrogen, but testosterone can be converted into estrogen.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:07.760
 If you don't have the progesterone and thyroid hormone, then you're liable to convert your

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:14.360
 testosterone into estrogen and lose the masculinizing effect of the testosterone.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:19.920
 So that's why he was saying just a little bit will do you. He didn't give a formula,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.800
 but you say about 5 to 10 grams if the guys are going to try.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800
 Milligrams.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.880
 Milligrams, yeah, sorry. 5 to 10 milligrams of a little bit of progesterone cream. And

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.920
 it comes from wild yams, just from yammies.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:41.840
 Yeah. Well, it can be made from several different plant steroids. I don't think the majority

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:46.560
 is now being made from yams. I think it's cheaper from soybeans.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.280
 Yeah, you don't want to do that, right?

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:58.600
 Well, yeah, because it's cheap and it's all refined so that you can't tell what plant

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:06.320
 it came from. It's chemically so purified that there's no difference between whether

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:18.160
 it comes from a ginger, I think, is one of the plants, and soy and yam. But the bulk

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.760
 is now made from soy, but it's all just as good.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:30.760
 Are beans estrogenic where you want to not do too many of those?

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760
 Beans?

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.760
 Yeah, beans.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:46.000
 Yeah, that type of plant. Many years ago, they found that sheep would miscarry if they

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:58.640
 grazed on leguminous plants, clover, alfalfa, beans, and peas. All in the plant do have

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.160
 estrogens that are enough to act as a birth control pill for animals that are sensitive,

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:15.660
 such as sheep. But in the bean itself, there are other toxins designed by the plant to

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:23.840
 make them indigestible. So people have developed technologies for cooking them properly. If

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:33.600
 you soak them for a day, any grain, if it soaks at room temperature long enough to start

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:44.480
 the sprouting enzymes, those enzymes work similarly to the cow's rumen, activate detoxifying

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:55.400
 processes to grow. The plant has to reduce its own toxins and convert them into growth

00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:05.720
 proteins. So soaking a bean detoxifies it quite a bit. Then very long cooking until

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:11.200
 it softens further reduces the toxicity of it.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.800
 So there's ways to do the beans and the grains where they're digestible.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:27.740
 Yeah, but they're still a very low-grade protein compared to leaf protein. The quality

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:38.280
 of the protein in leaf is similar to milk or about 70% as perfect as egg yolk protein.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:46.480
 The leaves in milk are similarly high quality. Muscle meat is a little lower quality by most

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:56.200
 definitions, but the bean and grain protein, most of them are way down on the scale of

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:05.920
 5% to 10% in quality, meaning that for good muscle building, they function as nothing

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.560
 more than energy. Might as well eat sugar as beans.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:15.040
 Might as well eat sugar. What about, these days you can get some pretty good, very good

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:22.000
 quality grass-fed whey protein. Do you think that's a reasonable food? Powder?

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:32.320
 The whey isn't quite as nutritionally balanced and safe as the casein. You separate the milk,

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:39.000
 you get different qualities in the different proteins. But yeah, the whey is good quality

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:46.280
 protein, but for many purposes, casein is better, the solid part that goes into cheese.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:52.840
 Oh, you mean overall, but you don't think it's a negative thing, a good quality whey

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.320
 protein for people?

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:59.840
 No, it's a good protein. Compared to beans, it's extremely good.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:04.240
 Yeah. Do you have to, to do the whey proteins, do they have to ferment this at all or do

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.760
 they just separate it out?

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:11.920
 There are different ways of separating it. I think a lot of it now is done with an acid

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:18.800
 treatment rather than having bacteria make the acid. I think they just add an acid to

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.600
 cause the curdling and separation.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:26.560
 Yeah, you want to be careful and warn which ones you get. Does Dr. Peat have any insights

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:32.240
 on leg vascular insufficiency or lipodymia? Oh, we were kind of talking about, thank you

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:38.640
 both for making these shows available. You're welcome. So did we cover the leg vascular

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:45.520
 insufficiency and lipodymia or not? Or is it different from what we were talking about

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.400
 20 minutes ago? The edema.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:38:02.280
 In the legs in particular? Well, having swelling of the legs and feet, the pressure from the

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:10.160
 tissue outside the blood vessels, that simply pushes on the blood vessels and makes it very

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:19.320
 hard for the blood to get through. Just like if you put your hand into a pressure chamber

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:34.080
 and applied pressure, when the pressure equaled 150 millimeters of mercury, for example, your

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.720
 blood pressure wouldn't be sufficient to push the blood through the vessels. And the same

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:47.000
 thing happens when you get swollen tissues around your blood vessels, the swelling pressure

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.800
 can reach the point that the blood can't get through. So it isn't just a matter of what's

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:02.480
 happening inside the blood vessels. But if you have extremely high fats in your blood,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:14.120
 that does increase the viscosity. If your albumin, it's a very small protein, but interestingly,

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:22.280
 having high albumin increases the fluidity of your blood. Other proteins like fibrinogen

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:36.360
 make your blood thicker. So fat and fibrinogen are viscosity increasers. Albumin and salt

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:47.440
 make your blood literally more fluid. You can correct the fibrinogen and fat content

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:55.920
 by lowering your stress basically. And that includes things like not having an excess

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:04.480
 of phosphate in your diet, making sure your thyroid function and vitamin D levels are

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:13.000
 good. Those are the three most neglected anti-stress factors in our culture.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:23.600
 The three again are the low thyroid, low vitamin D, and excess of phosphate. And those guys

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:32.560
 come from the ones before you said, the meat, too much meat, fish.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:39.320
 And beans and grains are also excessive in phosphate.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:48.360
 Corey Peat is with us, Patrick Timponi, OneRadioNetwork.com. Here is Kevin. He did a PSA test with his

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:55.560
 doc and the doc said it's high. And can Dr. Peat give us his opinion on this whole

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:01.040
 PSA testing? Is it viable? And what do I do now? Because he doesn't want to take any

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.820
 drugs.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:12.120
 In the 1980s, they were looking for ways to diagnose prostate cancer and they decided

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:21.740
 that this particular antigen was a sign that something was wrong with the prostate. Actually,

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:31.680
 this particular protein is a defensive reaction to some kind of irritation or problem. It

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:42.180
 happens that cancer does lead to an increase of this protein, but it's a defensive reaction.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:50.260
 A company several years ago was planning to develop this as a product to sell to treat

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:59.260
 prostate cancer because in itself, it has an anti-cancer protective effect. But anyway,

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:05.740
 the main drift of the industry was to use it to diagnose prostate cancer. So it came

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:18.140
 on the market, I think, around 1991. And in the next two or three years, there was approximately

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:33.120
 a 50% increase in the deaths from prostate cancer. And that is a general effect of diagnosis.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:44.500
 If you're using a treatment that produces some degree of mortality in the process of

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:54.220
 curing the disease, if you suddenly start treating many, many more people, the death

00:42:54.220 --> 00:43:00.060
 rate is going to increase. That's what happened. A tremendous surge in the deaths from prostate

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:12.380
 cancer in the early 1990s. In the later 90s, a journalist went to a convention of prostate

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:19.680
 specialists and asked these men who specialized in treating prostate cancer, what would they

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:28.160
 do if they discovered they had prostate cancer? Almost all of them said they would do nothing.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:35.420
 They were giving estrogen treatment and surgery to their patients, but they knew that they

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:41.820
 were not curing prostate cancer. So they said if they had it, they would not treat the prostate

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:53.700
 cancer. And around the beginning of this century, that became public, and the idea spread, watchful

00:43:53.700 --> 00:44:01.260
 waiting after the diagnosis. In other words, not treating, not using estrogen and surgery

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:10.740
 just because you have prostate cancer. And so then the mortality rate dropped. It's okay

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.340
 to diagnose it if you don't treat it.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:20.820
 Yeah, it's interesting. What's the connection between pumpkin seeds, zinc, and prostate

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:25.860
 that's been touted to be a good thing to help the guys keep Mr. Prostate strong? Something

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.460
 to that?

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:37.460
 Usually people eat their pumpkin seeds well salted, and I think increasing salt for many

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:46.220
 people is an extremely beneficial thing. Years ago, when I read about the effects of pregnant

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:53.380
 women curing their toxemia by eating a lot of extra salt, I knew a lot of women who had

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:59.660
 premenstrual syndrome, and they would have swelling for a couple of weeks. They would

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:07.020
 swell up and get irritable, and they would crave salt. But they all said that they knew

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:13.060
 salt would cause water retention. So even though they craved it tremendously premenstrually,

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.540
 they decided that they shouldn't eat it, but still they swelled up. And I told them about

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:26.260
 the pregnant women and said, "Why not eat the salt that you crave?" And the very first

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:34.580
 cycle that they simply ate as much salt as they craved, and they didn't swell up. Over

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:42.100
 several years, I saw that happen over and over. If they followed their tastes, their

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:50.260
 premenstrual symptoms were tremendously reduced. So I knew some old people who were told to

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:58.620
 restrict their salt. Invariably, they developed insomnia when they stopped eating the salt

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:07.260
 that they craved, and their blood pressure was not cured. I told some of my friends about

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:14.380
 the experience of the women with PMS and the pregnant women, and a couple of my old friends

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:23.780
 tried disobeying their doctors and salting their food as their taste indicated, and their

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.340
 insomnia was cured.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:30.820
 Very interesting. So this craving, and I know personally, I do, and I know other people

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:37.180
 that crave salt, is it generally we really need it because we kind of crave it? We want

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:41.820
 a little bit more on this particular food? And how would we know if we're getting just

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.660
 too much and we're kind of, the craving has turned into a, I don't know, just some kind

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:51.420
 of habit or some kind of a, you know, something that's out of balance?

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:58.060
 Generally people's thyroid function decreases with aging or with stress. And when your thyroid

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:06.900
 is low, you don't retain salt properly. You lose salt in your urine very easily when your

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:17.460
 thyroid is low. And when you lose the sodium, your aldosterone increases. Aldosterone causes

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:24.780
 increased blood pressure, and over time it causes fibrosis and degeneration of the blood

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:32.980
 vessels and heart. So low thyroid leads to these heart disease conditions, largely because

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:38.260
 of the salt loss causing aldosterone to increase.

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:45.260
 When I worked in the woods, we had a cook who was a fanatic. He knew people lost salt

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:51.620
 when they sweated, so he would put a tablespoon of salt in our morning porridge, and he wouldn't

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:57.500
 give us our ham and eggs if we didn't eat our porridge. And so everyone would gag down

00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:05.300
 the salt. And then they gave us a bottle of salt pills to take because we would sweat.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:14.700
 I would get white salt crystals on my eyebrows and arm hairs. The body adapts by lowering

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:23.980
 the aldosterone so that the salt is lost easily, and it even comes out abundantly in your sweat.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:31.420
 But then you lose the salt in just a few hours, and so you need the salt pills to prevent

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:38.180
 fainting. After a week of that, having to eat salt pills in the afternoon after having

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:46.820
 a tablespoon for breakfast, I got the idea that the body was adjusting. So I told the

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:53.420
 cook over the weekend that I had seen a doctor who told me to go on a low-salt diet. So from

00:48:53.420 --> 00:49:01.420
 then on, I got porridge without the toxic dose of salt. And immediately that week, I

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:12.340
 stopped sweating crystal and salt. So that was my first endocrine experiment on myself.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:20.420
 The adrenals adjust very quickly. But the background to that is that aging lowers your

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:30.100
 thyroid function, and your thyroid deficiency causes you to lose sodium. So the craving

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:39.620
 in most people is a very biological thing. But you could correct it by correcting your

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:45.060
 thyroid function, which makes you retain salt efficiently so you don't need to eat so

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.060
 much.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:51.500
 So people like myself and others who do a lot of saunas, I do a sauna almost every day

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.980
 and I sweat a lot. That would be another reason why I would crave the salt, if I'm losing

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:56.980
 it through my sweat.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.980
 Yeah.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.980
 Right?

00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.980
 Yeah.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:05.980
 So when you sweat like that in saunas, is it the salt you really need? People talk about

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:11.860
 electrolytes. What's the difference between salts and electrolytes?

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:24.140
 The main electrolytes are salt and the minor ones, potassium, magnesium, calcium. The main

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:35.060
 one in the blood is sodium and a moderate amount of calcium and potassium and magnesium.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:42.860
 But sodium is the one that is most often correctable.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:50.220
 But you can take electrolytes or things, right, extra if you need to.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:59.660
 Yeah. It's good to have a generous amount of all of them. If they're pure, they regulate

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:11.700
 themselves so you can eat a huge amount of extra calcium, magnesium and potassium. If

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:18.540
 you took a lot of potassium all at once, it could stop your heart and too much magnesium

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:25.860
 can make you unconscious. It has been used intravenously as an anesthetic. But when you

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:35.540
 take them orally, your body adjusts them so it isn't a matter of having the right proportion

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.060
 going in. Your body can do the sorting.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:43.820
 Do you know that little, that company, what is it, the Electro-Mix, you know, the little

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:48.220
 emergency, you know, those little packages. Do you think those are reasonable? Do you

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:54.380
 know that product? I think they call it Electro-Mix, the electrolytes. Do you know those?

00:51:54.380 --> 00:52:02.260
 Those are all basically beneficial if they aren't contaminated somewhere along the line.

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.820
 Who knows about that, right?

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:10.620
 This is from a fellow in Switzerland. Oh, hi there in Switzerland. What laboratory test

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.980
 would Dr. Peat advise for a good health assessment? Would the following markers be a reasonable

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:24.540
 choice for a middle-aged man to do the TSH, T3, T4, prolactin, DHEA, testosterone, cortisol?

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:31.140
 So he's asking about all these different tests for vitamin A, vitamin D. Talk a bit about

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:34.300
 people can do blood tests, some of the key things that they might want to do to help

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.380
 this fellow and others.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:50.380
 Doctors are often reluctant to follow the patient's interests, giving DHEA, even TSH,

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:57.700
 they're sometimes reluctant to do often enough. Vitamin D should be done pretty regularly

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:08.140
 if you live in a northern or temperate climate where you don't get sun all year round. There

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:20.700
 are some tests that are very rarely done routinely. Free fatty acids are extremely important.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:30.100
 Stress will increase the free fatty acids. The most common tests that people benefit

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:40.340
 from are the ones you mentioned, progesterone, DHEA, pregnenolone, testosterone, TSH and

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:47.820
 the thyroid hormones. Prolactin is a pretty good indicator of stress and imbalance when

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.820
 it rises.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:56.100
 And then of course you got the fibrogen in the A1c, the kind of classics, those are good

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:00.300
 markers of potential problems?

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:05.540
 Lactic acid in the blood is another thing that should be done more often because a lot

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:13.660
 of people, because of stress or hypothyroidism or nutritional imbalance, will chronically

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:24.340
 have more lactic, even though it isn't recognized as acidosis, a rise in lactic acid is a good

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:27.500
 indicator of something going wrong in your body.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:31.500
 So the ones you mentioned that are good to know, free fatty acids, prolactin, lactic

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:36.980
 acids, what are some of the other ones that you said?

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:50.060
 Well, the balance of calcium and phosphate will show up if you test the parathyroid hormone.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:58.180
 That is reflecting your status of phosphate, calcium and vitamin D.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.660
 And that's part of the thyroid panel?

00:55:01.660 --> 00:55:10.260
 No, it's rarely done, it's extremely relevant to your general health.

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:15.220
 Your heart health is powerfully influenced by parathyroid hormone.

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.140
 So you can actually test for that?

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.460
 Yeah.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:28.020
 Now, so would some of these generally ban if somebody has a really broad spectrum test

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:33.260
 done, we have a fellow that we're working with, he does a 52 marker test, Dr. Lewis,

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.260
 52.

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.340
 Would they be in, or would you have to ask the special generally, the ones that you mentioned,

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:43.340
 parathyroid, lactic acid, prolactin, or these would be special requests and add-ons?

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:53.900
 Yeah, unfortunately, some labs cost hugely for those specialized tests.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:56:01.060
 The Life Extension Foundation now has a deal with labs around the country and in the spring,

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:07.860
 they have extremely good prices on panels, hormone panels and some general panels.

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:15.500
 But I don't think they're yet doing some of the very important tests like lactic acid,

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.060
 free fatty acids and parathyroid hormone.

00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.060
 That's very interesting.

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:21.860
 Yeah, a little plug here for Dr. Lewis.

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:25.940
 We have an ad on the front page and you all can go on there free, take a little quiz.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:30.140
 Then if you want to connect up with him, he'll do a 52 marker.

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:36.300
 I think it's worth like 350 bucks plus an hour consultation to read and to interpret

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:40.860
 the labs and that's worth 350 right there to most docs.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.960
 So you might want to consider doing that.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.460
 And then, yeah, ask him about these.

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.500
 I've never heard of some of these parathyroid.

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.500
 Wow.

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.540
 The parathyroid hormone again, Dr. Peat?

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:55.420
 What does that tell us if we get that tested?

00:56:55.420 --> 00:57:04.260
 It is increased when you're deficient in calcium or vitamin D or have an excess of phosphate.

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:12.980
 And the parathyroid hormone happens to work closely with the aldosterone of the adrenals.

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:23.420
 So it responds to thyroid function and adrenal function and parathyroid hormone like aldosterone

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:30.180
 poisons the function of your mitochondria all through your system.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:37.700
 The mitochondrial respiration falls as your parathyroid hormone and aldosterone rise.

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:38.700
 Something happened to your phone.

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.460
 It seems like it lost a little volume and clicked on there.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.460
 Nothing?

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:44.460
 Yes.

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.460
 Oh, there you go.

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.460
 You hear that?

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:48.460
 There was an echo in the profile.

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.460
 Okay, there we go.

00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:50.460
 What is Dr. Peat?

00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:56.220
 Here's another email for Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpani, oneradionetwork.com, May 21st.

00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:00.420
 James Corbett will be here tomorrow for Tinfoil Hat Wednesday.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:01.420
 He's out of Japan.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:02.420
 He's really a trip.

00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:03.940
 You'll enjoy hearing some of the things.

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:07.820
 We'll talk about all the geopolitics in the world and some of the more spooky things going

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:10.740
 on with Tinfoil Hat Wednesday tomorrow.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:15.820
 Does Dr. Peat think there's anything to this more and more people talking about vitamin

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.740
 A toxicity?

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:21.860
 Seems to be a new thing that people are kind of clamoring about.

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:26.300
 Anything here we need to look at in your opinion?

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:38.300
 In 1973 and '74, the drug companies were coming out with synthetic vitamin A products.

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:45.940
 They found professors around the country to tell stories.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:54.060
 One at, I think it was University of Oregon or Washington, put out the story that she

00:58:54.060 --> 00:59:01.620
 had seen patients go blind from taking vitamin A. There were several professors with stories

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:09.980
 like that coordinated apparently through the advertising departments of the pharmaceutical

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:15.180
 companies selling synthetic vitamin A. I contacted these professors.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:18.700
 They wouldn't talk to me.

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:27.740
 It was obviously just made up stories to make people fear vitamin A. One of the popular

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:36.300
 stories is about some explorers who ate polar bear liver and their skin fell off in the

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:40.100
 following days.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:45.300
 There are lots of toxic things that a polar bear's liver might contain.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:51.820
 But they chose to blame it on vitamin A. In animal experiments, huge doses that would

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:59.100
 be greater than you could get from polar bear liver never produce symptoms similar to what

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.540
 the polar bear liver supposedly caused.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:10.300
 So there's a history of trying to create panic.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.900
 That's going on with vitamin E.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:18.860
 People are saying vitamin E causes heart disease and cancer.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:25.620
 They have products to sell that might cost $1,000 or $10,000 a month.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:30.060
 They don't want people taking something that costs a dollar a month.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.900
 I wonder what polar bears could eat that might make the livers toxic.

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.820
 I mean, it's pretty pristine up there, right?

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.820
 No pollution and just fish?

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:46.380
 Yeah, but if there's, for example, an algae bloom that fish have concentrated, the polar

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:55.940
 bear will eat either the fish or seals that have poisoned themselves eating fish that

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.700
 have eaten algae.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:06.980
 The algae toxins are a very good candidate for what got blamed on vitamin A.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:13.020
 Boy, there's so much stuff in Dr. Peat that if you really dig into the history, like anything

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:16.540
 on planet Earth, it's different from what we've been told.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.220
 I mean, it's just amazing, isn't it?

01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:22.100
 Yeah, experiments with baby chicks.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:29.340
 I think they were giving them something like a million units of vitamin A, which caused

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.940
 brain deformity.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:38.280
 Their brain stuck out of their cranium as they developed.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:45.860
 But if they gave them a moderate amount of vitamin E, the vitamin A was no longer toxic.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:53.620
 So what was happening was at a certain very high level, vitamin A auto-catalyzes.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:58.940
 It stimulates its own oxidation and degradation.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:06.500
 And the symptoms of vitamin A poisoning become similar to vitamin A deficiency.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:12.620
 And both of those are prevented by adding vitamin E, which prevents the breakdown.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:15.780
 Here's an email for you.

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:22.980
 What does Dr. Peat think about reducing endotoxins from gut bacteria by using things like garlic,

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:31.060
 ginger, cloves, black cumin seeds, and things like that?

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.420
 They have their own allergens, so you have to be careful.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:42.060
 They do somewhat suppress bacterial growth, but you have to watch that you aren't adding

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:47.900
 some of these seed-defensive toxins or allergens in the process.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.940
 I think it's safest to use certain fibrous foods.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:03:05.180
 For some people, a clean, rinsed bran from wheat or oats is a safe way to stimulate your

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.940
 intestine to reduce the endotoxin production.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:22.020
 A cooked mushroom or bamboo shoot, these organisms have antibacterial chemicals built into the

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:29.980
 organism so that they will not only act as a fiber and a bulker, but they will chemically

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.060
 reduce the bacterial population.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.100
 Raw carrot is another thing.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:44.180
 The carrot grows in a very microorganism-rich environment of fungus and bacteria, and raw

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.900
 carrot will powerfully reduce the endotoxin production.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.380
 That's why you like the carrot salads.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:54.340
 You like the grated carrots right at night.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:01.860
 And olive oil and vinegar are both bactericidal, so a good dressing, oil and vinegar with some

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:08.100
 salt makes the carrot more effective and tasty.

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:13.900
 So bamboo shoots, the only thing I've ever seen there in oil in restaurants are the bamboo

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.380
 shoots you get in a can.

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.380
 That's not what we're talking about.

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:21.820
 Can you get really fun, good-backed bamboo shoots somewhere?

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:27.180
 Only in places like Chinatown in San Francisco or New York.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:36.700
 The canned ones, you can get a quart or two-quart can of cooked bamboo shoots, and I always

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:44.740
 boil them for a minute or two to eliminate any metal from the can.

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:51.980
 But then if you make a sauce, for example, cheese and egg sauce, they can be a very tasty

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980
 dish.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.220
 And they're good for you, these little bamboo shoots.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.580
 So here's an email from Adam Bergstrom.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:02.340
 You know Adam, he was on the show with us one time.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:08.460
 He says, "Accelerated lipofuscin accumulation and oxidative stress are definitely involved

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:10.340
 in autism.

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:17.340
 Does the oxidative stress cause the lipofuscin accumulation, or is it the other way around,

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:19.940
 in your opinion?"

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.620
 It's both.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:33.180
 When lipofuscin lowers the oxygen tension, it acts as a catalyst, taking fuel directly

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:37.860
 to oxygen and creating an oxygen deficiency.

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:47.620
 And that oxygen deficiency imitates what happens under stress or in the presence of estrogen.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:58.420
 The low oxygen creates the catalytic condition to further degrade any polyunsaturated fat

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.500
 that's in the environment.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.900
 And vitamin A can contribute to that.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:14.180
 An excess of vitamin A without E interacts with the fish oil or other unsaturated fat

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:19.020
 to lead to the accelerated production of lipofuscin.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:25.220
 Oh, so the E helps with lipofuscin if you're going to do some poofers or something.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.140
 Yeah, it's the main...

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:34.540
 That was one of the things that led to vitamin E research was discovering that it prevented

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:43.260
 lipofuscin and the brain toxic effects and testosterone suppressing effects and so on.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:49.460
 So, would your fave be then one of those like mixed tocopherol kind of vitamins?

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:53.580
 Yeah, I think the mixed product is the best.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:59.740
 Can Dr. Peat tell us how much or is sauerkraut really good to consume on a regular basis,

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.180
 good for gut health, sauerkraut?

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:07.380
 The salt in it is, I think, the main virtue.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.380
 Just the salt?

01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.380
 Yeah.

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.380
 How about the...

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:16.540
 The saltiness of it, it's okay, but I don't think it's a health food.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:22.340
 Would soaking wheat, I'll write an email, work for making healthier bread, soaking the

01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:23.340
 wheat?

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.340
 Definitely.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.340
 Yeah.

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.580
 I was a bread maker when I was in graduate school.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.580
 Oh, you were?

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.580
 Yeah.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:36.420
 And I experimented letting it soak for 12 to 24 hours.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:44.060
 And I found that ordinary bakery bread would cause gas, just a slice of it would disturb

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:51.700
 my sleep, but I could eat a whole loaf of my homemade bread with no digestive problem

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:52.700
 at all.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.700
 And what did you do?

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:54.700
 Was it a sourdough?

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:57.180
 You had no starter?

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.540
 It was just what came out of the air.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.280
 Yeah, I think, yeah.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.740
 Good luck getting the right kind of yeast out of the air.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:14.900
 But just the soaking activates enzymes and the actual protein value where wheat has extremely

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:20.860
 low value protein because of the storage gluten.

01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:28.420
 Gluten doesn't have great nutritional value, but when it soaks, the enzymes turn it into

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:38.100
 growth proteins and more than double the actual protein value so that you're getting actually

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.100
 some valuable protein in your bread when it's soaked properly.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:47.140
 And these days you can even get the original organic einkorn wheat, you know, the old stuff,

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.500
 the old heritage wheat.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.620
 You can actually get that now at Whole Foods.

01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:56.180
 A lady, a friend of mine out of Italy is producing that.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.900
 She taught farm.

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:06.340
 The protein quality of the older seeds sometimes is significantly higher than current.

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:08.500
 She found the seeds and talked some farmers into growing it.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.860
 It's called einkorn.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.540
 She had kids that were having a hard time with all the gluten, you know, the whole gluten

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.260
 sensitivity thing.

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.260
 They do fine.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.260
 She's a bedbreaker.

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.420
 So they do fine with this einkorn.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.420
 Very interesting.

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:27.180
 There must be something with this new wheat on all this gluten stuff, huh?

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.100
 Hybridization and all that?

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:35.420
 Yeah, it makes bread lighter.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:42.900
 If you're going to make bread in a factory quickly without leavening it the natural way,

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:52.740
 the gluten has a rubbery quality that makes it possible to inflate the loaf and have a

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.620
 rubbery texture.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:03.180
 When the grain is soaked so that it's nutritionally more valuable, it loses that rubbery quality

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:10.140
 and you get a denser moisture tending to crumble bread.

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.580
 So it isn't popular in the supermarkets.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:16.820
 A few more here and then we'll let you go to work.

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:22.380
 Does Dr. Peat think that there is a fungal connection to prostate cancer and/or breast

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:23.380
 cancer?

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:35.340
 Most tumors contain fungus just because the immune system is deranged and you'll find

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:39.820
 lots of junk contributing.

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:47.140
 The fungus produces estrogen, for example, but the cancer cells themselves are producing

01:10:47.140 --> 01:11:00.700
 estrogen stimulating their own growth and I think the risk, the seriousness of a cancer

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:07.500
 increases the likelihood of finding fungus in it.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:13.820
 There seems to be a lot going on with the prostate and the testing and they're doing

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:20.420
 it for the breast cancer too and hasn't the science shown that the more you mess around

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:27.620
 with these things, these lumps and all that, the worse it is?

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:37.700
 Doing a biopsy, if you believe that the cancer is a mutant cell that is following its own

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:45.620
 internal rules, biopsy and chemotherapy and radiation and surgery all seem logical, but

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:53.740
 if you think of the cancer as a product of something going wrong in the organism that

01:11:53.740 --> 01:12:04.340
 is failing to heal a wound, if you see the tumor as a wound which is not healing properly,

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:11.940
 then when you mess with it, you're adding to the problems of the organism rather than

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.020
 solving the organism's problem.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:21.900
 So if you think of the tumor as a wound, flesh that out a little bit, that's interesting.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.540
 Talk a little bit more about that idea.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:32.940
 When you look at a healing wound, there was an article in JAMA about 50 years ago showing

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:42.820
 that doing a biopsy of a normal wound, just a stab wound or something, as the tissue heals,

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:51.140
 doing the pathology, doing a slice of the tissue, any stage of a healing wound can be

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:56.460
 identical in structure to a cancer.

01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.380
 A pathologist would say, "Yeah, these are cancer cells.

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:08.340
 They have all the properties of occasional abnormal cell division.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.660
 The ratio of cytoplasm in the nucleus is low.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:14.580
 It's invasive structurally."

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:22.540
 That's part of a normal wound healing process, but the problem is that the cancer lacks something

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:31.900
 to get beyond that stage of healing, and so it just keeps growing without resolving the

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.900
 wound.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:38.300
 It doesn't create an organized tissue because something is lacking in the system.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.300
 So the body's...

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:46.340
 It sounds like the body's trying to heal when these cancer cells are getting together, in

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.980
 a way.

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.980
 Yeah.

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:55.140
 You can find quite a bit of research on that, but it isn't popular.

01:13:55.140 --> 01:14:03.740
 The medical business is invested in their super-expensive chemotherapies and their radiation

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:12.900
 equipment, ion beam machines that cost millions of dollars, and it's not good for their investment

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:17.620
 to question whether the whole theory of cancer is right or not.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:24.220
 When you say this organism that's sometimes called a tumor that's trying to heal, it's

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.260
 lacking in something.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:27.460
 Do we know what it's lacking in?

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.460
 For one thing, carbon dioxide.

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:38.340
 The person who asked about a fungus probably had heard about Simoncini in Italy.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:48.060
 And baking soda, interestingly, very often does provide what the tumor lacks to be able

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:59.260
 to heal, but carbon dioxide is what the baking soda is providing, sodium plus carbon dioxide.

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:08.100
 And in the 18th century, people were already experimenting.

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:14.540
 The discovery of carbonated water, partly it was closely related to the observation

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:22.740
 that carbon dioxide helps with cancer, and people were already seeing great improvement,

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:29.740
 for example, in breast cancer just by exposing it to carbon dioxide.

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:36.940
 There's a book that reviews the history of treating cancer with carbon dioxide, for example,

01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:44.220
 carbon dioxide enemas, or breathing carbon dioxide, or sitting in a bag full of carbon

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:48.460
 dioxide to absorb it through the skin.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:56.820
 When you're under stress, the characteristic feature of cancer identified by Otto Warburg

01:15:56.820 --> 01:16:05.420
 a hundred years ago is that it can't stop producing lactic acid, which is normal in

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:16.740
 an injury, but the injured tissue producing lactic acid stimulates its own growth, which

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:26.220
 is good for the healing process, but at some point the lactic acid has to stop to allow

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.140
 maturing of the tissue rather than continued growth.

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:38.580
 Carbon dioxide is the feature produced by the respiring mitochondria, which should turn

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:46.940
 off lactic acid, but if something is limiting your ability to produce and retain carbon

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:52.340
 dioxide, then you can't turn off lactic acid.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:17:03.420
 And Simoncini's baking soda sometimes provided enough sodium and bicarbonate or carbon dioxide

01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:08.300
 to suppress the lactic acid and allow healing to proceed.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:15.540
 And do we know why this carbon dioxide process sometimes lowered?

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:24.820
 Low thyroid, low calcium, low vitamin D, low sodium are all factors in limiting the ability

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:27.740
 to make enough carbon dioxide.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:32.020
 Would it be reasonable, folks, every now and then, to take a little teaspoon of baking

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.020
 soda?

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.020
 I mean, would it be okay?

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.020
 Or help?

01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:42.860
 Well, athletes find that their endurance is greatly increased with typical doses of

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:48.180
 a tablespoon of baking soda at the start of an endurance race.

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.660
 That's a lot, a tablespoon.

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.220
 That's going to taste really, whew, man.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:59.620
 Yeah, but even a fourth of a teaspoon of water can make a big difference in how a person

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.620
 feels.

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:08.220
 I've known people who always got swollen feet on an airplane trip.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:16.420
 Taking a spoonful of soda in water, they found that they didn't have the swollen feet.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.300
 What's going on there?

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:29.140
 When you take in the baking soda, your kidneys quickly get rid of any excess sodium that

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:39.340
 you don't need, but the bicarbonate is able to be turned when it meets a cell.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:48.020
 Enzymes turn it quickly into carbon dioxide, which is acidic, and the acidic cell quiets

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:54.060
 down and stops making so much lactic acid.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:19:03.420
 The formation of lactic acid makes the cell alkaline, and the baking soda provides the

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:09.580
 carbon dioxide that will reacidify the cell and stop it from producing the lactic acid.

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.580
 Oh, very interesting.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.140
 But you wouldn't want to do that, I guess, around food time, because it doesn't dilute

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:18.660
 the stomach acid, too?

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.940
 The stomach usually can quickly adjust.

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:21.940
 Make some more.

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:30.940
 It's very powerful at producing acid and removing excess alkaline.

01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:37.060
 Does stomach acid increase with stress or decrease?

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.220
 It depends on the person.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.700
 Oh, right.

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:50.100
 It could go either way.

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:54.460
 Please ask Dr. Peed, what about A1 versus A2 casein milk?

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:56.660
 Is there a difference there?

01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:05.580
 There is a difference, but I've never seen any research that really makes a convincing

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:11.380
 case that it's important for the health.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:20.300
 The peptides do differ, and the peptides do have different effects, but our digestive

01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:26.860
 systems are usually so efficient that we don't notice any effect.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:33.580
 It breaks down right to amino acids, which have none of that endocrine effect.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.780
 They're out there actually selling A2 milk now.

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.780
 Have you seen that on the shelves, or A2?

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:43.100
 It's a whole marketing thing now.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:53.180
 Are the new digital x-rays significantly less dangerous than the older guys, or more?

01:20:53.180 --> 01:21:00.740
 What they're meaning is that they have a more sensitive way of registering the x-rays,

01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:10.740
 the same old x-rays, but they're claiming that their new machinery can make smaller

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:11.740
 doses.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:20.060
 In effect, in practice, what they're doing is making more pictures, and it turns out

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:27.940
 that the exposure per visit to dentists is likely to be just about the same, because

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:34.460
 they're so enthusiastic about making more pictures.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:37.740
 What about this thing that was really popular over the years?

01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:38.740
 I don't know.

01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:43.020
 I don't hear about it much more, but they were really promoting a lot on radio where

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:51.220
 you take a picture of your chest and look at all the calcium in your arteries.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.220
 What's the name of that?

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:55.740
 Do you know which one I'm talking about?

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.540
 High energy, a lot of big, strong x-rays.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:09.420
 Yeah, CAT scans is one way of doing it.

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:16.700
 It's well established that medical x-rays are a major cause of heart disease as well

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:20.940
 as breast cancer.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:29.980
 The areas that have the best medical care, the area around San Francisco and California,

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:39.780
 a very high-income area, have the country's highest incidence of breast cancer.

01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:47.340
 West Virginia has very poor medical care, so-called, but also the lowest breast cancer

01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:48.340
 mortality.

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:57.780
 Very good evidence that heart disease as well as breast cancer is caused by medical x-rays.

01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.380
 The term I was thinking of, Dr. Peter, CT scans.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:03.500
 They're very popular, very inexpensive, right?

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:04.500
 Yeah.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:08.740
 They deliver hundreds of times more radiation than a chest x-ray.

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:11.260
 Yeah, a lot.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:16.100
 More and more people have been exposed in the last 10 or 15 years.

01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:21.140
 You can go in some malls and get a CT scan.

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:22.140
 In a mall?

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.940
 In a mall.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:25.940
 Here's an email from Jill.

01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:33.500
 "If someone has a problem converting T4 to T3 and has slightly high reverse T3, are they

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.220
 better off taking Armour or Cytomel?

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:41.140
 I started Cytomel at 5 milligrams, but starting getting headaches, my doctor wants me to switch

01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:44.060
 to Armour."

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:55.340
 For most people, the combination products such as Armour are very good, reliable, the

01:23:55.340 --> 01:24:00.180
 dose can be adjusted if you are watchful.

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:09.180
 Women have been known to have at least five times as much thyroid disease as men because

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:17.420
 estrogen interferes with the function of thyroid at every level, at the gland and at the transport

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.380
 and at the cellular response level.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:27.500
 One of the things it does is increase cortisol and the stress hormones, and that interferes

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:31.820
 with the conversion of thyroxine to T3.

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:39.420
 So women are much more likely than men to have a T3 deficiency.

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:48.340
 Forty-five years ago when I was teaching endocrinology, there was a woman at the University of Oregon

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:57.660
 Hospital brought in unconscious from a myxedema coma, they called it.

01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:04.380
 Her doctor had started her on 100 micrograms of thyroxine.

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.180
 That wasn't enough for her symptoms.

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.180
 He increased it gradually.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.260
 At 500 micrograms, she went into a coma.

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:20.500
 In the hospital, they discovered she had essentially zero active T3 hormone.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:30.860
 The pituitary had been suppressed by the high dose of thyroxine and the pituitary is able

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:38.900
 to activate the conversion, but with the resulting high estrogen and high cortisol, the conversion

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.380
 was blocked.

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:47.540
 So they gave her intravenous T3 and immediately she came out of the coma and was well.

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:51.660
 But it's very common.

01:25:51.660 --> 01:26:00.340
 You could say that practically all of the women with a thyroid problem are deficient

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:05.900
 in T3 because of that effect of estrogen blocking the conversion.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:11.540
 And so they could maybe experiment with a little bit of progesterone and the wild yam

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:14.940
 thing to do, would that help?

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.940
 Yes.

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:28.660
 The progesterone blocks the formation of estrogen and also blocks the antithyroid effect of

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:31.180
 cortisol.

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:35.860
 Estrogen increases cortisol, which blocks thyroid function.

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:40.780
 Progesterone blocks both of those and lets the thyroid function normally.

01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:44.780
 So that's why it works for the guys with the testosterone, the progesterone.

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:47.820
 Same principle.

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:49.500
 Pretty safe too, what I understand.

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.500
 And do you agree?

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.500
 Pretty safe?

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.500
 Yes.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:27:05.380
 No one has really found any harmful side effects of progesterone except that it can cause unconsciousness

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:09.420
 if you take a huge dose.

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:14.760
 Okay, final email, then we'll let you go on with your day here.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:20.100
 What does your guest recommend for low thyroidism and high blood pressure at the same time?

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:24.940
 We recently started taking some Living Streams probiotics, which seem to have helped other

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:25.940
 symptoms.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.980
 Okay, thank you, but not the high blood pressure yet.

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.500
 I stopped taking armor thyroid when I started the probiotics.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:37.900
 Should I just have eased off of the armor?

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.580
 Oh, so let's see.

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:44.460
 It sounds like Dr. Peat, they've kind of just dumped the armor, but their blood pressure

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.820
 has gone up a little bit.

01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:57.620
 Yeah, when you're low in thyroid function, generally your TSH is very high.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:08.060
 TSH has a pro-inflammatory effect that creates many of the circulatory problems that are

01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:09.940
 blamed on hypothyroidism.

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:18.340
 It's really hyper-TSH-ism, which goes with the low thyroid function.

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:21.220
 Keeping your TSH down is very important.

01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:31.020
 I've got several dozen articles showing that hypertension was cured when they corrected

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:33.940
 their low thyroid problem.

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:40.900
 That's why she got off the armor, and then maybe why her blood pressure went up.

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:47.820
 Yeah, that's probably the largest cause of hypertension is low thyroid, but you have

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:51.700
 to watch the intestine health.

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.300
 It's extremely important.

01:28:53.300 --> 01:29:00.420
 When your thyroid is low, your digestion is slow, and toxins from the intestine contribute

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:02.820
 to the high blood pressure.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.860
 Yeah, well, Dr. Peat, good job.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:09.260
 Thanks for spending some time with us here today.

01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:10.260
 We appreciate it.

01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.260
 Okay.

01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:12.260
 Yeah, it's always fun.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.180
 Now, your website again is raypeat.com.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.740
 You have lots of articles.

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:21.580
 You have 12 different, what did you say?

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:27.300
 I'm sorry, 12 different, 12 subscriptions or 12 issues of your-

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:30.180
 Yeah, 12 issues every other month.

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.180
 Every other month.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.180
 Over two years.

01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.180
 Yeah, two years.

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:36.780
 You want to get your special email thing, and you can do that right on his website.

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:37.780
 Again, thanks a lot.

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.980
 Have a pleasant day up there in the Northwest.

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.380
 Okay, thank you.

01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:43.380
 Thank you, sir.

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:45.100
 Dr. Ray Peat, well, always good.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:48.380
 Boy, I tell you what, you got to take notes, right?

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:51.300
 Man, these little bodies, they are a trip, aren't they?

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:56.660
 Well, we do what we can here to keep bringing you folks that'll help you to stay out of

01:29:56.660 --> 01:30:01.980
 doctor's office, take care of yourself, and do your dream, and have more energy, and all

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.460
 the things that we like to do here on planet Earth.

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:08.300
 We're going to have fun on Thursday.

01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.940
 I think we're going to talk about the brain, the old brain, you know, the old brain thing.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.500
 We're going to do the brain on Thursday.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:14.820
 Do we have somebody else too?

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.260
 I got to check here.

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:19.100
 I know we had somebody else, but I will.

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.100
 We'll find somebody.

01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:23.020
 Oh, we got to get somebody else for Thursday.

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:27.380
 And then tomorrow, we're going to do a tinfoil hat Wednesday with James Corbett, who's out

 of Japan, and he's a fun guy.

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:30.460
 I think you'll enjoy him.

01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:32.500
 If you don't know him, just check him out.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.420
 So I love you all very much.

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:35.500

 I'm at your service here.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.380
 I'm always kind of checking what I'm doing, seeing what's going on.

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:50.660
 If I can help you, let me know.

01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:55.380
 People order sulfur, and they have questions about this and that, and all these questions.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:31:00.380
 So I'll see you tomorrow, and may the blessings be.
