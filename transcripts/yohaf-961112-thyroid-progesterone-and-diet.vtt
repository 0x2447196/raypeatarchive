 [music]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.760
 Good afternoon and welcome to your own health and fitness talk show.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.840
 I'm health integration specialist Laina Berman

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.240
 and I'm here live with you every Tuesday at noon talking to you about health care

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.320
 and fitness trends

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.680
 and taking your phone calls. This week's show is an interview with

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.960
 biologist, researcher, and medical activist

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.880
 Raymond Peat. He's the true pioneer of the use of

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.120
 supplemental natural progesterone among other things

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.560
 and as usual I will open up the phone lines

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.720
 at 1230 at 510-848-4425 for your participation.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.480
 I want to remind people if you'd like to get a tape of today's show or you need

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.960
 to get hold of me after the show you can call my office during normal business

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.640
 hours

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.280
 and that number is 707-769-145

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.520
 8. I don't

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.600
 actually want to do much of an editorial today

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.360
 because I have a lot to discuss with Dr. Peat and I want to get right into the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.800
 show

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.320
 but I'd like to give you some information about why

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.560
 the show is so important to me and why I chose

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 Dr. Peat to come on the air with us today.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.760
 It was roughly 15 years ago I went to a lecture,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.360
 a small talk actually at UCSF and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.520
 Ray Peat was there speaking and he spoke

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.600
 a bit about among other things some

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.120
 research that had been done on the topic of helplessness

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.160
 using animals. It was unfortunate, I mean animal rights people would not like

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.000
 this research but

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.920
 they had done an experiment that proved that when animals

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.000
 were made to feel helpless they lost the will to live

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.640
 and he was discussing this

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.840
 in the context of how it affects patients who are caught

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.000
 in a chronic illness cycle and are in a cycle of being

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.200
 treated constantly and being dependent on treatment. He also

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.320
 spoke about the use of natural progesterone

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.400
 and thyroid medication as

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.640
 things that excite the cells and help

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.880
 the body to pull out of an inhibitory state. His

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.920
 work is very controversial although

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.320
 some of the things, many of the things, most of the things that he said

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.640
 that I heard 15 years ago now are considered

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.880
 sort of the new wave of information

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.640
 in somewhat alternative health although even in mainstream

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.160
 health some of the swings that we've made from polyunsaturated oils to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.640
 recognizing the use of saturated fats for cooking and various things

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.480
 and certainly the use of progesterone, natural progesterone

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.760
 and thyroid medication and the problem that people have with thyroid.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.760
 I have chosen to do a show with him and I want you to understand that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.000
 you may find a lot of what he has to say

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.560
 confusing and controversial but I want you to maintain an open mind

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.840
 as I do with him at all times and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.920
 consider what he has to say and try it on for yourself.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.360
 As with all the shows that I do I want you

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.680
 to think for yourself but it's a rare opportunity to have Dr. Pete available

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.280
 to us

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.440
 and I think that he's a very important researcher and I think you ought to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 listen carefully to what he has to say.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.760
 In ways of an introduction Raymond Pete has a doctorate in biology from

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.880
 University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.840
 His books include Mind and Tissue,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.160
 Progesterone in Orthomolecular Medicine, Nutrition for Women and Generative

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.520
 Energy. He's taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.480
 Montana State University, National College of Naturopathic Medicine,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.500
 Universidad de Veracruz, Ana,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.320
 and the Universidad Autonoma del

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.120
 Estado de Mexico. He founded Blake College which is an international

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.860
 university.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.880
 Dr. Pete in addition does independent research,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.320
 continues to do it, thank goodness for all of us, and private endocrine and

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.040
 nutritional

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.880
 counseling. Some of you have just been introduced to Dr. Pete because

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.480
 he's mentioned in Dr. John Lee's book What Your Doctor May Not Know About

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.320
 Metapause

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.920
 as Dr. Lee's inspiration for his research

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.240
 on natural progesterone. So without any further delay I'd like to welcome you

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.280
 to the show. Are you there Ray? Yeah, yeah, hi. Hi.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.000
 Thanks so much for taking the time. I thought that was a good context

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.040
 you created talking about the helplessness

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.600
 thing because since Dr. Lee's

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.160
 book came out I've been hearing from people who

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.320
 say I just want progesterone for my bones or

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.840
 whatever and I think the real meaning

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.920
 of any of these natural supplements or substances

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.160
 is that they

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.560
 participate in everything.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.840
 Their physiology and ecology are

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.080
 tied together in a system and these things are important because

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.080
 they're sort of central links in this ecological, physiological

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.520
 system but even inside the perception

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.960
 of power or helplessness can make

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 a tremendous difference in how these

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.040
 hormones work and when people think of them as

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.120
 products or drugs

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.400
 they are almost certain to misuse them in some way.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.960
 Well, the reason I brought up the research on helplessness is because

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.120
 essentially hearing the lecture that you gave let me out of a cage

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.960
 and I had a completely different view of my health after that and it

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.720
 had a profound effect on me. I think

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.600
 it's a good segue to talk about what you talk about when you talk about an

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.800
 inhibitory state which is the same as what you just started to say

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.160
 so that I want you to talk about the fact that we're not just talking about

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.760
 progesterone, we're talking about the way for instance our

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.800
 modern diet has suppressed thyroid function in the way that all of these

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.040
 systems work together.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.280
 The idea of the inhibitory

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.040
 state comes largely from

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.640
 Pavlovian tradition and Pavlov

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.320
 saw three basic biological states,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.680
 one in which you're so well rested and prepared

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.800
 that you could respond

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.480
 to challenges without being stressed and

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.400
 the other, that was high inhibition,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.440
 readiness and the low state of being inhibited

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.200
 is sort of protection against

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.800
 overstimulation and in between

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.040
 is the range of stress and

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.080
 energy is needed to put us up into the readiness

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.200
 state where we're relaxed and able to cope with

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.600
 without experiencing the stress reaction and

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.520
 we think of cortisol and the glucocorticoids

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.080
 as the central stress handling

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.160
 hormones but the brain is

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.840
 set up such that ACTH

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.840
 which turns on the adrenal hormones such as cortisol

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.680
 ACTH is produced in response

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.600
 to a substance which is only produced when we're deficient

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.560
 in pregnenolone and thyroid, the precursor materials

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.880
 and so that when you're in that

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.520
 replenished state with enough pregnenolone

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.520
 you don't even resort to the stress

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.920
 reaction. That's the latest

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.640
 biological meaning of the high state of

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.880
 inhibition or readiness.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.200
 So to make it accessible to people who are listening

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.520
 many of us you know have been as we

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.720
 often like to say running on adrenaline instead of

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.720
 something more sustaining and

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.200
 there's a lot of adrenal exhaustion in people with autoimmune diseases and

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:21.720
 whatnot

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.600
 so part of what happens is there's a wheel and somewhere along the line you

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.440
 have to be able to stick a stick in the wheel to make it stop

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.840
 what is the stick? What's the first stick?

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.560
 Adequate protein and sodium

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.600
 are very crucial

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:44.400
 for the average American. Adequate high-quality protein is

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.440
 needed before your liver can regulate

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.200
 your blood sugar and all of the hormones

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.800
 and without that you tend to

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.680
 waste your minerals and sodium is a key mineral

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.080
 and so people who are on low protein and low sodium

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.440
 diets are doing exactly what

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.480
 puts them into the stress situation.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.560
 And as I understand there are foods that you believe

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.840
 suppress thyroid function which is another key to this yes?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.240
 Yeah, these low sodium and low thyroid

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.560
 are sort of basic

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.240
 things to think about but there's a whole

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.960
 layer of American foods and

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.640
 they're worldwide poison. You can see belts

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.600
 of thyroid disease and tuberculosis for example

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.480
 wherever people eat too much cabbage

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.920
 or too many beans and lentils.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.920
 These foods are the classical

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.960
 traditional thyroid inhibitors

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.560
 but chemically it's the

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.920
 essential fatty acids

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.120
 so-called the unsaturated fats

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.880
 that are becoming very important to Americans

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.920
 and thyroid and progesterone function.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.160
 Okay, well the reason both of us are laughing is because we've had no

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.280
 end of conversations about essential fatty acids because

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.000
 I don't know how I feel about this. I'm rather alarmed by what Raymond is

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.800
 saying

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.320
 but I'm confused because when you go to

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.600
 at least what I've seen in biochemical and nutrition textbooks

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.440
 they say that, you know, the premise I think that Ray is talking about is that

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.200
 saturated fat will turn into

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.560
 essential fat but my understanding is that saturated oil can't turn into

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:40.440
 long-chain

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.600
 omega-3s and that although Paleolithic

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.000
 meat had it in it because the animals were eating leafy greens

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.440
 since we're now eating corn-fed meat

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.200
 we're not going to get it outside.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.400
 Omega-3 and omega-6

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.520
 are the things that people are

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.120
 currently conscious of because of vast marketing

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.160
 campaign that has been going on for 40 years

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.200
 but when we aren't given

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.480
 these things which inhibit these external

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.840
 unsaturated fats, inhibit our own enzyme

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.920
 systems and when we are not saturated with these

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.000
 enzyme inhibitors our own

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.520
 cells produce omega-9

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.360
 unsaturated fatty acids. Coconut oil and

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.960
 olive oil are very similar to what

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.240
 the baby produces

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.640
 when it's not, when it's relatively insulated

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.480
 and if you take cells and grow them in culture

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.760
 they grow wonderfully in a completely

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.440
 unsaturated oil free culture medium

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.600
 showing that human cells whether

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.040
 in the developing fetus or in the laboratory

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.040
 dish do a fine job of producing unsaturated fat

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.280
 and in fact have

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.240
 more cellular vitality than when they're exposed to these

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.520
 environmental oils. Okay well just again to make it accessible

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.600
 what you're really saying is to stay

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.920
 away from vegetable oils correct? Yeah

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.240
 for example the degree of unsaturation

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.200
 linoleic with three double bonds

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.480
 or linoleic acid with two double bonds

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.320
 in proportion to the number of double bonds

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.600
 they poison the thyroid function

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.080
 at every known level. The synthesis

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.280
 the transport and the response

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.760
 in two or three different ways inside the cells

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.760
 are strongly poisoned by the

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.400
 three unsaturated groups and

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.520
 significantly inhibited by the

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.040
 two double bonds of linoleic acid. I told you guys this would be

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.120
 going against everything else you've been hearing and truly it is

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.600
 we're gonna run out of time and one of the things I want to make sure we go

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.520
 over is that

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.080
 I think what we've just said is that eating

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.120
 unsaturated polyunsaturated oils is

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.080
 thyroid inhibitory not eating enough protein also

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.840
 inhibits thyroid function and don't you also believe the grains

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.280
 do the same thing? Well the whole grains

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.080
 contain a variety of toxins that are put there

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.880
 to protect the next generation of the plants

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.560
 the plants put their worst poisons in their seeds

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.360
 and the next level of toxicity in their leaves

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.000
 to prevent bugs and grazers from

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.520
 killing them. Fruits and roots

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.160
 are where the vegetable matter is least

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.960
 toxic but the unsaturated oils in the seeds are part of the

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.280
 cells that the plants defense against being

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.520
 eaten and digested.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.960
 So when we start to talk about being careful what you eat because it may

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.520
 inhibit your thyroid function

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.520
 the reason we're saying that is because even people who are testing normal

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.520
 for thyroid function but have cold hands and have below normal temperatures and

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.640
 maybe are just slightly low in thyroid function

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.680
 often also are estrogen dominant

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.080
 and this includes some men.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.320
 As your thyroid goes down your estrogen comes up

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.200
 a very neat connection which is because your liver

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.920
 needs both protein and thyroid to get rid of estrogen

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.240
 and when your liver function decreases your estrogen automatically

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.360
 piles up. Okay just a quick

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.600
 ID for the show this is your own health and fitness I'm health integration

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.880
 specialist Lena Berman and I'm on the phone with

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.680
 biologist and I would say medical I'd like to call you a medical

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.280
 activist

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.480
 Raymond Pete who

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.400
 is a rare guest and a very important guest and we're talking about the

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.680
 relationship between

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.920
 a diet and the various hormones and steroids that exist in our bodies

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.920
 including thyroid

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.920
 and progesterone. We'll open up the phone lines

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.280
 maybe at 1230 I may actually extend the interview a little bit let's see

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.240
 how we do.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.920
 So what happens when you're throwing off the estrogen balance in the

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.200
 body and again to remind people this is not just

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.200
 women this is men and particularly because we're living in an environment

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.280
 with a lot of xenoestrogens and foods that have estrogen like

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.000
 like soy this can happen in men as well.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.800
 This leaves us susceptible am I right to autoimmune

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.480
 dysfunction? Yeah there are several good

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.160
 books available on the role of

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.360
 estrogen in autoimmune diseases. It's

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.480
 very central to autoimmune

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.160
 degenerative diseases. In our hamster lab

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.000
 many years ago some of the researchers saw that

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.560
 estrogen first causes overdevelopment of

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.720
 the adrenal cortex in the animals and

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.240
 as they increase the dose it reached the point that it killed the adrenal cells.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.200
 It in essence is a

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.400
 stress hormone. Hans Zellye in the 1940s described it as the shock

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.240
 hormone. It imitates everything of shock and stress.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.240
 Because it's this sort of line of thinking I think and reading

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.280
 I was going to ask you about where you're looking what research

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.600
 you've been looking at that brings up this stuff about polyunsaturated oils

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.800
 because in many of our conversations you've said this research is very old

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.040
 about the carcinogenic the potential carcinogenic effect of polyunsaturated oils.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.360
 The oldest study that I know of was 1927 in

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.680
 Germany in which they showed that a fat-free diet

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.400
 in rats caused them to be essentially free of spontaneous

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.280
 cancer and just in the last

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.920
 several years researchers have demonstrated that

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.640
 as you increase the amount of unsaturated oil

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.760
 in the diet there's almost a straight line

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.360
 associated increase of the development of cancer.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.200
 Yeah and so saturated fat apparently doesn't do this in your estimation?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.480
 No and saturated fat is for many years it's known to

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.800
 be pro-immunity.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.520
 Yeah of course there's all this stuff about heart disease that everybody's getting

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.800
 excited about though and

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.640
 people do well go ahead.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.160
 The Broderbarn's books on heart disease are probably the best

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.600
 introduction to this even though the Schutt

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.720
 family started in the 1930s showing how

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.120
 estrogen promotes blood clots but

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.560
 Broderbarn's work shows that

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:08.400
 low thyroid which of course is caused by too much unsaturated fats

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.560
 is the main cause for

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.000
 degenerative circulatory disease and

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.720
 the research of just the last few years is showing

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.520
 that in fact unsaturated fats are highly

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.720
 atherogenic. The free radical reaction

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.400
 which is developed in thyroid deficient animals

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.800
 causes the blood vessels to be the first

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.040
 site of attack as these unsaturated fats

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.160
 are either eaten or drawn out of

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.040
 the fat storage tissues. They are exposed to

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.480
 oxygen in the bloodstream, produce free radicals

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.600
 and attack the lining of the blood vessels.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.200
 Just to again to break this down for people what we're talking about

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.680
 is a real hunter-gatherer diet that's what we're talking about is eating a

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.080
 very strict hunter-gatherer diet that is

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.640
 probably forty percent protein and includes

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.480
 probably some cooked vegetables

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.280
 well-cooked and tubers, potatoes

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.920
 and fruit. But

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.080
 let's go back to progesterone because

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.680
 you're really quite famous for this now and talk about the link and how

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.920
 progesterone works

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.240
 to help with this again to put a stick in the wheel.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.320
 Okay, the reason

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.320
 cholesterol is high in low thyroid people

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.440
 and this was neatly established in the 1930s

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.680
 that they took high cholesterol to be diagnostic of

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.800
 low thyroid because you can demonstrate such a neat

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.080
 up-and-down relationship. For example a month ago I saw

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.520
 two people who wanted to pass a

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.880
 health test in a few days lower their cholesterol

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.920
 200 points in about three or four days

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.800
 just by adjusting their thyroid.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.120
 So thyroid is what

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.240
 makes you regulate your cholesterol but it

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.160
 does it largely by turning cholesterol

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.720
 into steroids starting with pregnenolone

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.320
 and progesterone being

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.040
 one of the major products so that

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.320
 if you have adequate thyroid and cholesterol

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.600
 and vitamin A your cholesterol is going to be turned

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.840
 efficiently into progesterone and

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.840
 these are the hormones that prevent the stress reaction

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.600
 that involves cortisone and adrenaline.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.120
 Okay, well that's a big if because for many of us even those of us

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.440
 who I mean as we've talked about before there are many people who already have

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.520
 autoimmune disease

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.720
 and maybe you're supplementing with thyroid now so part of this

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.880
 has to do with supplementation of thyroid and progesterone because this

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.360
 sort of

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.920
 mechanism of getting well again after the damage has been done

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.240
 is a slow one, no? Yeah and the unsaturated fats

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.320
 also poison the for example ovaries

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.920
 and brain cells directly. I just hate it when you talk this way.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.840
 It makes me nuts. Go ahead.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.040
 There are other things such as iron overload

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.160
 or unsaturated fat excess or vitamin

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.200
 E deficiency that poison the progesterone producing

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.360
 cells but the basic thing is

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.240
 having enough cholesterol, vitamin A and thyroid to produce

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.400
 these protective hormones. Okay so some people are starting to take extra

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.080
 supplemental thyroid again I'm looking at trying to stop the wheel

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.280
 and people are introducing

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.080
 natural progesterone as a supplement to help the absorption of the thyroid

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.920
 and to lower you know to contest the estrogen. Am I okay?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.760
 Progesterone facilitates function of the thyroid gland

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.760
 and that is a potential side effect of taking progesterone because

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.080
 everyone who's low in progesterone is

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.360
 going to have some kind of thyroid malfunction

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.840
 because the thyroid is blocked in its function by

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.400
 estrogen and activated by progesterone

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.280
 so if it has been blocked and has a store

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:31.920
 of hormone when you take progesterone sometimes

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.640
 it starts the thyroid working too fast as it

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.760
 unloads this bulk.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.120
 Okay so then we've got

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.120
 people who are getting older. First we've got people who maybe are even

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:48.960
 really young

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.600
 that are still having trouble with the thyroid being inhibited and

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.000
 the autoimmune diseases and they're taking progesterone

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.160
 and this is again, men can take this as well, no?

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.120
 Then we start to get people who are getting middle-aged

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.280
 and things start to change and that's when I think

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.960
 you like people to consider if they're ill or maybe not only ill to consider

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.720
 supplementing with pregnenolone

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.120
 and you know I asked, I think I told you I asked Michael Colgan

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.400
 who is a sports nutrition specialist about pregnenolone. He went, "Oh no, it

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.320
 makes, you know, makes cortisol and people who are exercising will make cortisol and

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.160
 that won't be good." So

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.000
 tell me, tell everybody about that. The one hormonal

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.280
 effect that has been seen consistently

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.360
 and it's the only thing that shows up

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.720
 in when you study

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.040
 animals or people who are given pregnenolone, the

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.480
 only hormonal consequence is that if their cortisone

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.400
 is elevated, pregnenolone brings it down to normal.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.480
 That's because the elevation of cortisol

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.000
 is connected through mechanisms

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.120
 in the brain circuitry.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.080
 High cortisol is a symptom of a

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.560
 pregnenolone deficiency and once you get your cortisone

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.880
 down by having enough pregnenolone, then any amount of pregnenolone you take

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.280
 has no hormonal action whatsoever

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:24.600
 but you need to be saturated otherwise

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.840
 you are going to resort to cortisone and cortisone

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.600
 is the basic thing that ages the skin, the brain cells,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.920
 the bones. Every cell is

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.160
 aged faster under the influence of cortisone.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.680
 Okay, and then pregnenolone usually advise people after 50

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.800
 to do. Incidentally, just to let you know, I am going to go long on this

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.560
 interview. What I'll do is I'll still break at 1230 for about 30 seconds

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.800
 and you guys who are listening who want to call in, please

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.360
 try to maybe write to me questions down because we'll probably have to move quickly through the calls

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.320
 and then when we come back from break I'm going to go ahead with the interview for

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.920
 maybe another 10 minutes because there's

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.280
 several things I want to sort of go through with Ray before I open up the phone line.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.920
 So start listing your questions down so we can move through them quickly.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.200
 Pregnenolone after 50.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.120
 Now we've got the vitamin companies are pushing DHEA.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.680
 So why don't you explain how that fits in? Okay, pregnenolone

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.160
 turns into either progesterone or DHEA

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.800
 and DHEA happens to be close

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.720
 to testosterone and estrogen. It's in the sex hormone pathway.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.160
 And progesterone happens to be in

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.400
 the adrenal pathway. It's the main

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.640
 protection. It's a very powerful protection against

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.240
 all of the adrenal hormones so that

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.360
 you don't even need your adrenal glands.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.000
 Hans Zellye demonstrated that the adrenals can be removed

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.520
 and the animal is happy and lives its full lifespan

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:06.400
 if given progesterone. So progesterone is necessary to make the adrenal hormones

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.640
 but it's the basic protection against an

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.040
 excess of them. So these

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.640
 two pathways are both kept supplied

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.600
 by pregnenolone. And you know I'm not

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.520
 I'm telling especially women to sort of stay clear of DHEA because I think that

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.320
 that's the wrong step in the pathway.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.720
 I knew a middle-aged man who

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:35.640
 was taking DHEA and had his liver was expanding so large I had him

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.200
 get his estrogen measured and his

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.480
 estrogen was high for a young woman.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.920
 And a few days after he stopped the DHEA

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.440
 his estrogen level was down to normal

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.480
 but his liver now a year later is still like a watermelon.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.440
 And in rat studies DHEA is

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.160
 highly carcinogenic to the liver. It stimulates first

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.760
 enlargement of the liver and sometimes shrinkage of the thymus because of

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.760
 its overflow into the thymolytic

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.920
 sex hormones, estrogen and testosterone. But

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.000
 it is chronically a great risk of liver cancer.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.400
 So the way to encourage production of it would be

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.640
 after 50 or so people who

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.680
 who want to can supplement with pregnenolone instead?

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.080
 Yeah and if you have adequate cholesterol

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.080
 I think of people as being lucky if they have cholesterol of 250 because

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.560
 that means all they have to do is take thyroid

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.120
 until they have brought their cholesterol down

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.240
 to about 170 or so

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.840
 and at that point the abundance of cholesterol

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.080
 is a great benefit because it makes them able to produce pregnenolone and

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.760
 progesterone and DHEA.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.280
 Okay, that makes a lot of sense actually.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.640
 I'm going to break in a moment here

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.600
 but when we come back what I want to ask you about is men and progesterone.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.560
 Also I want to make something clear to people.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.360
 We're talking about natural progesterone

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.120
 not progestins, not pharmaceutically altered

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.520
 hormones that are sold by pharmaceutical companies and patented that are changed.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.920
 We're talking about natural

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.400
 progesterone that is synthesized still from natural sources but not changed, not

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:29.840
 altered.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.920
 We'll talk about some sources of that when we get back. So let me

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.080
 take a brief musical break. When we come back I'm going to continue the interview

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.480
 for another 10 minutes or so.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.240
 At about 1240 I'll open up the phone lines. This is your own health and fitness talk

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.720
 show.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:48.720
 I'm Lena Berman on the phone with Dr. Raymond Peat. We'll be right back.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:55.720
 [Music]

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:02.720

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:10.720

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:17.720

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:24.720

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:52.720

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.720
 [Music]

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720
 Welcome back.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.720
 Welcome back. This is your own health and fitness talk show. I'm Lena Berman,

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.120
 health integration specialist.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.520
 I'm on the phone with Dr. Raymond Peat, a biologist and researcher.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.920
 I'm holding off on opening the phone lines for another 10 minutes because we

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.420
 have an awful lot to talk about.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.520
 At about 1240 I'll open them up. Raymond,

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.020
 we were talking about pregnenolone and I'd like to move to progesterone,

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.020
 natural progesterone

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.240
 in its use for men and also you discovered

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.280
 that it's good for the relief of migraine headaches.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.320
 Hans Zellye

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.360
 discovered all of the basic properties of progesterone. I think

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.820
 his technicians reported that they had killed

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.520
 all of his rats in one experiment with progesterone and he

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.840
 said he couldn't believe that and he fished the dead

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.800
 rats out of the garbage and found that they were just profoundly

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.600
 anesthetized. It turns out that

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.640
 when healthy animals are in their last day or two of

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.520
 pregnancy, people have put them on electrified

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.560
 floors and they don't even notice that they're being shocked because

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:10.840
 the progesterone that's naturally present for childbirth

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.920
 is putting them in a literally anesthetized

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.400
 state even though they're apparently happy and

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.600
 moving around. Don't try this at home people.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.280
 Most of the progesterone that has been researched

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.400
 in humans, the maximum doses they give

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.480
 injecting 6,000 milligrams for example,

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.760
 made people drowsy but never put them

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.120
 into an actual anesthetic unconsciousness but

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.280
 that's because the solvent

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.800
 drop crystals of progesterone when you inject it

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.880
 or if you take the powder it doesn't dissolve

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:58.000
 in ordinary oils but if you take it dissolved in vitamin E so it actually

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.240
 gets into the bloodstream,

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.400
 the progesterone has this

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.480
 rising series of

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:11.520
 effects which at the peak is

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.280
 a highly protected but anesthetized

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.480
 condition. Short of that state it

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.680
 protects against harmful

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.120
 stimuli. For example,

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.880
 some of the amino acids are called excitotoxic amino acids

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.440
 and the basic protection against these which are

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.680
 normal brain transmitters but

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.000
 they happen to excite brain cells to death.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.880
 The brain's normal protection against cell death

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.840
 produced by these ordinary transmitters is progesterone

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.160
 and to some extent pregnenolone does the same thing. They are the only two

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.400
 hormones that work with the other transmitter called

00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.720
 GABA which puts the brain in a protected resting state

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.960
 and prevents the stress damage.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.760
 Okay, so we've done a segue here instead of talking about

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.040
 men and progesterone, what we've talked about is that it's not possible really to

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.760
 overdose

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.600
 on progesterone. Although you know one of the questions that

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.640
 came up for me is why can't you become progesterone dominant?

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.440
 Well, on the way up the scale towards protecting everything

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.800
 it's also protective against salt imbalance

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.520
 and imbalance of the sex steroids and

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.960
 that means that it protects your thymus and immune system against destruction by

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.240
 the stress hormones

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.280
 or the sex hormones. So it's extremely important

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.000
 in the sense of being protective but it also neutralizes

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.040
 the male hormones and

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.080
 so this is at a very low level

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.640
 in men it begins to neutralize

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.640
 the testosterone and

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.760
 so a man wants to be conscious that there is this

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.400
 deadly rising protective function and

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.440
 if they don't want to be protected against

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.360
 having whiskers and other typically male

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.400
 traits, they don't want to take

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.600
 more than just a very few milligrams a day,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.400
 two or three milligrams a day is about enough to

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.120
 offer general protection without neutralizing them

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.600
 sexually. Oh, I didn't think it had any feminizing effect. No, it isn't

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.680
 feminizing in the sense of

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.000
 not being either estrogen

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.160
 affected or testosterone effect. Oh, that's interesting because I thought it did, I

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.200
 thought when women took

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.400
 progesterone that it does increase their testosterone levels. No.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.040
 Well, why does the libido come back then in women? Well, because

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.720
 the estrogen as a shock hormone

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.960
 causes protective loss of libido

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.040
 at some point and by stopping that shock reaction

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.080
 the libido comes back and

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.600
 men can still function even with

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.120
 their testosterone highly neutralized so

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.600
 they feel like they've just come out of a cold shower but

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.000
 the brain still knows how to make everything

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.200
 function. This would be nasty though if the woman is taking progesterone and the man's

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.000
 taking too much it could get really ugly.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.360
 Well, it doesn't really prevent potency.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.880
 Well, just interest I would think after a cold shower.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.000
 But it sounds like taking a very small amount of progesterone for men will be

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.440
 protection against

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.440
 maybe something that we loosely call andropause or male menopause and

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.960
 prostatitis and prostate disease.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.520
 It has been used largely in Europe

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.880
 to shrink enlarged prostates and

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.760
 I've seen it happen at a very moderate dose that doesn't even

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.680
 affect their sexuality. It'll shrink an enlarged

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.160
 prostate. Okay, a couple of quick things.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.440
 I think what we're saying, so what you're saying about the headaches is that it

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.800
 has an anesthetic effect. Yeah, and it

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.800
 stops the vascular problems that are involved in the blind spots of migraine.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.680
 In two of my worst migraines

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.440
 ever I found that in a minute and a half the headache

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.200
 totally resolved and

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.240
 in women it is less likely to have such a

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.040
 quick massive effect because women are likely to have a much higher

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.480
 estrogen level. Estrogen causes nerve

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.720
 sensitivities which can

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.320
 culminate in epilepsy but migraine is the lower

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.560
 grade of this estrogen poisoning and

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.040
 the effect on the vascular system of progesterone is

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.480
 in the direction of digitalis. It's considered to be the body's

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.680
 own heart and circulation regulatory substance

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:03.800
 which is affected by digitalis and this means that

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.640
 it tones up for example varicose veins or

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.000
 bulging veins on the backs of your hands are an easy way to see a progesterone

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.160
 deficiency but

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.960
 that's what happens in a migraine. The bulging veins

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.760
 impair circulation. Ray, very quickly, do you

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.280
 completely disapprove of ever supplementing with estrogen if women

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.520
 have vaginal atrophy and

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.240
 stuff like that? Yeah, because of the side effects.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:35.640
 There must be a lot of other hormones that people could research

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.080
 without going right to the most

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:43.680
 dangerous shock hormone, estrogen. So your sense is that if women are having

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.640
 those even with progesterone

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:51.280
 supplementation? Researchers have found that vitamin A in progesterone and

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.800
 even DHEA very often

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.440
 it seems to be the missing factor. Okay, now you're confusing people.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.840
 So you're saying after menopause when women are experiencing

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.480
 maybe some specific symptoms intervaginally

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.560
 that rather than use estrogen that in that situation maybe DHEA is

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.640
 appropriate? What about testosterone?

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.880
 Yeah, people have been researching all of those and

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.960
 all of them seem to affect at least

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.800
 some of the women and so I think it's better to check them out in the order of

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.040
 safety like with pregnenolone,

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.640
 thyroid, progesterone first and then try

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.120
 as your last resort, try the one that

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.400
 tends to kill you sooner. That makes sense, so thyroid and pregnenolone

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.480
 first, that makes sense.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.360
 You've had some success treating Graves' disease with pregnenolone. I mean

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:41.760
 they're

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.640
 irradiating people's thyroids for Graves. Yeah, there's published

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.720
 stuff using what I consider mild

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.200
 doses of pregnenolone. All of their people, the eyes receded

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.600
 and in my few experiences

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.800
 the eyes just sort of were sucked back into the head.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.320
 It's such a dramatic process that

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:08.640
 you have to see what it can do to

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.080
 deformed arthritic joints or

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.800
 emphysema in which there's almost no oxygen getting through the lungs

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.440
 or in this state of Graves' disease

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.640
 in which there's a gelatinous material behind the eyeball.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.240
 The valves of the heart can get the same gelatinous deposit which is

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.600
 historically thought of as a low

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.880
 thyroid product, a glycoprotein,

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.200
 but pregnenolone has the most dramatic

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.480
 almost instantaneous effect. Like in an hour you can

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.600
 see results. Okay, what I want people to do is to make sure you get a pencil and

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.440
 paper because I want Ray to give out

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.480
 his PO box number and his address.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.480
 I'm sorry, his PO box number and if you'd like to, Ray, also your phone

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:57.640
 number in a second because

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.720
 you actually make an oil which is the vitamin E oil with progesterone which is

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.440
 much stronger than the creams that are available on the market

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.960
 and I think it's a very effective way of supplementing

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:12.600
 for progesterone and it's easily gotten by ordering it from you by mail

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.720
 including all of your books which are self-published and available

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.200
 by ordering them from you by mail. But you know what? You never send a protocol

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.920
 with your progesterone oil so I'm

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.000
 getting no end to phone calls. Yeah, people should read the book

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.760
 and become their own expert because like I said at

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.800
 the beginning, it's always

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.200
 individual and progesterone is just

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.680
 one of the central factors in a whole

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.440
 physiological ecological problem and usually you can fix the

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.480
 problem with diet and if not just diet then thyroid

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.880
 and I think of progesterone just as one of the

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.440
 first aids in repairing the problem but

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.800
 not the answer. Okay, so the book being "Progesterone in

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.680
 Molecular Medicine" but given that people should

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.080
 use their body and their understanding to help to treat themselves

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.160
 how much progesterone is in say

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:13.080
 an eighth of a teaspoon of your oil? 50 milligrams

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:18.200
 but you can't think in terms of what doctors often talk about because

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.640
 that's enough to make some people a little bit drunk.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:26.080
 That's three times the normal day's dose.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.400
 Okay, so maybe a sixteenth of a teaspoon is a better starting dose

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.880
 and how much vitamin E is in that dose?

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:37.920
 Well, the solvent is vitamin E, it's 90 percent of

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.560
 the quantity and so if you have

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.880
 25 milligrams of substance

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.600
 it's going to be about

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.200
 200 units of vitamin E.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.960
 Great, I'm so glad to know this now. You have no idea how many phone calls I get on this.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.400
 Alright, your PO Box and your phone number?

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.920
 PO Box 5764

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.160
 5764. Eugene, Oregon

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.720
 97405. Okay, and you want to give out your phone number?

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.680
 No. Okay, so if people want to do a consultation with you?

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.520
 Yeah, they can write to the post office box.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.440
 PO Box 5764. Eugene, Oregon

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:27.960
 97405 and you also have a newsletter which is $24 for 12 issues

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:33.400
 a year and you can I assume send people information on how much each book costs?

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.120
 Yeah. Okay, I also have a list of the books and the PO Box

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:43.360
 at the front desk of KPFA so people after the show if you get confused can call

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:48.920
 510-848-6767 to get some of the information we just gave out, you know, the PO Box.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.120
 Alright, I am going to open up the phone lines at long last for those of you who have been waiting

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:52.840
 patiently.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.480
 This is your own health and fitness talk show. I'm health integration specialist

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.240
 Laina Berman and I've been on the phone

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.840
 for the last 45 minutes. It's been very luxurious with Raymond Pete,

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.000
 PhD, a biologist and researcher. We're going to open up the phone lines now at

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.440
 510-848-4425. Again, 510-848-4425.

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.240
 Please remember to turn your radio down before we pick you up. And let's move to

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.080
 our first caller.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.320
 Caller, you're on the air with your own health and fitness. Yeah,

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.440
 I was curious about how much progesterone you need to

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.840
 take to treat migraine headaches because I have been getting them

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.040
 and I do think they're hormonally related.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:35.240
 Like I said, the problem is to balance the estrogen

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:39.080
 and it's hard to tell how much estrogen a woman has

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.640
 to balance and so a dose that would

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.040
 not touch a headache in one person might make the other one

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.840
 so drunk they couldn't walk for several hours.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:54.120
 So I would say not to try more than

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:59.120
 50 milligrams at a dose but then repeat it

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.280
 every 15 minutes until the headache is gone.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.520
 And the efficient way

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.560
 to prevent them is to take thyroid or optimize your own

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.680
 thyroid production so that your estrogen

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.800
 is controlled to a reasonable degree

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.400
 and then it takes little or no progesterone

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.520
 because the estrogen

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.960
 is able to be controlled. Okay, caller, thank you.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.840
 You know, you've also mentioned Broderbarn's books but they are in fact

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.200
 out of print, am I right?

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:37.320
 Yeah, I think so. Okay, so maybe libraries, Broderbarn, B-R-O-D-E-R,

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.800
 B-A-R-N... B-R-O-D-A was his first name.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.280
 B-A-R-N-E-S. B-R-O-D-A-

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.040
 B-A-R-N-E-S, Broderbarn's.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.560
 Maybe in the library. Okay, let's move to another caller.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.920
 Caller, you're on the air with KPFA. Yes,

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.000
 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease... Along with everybody else in the world.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.280
 ...six months ago with an astronomically high

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.560
 level of thyroid antibodies. I have no

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.680
 symptoms which can clearly be

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.760
 traced to it and I've now, you know,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:16.600
 reached a dose of Synthroid which, you know, balances out my blood test

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.200
 but there's no change in the way that I feel.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.520
 There's a lot of history involved here but

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.000
 in the practical point that I've seen is that,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.320
 for example, any tissue which is

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.320
 injured, like they have experimentally twisted a piece of cartilage

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.480
 and found that just that small amount of

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.560
 disruption causes it to raise

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.040
 antibodies from its own body and so

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.200
 any tissue which is under stress is going to have

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.960
 antibodies as part of a cleanup process.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.680
 So don't worry about the diagnosis or the antibodies because

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.880
 everyone who corrects their thyroid function

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.920
 that I've seen has corrected their

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.600
 antibody level after about a year of good functioning but

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.720
 the real problem is that in the 1940s

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:15.400
 it was known that almost half of Americans were hypothyroid

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:20.280
 and got over their symptoms whether it was diabetes or heart disease or

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.200
 infections

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:25.440
 when they were given adequate thyroid but a drug company came out

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.880
 with the test for protein-bound iodine in the blood

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.720
 and they found that 95 percent of the population

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.920
 had enough of that and so were not hypothyroid

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.240
 and that indoctrinated the whole country to believe that

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.440
 only five percent of the population is

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.520
 really hypothyroid but in the 60s

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.040
 it turned out that that test was complete nonsense

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.320
 that didn't measure anything of significance but

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:59.400
 what stuck was the doctrine that 95 percent of the people

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.960
 are not hypothyroid and the

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.000
 synthroid type thyroxine

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.160
 was tested in the 1940s on

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.760
 young male medical students who were healthy

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.280
 and they said oh it works just like thyroid

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:20.160
 but the fact is that it was not tested on women

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.200
 and women because of the high estrogen

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.640
 that is exaggerated by low thyroid

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.200
 women who are low thyroid have

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.440
 almost a complete inability to respond

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.600
 to thyroxine because it has to be activated by the liver

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.640
 and over and over I see women who get

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:46.320
 more and more hypothyroid as they take more and

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.360
 more thyroxine and

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:52.480
 sometimes this happens in men sometimes men

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.600
 can respond because their livers are not as poisoned by estrogen

00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.280
 I'm sorry to do this Ray but you know I actually know a lot of people who

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.720
 taking a combination of medications including some synthroid have done

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.440
 really well

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.880
 so I don't know. Sometimes it works but

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:13.320
 it's utterly unscientific. That may be so actually

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.560
 but then there's that quality of the body as a laboratory

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.480
 well it's better than nothing for sure but it very often goes the wrong

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.360
 direction

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.680
 Collar thank you for your call. I guess we should move

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.240
 you know let me ask you something if people were to experiment with

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.120
 losing a lot of people are supplementing with essential fats like primrose oil

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.560
 and flaxseed oil and everything

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.280
 because it makes them feel better when I asked you about that initially you said

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:37.880
 because

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.080
 it has an inhibitory effect on the immune system and so you get less inflamed

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.680
 because of that

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.240
 how would you stop taking something like that if it's making you feel better

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:50.000
 fish oils are the ones that are more effective

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.960
 anti-inflammatory agents but

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.720
 there's a generalized anti-immune function such that

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.720
 they used to sell emulsions for intravenous use of

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.560
 vegetable oils as feeding for cancer patients but

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.600
 since it made the patients die faster then they discovered that it was

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.760
 destroying their immune systems now they use the very same emulsions

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.680
 for organ transplant patients just because it does

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.720
 suppress immunity. Okay so basically maybe

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.240
 up the fish oils get rid of the other stuff is a transitional thing

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.480
 possibly anyway let's let's move to some more collars

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.720
 Collar you're on the air with KPFA do you have a question? Hello

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.200
 yes I've had chronic fatigue syndrome for

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.400
 15 years do you have any information that might help me

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.280
 yeah very often it starts

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.520
 with either thyroid or beans in the diet

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:51.320
 or beans are very common dietary factor

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:55.000
 they contain antigens that

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.520
 make them a more complex

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.800
 toxin that cause

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.280
 the liver and the intestine and the thyroid

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.440
 to malfunction and

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.960
 you can break the cycle sometimes just with diet

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:15.240
 but usually thyroid is an important

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:18.960
 thing to consider. Okay, Hunter Gather Diet.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.520
 I think I've talked about it in newsletters

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.480
 one called the bean syndrome which involves

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.640
 muscle soreness as well as chronic fatigue

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.120
 several people have written about it in the past but

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.320
 can people get back issues of your newsletters?

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.160
 I don't like to mention that because it

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.120
 takes a long time to find the back issues. What about Nutrition for Women

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.640
 your book does it talk about it there?

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.040
 No I think the progesterone book is the one

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.640
 people should start with. Okay, Collar thank you for your call

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:57.200
 thank you. Let's move to another. Collar you're on the air

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.920
 yeah I wasn't listening to the beginning of the show so I don't know whether you spoke about this but

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:05.360
 when you're talking about treating low thyroid how do you treat it?

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.320
 Oh boy I don't know if we can give you a short answer we've got a lot of people

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.600
 waiting to call in

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:14.160
 it depends on where you're starting from sometimes

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.160
 four ounces of orange juice every hour

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:21.680
 through the day for several days is all it takes to

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:25.520
 activate the thyroid. Sometimes it takes adding

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.240
 eggs or milk to the diet. If you're not allergic?

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.520
 Yeah depending on what the limiting

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.600
 factor is in your thyroid problem sometimes

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.200
 one dose of progesterone can

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.480
 break a person out of the cycle. Sometimes

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:47.280
 dropping out vegetable oils or beans or nuts or seeds

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.720
 is all it takes. Yes switching to a higher protein diet without those

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.480
 items in it and low grain too the grain is irritating as well

00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:00.320
 yeah. Okay Collar thank you. Let's move on

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.880
 Collar you there? Go ahead please.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.480
 We're having some... Hello? Yeah are you there? Oh yeah gee I don't know

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.000
 great okay. Go ahead please. Hello can you hear me?

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.440
 Yes please go ahead. Have you done any research on the connection between

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.640
 high estrogen levels and fibroid tumors

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.240
 or and obesity? Of course. Sure that was

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:27.240
 well documented by 1950 Alexander Lipschut

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.520
 and his group showed that the very

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.920
 smallest incredibly small dose of

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.280
 estrogen that he used if it was allowed to act continuously

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.640
 without interruption by pregnenolone or progesterone or thyroid

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.280
 was first produced

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:50.080
 fibromas in the uterus then the breast

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.080
 then the intestine then

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:58.640
 the fibromas tended to progress eventually to cancer of every organ

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.600
 he was one of the people who documented the natural history

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.920
 of estrogen induced cancers and

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.360
 fibromas are just an early influence of estrogen

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.800
 primarily in the uterus and breast but ultimately

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.000
 in all connective tissues and

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.800
 other types of cell. What can you do about it?

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.920
 Thyroid is the basic thing I've had people

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.360
 get into a slightly hyper thyroid state taking

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.440
 a good balanced thyroid supplement

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:35.280
 and month by month they have documented that the thyroid alone

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.080
 is able to shrink the uterine fibroid

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.080
 really without using progesterone? Yeah the progesterone

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:46.000
 was tested and does work but partly it works through the

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.080
 thyroid and the essential thing is to take enough thyroid to get your estrogen

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.040
 way down

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:56.640
 even below normal for a while. Where do you get it? You have to go to the doctor. Yeah you do and that's

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.440
 going to be an interesting argument I don't even want to hear that argument

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.440
 Collar thank you for your call. Good luck. I actually

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.760
 have heard of people just changing in my experience with clients that I've had

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.920
 just changing their diet and getting rid of the grains getting the protein out

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.920
 getting rid of the beans getting rid of the soy

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:15.240
 and getting them on some supplemental progesterone and it has worked

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.760
 That's ultimately the best thing but if they're in a hurry to have a baby or

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.320
 something

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.120
 they can speed it up. You have to get some black market thyroid.

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:27.160
 Alright let's take just one or two more quick calls. Collar you're on the air

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.280
 Hi I was just wondering I missed the very beginning of the show

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.160
 and what in what relation are you talking about the thyroid right now?

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.160
 Well you know what we're not going to be able to go back because it's way too

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.560
 but you can order a tape of the show and if you take my number down at the end. Okay well then I've

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.120
 got a question. Okay.

00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.120
 I eat a diet very high in beans

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.600
 and grains and I've been experiencing lots of fatigue

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.560
 Right that's what we've been talking about. Thyroid symptoms, my thyroid has been kind of

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.080
 I've been noticing it which is unusual. Ray did you pay this guy?

00:54:56.080 --> 00:55:01.400
 A few weeks ago there was an article in the newspaper about China

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.480
 having 25 million Cretans and 100 million hypothyroid

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:11.240
 people at least and just a couple days after that article

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:14.640
 someone said but you say soy is

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.520
 poisonous because it's estrogenic and anti thyroid. What about all the Asians?

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:24.000
 And I said yeah it's proven that it causes

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.960
 hypothyroidism. Collar I've made it my mission

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:31.120
 since I've been on the radio to get people to look at this problem it's not

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:32.360
 that I have some kind of

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.960
 moral thing about vegetarian diets I just found that they're not entirely

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.240
 healthy for everyone.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.960
 Yeah I'm not entirely vegetarian I do eat meat occasionally.

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.400
 Well you can experiment with dropping the beans and

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.880
 pulling back on the vegetable oils and certainly not cooking with vegetable oils

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:48.720
 and eating more

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.000
 potatoes. Yeah don't do that.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.640
 Ordinary potatoes especially if they're fried in coconut oil

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:59.660
 are often fantastically

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.080
 therapeutic for people with a dietary problem.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.400
 That's a long story but potatoes have an extremely high quality protein.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:11.200
 What do you think of protein supplements? You know what we're not going to have

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.920
 to, I'll let Ray answer you real quick.

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:20.480
 They're generally produced under oxidative conditions that damage the

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.120
 protein

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:25.960
 seriously so you can get much better protein

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.360
 much cheaper from natural milk and eggs or potatoes.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.920
 We're going to have to stop. I don't want to stop but we have to stop.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:38.880
 Ray Peet we've given out a PO box for him it's at the front desk of KPFA.

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.240

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.720
 willing to do it.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.960
