 Tune in and call in this Sunday at 1.30 p.m. to Edge of the Herd.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Keep your heads up.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 And support for KMUD comes in part from Golden Dragon Medicinal Syrup,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 an anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antibacterial, antioxidant medicine made without heat or ice.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Golden Dragon Medicinal Syrup is organic, edible, topical, cosmetic, and water-soluble.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Time will be made available for other viewpoints.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Thank you for joining us.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 And, you know, for the record, that was not my view.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 They made me say that, and I think that is the one thing that the station does have as its own view,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 is that the views are yours.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Anyway, here comes...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Ask Your Doctor.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Ask Your Doctor.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000

 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 My name's Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 which run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m.,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herbal extracts,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 which are either grown on our CCF certified herb farm,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD, Garboville, 91.1 FM,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 to this month's mixed topic of hormone replacement therapy,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 estrogen, along with the inflammatory effects of estrogen,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 as well as some other popularly accepted hormones like serotonin, melatonin, and 5-HTP,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 so we can discuss the roles of those particular materials in our bodies

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 and why they're not actually that good for us.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 So once again, we're very pleased to be joined by Dr. Ray Peat,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 who will be sharing his research and knowledge surrounding these topics.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 The number here, if you live in the area, is 923 3911,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 or if you live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 We can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-ERB for further questions

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 during normal business hours, Monday through Friday.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 So science, whilst responsible for many excellent breakthroughs,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 is unfortunately subject to the same scandals that beset many excellent thoughts.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 While studying physiology myself, I, like many others,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 was subject to what I now understand as an indoctrination, if you will,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 into an erroneous state of pseudo-fact,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 and that one of those things was the receptor model used in physiology,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 with one particular hormone, namely estrogen,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 which will be the subject, partly at least, of tonight's discussion with Dr. Peat,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 this being a perpetrator of much deceit on the behalf of Big Pharma.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Why was HRT so promoted and how did the truth behind estrogen effects get so covered up?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Well, this question and many other answers will be opened up in tonight's Ask Your Herb Doctor,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 including the facts surrounding the melatonin, serotonin, 5-HT craze.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 So thank you once again, Dr. Peat, for joining us on the show.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 OK.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Again, as always, we always get comments from people after the show.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 I know a lot of people that listen to the show have either emailed us or contacted us

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 regarding information that you've been sharing

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 and how they can get hold of more information so they can be a little bit better informed.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Now, as usual, some people will have tuned into the show and maybe have never heard of you.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Would you just open up with your background, your scientific background?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 OK. As a kid, I was interested in science, but I would read old medical books and encyclopedias and such.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 And I very early got the impression that education was largely indoctrination.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And I found that literature as an undergraduate was a field where I could see the actual evidence,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 the material that we were studying without interpretation of the professors.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 So it was years and years later that I finally decided to go to graduate school in science

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 when I realized that I could get through it without having to fight with the professors.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 I could just be quiet and do what I wanted to do.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 So I enrolled at the University of Oregon in the biology department,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 starting as specializing in nerve biology.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 I was interested in how the brain could do things like handling language and images and such.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 And I saw that the whole direction of the brain biology was towards a very reductionist computer analogy.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 And looking around the department, I saw that the other end of the organism,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 the reproductive physiology, was much more scientific.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And so I shifted over to that specialization.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 My professor, if I would get unusual results, would say, "Well, if it's repeatable, just go ahead."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 But in the nerve biology section, if the results or the interpretation were a little off,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 you had to throw away the evidence.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Okay, well that word "indoctrination" I think is a very good place to start tonight's expose.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 I know the scandal surrounding HRT that was kind of revealed as it were mainstream not too long ago

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 is a very good place to begin tonight's talk.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 In terms of indoctrination and the models that were so popular then and probably still are now,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 when I was studying the whole receptor-ligand interaction was just dogmatic

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 and a particular compound elicited a particular effect when it was bound to an enzyme or to a cell,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 that surrounding estrogen, the estrogen receptor,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 you actually have a very good understanding of the background enzymatically,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 how it was before it was taken over by...

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And unfortunately, I know it's another conspiracy as it were,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 but it's the truth in terms of pre-1940s with the enzyme...

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 The people studying enzyme interactions were then effectively taken over by Big Pharma

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 and corporate manufacture for want of increase from their products

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 and the whole estrogen receptor is a bit of a non-entity, I understand.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Yeah, it was 1970 when I was working on my dissertation

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 and I was studying the metabolism of the uterus in aging animals

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 and trying to understand why in middle age infertility came about

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 and the particular metabolic studies that I was doing

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 corresponded to increased estrogenic stimulation with aging

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 and that led me, since all of the current textbooks in the 1960s

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 were saying that menopause is when the ovaries wear out and stop producing estrogen.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 So I read way back to about 1900 and up to the 1940s and '50s

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 and I saw there was a sudden change in 1942 all through the 1930s

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 when my thesis advisor was a student into the 1940s.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 His thesis advisor was Richard Blandau

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 who was later at the University of Washington Medical School

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 and Soderwald and Blandau were among the people who were studying

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 the effects of excess estrogen on the uterus

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 and they showed that if you gave a greater dose,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 increasing amounts of estrogen caused miscarriage at earlier

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 and the smallest dose would cause miscarriage at a very early stage

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 and if you waited until very late in the pregnancy it would take a bigger dose

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 but it was a very continuous graded effect

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 in which the estrogen, slight excess, would be sufficient to kill the developing embryo

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 and this was going on all through the late 1930s into the 1940s

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000
 and the hormones of the ovary were identified in the mid-1930s

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 as the very major substance produced in the ovary was progesterone

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 and estrogen was a minor substance

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 and it turned out that other people doing research on how estrogen worked at this time

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 saw that soot, just put a spoon in a candle flame and then extract it in a solvent

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 you could get hundreds of different estrogenic substances out of just soot

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 and this was wonderful for the drug industries because everyone could find an estrogen patent

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 but there was only one natural progesterone and so that was not a viable drug

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 because no one had a patent on it

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 so by 1942 the 13 major estrogen companies had their synthetic estrogens

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 and the situation scientifically was that estrogen caused infertility

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 and was associated with aging

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 but since they had products they said here we have the female hormone

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 and being female means being able to have babies

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 and so estrogen must be what causes women to have babies

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 and they wanted to sell it for some popular use

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 so they could sell it to millions of women

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 and they came up with the idea that it would prevent miscarriage

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 even though the science said the opposite

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 and they got a teen man and wife at Harvard to promote the idea that diethylstilbestrol, D.E.S.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 D.E.S. which is just awful

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 yeah, that it would prevent miscarriages

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 and so they were prescribing it for years to women to prevent miscarriage

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 and to make a healthier baby and so on

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 and it turned out, well probably they never would have had to stop selling it

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 even though it was causing cancer and deformity

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 but about the same time it was getting recognized that D.E.S. causes cancer

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 and doesn't prevent miscarriage but actually increases the risk

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 they were getting interested in a new product to sell to even more women

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 the birth control pill

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 so when they decided that the time was right

00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 in the 1940s they didn't want their drug company known as the abortion producer

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 but by 1959 or 60 abortion was becoming, or contraception was becoming acceptable

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 but still abortion was a taboo

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 so they invented a story saying that if you take estrogen it will suppress your body's estrogen

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 and prevent miscarriage by lowering your estrogen

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 and so they came out with the contraceptive so called abortion pill

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 just as it was recognized that D.E.S. was causing miscarriages and cancer

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 so they lost one product but immediately came out with another falsified story

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 to sell the birth control pill

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 in terms of the dogma behind receptor physiology

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 what is the truth behind whether or not estrogen binds to a specific receptor

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 and the lies surrounding the so called science that was produced in order to support the estrogen industry

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 these people who were doing the real science were trying to explain why estrogen had these toxic effects

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 and they thought that natural estrogen was imitated by these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soot

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 which were famous and recognized as carcinogens

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 and estrogen was known to be carcinogenic

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 and so they were studying the properties of soot and estrogen

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 and finding that given estrogenic properties

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 the substance was also intended to produce inflammation and cancer

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 which is a very close association electronically in the nature of the molecule

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 and these were activating enzyme systems in particular ways

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 according to the exact nature of that inflammatory carcinogenic estrogenic electronic configuration

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 and this was reaching a peak in the 1950s

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 and the government moved some of their investment from chemical warfare into endocrine research

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 the opinion of many people is that the intention was to use it for population control

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 and that the Nazis had been using estrogen on people in slave camps and such

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 but the US government got very interested in estrogen after the second world war

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 and they gave a big grant to a group

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 it's an ongoing tradition of a group associated with the University of Chicago, Michigan and Lawrence

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Livermore Radiation Lab and UC Berkeley

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 the project that was funded for Elwood Jensen was the leader of it

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 he had been working in chemical warfare

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 and wanted to create a new idea for how estrogen worked

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 that would not involve all of this interesting chemistry

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 which explained why estrogen was a very intense toxin, a carcinogen

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 he wanted to say that all it does is activate the female genes

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 that women are characterized by having a uterus and breasts

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 and the function of these is governed by their genes, their female genes

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 and these genes are activated in their particular organs

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 and estrogen somehow turning a switch that would only activate those female genes

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 and not involve all of this nasty chemistry of cancer and inflammation

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 but they knew that soot caused cancer in the late 1800s from the chimney sweeps

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 but that was exactly what Jensen wanted people to forget

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 just forget all of this enzymology and chemistry that people have been working on

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 which in such elegant ways showed the similarities of the carcinogens and estrogens

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 but he wanted to say that it's like a lock and key

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 the female organs have a very specific lock

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 and the estrogen is the key that sticks only into that lock

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 estrogen receptors are now known to be found all throughout the body right?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 and in men

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 but at that time the real science was thinking of the whole cell and the whole organism

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 as the responsive unit to things like estrogen

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 but Elwood Jensen would, he was arguing that there was just one little switch molecule in the cell

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 which would neatly turn on only the female genes

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 and so it wouldn't have the possibility of any of these other actions

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 the defense department funded, well the atomic energy commission gave him permission to use radioactive isotopes

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 and supplied the isotopes

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 and other labs, his competition didn't have either the grants or the isotopes

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 they were very tightly controlled by the atomic energy commission

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 and he labeled estrogen and found that it concentrated in organs like the uterus

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 and since the enzymologists were saying that it affects the whole energy system of the organism and the cell

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 changing the oxidation reduction processes and participating in the chemistry of the cell

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 he labeled two different kinds of estrogen, put labels in two different places

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 and added them to the uterine tissue and said that there was no interchange between the two

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 there were no oxidative reactions in which estrogen participated

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 and he published that I think it was 1962

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 and that the enzymologists had been, the whole thing was based on estrogen participating as a chemical reactant

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 and he had the only means by which to demonstrate what he claimed

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 so his opponents didn't have the grants or the isotopes to challenge that

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 to disprove it, because the research up until that point had been showing that estrogen causes cancer

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 but the drug companies after 1942 wanted to sell the oral contraceptive pill, they wanted to sell DES

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 which is known to cause cancer for generations later and the babies of the mothers who took it

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 and now HRT, so we're talking about three different majorly used drugs that they knew caused cancer

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 and doctors are still prescribing them today

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 and some of the particular enzymes involved in cancer and estrogen function were well known to the enzymologists

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 and Elwood Jensen's group said no they don't use the fancy isotope demonstration

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 to say no they don't participate, they're not oxidized and reused

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 but 10 or 15 years later after the receptor dogma had been imposed on the world of biology

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 other people started using isotopes and showing that yes the older enzymologists were exactly right

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 estrogen does participate as a catalyst in enzyme reactions

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 especially trans-hydrogenation reactions that connect energy production to gene turnover and cell growth and so on

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 so that's how it initiates cancer cells?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 yes, it allows the energy to be short circuited over into the growth rather than the function mechanism

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 so the cell stops functioning and doing its normal cellular functioning and just the estrogen turns on the cell growth processes?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 yes, it drains the energy right out of function into growth

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 very scary

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 ok one sec, you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Galbraithville 91.1 FM

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 either related or unrelated to this month's topic or mixed topics of estrogen, DHT, serotonin

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 and those hormones that are particularly bandied around by doctors and the mainstream as being helpful and beneficial

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 when in fact the science is there quite clearly to say the opposite

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 and we are very privileged to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat who has many years of research under his belt

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 to just tell us all about it

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 so Dr. Peat, again I'm interested about the, because I know that I've mentioned this in the past

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 and I think you brought it up on one of the previous shows

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 about water, water, H2O as we know it, is not just straightforward water

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 and I read some alchemical treaties about the way they would capture lightning water

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
 or water that was subjected to fall out during storms

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 and how this water was energetically more active

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 and actually modern science has shown that H2O exists in many different states

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 and there is a very different mechanism by which water can act cellulally or intracellularly

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 and I'm interested from a point of view of what we're talking about now with estrogen involved in redox reactions

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 how that actually comes out in terms of its cancer promoting

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 well the fastest change that you can see in a cell within a minute or two of exposing it to estrogen

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 is that it just instantly starts taking up water

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 and as it takes up water, the water gets out of the cells control

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 and that's part of this short circuiting the energy process

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 the microtubules that are an organizing force in the cell

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 that lets it do the work it's supposed to

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
 these are depolymerized in the presence of estrogen and disorganized

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 and that's part of the cancer problem that the cell can't communicate from one part to the other

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
 because the microtubules are messed up

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 and the division process even can reach the point where it can't separate the chromosomes evenly

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 and then you get imbalance of chromosomes making the cancer degenerate

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 the water is normally under control of adjoining surfaces

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 so that it's very unlike bulk water but in the presence of estrogen it becomes bulk like

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 so that one of my experiments at the university was to put an old uterus

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 a young uterus and an estrogen treated uterus in an MRI machine

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 and we could show that the old uterus and the estrogen treated uterus had loose water

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 disorganized water that could be distinguished from the young healthy uterus

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 interesting, ok, it's coming up close to 7.30 so I just want to let people know that

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 from any time on people are welcome to call in with questions related or unrelated to this month's show

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 so far as other hormones are concerned the whole hormone replacement therapy

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 just give me your opinion of the HRT's effects and why it was eventually taken out

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 well, still not taken out, people still, it's not as popular

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 in England there's a big backlash against it

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 the industry succeeded so greatly in turning science completely upside down in the case of estrogen

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 that that took a lot of other hormones with it

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 progesterone was suppressed and ignored because it would cure the things that estrogen was claimed to cure

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 and it couldn't be patented as you said

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 yeah, and prolactin had many toxic effects that were well recognized

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 but since estrogen increases prolactin there was a great pressure not to think very much about what it means

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 that prolactin causes bone loss and contributes to osteoporosis

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 but it wasn't popular to think of the fact that estrogen increases prolactin

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 and serotonin is another thing that has been strongly influenced by this inverted interpretation of estrogen

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 because estrogen increases exposure to serotonin

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 serotonin is one of the means by which estrogen increases prolactin

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 and serotonin does many of the harmful things that estrogen and prolactin do

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 including a direct cause of bone loss

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 people who take the fluoxetine type of antidepressants

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 are seen to have a lot of premature bone loss because of the excess exposure to serotonin

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 and the associated prolactin

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 and serotonin is in a way kind of a co-factor for estrogen

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 estrogen increases serotonin systemically and serotonin in turn increases the production of estrogen

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 so when one gets out of control they both tend to become dominant

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 and serotonin is involved in the inflammations produced by estrogen

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 well we're all told that serotonin is the feel good hormone

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 and they give you SSRIs

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 yeah they give you antidepressant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 so you can feel better

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 so it's more present in the circulation

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 and so it's just the same brainwashing they're trying to do to us like they did with the estrogen

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 saying estrogen prevents bone loss when actually it causes bone loss

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 so serotonin helps your depression and in fact has all these negative side effects

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 of increased bone loss, increased estrogen levels, increased risk of cancer

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 yeah one of the currently bad effects of serotonin excess is getting some recognition

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 even though in the 1950s all of the bad features of serotonin were recognized in a disease involving tumors in the intestine

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 that produced too much serotonin

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 but in just the last 2 or 3 years the hypertension of the pulmonary artery is being seen to be caused by serotonin

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 and the drugs that increase serotonin increase this pulmonary hypertension

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 and degeneration of the valves in the right side of the heart

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 this was known in the 1950s as the main deadly complication of having that serotonin producing tumor

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 but finally 60 years later it's being recognized as a way to treat pulmonary hypertension by using anti-serotonin drugs

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 gosh, ok we do actually have a caller on the line Dr. Peat

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 yes, I sometimes have a tendency toward depression

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 and I like to do more natural things when I can and stay away from the hard drugs when I can

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 so I resisted trying if you like Zoloft or Prozac or any of that

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 but I was told by some nature doctors to try 5-HTP

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 matter of fact I was told by another couple of people that I inquired that had depression

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 and they said that this 5-HTP was something natural that would help you use your own serotonin better

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 and be more like kind of a natural Prozac

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 now are you telling me that that is not good for you?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 that that's going to make you either make more, does it make you make more serotonin or utilize what you have better?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 the Prozac type drugs keep the platelets and nerve cells from binding and keeping serotonin out of the way

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 and so they lead to overexposure to the serotonin

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 are you familiar with 5-HTP?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 that's what you get at the health food store, that's supposed to be like an amino acid

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 yeah, plain tryptophan is bad enough but the 5-hydroxy tryptophan is one step closer to being serotonin

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 so you think that it's not good for me to take it?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 everything that I know suggests that for example there's increased risk of breast cancer and obesity and many bad effects

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 how can it increase obesity?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 by slowing metabolism and suppressing thyroid

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 5-HTP does that?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 the antidepressants?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 I don't mean like Prozac, I'm just talking about 5-HTP

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 it hasn't been studied as much as the antidepressants but it works to raise your serotonin

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 it's basically providing you the precursor in your body makes more serotonin out of it

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 so the effects of serotonin in excess are going to be increasing estrogen which slows your liver's metabolism

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 that can slow your thyroid down, that can lead to obesity, by increasing estrogen it can promote cancer

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 Janet says it elevates your mood

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 well you have to weigh it up, it might elevate your mood but you also risk these other things

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 they used to give x-rays to help with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 oh whoopsie daisy, sorry you got cancer, my aunt had a lot of x-ray treatment for her acne on her back

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 and she had a terrible form of breast cancer which turned into bone cancer and she died at the age of 50

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 well I certainly don't want to slow my metabolism or my thyroid down or any of that

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 I've done with the menopause thing so I figure my estrogen has balanced itself out and I've never taken the replacement

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 it seems like he's not talking about how it became so outrageously popular for women with menopause

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 the little pink pills, the HRT, hormone replacement therapy that everybody was taking because they didn't like having hot flashes

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 and other things that would move the swings and menopause symptoms

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 but my approach was that it was a natural occurrence and so it didn't really need to be medically changed

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 I just feel I had a symptom that was bad enough that I needed medical intervention

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 maybe I was just lucky and I had mild symptoms although I did have a lot of hot flashes

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 but it was only the last maybe 4 or 5 years that it's been suggested that I take this 5-HTP as if it was like on rest

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 I mean I don't need to increase my serotonin if it's going to slow down my thyroid and up my estrogen and be bad for my heart valve

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 that's right

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 so that's all the things that she said it did right?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 yeah and it's not again because Dr. Peat has spent his life researching things and doing research on even the articles

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 is this faulty science? is this promoted by a drug company? who did this research?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 when he says that it's not him saying that as though it's his own opinion he's adopted that opinion from researching the evidence

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 what causes it?

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 I just want to say again that I'm not talking about the Prozac or the Zoloft or the pharmaceutical serotonin drugs

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 I'm specifically talking about 5-HTP which you get at the health food store where it seems like it's this benign thing that can't hurt you

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 I know but it's all part of the same system

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 yeah sure Prozac might increase your serotonin to a much higher degree than taking 5-HTP

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 but it's all working on that same system and if a little bit is that the body naturally produces in the bowel

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 because your bowel naturally produces serotonin and if a little bit is stimulating inflammation and degeneration

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 then you wouldn't want to increase that even through natural means

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 yeah so I should probably do without it and see if my food is okay anyway and just have a stiff upper lip right?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 yeah sounds like a good idea

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 thank you

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 I think unfortunately what comes out time and time again is that the short term is certainly not worth the price of the long term sequelae of disease processes

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 and I think most people, I think us all included, we only really see the short term unless we delve into the facts

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 it's like with fish oils and people's inflammation, it can relieve inflammation to some degree

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 but you also run the risk of suppressing your immune system and damaging your liver in the meantime

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:06.000
 so I think what gets brought out more and more is that the long term risks are certainly very evident and very prevalent

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 and that people, what we're doing here with this show and other previous shows is just highlighting the long term risks

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 and so unfortunately most people don't understand the long term risks and only the short term gain is I think what fuels most people's desires to be on certain drugs

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 but there is a lot of long term risks associated with it and I think Dr. Peat is doing an excellent job of bringing these facts out

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 because it's already there in terms of science articles

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 okay there's two more callers on the line

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 hello

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 hi you're on the air

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 hi Dr. Peat this is wonderful

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 I've talked to you before and I've gotten completely off of my serotonin reuptake inhibitors

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 and I wanted to say that I read a bunch of articles on your site

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 and I have to tell you that one effect of stopping taking these Prozac and these serotonin things

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 is that I've now been able to stop taking, using steroids in an inhaler

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 my asthma has gone away completely

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
 alright well done

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:24.000
 and I just wanted to make sure that I read your website right because I think you said there that it does relate, serotonin does relate to asthma

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 and nobody ever told me that but I'm completely off my inhaler

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 and it's only been a month so I just wanted to tell you that and ask a question about that

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 yeah it does several things related to asthma

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 estrogen is related to asthma too

00:41:43.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 and the effect of the serotonin is to cause localized contraction of the tubes in your lungs as well as causing them to take up water and promote some inflammation

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 but the contraction is the thing that's best studied in connection with asthma

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 well thank you so much that's really interesting because it went away within like four weeks

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 I wasn't having the breathing problems

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 the first week or so I coughed up a lot of liquid but then after that it just quit

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 so anyway thank you very much and I'm going to keep reading your website for articles thank you

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 that's great you coughed out the asthma

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 I don't know what I coughed out but I just coughed up a lot of fluid for like a week but after that it just cleared up and I stopped using the inhaler and I'm not using it anymore and I'm just really grateful

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 fantastic news

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 getting off the serotonin was painful but after I'm off of it now for almost two months so I have to be I'm very grateful so thank you for the information

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 thank you for your call

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 good well there we go that's another glaring example of what we hear frequently

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 so yeah if you want to listen to Dr. Peat truth is out there if you open your ears

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 okay there's another caller

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 hey hello I came in a little bit late to the discussion but I haven't really heard mention of the three different types of estrogen in our bodies

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 they have a hugely disparate impact on our bodies and I think that that's really germane to this conversation so please inform us of that

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 there are probably a dozen important types of estrogen but almost all of them the three main types estriol, estrone and estradiol those are the best known and have been used as drugs

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 those all have pretty much the same effects but just at different potencies so that if you can turn your most potent estradiol into the others you're protected against some of the most toxic effects of estrogen

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 during pregnancy enzymes are detoxifying estrogen by many different routes but the index of a healthy pregnancy is when the estriol is high because that means you're destroying your estradiol very quickly

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 so the estradiol is the most dangerous form and that's usually what I recommend women have tested to make sure their most dangerous form is not too high

00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 and these different forms are exactly the issue that Elwood Jensen denied happened he said estradiol can't turn into estrone and estriol but in fact that's a major way of either activating or inactivating estrogen according to the cell's energy system

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 so the only reason you'd want high estriol is because that would tell us that the estradiol is being detoxified not that high estriol in itself is protective in any way shape or form

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 yeah it's about ten times weaker than estrogen so every little bit of estradiol that you turn to estriol it's a down stepping of your estrogen effect

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 so I'm not sure that's the answer that lady was looking for

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 okay well there's two more callers on the line so

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 hi thank you so much for having me on the show it's really interesting

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 I had a question about modern birth control methods and your opinion of them in terms of how safe they are things such as the pill or the Nuvaring and just in terms of I know that those still have levels of estrogen and do you recommend those as safe contraceptives or do you think that those are still dangerous to your health and I can take my question off the air thank you

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 tremendously decrease the amount of estrogen in the contraceptives but if it's strong enough to kill the embryo it's strong enough to do some damage to the woman

00:46:41.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 and about 30 years ago there was quite a bit of agitation among women's groups for FDA approval of the traditional cervical cap which the ideal thing was made by a metal worker or a dentist with a metal casting outfit

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 they would use a dental mold making material to get an exact impression of the cervix and then they would cast silver or gold or some inactive metal in the shape of the cervix and it would form a vacuum seal and it could be used could be left in place weeks at a time

00:47:33.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 and under the pressure from the women's groups the FDA gave its approval to a rubber so called cervical cap which was actually shaped more like a baby bottle's nipple with a huge projection chamber on the end which was supposed to be filled with spermicidal goo

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 and that immense structural projection caused it to almost instantly be displaced and so they were terribly unsuccessful it was just like a way of inserting a spermicidal cream or jelly

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:41.000
 but the FDA approved that but wouldn't approve the one that actually worked because I think it was because they were simply working for the contraceptive pill industry

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:52.000
 and then as far as IUD they now have IUDs that have hormone that secrete a small amount of hormone inside the uterine cavity so that would be the similar situation

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:11.000
 yeah the signal from inside the uterus travels through nerves and other conduction up the fallopian tube to prevent the ovary from producing the amount of progesterone that it should

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 so any kind of IUD with or without hormones will create a hormonal imbalance which is what is the main thing accounting for the prevention of pregnancy

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 and then thereby increasing your estrogen and increasing risk of cancer

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 yeah

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 so the only the one possible safe method of contraception would be the silver or the gold

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 but they don't make those

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 they don't make them

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 is there anything else other than natural birth control

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
 rhythm or method

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
 fertility awareness method

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 not too much else

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:57.000
 yeah I think the rhythm cycle method is the best

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
 yeah good

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
 another caller I think there's two more

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 hello you're on the air

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000
 caller are you there I think you have something playing in the background

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 well I guess we don't have another caller here so the lines are open so give us a call at 923 3911 and we'll continue on with Dr. Peat

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:31.000
 okay that last call I guess is not there so Dr. Peat going on to the other hormones

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
 we want to talk about melatonin

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 melatonin what do you think of melatonin

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:45.000
 well it has its own endocrine problems it can disturb your progesterone and thyroid production if you take a lot of it

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 but its function seems to be as a way of detoxifying serotonin

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 the trigger that turns the conversion in the pineal gland of serotonin into melatonin

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 it's the adrenergic stress related nerves

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 during the night your stress increases from the lack of light

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 and this adrenergic system causes the pineal to convert serotonin to melatonin

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:32.000
 and in general in various places melatonin is functioning as an antidote to serotonin

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 so biologically it's evidence that you're responding to stress with a detoxifying process

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.000
 and the similar enzymes that exist in the pineal that are activated by the stress

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 can also be found in inflamed joint tissue and in breast cancer for example

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.000
 and serotonin is involved in the pathology of both of those situations

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 so if our enzymes could turn it more quickly into melatonin then there would be less of a serotonin problem

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 but when people actually take melatonin

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:26.000
 sometimes it's probably protecting against the circulating serotonin but in itself in an otherwise healthy person

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 for example in the animal studies it was capable of lowering both progesterone and thyroid while increasing estrogen

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 so in a short term emergency situation it could be okay but again long term it's going to have negative side effects

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:55.000
 yeah, it depends probably on the person but it's much safer than serotonin

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000
 okay, alright we do have two more callers so we'll try to get through them if we can and see how we go

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 you're on the air?

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 yes

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 hi, you're on the air

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 hi, yeah I take a vagin... it's called Vagifem suppository and it's for dryness

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 but I just looked on the package and it says it's extra diol

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 so should I really worry about that because I did have a problem with pretty dry

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 okay, Dr. Peat what would you...

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 people have been studying who are using vaginal creams for example and their blood level of estrogen was even higher than some of the oral pills were causing

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 so it's definitely a systemic hormonal influence wherever you put it

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 right, so obviously if there's any familial... even if there isn't a familial history but especially if there is a familial history of any estrogen cancers so...

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 so Dr. Peat what would you recommend to this lady to use in place of her suppository?

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:29.000
 I've known several women who had pharmacists make them up suppositories with a fairly high dose of vitamin A and a little vitamin E in cocoa butter or other way of introducing it

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 and the vitamin A helps to strengthen the membranes and normalize mucous production

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 okay

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
 okay good, well that's a pretty...

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 and in the meantime if you can't find a pharmacist to make it...

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 yeah you can do that yourself

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 vitamin A, palmitate and vitamin E you can buy those capsules and try that

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 okay, well thank you very much

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 you're welcome, certainly sounds a lot safer than...

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 yeah

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 yeah, what you were using

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 okay good, there's another caller on the line

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
 hello

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
 hi, you're on the air

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:10.000
 hi, what do you think of the bio-identical hormones in low dose?

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
 hmm, very suspicious of people

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 that come from wild yams and...

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
 well it depends which ones are they, estrogen or are they progesterone?

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 well they're the three estrogens but the estradiol is the lowest that you know that are compounded by women's international pharmacy but they're from soy and yam, wild yam

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 and there's no progesterone in there?

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 and progesterone also from vegetable sources as opposed to the synthetic or the animal estrogens that pharmaceutical companies use

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000
 so Dr. Peat what would you recommend to this lady?

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000
 well whether it's his opinion of the bio-identical hormones

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 well all of the hormones that are bio-identical can have, they have to fit into the system in a balanced way

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 and it's okay to have a physiological amount of any of these serotonin, estrogen, melatonin and so on

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 but when you supplement estrogen or serotonin you're most likely increasing something that's already excessive

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 the doctrine of replacement with the natural hormones is building on the history of the estrogen replacement with synthetic hormones

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 and what they neglect is that as a woman ages from age 19 to 39 for example

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:12.000
 there's a steady average increase in the amount of estrogen in her blood stream

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:26.000
 as well as a fairly continuous amount of progesterone which every cycle the estrogen is forced out of the cells all through the body

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000
 by the rising large amount of progesterone

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 and in the 40s progesterone production is no longer able to fully keep up with this steadily increasing estrogen production with aging

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 and as soon as estrogen, as soon as progesterone decreases and can no longer force estrogen out of the cells

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 the blood estrogen level will drop but the estrogen inside the cells will increase

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 publications by some, I think they're Norwegians, Batra and others

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:27.000
 and by Richard Blandau in University of Washington showed that the tissues of old organisms retain much estrogen than the tissues of young animals

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:39.000
 and the fact that you don't find it in the blood is simply because estrogen sticks inside the cells in proportion to the deficiency of progesterone

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 so that was probably the reason why they recommended it is because of low blood levels

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 and so Dr. Peat's advice would be to not use it

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:56.000
 Okay, I'm being made aware that it is 2 minutes to 8 o'clock and the show does wrap up at 8 o'clock

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 so thank you for all those people that have called in

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:06.000
 for anyone else who's listening who wants to find out more about Dr. Raymond Peat who's our special guest this month

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:16.000

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
 Thank you so much Dr. Peat for joining us this evening

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
