00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:08.320
 The following show was recorded on the 29th of January, 2012 with Dr. Raymond Peat.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.720
 It's a part two discussion about progesterone.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.200
 Some podcasts of this show are available at radionumeralforall.net.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.420
 That's radionumeralforall.net.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.480
 And when you get to the website, search for Politics and Science.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 And now here's the show.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.400
 Welcome to Politics and Science.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.680
 I'm your host, John Barkhausen.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.080
 And I'm very happy that Dr. Raymond Peat is returning to the show.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.200
 This is a follow-up show about progesterone from the one we did last week.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.720
 And for those who don't know, Ray Peat has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.200
 with a speciality in physiology.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.920
 And he's done extensive research in the fields of endocrinology and I should say science

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.720
 and chemistry.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:09.880
 I've been reading in both of those areas since I was about 14 or 15 years old.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.600
 You mentioned before that when you were a little kid, you were reading the little blue

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 books.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 Yeah.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.720
 And when did you first encounter Kropotkin?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.680
 This is completely unrelated to our topic, but I was curious about that.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.920
 He was really, besides the little blue books, he was the first really political argument.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:40.880
 His book on cooperation and animals and as a basis for his anarchy theory.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.040
 I think I was 14 when I found that at the library.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.080
 And that shaped my thinking both in politics and in biology.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.600
 Yeah, he was a pretty amazing person.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.800
 And well, back to the subject of progesterone, which we left off last week talking about

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.880
 the Wall Street Journal article about this doctor who had done a lot of research on the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.720
 effect of progesterone on brain damage, both through accidents and through strokes, and

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.080
 found it a very effective therapy.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 I think people recovered twice as fast and probably a lot of people recovered that wouldn't

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.240
 have.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.560
 And there were no negative side effects.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.120
 And I asked you last week about any negative side effects you knew about progesterone.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.200
 And one thing you mentioned was the danger of being over anesthetized by it.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.720
 And I was just wondering, is that a danger from actually stopping your heart if you potentially

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.720
 took too much?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.560
 Or is that just from you might get into an accident if you fell asleep?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.880
 I think what it would do first is stop breathing.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.080
 But up to a certain point, it stimulates breathing.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:09.720
 So it's probably somewhat of an antidote to things like morphine, because progesterone,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:20.960
 as long as it's within something like several hundred milligrams at a time or per day, it's

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.880
 like an imitation of pregnancy where it stimulates breathing.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.160
 But up in the pharmacological range of something like three or four thousand milligrams all

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:43.160
 at once, then instead of being a stimulant to respiration, it just puts everything to

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.720
 sleep.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.840
 And I think that would include the respiratory system at some very high level.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:02.960
 In Mexico, some students were experimenting with the idea that maybe progesterone works

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.160
 like morphine because of those sedative effects.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:19.600
 And so they combined naloxone, the anti-morphine drug, with progesterone and their experimental

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600
 rat died.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:33.040
 And it was okay on a given amount of either of them, but that pretty much said that progesterone

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:47.280
 isn't acting like morphine because the anti-morphine chemical seemed to exaggerate the anesthetic

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.000
 effect of progesterone.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.440
 Is it the equivalent of saying that maybe water supports life, but if you drink too

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.240
 much of it or fall into it, it can potentially kill you?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.540
 What's the range of the dose we're talking about for overdosing on progesterone?

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.440
 No one really has done that.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.440
 My student's rat was the only death that I know of, even experimentally.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:30.360
 In the 1940s, Hans Elie had told his technicians to experiment with very big doses of progesterone.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.480
 And after doing some experiments, they said those high doses had killed the rats.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.200
 And he didn't believe it.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.360
 He said, "What did you do with them?"

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.200
 And they went to the garbage and fished them out.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.960
 And he published photographs holding them by the skin on their back.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.320
 They looked sort of like a wet dishrag, just the most relaxed rat you ever saw.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.720
 But they weren't dead, they were just deeply sleepy.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.560
 But his technicians had thought they'd died.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:21.640
 So I'm not even sure that my students were not mistaken about the naloxone and progesterone

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.880
 combination, but they thought the rat had died.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880
 I see.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.040
 Well, I think that settles that then.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.280
 So it's only potentially fatal in enormous quantities.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.760
 Yeah.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:46.520
 And you also said that vasectomies in men tended to lower progesterone in those men.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.440
 And I was wondering, what's the mechanism behind that?

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:59.280
 Well, it wasn't consistent, but when the men had very distinct symptoms following the vasectomies,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.560
 they studied what was going on and found that the ones who had the symptoms had very low

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.320
 to almost zero progesterone.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.080
 And they recovered when they gave them progesterone.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.480
 But most of the men having vasectomies didn't have any symptoms.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:35.120
 And so my interpretation is that it's a biological analog to what's reasonable in the female.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:44.200
 If the female has an infection in the uterus or tubes, for example, it's biologically

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:51.840
 reasonable to turn off progesterone production so that pregnancy can't happen.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:00.520
 And so irritation in the uterus or tube in the female causes sterility by turning off

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.600
 progesterone and increasing estrogen.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:11.960
 And I think the event in the men who had the bad reaction to vasectomy, I think it was

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:24.160
 the biological equivalent of a signal traveling up the ducts to the testicle, maybe to the

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.520
 pituitary, turning off steroid production.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.440
 So and it's interesting.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.680
 These hormones, they seem very complicated so that when we, as you pointed out before,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:42.120
 try to name them by one purpose that they might have, it gets very confusing.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.840
 So we think of progesterone as, I have been lately thinking of it as the female fertility

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.720
 hormone, but there you have it, that men are actually producing it in their testicles or

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.720
 pituitary.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.920
 And then negative effects that they were experiencing from their vasectomies were actually potent,

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.840
 wasn't it, one of the negative effects?

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.840
 Yeah.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.720
 And I've seen several men, I don't remember whether they had vasectomies or not, but they

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:16.680
 were suffering from impotency and it just immediately was resolved by taking just very

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.960
 small doses a couple of times of progesterone.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.680
 It's sort of like priming the pump.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.800
 Progesterone has a positive feedback apparently in men as well as in women.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:39.000
 People have experimented with slices of either ovary tissue or adrenal tissue which makes

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.160
 some progesterone.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:50.080
 And they found in both cases that if you add a little bit of progesterone, it increases

00:09:50.080 --> 00:10:01.320
 the organ's production of progesterone, positive feedback, which is unusual in hormone regulation.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.280
 And that indicates to me that the body doesn't see it as something you can get too much of.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.680
 Yeah.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.560
 From that kind of engineering, you would think that the body believes that more is always

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.360
 better in the case of progesterone.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:24.680
 Which seems to be what happens in pregnancy.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.120
 If a person is having some biological problem where their progesterone drops off and they

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:38.480
 start bleeding during the pregnancy, there have been studies where women who habitually

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:44.080
 either miscarried or had monthly bleeding every month of the pregnancy and then delivered

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:51.480
 at five or six months, maybe seven months, they would give early in the pregnancy one

00:10:51.480 --> 00:11:00.680
 shot of progesterone and I think it was two-thirds of the women maintained full increasing production

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:07.920
 every week higher than the preceding week until they had a normal nine-month delivery.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:17.120
 Another, I think it was about 30%, required a second injection several weeks later after

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:25.200
 the first one and they too went back to the full production.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:34.720
 I forget the percentages exactly, there was a small group which didn't recover so completely.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.720
 And I know a lot of people are going in for fertility therapy in this day and age, I don't

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.600
 know if it's more than in the past, but do you know, does progesterone still play a big

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.720
 role in modern fertility therapies?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:59.840
 Yeah, but very few of the clinics that specialize in that really understand, if they would read

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:08.600
 more animal research, they would understand people better, but there's really a medical

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:16.440
 bias against endocrine science based on animals.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.280
 And why is that, do you think?

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.600
 I think the marketing thing has done it.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:30.600
 After 40 or 50 years, the estrogen industry said don't pay any attention to the fact that

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:40.000
 estrogen causes clotting, heart attacks, cancer, brain damage, and so on.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.720
 That's just in animals, but it has just the opposite effects in humans.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.880
 That's interesting, yeah, it does seem that they've thrown out a lot of the earlier research

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.800
 that was done back, that you write about quite a bit, back in the early 20th century.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:04.600
 And when the industry wants to sell something that they can't demonstrate in humans, then

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:12.120
 they will base the whole thing on animal experiments, like the osteoporosis thing.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:18.800
 They found that there was no evidence that they could demonstrate bone improvement with

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.600
 estrogen in people.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:26.280
 So they looked around at different animals, tried it on beagle dogs, found that it caused

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.560
 more osteoporosis in dogs, and so they forgot about that and looked around, found that in

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:41.800
 rodents it could seem to be causing increased bone strength.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:49.560
 But it happens that in rodents, even cortisol can increase bone strength.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.320
 There are some situations like prolactin in rats will increase progesterone, where in

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.400
 humans it generally decreases it.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:08.400
 If you look at the interactions, it's really all the same principles that apply in people.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:14.160
 But for example, rodents are generally nocturnal animals and we aren't.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:22.120
 And so you have to take into account what time of day you give the injections, because

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:31.200
 you're either intensifying or weakening their normal rhythms.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:38.760
 And by using animals with an upside-down rhythm compared to humans, you can sometimes get

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.600
 very nice upside-down results.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.600
 I see.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.160
 And you're saying that the pharmaceutical companies who are paying for these studies

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.720
 are actually engineering them that way on purpose.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.720
 Yeah.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:56.480
 They like rat experiments when they can be arranged to sell a product, but they want

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:06.680
 to forget completely about the dog experiments which cause only bad effects.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:12.880
 Going back to estrogen and progesterone, which is the subject of our show today, effect on

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:19.440
 fertility or contraception, I was curious if there's any effect on estrogen or progesterone

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.480
 production when somebody gets a tubal ligation.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:32.840
 Because at the same time that the impotency experiment saw that in men, some other group

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:40.800
 within just a month or two of that publication saw exactly that effect in the result of the

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.160
 tubal ligation.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:51.080
 And that really helped to explain how IUDs work.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:59.400
 And animal experiments had been demonstrating that for years, that if you want to have the

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:05.360
 animal become infertile, you just put a little suture in the uterus.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.060
 That's usually all it takes.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:14.400
 And the signal travels up from the slightly injured uterus to turn off the ovary progesterone

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.400
 production.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:23.240
 And so injuring the tubes does the same thing.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.720
 Not always, but often.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.400
 So that could lead to a progesterone deficiency in somebody who's either had an IUD or a tubal

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400
 ligation.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400
 Yeah.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.400
 Yeah.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400
 Huh.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:41.960
 So let's, if you don't mind, we'll pick up where we left off in your sort of life's path.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.560
 You were, I believe, teaching at naturopathic colleges after you'd gotten your PhD.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.960
 And you, I think where we left off in the last show, you had decided to start recommending

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.880
 progesterone use to some of your nutritional patients.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.960
 You worked as a nutritional consultant, I think, also.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.780
 Yeah.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:12.100
 I guess I was teaching endocrinology at the naturopath school, but I was doing mostly

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.420
 nutritional counseling at home.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:26.740
 And I found that it was more and more involved hormone interactions with the foods.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:38.900
 And so I just, when I saw these two or three women with such absolute recoveries from just

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:51.140
 small amounts of progesterone, I realized that I would be basically injuring people

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:57.900
 that I talked to if I didn't give them the true information that I knew about in animals

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.700
 and was starting to see in humans.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:10.940
 And so I would just mention what I saw was the case.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:21.220
 And over a period of, I guess, two or three years in Eugene, I had spoken to enough women

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:31.140
 about the effects of thyroid and progesterone and their symptoms that the local gynecologists

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:37.700
 had turned 180 degrees in their practice just because there were so many dozens of their

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:45.940
 patients saying that they wouldn't take estrogen and insisted on getting a prescription for

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.740
 progesterone or thyroid.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:55.220
 Just took a couple of years and doctors saw that their business was being affected and

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.660
 so they totally reversed their practices.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:08.860
 And that went on until those doctors retired and then I think the pressure from the industry

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.380
 and profession probably reverted the situation.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.500
 So it sounds like those doctors were pretty open-minded.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.140
 No, very, very closed-minded.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.140
 Okay.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:29.100
 I had a terrible experience of the first dozen or so women who went to them.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.460
 Just awful personal attacks.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:39.460
 The doctors at first would tell the patients not to come back because they had personality

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.020
 defects that they wouldn't accept their advice.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.020
 Like I said, very open-minded.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.020
 Yeah.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.020
 Oh dear.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:53.020
 And we're talking about the late 70s and early 80s at this point, is that right?

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:57.780
 Yeah, between '76 and '82.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:05.860
 Yeah, it's pretty astounding the attitudes of the pharmaceutical companies and the medical

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.860
 world at that point.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.740
 I have a quote here if I can find it from the report that you referred to last time,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.740
 Carla Bronsenberg.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.300
 That's right.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.300
 Which is very available on the web if anybody wants to look it up.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:23.140
 You go to Carla Rothenberg, Google that name, and she wrote a report when she was at Harvard

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.620
 about the history of hormone replacement in this country.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:32.020
 It's about advertising hormone replacement therapy and it relates to what Ray just said

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.060
 about doctors' attitudes.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:46.460
 Barbara Seaman was my contemporary in studying estrogen and progesterone and she wrote a

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.340
 lot of good stuff.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:57.620
 Women and the Crisis in Sex Hormones I think was one of the titles.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:07.260
 She was very good at, despite knowing a thousand times more, when she got the opportunity to

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:15.420
 debate someone from Yale Medical School, for example, they ended up looking like complete

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.660
 ignoramuses, which they were.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:25.700
 But she was very influential against estrogen for progesterone.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.340
 I see, and how do you spell her last name, Ray?

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.340
 S-E-A-M-A-N.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.820
 M-A-N, okay.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.260
 Did you work with her at all or just knew about her?

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.340
 No, I talked to her.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:47.460
 She called up a few years ago and mentioned that we had met after some of my talks, but

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:54.420
 I wasn't aware of who she was when we talked at that time.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:22:01.500
 Here's the ad campaign from hormone replacement therapy, I think back in the '50s and '60s.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.060
 The treated menopausal woman in other ads is a happy, trouble-free wife standing proudly

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.180
 next to her husband because otherwise she would have emotional and physical problems

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.740
 and be a burden to those around her.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:21.140
 An ad for Hoffman LaRoche's Menrium, I guess that's the drug, says, "His wife has a lot

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.300
 of different menopausal symptoms, but only a few really irritate him.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.020
 Her hot flashes, her vertigo, her palpitations, that's her problem.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.980
 What really bothers him is her nervousness, her irritability, and her excessive anxiety,

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.180
 often expressed by endless 'book shuffling,' chain smoking, and reading lamp insomnia."

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.340
 Oh, I see, reading lamp insomnia.

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.820
 "Merinium takes care of the vasomotor symptoms as well as the emotional symptoms.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.620
 This means the symptoms that bother his wife the most and the symptoms that irritate him

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.100
 the most.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.220
 So to help them both get through menopause, remember Menrium."

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.540
 There we go, in case you want to go get some.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:09.500
 Probably off the market at this point, but that was, I thought, a pretty astounding example.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.700
 Yeah, go ahead, Ray.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:26.060
 Well Barbara Seaman went over advertising and the public relations very thoroughly.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:38.340
 And I guess Carla Rothenberg did more on the actual conspiracy aspects, but on public misinformation,

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.660
 Barbara Seaman was very good.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:50.060
 And at one point she mentioned that Hitler had tested estrogen on people in the prison

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.780
 camps as a way to make them meek and submissive.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:03.460
 And she thought that that was probably, if you put it in context with an advertisement

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:11.820
 like the one you read, it makes a more obedient, servile wife.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:17.020
 It's less irritating to the lord and master.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:22.460
 So you were basically helping people find out about progesterone and then they were

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.820
 working on getting their doctors to help them do that, I mean use progesterone.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.380
 And what form would they get the progesterone in from their doctors?

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.260
 And at some point you patented a progesterone formulation, right?

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:44.020
 Yeah, the woman I mentioned, who I talked to and who lectured in my class, who had had

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:53.460
 MS and optic neuritis, she was using exclusively injectable progesterone.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:01.900
 And so she was getting really big amounts of benzoyl alcohol, which is nerve toxic.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:13.940
 And it happens, Hans Selye called it the catotoxic effect of progesterone and pregnenolone,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.860
 that it helps the body destroy toxins and eliminate them.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:30.260
 And even injecting vegetable oil and a toxic solvent, progesterone's antitoxic effect

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:40.580
 is so great that people were just tremendously benefiting from these injections of progesterone.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:48.700
 But sometimes if a doctor didn't like those toxins in the injectable form, there was also

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.620
 a micronized solution in water.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:59.780
 But if they would inject that in the hip, for example, where there was supposed to be

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:09.580
 a good fat pad, sometimes the particle would cause irritation that would cause destruction

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.300
 of the fat cells.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.260
 And they would have a dent wherever they got an injection.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:23.060
 And because of the known toxic effects of the oily version and the irritating effect

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:31.900
 of the so-called water-wettable solutions, and those weren't really just progesterone,

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:38.980
 there was a molecule, a carbohydrate-like molecule attached to the progesterone particle

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.180
 making it wettable.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.220
 And those particles are toxic.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:50.340
 So that was probably what was making the particle destroy the fat cells.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:27:00.500
 But anyway, knowing about the problems with injection and the medical indoctrination that

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:09.300
 stomach acid destroys progesterone, even though the manufacturer involves boiling the steroid

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:18.140
 in acid so your stomach couldn't make it bend in the activity of progesterone.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:26.860
 But anyway, as an alternative, I decided, since I had noticed that I could taste progesterone

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:34.340
 just sticking my hand in the powder, I decided that if I could get doctors to use it on the

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:42.820
 skin, that would let them have the opportunity to see what it really does.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:51.220
 Easy to give to the patient, and the patient wouldn't have to go in and pay for an injection

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.540
 every week and so on.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:28:03.980
 And the first experiments for several months, I would heat it in olive oil and get a good

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:09.820
 high concentration and then the olive oil would, in less than an hour, it would bring

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:15.580
 their blood levels up to a perfectly normal amount.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:28.340
 And I was thinking about the old research, for example, in Italy, in explaining why vitamin

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:38.260
 E would protect against the sterility producing effects and other toxic effects of estrogen.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:47.920
 They explained vitamin E's action as being the progesterone sparer, somehow activating

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.140
 progesterone in the system.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:58.700
 And so I was thinking about those old studies to explain vitamin E's anti-estrogen effects

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:08.140
 and it made me think about what vitamin E is doing in the mitochondrion where progesterone

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.380
 is produced and has its effects.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:22.620
 But I realized that for them to both act in and be produced in the mitochondrion, they

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.660
 have to be compatible in solubility.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:35.580
 And so I dropped some progesterone powder in vitamin E and saw that I could get a 50/50

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.980
 solution with a very pure form of vitamin E.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:44.660
 They were just absolutely inter-soluble.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:59.060
 And so that was a compact, stable way to get doctors to start using the transdermal progesterone.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.860
 I had told them about the effect in olive oil, but no one wanted to have to heat the

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.820
 solution up every time they applied it.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:21.100
 But you could get a stable 5, 10, or 20% solution that would be convenient to rub into the skin.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:28.220
 But you only absorb maybe 10 or 20% at best when you rub it into the skin.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:38.260
 And so after doctors were willing to prescribe it for their patients using it on the skin,

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:47.020
 then I pointed out to them that they could take it orally and save about 80% of the cost

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:51.500
 at least.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:56.260
 So even when it's dissolved in vitamin E, which I guess it just does without even heating

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.060
 it, it's just totally compatible with vitamin E?

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.020
 Yeah, you don't have to get it hot.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:09.580
 Just warming it so that it's thin enough to stir and just stirring it at room temperature

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.460
 will do it.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.940
 And when you buy progesterone, it's in a powder form, is that right?

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:22.940
 Yeah, crystals or micro-crystals.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:28.100
 A lot of it is still sold with the carbohydrate wetting agent attached.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:34.900
 And they don't even list that as an ingredient, but it's a potential toxin.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.860
 I see.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:44.820
 And why is only 20% absorbed through the skin when you put it on with the vitamin E?

00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:56.900
 Well, it binds to the skin, the cells collapse as they mature and prepare to shed.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:04.660
 And the keratin fibers, the protein that makes up part of the structure of the cell, these

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:14.980
 are cross-linked and become sort of a semi-tanned, hardened barrier to water.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:25.460
 But they bind oil so that the oils in your skin link to these cross-linked keratin proteins

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:32.260
 and make like a raincoat effect, closing off the surface to the water.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.940
 But those also bind progesterone very strongly.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:45.260
 And so the progesterone will saturate those, and some of it passes on and gets into your

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:52.100
 deeper tissues from which it can be gradually absorbed into the bloodstream.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:33:04.980
 But a good part of it sticks on these superficial barrier cells, and then those are shed.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.980
 I see.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.380
 So it might be good for your skin if you're having skin problems, but if you're trying

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.380
 to get it in further...

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:17.540
 Yeah, it's more economical just to take it orally because when it's dissolved in oil,

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:28.380
 when you eat a lot of fat in your diet, your bile emulsifies it so it breaks down into

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:38.420
 very small particles about the size of a bacterium, the chylomicrons that will pass through intestinal

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:47.860
 cells into the lymphatic ducts that are called black teals because the absorbed fat particles

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.540
 give it a milky look.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:58.620
 And from there it goes right into the bloodstream as little fat globules that circulate.

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:07.740
 They're much smaller than red blood cells, and they circulate and reach all the tissues

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:17.340
 directly as fat particles, but also the liver will eventually metabolize them and help to

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:22.260
 distribute whatever was in the fat.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:31.300
 And since the progesterone and vitamin E are fat soluble, they get divided up as you're

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:38.300
 digesting your other fats in the chylomicrons which get directly into the bloodstream.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:48.140
 If you eat powdered progesterone, the cells of your intestine have the same enzymes that

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:59.260
 the liver has for adding sugar to hormone molecules and making them water soluble.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:07.260
 And so when the crystalline progesterone hits your intestine cells directly, a lot of it

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:16.660
 is processed just as it would be in the liver, and the rest of it is sent from the intestine

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.700
 as a particle into the liver for further processing.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:28.620
 So you lose a big part of your progesterone if you take it still in the crystalline form.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:34.700
 But when it's in the fat globule form, it bypasses the liver because it's taken up as

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:38.700
 these nutritional fat particles, chylomicrons.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:44.860
 That's a good explanation, thanks.

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:52.580
 So basically something like 99% of it gets into your circulation quickly when you eat

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.340
 it in the oil form.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:36:01.260
 And it would be distributed probably in the same proportion that your circulation works,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:06.100
 so that if your brain is getting a lot of circulation, then it will get a lot of progesterone.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:14.420
 Yeah, everywhere red blood cells go, these chylomicrons will circulate a few times.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:21.900
 So how difficult, when did you decide to patent it and what was your thinking on that?

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:30.420
 I wrote, I was constantly submitting articles to medical and science journals, and medical

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:37.060
 journals didn't want to have anything to do with it because they were doing business with

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:43.660
 the estrogen industry basically, didn't want anything good about progesterone.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:50.940
 And since I couldn't get anything published about it, I was just having to give talks

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:56.340
 up and down the West Coast to alternative medical groups and such.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:03.180
 And so I wanted to get the information out and figured that publishing it as a patent

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:08.980
 would be the only way I could get it on the record and openly distributed.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.820
 So was it difficult getting the patent from the government?

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:25.100
 No, I wrote up the whole story and sent it in and I think it was the patent examiner

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:36.220
 talking to me through a lawyer, said you can't say anything about cancer if you want to get

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:47.500
 the patent issue and said that that's a standard rule that the only thing they really are concerned

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.300
 about the accuracy of is a cancer claim.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:38:04.980
 And so I just deleted the things that I said about the things I had seen it do to cancer.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.380
 And so it went right through.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:13.220
 What is the prejudice against cancer claims?

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:21.140
 Just that it would be used as a marketing tool by the cancer industry.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:29.020
 You can claim perpetual motion, free energy, all kinds of things in a patent.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:35.140
 There are thousands of those crazy patents and the examiners, if you can draw a picture

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.260
 of it, they'll patent it.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.900
 But they have some standards.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:49.660
 So once you patented it, did you figure out some way to make it available to people who

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.700
 wanted to buy it?

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.620
 I was mixing up some myself and selling it.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:05.100
 Sean Lee, for example, was one of the first people who started buying my mixture.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:12.740
 And I tried to get various people to manufacture it over the years.

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:20.060
 As long as I had the patent, I thought that I could make an arrangement for a drug company

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:27.140
 to use the patent themselves as a basis for marketing it.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:36.980
 And that I could keep them some control by whatever arrangement I made in licensing it

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:42.300
 so that they couldn't take it off the market by buying the patent.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:48.220
 So I talked to all the big drug companies and they said, "No, thanks."

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:54.940
 And those drug companies then, about a year or two later, came on the market with a crystalline

00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:00.980
 progesterone mixed with oil.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:05.580
 They saw that there was increasing interest in progesterone so they had to get on the

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:15.300
 market but probably my having the patent on vitamin E as the solvent prevented them from

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:25.060
 messing with that even though it was the economically effective way to have progesterone.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.180
 They would mix it with things like peanut oil.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.540
 That's what I was going to ask.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.540
 What oils did they use?

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:33.180
 So that sounds rather toxic.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.900
 Yeah, and it's not a very good solvent.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:47.500
 It does dissolve some of it so it's effective but not extremely effective.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.900
 And then did you manage to set up your own plant or I guess it wouldn't be a plant.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:56.260
 There's a home-scale production line?

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:04.860
 And first I tried to get someone that I had worked for in nutrition counseling.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:12.940
 He got interested in it and dealt with the FDA and we got a cream form of it available

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:22.300
 but then he kept making it cheaper by buying things that weren't quite progesterone or

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:32.860
 that weren't quite vitamin E. And that eventually became its own product but I wasn't connected

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:44.460
 with it after I guess 1979 was when I stopped being involved with any real company.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:56.820
 Then I got friends to gradually develop their own business and seeing what this other person

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:09.980
 had done with the FDA and how it's basically sort of a crony system, I suggested that they

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.700
 just sell it to the doctors who were already interested in it.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:21.140
 And then those doctors would over the years tell their friends and so there was never

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:32.700
 anything said about progesterone by the people who took it over with Kenogen for example.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.020
 Because it was never marketed to the public, just to doctors?

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:45.500
 Yeah and only by a direct personal contact doctor to patient and patients to other doctors

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:54.620
 and so on so it wasn't necessary to ever say anything about its medical effects.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.820
 Oh I see.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:02.060
 So basically you didn't make any claims about it?

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:11.100
 When I was dealing with the FDA at various times they said that, they looked at my books

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:18.820
 and said those are federal crimes because you have a patent.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:25.060
 So they didn't prosecute me for writing the books about it but they said that I couldn't

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.940
 say anything good about progesterone.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:33.860
 Oh even in your books you couldn't say anything about it even though it's not attached to

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.300
 the actual vial of progesterone?

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:42.980
 I asked them if they would put that in writing just because it seemed so ridiculous and they

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:43.980
 said no.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:52.180
 Yeah well I guess somebody is sort of flexing their muscles there but they didn't really

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.340
 want to throw the punch.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.220
 Yeah that's standard policy.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:02.980
 They can be very nice people on the telephone and then they talk to the lawyers and act

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.280
 like thugs when they put anything in writing.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:13.740
 So I know when I first started looking for progesterone I was able to find it in places

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:20.980
 like Vitamin Express which is a large nutritional supplement and vitamin online store and I

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:27.940
 think they have real stores as well and they were carrying Dr. Ray Peat's Progest-E.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:33.940
 So at what point did you start managing to get it into some stores?

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:44.780
 Oh I don't remember when that started but they got that out of John Lee's books and

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:53.860
 so I don't remember when his books made it famous but that's where they got attached

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:59.100
 my name to it which they weren't supposed to do but John Lee described it as Ray Peat's

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:06.500
 Progesterone and so that's what the customers wanted and so these places like Vitamin Express

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:14.060
 attached my name to it even though I hadn't been involved with it for I guess 15 years

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.060
 at that time.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:20.180
 I don't believe there's any claims made on the packaging or even in the literature

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:25.100
 at say Vitamin Express for what it's used for.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.620
 How is it sold under FDA supervision?

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:39.300
 Well I talked to, in 1991 I talked to a man in FDA headquarters in Bethesda who described

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:47.060
 himself as the head of the drug division of the whole thing as opposed to the food and

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:57.180
 cosmetic sections and he said that he had just read an internal magazine historical

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:06.260
 article that in 1941 when they were getting around to enforcing the I think it was the

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:15.260
 1937 Food and Drug Act, they had had a meeting in which they decided they would not take

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:23.620
 authority over natural hormones and he said that I had it right here on my desk, I'll

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:31.460
 send you a copy when I can find it but then months later I got a letter apparently written

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:39.740
 by his lawyers which didn't mention that article at all and under Freedom of Information Act,

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:49.900
 I tried to get a copy of that meeting and after a very long time I got some edited pages

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:57.940
 that cut off right at the point where they were going to say that and so I gave up.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:06.260
 At one point I explained that the pages weren't complete and whoever I talked to at that point

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:12.180
 said well the meeting was a long time ago and we didn't save the records.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:17.940
 Wow, well that sounds like classic bureaucratic obfuscation.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:28.580
 Yeah, they will give you information freely if it's not anything that is important.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.500
 Yeah or anything that disagrees with what they want to do now.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.940
 So it sounds like they want to take over the authority to regulate hormones, is that what's

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.940
 going on?

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:54.100
 Well in 2005, in 2002 the Women's Health Initiative and another study done in one of the research

00:47:54.100 --> 00:48:03.740
 agencies of the government announced that estrogen causes dementia, heart attacks, strokes,

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:18.620
 deep vein clots, lung embolisms and such and that the Prempro industry, I think their sales

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:26.180
 went from over 2 billion down to a little over 1 billion over a period of about 3 years.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:36.940
 I think 2005 was the bottom and that really got their attention and besides thinking up

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:46.340
 new ways to market the estrogen products, they realized, they saw that progesterone

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:55.780
 sales had gone from a few, I forget, a ton or something a year up to many tons over just

00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:02.300
 a period of a few years as estrogen sales were falling.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:16.100
 And in 2005, YF petitioned the FDA to prosecute pharmacists who were preparing natural progesterone

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:30.540
 and the response of the FDA was that they aren't designed to initiate enforcement actions

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:40.500
 in response to a public petition, but a little later they did send out letters telling pharmacists

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:53.060
 to stop making any claim for progesterone and also in 2005, the lawsuits against progesterone

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.420
 started.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:50:06.980
 A women's law group had a $300,000 donation, the source of which they wouldn't reveal,

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:18.500
 to claim that progesterone was causing breast cancer and they sued something like 60 companies

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:25.220
 that were selling topical progesterone and I think most of them just stopped selling

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.220
 progesterone.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:32.220
 Now you're saying this is in response to the World Health Initiative study where they found

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:37.540
 estrogen was causing cancers and other health issues.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:44.380
 The National Lung, Heart and Blood Institute did another similar study right almost at

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.380
 the same time.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.380
 I see.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:56.420
 And then in 2003, there was a Lancet study, I guess, in the UK which had similar results.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:04.420
 So they're going after progesterone in response to these studies blaming estrogen for these

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.100
 various serious health problems.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.420
 What's the logic there, Ray?

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.380
 I don't quite understand.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:18.740
 They saw the tremendous increase in progesterone sales exactly at the same time their estrogen

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:28.380
 sales were falling and so it was obvious that women were shifting at least their menopause

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:38.980
 treatment from estrogen to progesterone and the timing of that petition and the lawsuits

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:53.940
 and grants to medical schools, a '09 lawsuit revealed that I think they said tens of millions

00:51:53.940 --> 00:52:05.860
 of dollars were being spent by WIATH to basically bribe doctors, medical journals and researchers

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:13.460
 to say that estrogen is really the thing they should be using.

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:21.300
 And looking at one of the schools that has published most of the anti-progesterone stuff

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:33.620
 since, basically since that WHI study, University of Southern California had a website and they

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:44.500
 looked up estrogen found I think it was 150 items indicating how good estrogen was and

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:50.260
 looking at progesterone, I couldn't find a single article saying anything good about

00:52:50.260 --> 00:53:01.820
 it and I think it was 30 or 40 publications that were investigating the carcinogenic and

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:08.540
 other toxic effects of progesterone and there were several other universities and research

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:17.980
 groups that were getting big financing against progesterone as well as reconsidering the

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:25.460
 World Health Initiative facts against estrogen saying really it wasn't estrogen that was

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:29.700
 causing those cancers.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:41.300
 It was a combination with a synthetic progestin and so that links into the need to attack

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:42.300
 progesterone.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:50.180
 I see and they found it's basically a scapegoat by blaming progesterone for the problems of

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:54.260
 estrogen and of synthetic progestins.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:54:00.260
 And that shows up in the whole history of how progesterone is labeled by pressure on

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:01.260
 the FDA.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:12.220
 They found that the synthetic progestins were toxic, caused heart defects in babies and

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:20.300
 so on and so the natural progesterone has to bear the label that it might cause birth

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:27.700
 defects even though it's a completely different substance having completely opposite effects

00:54:27.700 --> 00:54:32.180
 it carries the label of these so-called progestins.

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:37.280
 Labeling is a very powerful tool if you want to pin something on somebody and for people

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:44.820
 who think it's silly that they would go to these lengths you should know that just sales

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:55.640
 of Premarin products alone generated $2.04 billion in sales in 2001.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:02.820
 So these people, the drug companies, were wildly successful with these products and

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:07.500
 the WHI study seriously dented that success.

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:13.060
 Yeah, it lost them billions and billions of dollars.

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.860
 Ray we've come to the end of the hour, it's hard to believe, and we still haven't gotten

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:24.900
 to the meat of what's been happening or what did happen with progesterone under California

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:32.020
 law and I do want to cover that so would you be willing to do a part three show to follow

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.020
 up?

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:41.180
 Yeah, the article on my website really covers it but I don't know very much about what has

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.140
 happened since I wrote that article five years ago.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.540
 Well the thing that concerns me and I think that people should know is that our public

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:55.340
 policy is determined by these regulatory boards and what drugs we have available to ourselves

00:55:55.340 --> 00:56:02.100
 is determined by them and I think your case in point about progesterone and the fact that

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:09.660
 you know the details of what happened in California is very illustrative of how our entire basically

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:14.660
 public health policy is going and would be educational for everybody to hear your point

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:23.340
 of view so if we could talk about what you do know I think that would be more than adequate.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:27.700
 So thanks so much for being on Politics and Science today, we've been talking to Dr. Raymond

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:33.260
 Peat who's a PhD in biology which he received from the University of Oregon and he specializes

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:38.620
 in physiology and endocrinology and is also a science historian and you can find out a

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:45.620
 lot more about Dr. Raymond Peat at raypeat.com where he has many articles to read about this

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.020
 subject and many more.

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:53.260
 Alright thank you very much Ray and have a good week if I don't talk to you.

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.580
