00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to It's Rainmaking Time.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.140
 This is Kim Greenhouse and it's an extraordinary honor to welcome Dr. Ray Peat, who is an expert

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.680
 in the area of naturopathic medicine in nutrition and physiology.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.400
 He has a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon and he specializes in physiology.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.520
 He's taught at the University of Oregon, Urbana College, Montana State University, National

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.360
 College of Naturopathic Medicine, Universidad Veracruzana, oh my God, I don't know if I'm

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.680
 pronouncing that right, and the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Mexico and Blake College.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.000
 He has written about anti-aging, he's written about the effects of hormones from estrogen,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.920
 progesterone, DHEA, he's written about radiation, stress, lack of oxygen.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.360
 Recently I just found out he had written about water, some of the misunderstandings about

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 water.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.240
 He has articles and papers on cancer, on hot flashes, multiple sclerosis, on meat, fats,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.360
 functions and malfunctions.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.960
 It goes on and on.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.940
 He feels there needs to be a new perspective on living matter.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.120
 If we actually had a different kind of perspective, we would understand that energy and structure

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.560
 are interdependent at every level.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 That's what he says.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.120
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the Honorable and incredible Dr. Ray Peet back to its rainmaking

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.120
 time.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 Good afternoon.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.120
 Thank you.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.000
 If people want to get a perspective on what that means, a new attitude towards what life

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.560
 is, the works of Albert Saint-Georges and Gilbert Ling are the best places to start,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 I think.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.840
 Let's do a little bit of a context for the listeners about a new perspective on living

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
 matter.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 Flesh that out for us.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.320
 Talk a little bit about it.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.180
 It probably got its best start with a biochemist named Bungenberg de Jong.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.720
 He demonstrated that compositions of fat and protein and carbohydrate made things much

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.180
 more complex than colloids.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.300
 He called them complex coacervates.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.680
 They had many of the functions of living cells.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.480
 And then Sidney Fox, a generation later, demonstrated that he could create things like cells so

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.580
 simply that his students could create replicating cells that had many of the functions of bacteria

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.080
 in just an hour or two-hour afternoon lab.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.060
 He would throw amino acids on hot lava, imitating a prehistoric situation, and then splash a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.880
 little water on them so that he was creating from a dry environment in which water was

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:10.400
 under the control of protein or of amino acids rather than in a wet ocean-like environment.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.880
 And he showed that in this relatively dry condition, the water and the amino acids catalyzed

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.660
 themselves to form protein-like molecules which spontaneously formed little spheres

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.740
 about a micron in diameter, very uniform, and that these things would assimilate other

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.500
 proteins from the environment and grow and bud like yeast replicating.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.240
 The buds would grow and assimilate more proteins and so on.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.920
 They simply lacked nucleic acid to resemble living bacteria.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.500
 And then he showed that adding the precursors to DNA, these things would catalyze polymers

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.740
 of DNA-like material.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.960
 So spontaneously, he showed that simply by not overwhelming the molecules with too much

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:10.200
 water, that the water was an essential part of organizing proteins and DNA-like material,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.720
 and that the very stable, spontaneously forming structure resembled bacteria.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.080
 But what does that mean to us in the context of a new perspective on living matter?

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.800
 What does that mean, what you just said?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.200
 Well, when you look at the substance of a cell, rather than having to be assembled through

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.520
 a billion years of evolution, it means that the principles governing the way we function

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.720
 also govern the way the organism holds itself together or forms itself, makes new cells.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.360
 And rather than a cell being isolated from the environment by a lipid membrane, the famous

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.080
 bilayer lipid membrane, the functional principle is what Bungenberg de Jong demonstrated was

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.720
 that these complex mixtures of protein, fats, and carbohydrates primarily spontaneously

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.560
 separate things from the environment and cause their chemical change and integration.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 So that, for example, if you take a piece of hair made up of completely dead cells and

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:24.600
 wash it completely free of all of the sodium and potassium and calcium ions and so on,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.880
 and then you dip it in the serum, it will pull out the potassium and bind potassium

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.440
 to itself against a gradient excluding sodium.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.180
 It will bind magnesium, excluding calcium and so on.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.520
 So this demonstrates that you don't need membrane pumps.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.960
 It's simply an ion exchange phenomenon that dead cells can do.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.680
 And this is behind the way of looking at matter that Gilbert Ling, Bungenberg de Jong, these

00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:00.120
 non-mainline researchers, I think of it as the real mainline of science and that the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.240
 membrane school is the peripheral irrelevant part, except they're more numerous.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.960
 So that's the big paradigm change in the way we understand the cell.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.400
 You're saying there's so much even about hydration that's said that you have to get through the

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.960
 membrane of the cell to hydrate the cell.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960
 Do you agree with that?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.000
 I agree that that's the paradigm, but that's been totally disproven so many times.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.600
 The idea of the membrane is that the arrangement of chemistry inside is unstable relative to

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
 the outside.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:40.920
 And this whole idea that we're negentropic and that entropy tends to kill us, tends to

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.720
 make everything die.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.160
 This view is that we are a stable form of matter as long as energy runs through us and

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.280
 that it's a chemically favored arrangement of matter that doesn't need pumps in the membrane

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.880
 to maintain it.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.000
 It's simply the composition which maintains itself.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.480
 Is what you're saying the cells are self-maintaining organism?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.480
 Yes.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.480
 Okay.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.520
 Versus needing things from the outside.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.520
 Yeah.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.080
 So the whole idea of the membrane and the pumps is based on this idea that it's an improbable

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.640
 accidentally arranged thing that came about only by extremely improbable events over a

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.400
 billion years.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.800
 The fact that Sidney Fox could make cell-like things in a couple of hours shows what a different

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.120
 perspective it is on the nature of substance.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.120
 Here's my question.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.360
 You know how there's a lot in science now about cell hydration.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.880
 What is your view on cell hydration?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.080
 Gilbert Ling just sort of incidentally to his main work has demonstrated that hydration

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.020
 is regulated by energy.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.840
 The amount of energy the cell is producing and holding prevents the cell from taking

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.640
 up too much water, but it binds water and prevents its loss below a certain level.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:08.240
 And so if you lose the adequate amount of energy, the cell will control the water.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.040
 The water starts to take over and control the cell.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.880
 This explains many medical problems involving edema and swelling that the membrane theory

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.880
 is totally confused about.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.160
 Doctors will tell you, "Stop eating so much salt to reduce your edema."

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.520
 But in many situations, restricting sodium is exactly the wrong thing.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:39.520
 It will make the edema worse, especially in premenstrual women and very old people.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:46.400
 I've seen people solve their swelling problems, their high blood pressure problems, appetite

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.120
 control and so on just by salting their food according to what tastes good rather than

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.920
 what the doctor advises.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.240
 Dr. Pete, I have dear friends of mine that have high blood pressure and I tell them to

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.440
 take real salt, obviously not just the regular salt on the table, but they say their doctor

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.920
 tells them, "Do not have salt at all."

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:12.400
 Yeah, and a lot of doctors still tell people to drink two quarts of water, even disregarding

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.400
 whether they might be drinking milk, coffee, orange juice and so on.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.080
 And there are experiments that show that if you put a little too much water in the intestine,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:30.000
 it will promote inflammation a little beyond that and it can start causing a shock reaction.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.640
 Loss of sodium tends to be associated with imbalance of several other salts, but sodium

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.600
 itself stimulates energy production of the cell and respiration.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.680
 And if something interrupts that balance of salt, magnesium and calcium and the cell loses

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.880
 energy, the cell takes up too much water and the excess of water stimulates cell growth

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.560
 but not energy production.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.920
 That tends to create an anabolic condition with all sorts of possibilities including

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.160
 diabetes, obesity and cancer, inflammatory things in general.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:13.880
 You know how there was a guy who got the Nobel Prize for identifying the aquaporin channel

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.880
 in the cell?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.240
 Yeah, Gilbert Ling has written quite a bit about the whole channel idea.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240
 What do you think about it?

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.440
 Because I haven't read Gilbert Ling yet.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:31.200
 Since Ling explains the balance between proteins and water adequately to take care of everything

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.800
 and the channel idea goes with the idea of a membrane which is a barrier to salt and

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.320
 water and so it needs channels, but Ling demonstrated that there is no such barrier.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.920
 There might be something that you can stain that looks like a membrane with different

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920
 preparations.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.880
 You get different membrane appearances, but there is no barrier to sodium entering the

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880
 cell.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:04.480
 As soon as isotopes became available in the 1940s, it was discovered that sodium freely

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.440
 leaves and enters the cell, but there's no semi-permeable membrane keeping sodium out.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.440
 What about keeping water out?

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.680
 It's the same thing.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.880
 If you have a fat layer which can keep sodium out and potassium in, that would obviously

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.460
 be keeping water out.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:29.080
 One of the early persons criticizing the idea of a lipid membrane, it was being described

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:36.160
 as basically a lecithin membrane made out of phospholipids with their fatty acids stuck

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.120
 together in the layer.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:44.160
 He commented that lecithin has a great affinity for water and it will swell in the presence

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.640
 of water.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:54.000
 So it's a very bad choice for postulating as limiting membrane barrier on the cell.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.240
 You talk about the distinction between water and ions, that we need to really understand

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.120
 more about the play of water and ions.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:13.840
 The thinking is partly sustained just because some of the methods becoming so complicated

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.480
 that doctors and researchers use approximations and don't really calculate what's going on

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.720
 with ions and pH and so on.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:31.000
 A lot of that derives from the definition of what an acid and a base is.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.480
 Gilbert Lewis defined acids in a very different way in which protons aren't involved.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:44.600
 The whole medical idea of acid and base involves the concentration of protons.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.480
 That's what pH stands for.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.920
 Gilbert Lewis demonstrated that you don't need protons at all to have acids or bases.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.160
 It's all a matter of how the electrons are handled and since electrons are what are involved

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:07.320
 in metabolism and energy production, it's much better to use his concept of acid base

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.720
 rather than the proton pH idea.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:20.440
 Peter Stewart redesigned the handling mathematics for acids and base and he showed that almost

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:28.080
 always the crucial factor is carbon dioxide gas pressure, not the bicarbonate ions that

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.920
 hospitals are measuring and calculating.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.640
 It happens to be that Peter Stewart and the Gilbert acid theory are simply physically

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:41.760
 correct and Gilbert Ling doesn't talk about these particular aspects of the theory, but

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.720
 his way of calculating ion distribution is so physically simple and correct that some

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:56.280
 of the first people to accept his calculations were the engineers designing water softeners

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:04.840
 and ion exchange resins because his calculations work perfectly for any physical system, not

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840
 just cells.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:13.320
 Would you talk a little bit about CO2 because since 2009 and since the EPA declared war

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:19.680
 on CO2, carbon dioxide, and since the whole global warming thing and anything connected

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.520
 to climate changing, people are scared to death of CO2.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:30.160
 And I just realized in doing an interview with Dr. Mark Circus that oxygen isn't everything.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.400
 In fact, if you don't have enough carbon dioxide, you're not going to be well.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.160
 There's a lot of confusion about this.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:42.720
 Explain what carbon dioxide is and what does carbon dioxide have to do with aging and health?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:50.480
 About 60 years ago, some people working with microorganisms did a survey and found that

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.920
 although some bacteria, protozoa and so on can survive without oxygen, like in deep sea

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.400
 vent, there are organisms that totally live without oxygen and use sulfuric acid as their

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.640
 oxygen for example.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.600
 These experimenters tested many different types of organism and even those which can

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.440
 live without oxygen can't live without carbon dioxide.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:24.520
 So it really should be considered the basic material of life, not oxygen.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:30.480
 The purpose of oxygen from that point of view is to make carbon dioxide.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:38.400
 And if you consider it in the context of Gilbert Ling's cell structure, with the protein itself

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:46.640
 is a weak acid and the weak acid is electrically charged with a negative charge which attracts

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:52.760
 positive ions so that it spontaneously binds things like potassium, sodium, magnesium,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.440
 and calcium.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:01.560
 But if you adjust the composition as a whole, the whole colloid or coacervate of the cell,

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:07.080
 the water softener prefers to bind calcium over sodium.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.480
 But if you put a very high concentration of salt through your water softener, you can

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:17.680
 wash out the calcium and then it will extract calcium from your hard water because of its

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:24.920
 chemical nature that an acidic group of the right size will prefer one ion over the other.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:32.160
 And carbon dioxide is one of the factors that cause our proteins to prefer potassium over

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.840
 sodium.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:42.180
 At the same time that the cell is regulating its salt and ion balance by having the right

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:48.800
 amount of carbon dioxide, it's producing a steady stream of carbon dioxide flowing out

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:55.480
 of the cell into the blood and as it leaves the mitochondrion, it reacts with water forming

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.780
 carbonic acid.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:05.680
 And the carbonic acid has a negative charge so as it flows out of the cell, it drags along

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.200
 positive ions with it.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:14.240
 In this case, calcium and sodium are constantly flowing out of the cell just because of the

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.400
 flow of carbon dioxide.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:23.480
 And as we exhale, that carbonic acid in the blood is constantly changing back into carbon

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:30.560
 dioxide which leaves in the lungs and that leaves these calcium and sodium ions stranded

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.280
 in the blood as the carbon dioxide leaves them.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.720
 That accounts for the blood having a more alkaline test pH equivalent than the inside

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.480
 of the cell.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.800
 Then the kidneys finish keeping the balance again by adjusting the change between carbon

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:55.520
 dioxide and carbonic acid allowing the kidneys to select in one direction or the other these

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.720
 ions.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:03.200
 One of the functions of carbon dioxide is to regulate the acidity of tissues and prevent

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.880
 the uptake of too much water and to keep the energy intake going.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:16.680
 Shock is a typical extreme situation in which cells become unable to make energy and take

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.360
 up too much water.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.520
 So that, for example, your capillaries take up water and swell shut.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.240
 Cells become so fat they close the aperture.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.800
 Arterials get swollen so that blood hardly passes through them.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.480
 The mechanisms obviously relate to the known mechanisms of shock except that the shock

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:45.100
 industry is committed to the idea that something fails in the circulatory system as the primary

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.640
 event but not necessarily the closure.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.120
 Simply the heart stops pumping enough maybe because the blood vessels have relaxed too

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.400
 much and can't return the blood but they neglect the fine structure of what's really happening.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:07.880
 In the early part of the century, Yandel Henderson, a Yale professor, became interested in carbon

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:14.240
 dioxide physiology as a regulator of oxygen metabolism.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:21.400
 Shock at that time was being seen in relation to the nervous system as something that can

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.200
 turn off or turn on energy production of cells all through the body.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:33.040
 But he was simply looking at what happens with more or less carbon dioxide.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:40.760
 And in one of his studies published in 1910, another one in 1911 on what happens to the

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:46.680
 circulation in the absence of carbon dioxide, he was one of the first people to see that

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:54.120
 carbon dioxide relaxes the arterioles and allows blood to flow freely through the body.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.360
 But if you turn off the energy production and stop producing carbon dioxide, then you

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.240
 have less relaxed blood vessels.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.660
 The heart has a harder job pumping.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:10.560
 So he was looking at the feature of shock that fails to return blood to the heart and

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.600
 fails to pump it.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:18.880
 The First World War, all of that research relating to the chemistry of metabolism and

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.880
 how it relates to the function of arteries, capillaries, and veins and the heart, all

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.920
 of that was displaced by a simple mechanical failure of the blood to pump without explanation

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.880
 for the mechanism behind it.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:42.320
 And that elimination of carbon dioxide metabolism became institutionalized as hospitals simplified

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.880
 things by supplying oxygen in an emergency where Yandel Henderson showed that you could

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:56.600
 cause quicker recovery of oxygenation by adding 8 or 10% of carbon dioxide to your oxygen.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.800
 The whole idea of physiology changed largely as a result of the war research.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:10.320
 At the time of the Second World War, a Russian researcher who was looking at the appearance

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:18.480
 of high metabolizing animals in the world, how the expensive energy producing brain of

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:25.800
 humans could evolve, what the factors in the environment are that are needed to maintain

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:32.960
 and develop the brain, he saw that the environmental carbon dioxide is an essential factor for

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.600
 good brain function.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:44.680
 And he predicted that the natural development of the planet's ecosystems would be to increase

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:52.600
 the metabolic rate, increase the brain size of populations, and do it by the interaction

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.240
 of increasing carbon dioxide, stimulating oxygen metabolism, and stabilizing the big

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.480
 brain.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:08.320
 And in the history of the deposition, the Carboniferous Age of fossils, for example,

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:16.160
 at that time when evolution advanced so rapidly, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.800
 was many times higher than at present.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:27.360
 So he predicted that the earth would go through other phases of greatly increased atmospheric

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:34.320
 CO2 that would increase the whole vitality of life on the planet.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.280
 Vernadsky died around the end of the war in 1945 or '46.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:47.120
 But around 1970, a Russian researcher looking at the length, birth weight, and head size

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:55.760
 of babies born over a period of decades saw that around the world, the head size had been

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:04.280
 increasing in correspondence to the increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, seeming to validate

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.480
 the prediction of Vernadsky made 25 years earlier.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.320
 What does that mean?

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.560
 We don't have to worry about increasing the atmosphere because it's stimulating life at

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560
 all levels.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.960
 Can you tell that to the EPA?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:26.080
 Because the EPA is acting as a police agency, an entire industry is created to decrease

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.080
 CO2.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.520
 Yeah, but if you think of CO2 as a life-supporting, brain-supporting thing...

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.000
 Well, I do, actually.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.960
 I had Dr. Sherwood Itso on to do a whole show on CO2 with regard to plants and life itself,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.600
 but you're a whole other side of it with health.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.520
 Going to a high altitude is one thing an individual can do.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:55.280
 Changing the diet to include lots of fruit, anything that supports thyroid function, avoiding

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.560
 polyunsaturated fats, avoiding electromagnetic fields, and so on.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.700
 We're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.820
 We are living in one of the most exciting and dangerous times in history.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.260
 Many of us are being challenged to turn away from parasitic systems of enslavement and

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:19.600
 misery and move into different life-giving activities, commercial opportunities, and

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.440
 communities.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.880
 Transition is upon us right now.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.880
 The seizure of the world's natural resources, the poisoning of our food, water, and air,

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.080
 and the total electronic surveillance of our lives is forcing many of us to develop new

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.520
 rules of engagement for being in the world.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.360
 Living business today is way more complex and nuanced.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.280
 The electronic age is a mixed bag.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.020
 If you want to live in a more humane world, don't confuse electronic communication with

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:53.400
 real relationships or knowing who your neighbors are or how they're doing or the importance

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.420
 of sitting down with your family and having meals together.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.840
 This is real life.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.120
 Practically everything we've been indoctrinated to believe about life and work is out of touch

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.480
 with what's available to us today.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.600
 New discoveries about nonlocality and consciousness are not only mind-boggling, they are game

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.920
 changers that require us to embrace paradox and ambiguity.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.460
 Beings and agencies that insist on using deceptive practices, protocols, and instruments for

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:26.560
 market and industrial domination will eventually realize they are at the tail of a riveting

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.960
 new industrial complex of markets, projects, and products that they never perceived.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.120
 This new complex is emerging.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.040
 Receptivity is a human imperative.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.660
 Imagination is an agency of transport.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:47.080
 The current behind the currency matters, and our children and future generations are counting

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.400
 on us to prepare the way for them.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.760
 I'm Kim Greenhouse.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:57.880
 I'm the Chief Executive Officer of The Rainmaking Company, a manifestation agency, a leadership

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.160
 agency, and a development agency.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:08.160
 Feel free to call for our rainmaking services, both on an advisory and development level,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.640
 626-398-8652.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.200
 And back to the show.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.680
 Do you agree that if we got more carbon dioxide in our systems that we would be healthier?

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:27.480
 Up to a certain point, the insurance industry more than 100 years ago recognized that all

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:34.400
 of the degenerative diseases caused less death at very high altitudes.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:40.160
 They had figures from all over the world at the beginning of the 20th century showing

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:47.400
 that cancer, brain diseases, heart disease, all the circulatory diseases caused many fewer

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.000
 deaths at altitudes of 8,000 to 10,000 feet.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.640
 Why do you think that is?

00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:00.920
 Well, Yandel Henderson, a professor at Yale in the early part of the century, did most

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.840
 of the basic human physiology relating to carbon dioxide.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:12.400
 He showed that oxidation of the tissues depends on carbon dioxide.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:20.040
 And if you have too much oxygen in your environment, which at sea level we do have, that reverses

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:27.760
 all of these ion balancing processes and energy giving processes and pushes too much carbon

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.760
 dioxide out of our blood when it reaches the lungs.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:37.920
 That shifts the whole balance so that as the blood reaches the cells carrying its load

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.040
 of oxygen, it requires the carbon dioxide being produced in the cell to release the

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.120
 oxygen to the cell.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:52.160
 And if your whole system has been depleted beyond a certain level of the necessary carbon

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:58.120
 dioxide, your red blood cells don't give up enough oxygen to the tissues.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.320
 And so you will starve your peripheral tissues.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:07.760
 If you hyperventilate for a couple of minutes, breathing deep and fast, you will notice that

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.000
 maybe your fingers and toes go into a cramp.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.360
 That same process happens under any circumstance that is depriving you of carbon dioxide.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.760
 Giving pure oxygen, 100% oxygen, will create the same situation.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.520
 And in the brain, too much oxygen and the deprivation of carbon dioxide shrinks the

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:38.080
 blood vessels so that just a couple of years ago, using MRI and other imaging, they have

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:44.640
 shown that too much oxygen breathing lowers the availability of oxygen in the brain by

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.680
 constricting the blood vessels.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.680
 Fascinating.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:53.440
 So, what would you suggest for the listeners to get their carbon dioxide levels up?

00:28:53.440 --> 00:29:00.440
 I noticed you brought up the breathing method of Butyko, B-U-T-E-Y-K-O, the Butyko method?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.800
 Oh, Butyko, yeah.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.360
 Butyko, talk about that for a minute.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.120
 Isn't that a Russian breathing method?

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:11.840
 Yeah, he was a Russian doctor who, starting in the 1950s, noticed that sick and dying

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.120
 people tended to hyperventilate and he found that if he could calm them down and get them

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.800
 to breathe more slowly, they often recovered.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.600
 I don't think he was aware of the research that Ian Dell Henderson did, but Henderson

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:33.800
 got the emergency firefighters and such from the 1930s into the 1940s.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:42.840
 It was standard to use 8% or even 10% carbon dioxide in their respiratory tanks with oxygen

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:48.880
 to treat suffocation victims, carbon monoxide poisoning and such because the carbon dioxide

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:56.240
 is so essential to restoring respiration and it even activates the Krebs cycle.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:04.440
 I personally think it's involved in the actual formation of ATP from ADP by facilitating

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:12.880
 the dehydration withdrawal of water from the phosphate precursors to form the ATP itself.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.320
 So what do you suggest for people so that they get more CO2 in their system?

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.320
 The diet is very important.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:27.080
 Some foods interfere with metabolism, cause you to tend to produce lactic acid, which

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.480
 displaces carbon dioxide.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.080
 Let's talk about that.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:37.400
 Polyunsaturated fats block respiration and thyroid function.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.920
 Alkaline acid balance is another thing that tends to make you blow out too much carbon

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.000
 dioxide and not form enough.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.500
 Don't you find, Dr. Peete, that that's very confusing for people?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.440
 This man that I interviewed years ago who's passed on now, David Webster, who did a huge

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:58.080
 amount of research for like 35 years on the colon.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:04.360
 One of the things he said to me is that people talk about pH, but there's blood pH, the colon

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.400
 has a totally different pH.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.240
 There's different pHs in the body.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.100
 So how do we not get it all confused?

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:17.320
 If you think of the flow of carbon dioxide, for example, the healthy cell producing a

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:24.240
 lot of carbon dioxide, which is a Lewis acid, it contains no protons, but it has an acidic

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.000
 reaction all by itself.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.160
 It being formed and the oxygen which forms it, oxygen is named as the acid former.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:39.160
 The acid that it forms is in the cell carbon dioxide.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:46.000
 So the function of oxygen is to make the carbonic acid, which gives the cell in its healthy

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.240
 condition an acidic reaction below 7 pH.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:57.740
 When it gets sick and can't make carbon dioxide, as in cancer, the pH of the cell becomes alkaline.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:03.920
 But in the healthy condition, you have inside the cell a mild acidic condition.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:10.320
 As the CO2 drags minerals out of the cell and drops them in the blood, the blood becomes

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.360
 alkaline.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:19.520
 As the urine retains the alkaline minerals that it needs, the right balance of calcium,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:25.640
 magnesium, phosphate, sodium, and potassium, the kidney ideally should be producing an

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.720
 acidic urine to maintain that alkaline bloodstream.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:35.520
 So when people are measuring their alkaline acidity balance with an alkaline piece of

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.920
 paper and they're testing their urine, it's not giving the right reading, is it?

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:45.960
 No, you want your blood to be alkaline and to do that, your urine ideally, usually is

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.080
 on the acidic side.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:54.400
 And people with alkaline urine tend to deposit minerals just because of the physics of the

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.600
 situation.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.520
 I hope the audience understands this because it can be a little bit confusing.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.400
 Say it again, would you, Dr. Pete?

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.400
 Okay, the kidneys are very important along with the lungs in maintaining the alkaline

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.240
 normal condition of the bloodstream.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:18.400
 And to do that, your lungs blow out the acidic carbon dioxide and your kidneys, according

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.440
 to the need, they can adjust the pH.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:29.760
 But the most stable situation is for the kidneys, like the lungs, to excrete a slightly acidic

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.480
 material.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:36.760
 What do you think about hyperbaric oxygen chambers that cancer patients have gone into

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:42.120
 to try to get rid of the damage from radiation and chemo?

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:49.200
 If the circulation is completely destroyed to an area, as in gangrene, high pressure

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:56.040
 oxygen can get the tissue, keep it alive simply by diffusing into the tissue.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:03.400
 So for like a wound, a puncture wound with damaged blood vessels, high pressure oxygen

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.000
 can help it recover.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.960
 But the situation in the brain in which too much oxygen shuts down the blood vessels,

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:19.000
 the oxygen is actually preventing proper delivery of oxygen to the brain.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.400
 I knew someone who was treating cancer patients with high pressure oxygen, I think 200% of

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.200
 normal pressure.

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:33.120
 He tried adding some carbon dioxide to the atmosphere inside the chamber and he got a

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.560
 little too much in and the patient lost consciousness.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.960
 He hadn't been able to speak at all because of cancer in his throat, but he was unconscious

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:47.440
 in the machine for a while as the person tried to remedy the excess carbon dioxide.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.440
 And during that time, the windows steamed up so that the doctor couldn't see what was

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.440
 happening in the chamber.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.920
 It doesn't sound like a very stable scenario.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:04.720
 It was a very scary situation when he finally got the pressure down and the chamber opened.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.680
 The person was recovered as the CO2 went down.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.480
 He woke up and he could talk.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.840
 But what does this mean?

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:15.800
 The bedding he had been lying on was soaked.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:22.360
 He was almost floating in water from perspiration and his breath had produced so much vapor

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.000
 that it fogged up the windows.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.960
 The carbon dioxide basically improved the acidity of his cell proteins so that they

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.840
 could excrete the water.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:40.520
 In the cancer situation, cells lose their carbon dioxide production and with the low

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:48.040
 energy become waterlogged, soak up too much water and can't do anything but grow.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:54.320
 So apparently the carbon dioxide helped his cells to excrete water very fast.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:01.280
 So it was just pouring out of all of his pores and through his lungs and kidneys and he could

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.680
 talk normally and felt very good when he woke up.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:11.520
 So what should we do to enhance our carbon dioxide experience and get more of that into

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.600
 our cells and our blood?

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:20.400
 Living at an altitude of 11,000 to 12,000 feet probably is the simplest thing if you

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.640
 can do it.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:27.240
 But otherwise, it's a complex matter of improving everything that's relevant.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:35.480
 Buteyko found that just by behavioral assistance, coaching them to breathe more calmly and shallow,

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.360
 slow breathing, he could do it.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:43.000
 But the stressful environment makes people hyperventilate.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.720
 Chemicals in the environment, estrogenic materials, stimulate hyperventilation.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:55.720
 Pills of all sorts increase hyperventilation and imbalance the blood, minerals and so on.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:04.640
 Would you talk a little bit about the distinction between progesterone, pregnenolone and estrogen

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.000
 just in terms of giving a frame of reference to the public?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.480
 Estrogen is essentially anti-oxidative and anti-thyroid.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.600
 Thyroid is our basic oxygen-using hormone.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.640
 So if you can have good thyroid function, you're going to be producing enough carbon

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.880
 dioxide.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:34.000
 And estrogen in many ways, it actually blocks the secretion of thyroid hormone.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.560
 But on the cellular level, it changes the way oxygen is used, diverting it from making

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:47.520
 carbon dioxide to consuming energy, shifting away from glucose metabolism, which produces

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:55.880
 carbon dioxide, to fat metabolism, which makes less CO2, and stimulating the uptake of water

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.520
 as a result of this shift in energy production.

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:06.360
 So estrogen causes the breasts and the uterus and pituitary to swell up by taking water

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:12.680
 into the cell and the extra water stimulates cell division, so it causes the uterine growth

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.480
 and the breast growth and so on.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:21.200
 So I take it from listening to you and from reading your work that you are not into anti-aging,

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.840
 even bio-identical anti-aging hormones via estrogen.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:36.080
 Definitely not, because the older and more stressed a cell or a tissue is, the more estrogen

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.120
 it tends to produce.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:46.160
 A young healthy person produces estrogen primarily in the ovaries, with some in the adrenal glands,

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.520
 cortex.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:54.880
 With stress, aging, falling thyroid function, ability to synthesize progesterone, every

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:02.080
 cell in the body develops the ability to make estrogen and loses the ability to excrete

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.360
 it into the bloodstream.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:11.920
 So simply by becoming deficient in progesterone, your blood test won't show that you are deficient

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.920
 in estrogen because progesterone is needed to get the estrogen from the cell into the

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:22.440
 bloodstream, but inside the cell is where estrogen works.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:29.880
 And so your fat cells and brain cells, skin, every tissue in the body has the capacity

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.600
 to make estrogen when it's under stress.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:40.440
 People with diabetes, their tissues all through the body are producing excess estrogen.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.560
 What do you think of the fat cell relationship to estrogen?

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:50.360
 Yeah, that's the major bulk of it and some of that is actually getting into the bloodstream.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:55.840
 But the breast tissue itself starts producing estrogen, even though it's thought of as the

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:01.000
 target of the estrogen, it becomes the source of estrogen too, and the uterus.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.760
 I'm going to ask you a really controversial question, Dr. Pete.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.840
 How current would you say what you just said is?

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:17.280
 Oh, well, a man named PKC Terry was the first one to demonstrate clearly that fat after

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.280
 menopause, especially fat, becomes a major source of estrogen production.

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:29.600
 But since then, hundreds of people have demonstrated that with stress, diabetes, and inflammation,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.360
 the aromatase enzyme has increased.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:39.560
 An Italian named Cutolo has been very good on this subject for the last 10 years.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:45.120
 You know, the anti-aging community, that is the complementary supposed physicians and

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.800
 the anti-aging community, the doctors that assert that they are the hormone doctors are

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:59.120
 giving women who have been through menopause bio-identical estrogen called BIAST in a cream

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:06.600
 form vaginally, progesterone in a cream form vaginally, and testosterone in a cream form

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600
 vaginally.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.040
 What do you think about all that?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:15.600
 The early studies of the vaginal estrogen by itself, doctors were telling women that

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:21.520
 it's only local, it isn't going to increase your risk of breast cancer or lung cancer.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.200
 But as soon as someone measured the blood after people were applying it to the vagina,

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:31.520
 they saw that it produced very immediate high levels all through the body because the membranes

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.480
 absorb it so easily.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:39.200
 So local use is going to change the local tissues but also increase the exposure of

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.360
 all of the cancer-sensitive organs.

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:48.520
 It's been known since the 1940s that all tissues will develop cancer or a risk of cancer with

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.040
 continuous exposure to estrogen.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:58.960
 But if you interrupt it regularly with progesterone and stop the estrogen and have a good two

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:05.120
 weeks of progesterone exposure regularly, that tremendously reduces the carcinogenic

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120
 effect of estrogen.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.640
 What do you say to people who say, "Look, we don't have any libido anymore.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.840
 We've got to take something"?

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:20.360
 Sometimes thyroid to lower the stress hormones including estrogen, that very typically will

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.520
 normalize this libido.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.080
 So it's a whole system.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:29.120
 If I'm hearing you correctly, you can't really just deal with the hormones, the male and

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.200
 female hormones.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.260
 You've got to include the thyroid.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.260
 What else?

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.600
 Well, nutrition.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:40.960
 If the liver isn't supplied with at least adequate amount of protein and B vitamins,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:45.080
 your estrogen level will chronically stay elevated.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:51.160
 If you don't eat enough fiber, your liver, even if it's supplied with good nutrition,

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:57.600
 it's detoxifying all the estrogen that reaches it if it's well-nourished and secreting some

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.880
 of it into the bile, some to go to the kidneys.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:08.480
 But if you don't eat enough fiber or don't have a good active intestine, that estrogen

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.620
 excreted into the intestine is reabsorbed.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:17.960
 So just eating a carrot every day, after just a few days, it will normalize the hormones

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:24.520
 in a lot of people, lowering the estrogen, increasing progesterone and lowering the stress

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.640
 hormones, cortisol for example.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.800
 Let's talk about coffee.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.440
 Let's get really controversial.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.920
 Weren't you one of the first people in the US to tell people that coffee is good for

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.920
 you?

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.920
 Well, in the 1970s.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.920
 Right.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:47.720
 They did a monograph showing many of the biological effects, including the cancer protective effects

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.360
 of caffeine.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.960
 And that was what really got me interested.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:44:00.440
 They had been experimenting with tobacco smoke in the lab and showing that 96 to 100% of

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.440
 their mice developed cancers where the concentrated tobacco smoke was applied.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:12.920
 But they looked at their records for one week and saw that about 5% of their mice that week

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.480
 were developing cancer.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:20.300
 And they saw that in the lab records, someone had used this distillation apparatus for something

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.280
 involving caffeine.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.400
 So their smoke had been contaminated with caffeine during that week.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:33.000
 And they repeated the experiment, adding caffeine to the carcinogenic smoke.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.840
 And again, it would only produce cancer in 5% rather than 95% of the animals.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.840
 Wow.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:47.120
 Then they tested it on all the classical carcinogenic compounds, polycyclic aromatic compounds,

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:51.360
 radiation, ultraviolet and x-rays, viruses.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.040
 Every known cause of cancer was prevented by adding caffeine to the situation.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.040
 Very interesting.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:04.360
 And then there are some people, Dave Aspey from the Bulletproof Executive, he's popularized

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.360
 butter and coffee.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.360
 What do you think of that?

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:12.160
 Each one is good, but I think cream is better in coffee.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.160
 You mean tasting?

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:14.880
 Yeah, it tastes better.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.600
 He's talking about not margarine, but butter to get your saturated fats in, get the CLA

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.680
 in the brain first thing in the morning.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.560
 The butter just floats on the coffee and it's sort of messy, but...

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.560
 Not when you mix it in a blender.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.440
 You don't need to do that if you use good cream.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:32.960
 I use both.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.920
 Let's get to coconut oil.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:38.320
 I was sitting at a Thai place about a year ago.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.120
 This guy walks in and he sat down near me.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.280
 I ordered a coconut, one of those pure coconuts, and I go, "Oh, I just love coconuts."

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:51.200
 And he goes, "You Americans are crazy with the coconuts already and the coconut oil.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200
 What is it with you?"

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.080
 I said, "It's really good for you."

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:58.960
 And we started to talk, but they laugh at us, but yet they live on coconuts and coconut

00:45:58.960 --> 00:45:59.960
 oil.

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.400
 Talk to the public about coconut oil.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:06.320
 I've done shows on it, but I'd like you to share from your expertise about coconut oil.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:13.120
 Again, in the 1970s, I was attracted to it by reading an article in which they had fed

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:19.160
 several groups, I think it was 15 groups of rats on different diets, including either

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:26.360
 a high-fat, saturated fat, a low-saturated fat diet, a very high polyunsaturated fat

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:35.120
 diet, and a very low-fat diet with only polyunsaturated, and so on, so that they had 15 different compositions,

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:40.240
 very high-fat, very low-fat, pure saturated, pure unsaturated.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:46.280
 And at the end of their life, the leanest rats were the ones that ate the saturated

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.400
 coconut oil diet, regardless of whether it was high-fat or low-fat.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.560
 And the fat animals were the ones that had the pure polyunsaturated fat.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:47:01.160
 Again, even a low-fat diet, if it was purely polyunsaturated, made them the fattest animals.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.800
 So it wasn't the quantity, it was the unsaturation.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:10.960
 In the last several years, people have started talking about the saturation index, meaning

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:18.480
 the proportion of saturated fats to polyunsaturated in your tissues, and cancer patients are very

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.280
 low on the saturation index.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:27.760
 So it's not only obesity-producing, it's associated with high incidence of cancer to have highly

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.320
 polyunsaturated fat diet.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.920
 I have a question about thyroid, and the kind of thyroid that you recommend people to take.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:41.200
 I realize that you're not to prescribe anything on the show, but do you agree that people

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.520
 are still taking Armour thyroid, or do you have a particular thyroid that you think is

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.440
 more effective for what's going on today?

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:55.760
 The original Armour product was pretty stable for, I think it was 90 years, and they tested

00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:01.120
 all of their batches on mice and would adjust the composition because it varied from animal

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:08.000
 to animal, and they would test it to make sure that it had exactly the same potency.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.080
 When the finished product was tested and compared to others, it was much more consistent than,

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:20.480
 for example, the synthetic Synthroid product, which varied a lot from batch to batch.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.000
 But Armour was an extremely well-controlled product.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.320
 But then Revlon bought it, and the price went up from, when I was getting it as late as

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:33.480
 1990, it was $8 for 1,000 tablets.

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.120
 And after Revlon bought it, the price doubled or tripled.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.480
 They don't own Armour thyroid, do they now?

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:45.880
 Well, it went through three or four changes of ownership each time with the price doubling.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:51.600
 So from 8/10 of a cent per tablet, it now is over 50 cents per tablet.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:56.280
 Right, but that's a pharmaceutical industry phenomenon, right?

00:48:56.280 --> 00:49:00.720
 But at the same time, they were changing the additives in it, and there have been periods

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.920
 when the tablets wouldn't dissolve or they had different behavior.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.800
 So I stopped using it in the early '90s because some people found the pills were going through

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:10.800
 undigested.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.880
 So I started using synthetic products.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:21.420
 Thyrolar was the Armour company's synthetic equivalent since they tested every batch on

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:27.040
 mice, different synthetic compositions, and got one that acted just like the original

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.140
 Armour product.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.600
 So the sale of the company involved the sale of that product.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:37.480
 For several years, I recommended that one, but then it became hard to get.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.120
 Luckily, two or three other companies had copied their formula.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:48.720
 Proloid had been a colloid purified from the gland, and they changed to Proloid S, meaning

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:54.920
 synthetic, but the product is basically the similar composition, in effect, to Thyrolar

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:57.000
 and a couple of other products.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.560
 Ceno Plus is one that I've used for a long time, and it's very steady and reliable.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.400
 Is that also a synthetic?

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.400
 Yeah.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.760
 Some people listening are going to say, "Why, Dr. Peet, are you recommending a synthetic

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.920
 over something more bio-identical or bio..."

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:19.200
 Well, the Armour company invested a tremendous amount of work and research in their product.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.080
 Smaller companies haven't had access to that research, and when they change their additives,

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.520
 for example, sometimes it changes the way the product works.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.680
 I didn't know there were additives to thyroid.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.800
 Most of the products have had some changes over the years.

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:39.880
 Armour used only sugar and magnesium stearate, I think, for the binders.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.880
 They would adjust the amount of sugar slightly according to the animals they used so that

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:50.440
 it always had the same functional potency, but now the companies don't have the resources

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:56.240
 to test every batch on animals, and there just can't be the quality that Armour had

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.760
 achieved.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.120
 What happened to Cytomel?

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.640
 Remember Cytomel?

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:09.120
 In its foreign forms, it's called Cynomel or Cynomel, but it's made by the same recipe,

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.760
 and so it has been very valuable and consistent.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:21.040
 You know, the whole testing of both the thyroid and the hormone matrix in men and women has

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.200
 really changed over the years.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:30.480
 I remember that to test the thyroid, they would take your blood, and some people now

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.840
 say to test the thyroid, take your urine.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.880
 They used to do that with male and female hormones.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:41.960
 Instead of the blood, they say the active hormones are showing up more effectively in

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.560
 a 24-hour urine sample.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:44.560
 Do you agree with that?

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.160
 No, I think it's a better business.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:54.280
 The blood isn't such a great test for thyroid anyway because if you have more estrogen,

00:51:54.280 --> 00:52:01.720
 more cortisol, more free fatty acids, different amounts of protein, a given amount of T3 or

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:06.000
 T4 in your blood isn't going to have the same effect on the cells.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.600
 And even the reverse T3, which goes up under stress, interferes with the action of T3.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:18.240
 Unless you have a computer program to understand the whole physiology, there's not much point

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.480
 in looking at the T3 and T4.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480
 You mean in the blood?

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:23.480
 Yeah.

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.040
 What about free T3?

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:30.960
 Because the anti-aging community says the real action and heart of the thyroid activity,

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.440
 what's happening is in the free T3.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:34.440
 You agree with that?

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.840
 Ask them what they mean by free exactly.

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:43.480
 The idea of a free hormone is very vague and contradictory.

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.520
 The way they measure it, I think currently they're still using a dialysis method that

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:52.620
 what passes through a dialysis membrane is called free.

00:52:52.620 --> 00:53:00.000
 But in the blood, hormones actually travel with proteins and fats and in and on the blood

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.280
 cells.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.080
 Some people talk about it traveling on the red blood cells, but actually all of the hormones

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.960
 go in and out of red blood cells.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.920
 So you have to break down the red blood cells really to know what is actually in the blood

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.240
 and available to the cells.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.360
 The thyroid hormones can bind to albumin, for example.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.800
 Albumin has free access in and out of cells, even into the nucleus.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.680
 So anything bound to the albumin is going in and out of cells.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.280
 So how do we test for thyroid?

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.240
 What's the most effective way to test for the condition of our thyroid?

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:44.360
 Broder Barnes, who was educated in the 1930s, reflected a lot of the understanding that

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:49.000
 was based on the good research of the Armour Company.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.720
 He advocated temperature, morning temperature especially, as a very important indicator

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.080
 in the functioning of the thyroid.

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:04.400
 But other doctors in the 1930s used a combination of indicators.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.400
 For example, some people showed that there was a mirror image relationship between blood

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:12.480
 cholesterol and thyroid.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:19.960
 When you remove someone's thyroid gland, immediately the cholesterol increased in the bloodstream

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.520
 as the oxygen consumption decreased.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.400
 And if you then gave them a thyroid supplement, it was a mirror image again.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:34.800
 The increasing thyroid and oxygen metabolism caused the cholesterol level to come down

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.800
 to normal.

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.880
 I've seen people lower their cholesterol.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:44.800
 They were in a hurry to pass an insurance health test, lower their cholesterol 200 to

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:52.720
 300 points in a week by using hourly doses, not take a huge dose at once, but just adjust

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.600
 and keep their thyroid where it should be.

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.520
 Keratin was another indicator.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:05.440
 Low thyroid people had high keratin and keratin is antagonistic to the female hormones in

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.920
 particular but also it tends to block the thyroid.

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:17.480
 Reaction tests, the speed at which your muscles react or relax corresponds to your thyroid

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.800
 function and oxidative metabolism.

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:28.600
 Achilles tendon reflex relaxation rate is what was used in the 1930s but a lot of doctors

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:35.480
 look at how far you jump when they hit a reflex trigger but it's the rate at which the muscle

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.360
 relaxes that corresponds to good thyroid function.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:45.320
 And your brain undergoes those same reactions so that on an electrical measurement of your

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:51.600
 brain waves or an electrocardiogram showing the speed and quality of the T wave which

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:57.600
 is the relaxation rate wave, those all improve under the influence of thyroid.

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:06.200
 So any indicator of quick relaxation, quick energy restoration, normalizing of cholesterol

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:11.480
 and various blood components, all of those help with the diagnosis.

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.120
 How many tablespoons of coconut oil a day do you have?

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:18.080
 Oh, I haven't eaten it regularly for a long time.

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.120
 Incidentally, I've always used the cheap refined stuff.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:26.160
 Now I use it just for occasionally frying things.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:32.440
 When I had a tablespoon or two every day over a period of I guess it was six or eight weeks,

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:37.000
 I lost weight that I had had for about 20 years.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.760
 Went back to my 1970 body weight.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.640
 And you think it was just from that alone?

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.320
 You don't think it was from pregnenolone?

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:48.240
 No, I had used pregnenolone before without any change.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:55.800
 When I experimented in around 1980 with DHEA, I noticed that I was looking slimmer, had

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.080
 a smaller waist.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:01.520
 But when I weighed myself, I weighed exactly the same.

00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:07.440
 It turned out I had grown a little at the age of something like 44 and built more muscles

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:10.840
 so that even though I looked slimmer, I was actually the same weight.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:16.760
 But then about 12 years after that was when I started using a little coconut oil and went

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.080
 down about 14 pounds.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:24.160
 You made a point of saying that you used the refined coconut oil and not the unrefined,

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.840
 which everybody recommends the unrefined.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.240
 You made a point of saying that, why?

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:34.880
 Because a lot of people are allergic to the extraneous material other than the fat in

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:35.880
 the oil.

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.440
 So you use the refined?

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.440
 Yeah, the deodorized.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.440
 Okay.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.960
 The basically tasteless kind.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:49.400
 If you're not allergic to it, the very aromatic unrefined kind is nice for making ice cream,

00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.160
 for example, coconut flavored.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.960
 But for frying eggs, it tastes terrible.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960
 Smells terrible.

00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.000
 Yeah, it tastes terrible.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.960
 Some people love it, but I don't know how they love it.

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.040
 They must do something with it.

00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.900
 I want to ask you a little bit about serotonin.

00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:09.680
 So many people as they get older start to lose their serotonin production or it goes

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.680
 down.

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.680
 Do you agree?

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:14.360
 I don't know the way it's measured.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:21.400
 I think the only simple way to measure it is by the breakdown product called 5-hydroxyindoleacetic

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.680
 acid, 5-HIAA.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.600
 That indicates how much you're destroying or excreting.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:36.000
 To do a blood test, you want to see how much is in the platelets and how much is in the

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:42.280
 free liquid of the plasma because the total amount in the platelet, as long as it's inside

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.920
 the cell, it isn't hurting you.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:50.840
 But if it's free in the liquids of your body and is deficient in the platelet, that means

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:56.160
 something is causing it to be not retained properly as if they're excited.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:04.520
 The normal function of the platelet is 95% of your body's serotonin is made in the intestine.

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:09.480
 Anything that inflames your intestine, even mechanical irritation, stretching it with

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:16.840
 a gas blow-up or irritating allergenic foods, all of these increase the intestine's production

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.480
 of serotonin.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:25.920
 And serotonin moving from the intestine into the blood is picked up by the platelets.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:32.280
 And if they bind it firmly, they carry it to the lungs where the situation of the carbon

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:39.640
 dioxide oxygen exchange causes them to release it where enzymes in the lungs destroy the

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.480
 serotonin.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:47.080
 Negative ions in the air seem to help the lungs to destroy the serotonin in an oxidative

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.980
 process.

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:54.880
 If your lungs and platelets aren't getting rid of the excess serotonin made in an irritated

00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:02.680
 intestine, then it gets to the brain and can cause things such as anxiety, aggression and

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:07.960
 even depression turning on the inflammatory system.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:15.080
 Serotonin is a major stimulant of the corticotropic release hormone which activates your pituitary

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.600
 to turn on your adrenal stress reaction.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:24.200
 So serotonin reaching the brain is a powerful stressor.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:30.600
 If people have a hard time relaxing, they have a hard time sleeping at night.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.960
 Most often it's either poor nutrition or hypothyroidism.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:40.000
 Some of the old people I mentioned who solved their problems by adding salt to their food

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.080
 noticed that when they followed the doctor's orders to not eat so much salt, they developed

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.800
 insomnia.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:53.120
 In the study where they were told it was okay to add salt, their insomnia was cured.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:00.840
 That led me to realize that salt is a major factor in lowering the stress hormones, especially

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.600
 adrenaline.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.760
 One of its functions is to counteract the effect of too much serotonin.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.680
 How is it that it is said, and this is a popular myth then, that serotonin in people over 50

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.720
 is dropping and that's why they should take tryptophan at night because tryptophan produces

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.480
 more melatonin, but doesn't it also produce serotonin?

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.800
 Experiments show that especially the hydroxy tryptophan very directly corresponds to increased

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.800
 serotonin.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.840
 And isn't serotonin the happy hormone?

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.280
 No, the name means the pressure increaser, the serum toner.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.880
 It was identified in the 1950s as the cause of emotional disturbances, blood pressure

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.720
 disturbances, many circulatory problems.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:55.080
 In the 70s, this myth about it being a happy hormone, on my website I explain some of the

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.840
 circumstances accounting for that very odd myth.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.320
 Is that in the article "Serotonin, Depression, and Aggression, the Problem of Brain Energy?"

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.720
 Yeah, that's one of them.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.720
 Okay.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.080
 There are several of them.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:11.200
 You have so many, it's hard to keep track of you.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.640
 Let's talk a little bit about radiation.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.280
 We're covering a lot of subjects.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:19.760
 I know we're going quickly on these, but there's a lot to say on this.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:26.200
 For women over a certain age, we're all told that we need to have an annual, not only breast

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.520
 exams, but we need to have a mammogram, which I refuse to do.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.560
 I do a thermogram.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.400
 We're told that we need to have annual x-rays at our dentist.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:44.080
 I know people who have had MRI after MRI after MRI, and they're being radiated.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.360
 Let's talk about it.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.520
 What's your take on the whole thing?

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:54.000
 In the 1950s, I got interested in the issue, and I've been following it ever since.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.000
 In the 1950s, the government would basically destroy the career and reputation of anyone

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.720
 who said radiation was harmful.

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.080
 They were in the business of selling their atomic bombs and atmospheric testing, so they

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:14.000
 had to say it wasn't killing Americans to drop radioactive fallout on them, but later

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.040
 calculations showed that, in fact, at a minimum, it killed 15,000 Americans, not to mention

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.840
 the rest of the world.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:28.640
 That was a minimal calculation, but in the 1950s, one of their big mouthpieces was John

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:35.160
 Goffman, who happened also to be a promoter of the cholesterol theory of heart disease.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.520
 I considered him sort of a demon because every time someone would point out the dangers of

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:46.120
 fallout, he was there to say, "It hasn't been proven that it causes cancer or sterility

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:51.560
 or mutated children or mutated great-grandchildren and so on.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.880
 Always don't worry.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.800
 It's probably harmless."

01:03:54.800 --> 01:04:01.160
 But in the 1960s, he later reported that he came to consciousness in the middle of one

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:07.640
 of those lectures and realized that he was saying insane things, but he had been a very

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:13.640
 influential government spokesman ever since the late '40s through the '60s, and his

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.680
 whole life after that was trying to bring some sanity back to the radiation business.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.000
 One of his last works, it might have been his last major book, was on the radiation

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.440
 influence on health.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.960
 Medical radiation, he showed, was currently the biggest cause of breast cancer and heart

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:40.720
 disease because of flowing radiation through the chest of millions of people at frequent

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.720
 intervals.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:47.000
 The heart and the breasts were getting exposed by chest X-rays and mammograms.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.760
 He showed, for example, that the incidence of these diseases corresponds to the availability

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:01.200
 and use of medical services so that the rich areas around San Francisco, for example, had

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.120
 the country's highest rate of breast cancer and very high heart disease.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:12.680
 West Virginia, with the lowest access to medical care on average, had the country's lowest

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.000
 incidence of breast cancer, lowest mortality.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.120
 That corresponds with all of the honest animal research.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:26.000
 It overlaps very interestingly with estrogen cancer research.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.280
 People who did studies including both radiation and estrogen exposure showed that they synergized.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.720
 You get a certain amount of cancerization from either radiation or estrogen, but when

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.560
 you have both of them, it's even more than additive.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.560
 It's compounding.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:50.600
 What do you think about Homeland Security doing low-level ionizing radiation equipment

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.080
 on people that are trying to travel?

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:59.440
 I don't know the current motivation, but one of their apparatuses that was irradiating

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.120
 people for a time, the business was owned by the head of the agency.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.680
 By Michael Turdoff, correct?

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680
 Yeah.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:15.440
 I think it's primarily money-making business as well as keeping the population fearful.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:20.320
 Having to do with health, what do you think of people going through those machines?

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.880
 Well, all of those types of radiation are known to be harmful.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:27.160
 Do you know what they told me at the airport last year?

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.240
 Somebody said when I refused to go through the machine, then I said, "It's okay.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.480
 You can do a pat-down."

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.880
 Then I won't even tell you what happened on that.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:40.000
 The woman said to me, "When you fly in the air, you're getting just as much radiation."

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.440
 Yeah, that's a story that was invented by both the people doing the atmospheric bomb

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:54.420
 testing and by the nuclear power industry, which was closely involved with the bomb industry.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:07:01.400
 The whole thing was a single culture, people going in and out of military bomb manufacturing,

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:04.040
 private electrical power generation.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:11.840
 Their story was that these ions, the radioactive isotopes of various metals and other compounds

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:20.080
 that are released from bombs and from the nuclear reactors, including Chernobyl, Fukushima,

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.040
 and any operating reactor.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:30.320
 For example, the area around the Rancho Seco reactor in California, the water supply contains

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:36.480
 isotopes from that reactor that are probably still causing cancer many years later.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:43.040
 These deadly particles that release radiation in your body after they've been ingested or

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.120
 breathed in have almost an absolute carcinogenic effect.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:55.800
 Each one destroys a series of cells, mutates them, and the radiation from an x-ray, which

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:01.520
 is powerfully carcinogenic, is many times less carcinogenic than breathing in these

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.000
 particles.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.920
 But the low-voltage x-ray that produces the best image of a breast, for example, and is

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:16.800
 still being the devices that produce the low-voltage sharp imaging mammogram devices, these are

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:23.200
 still being promoted, even though it's known that low-voltage, low-energy x-rays are much

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.720
 more carcinogenic than the high-voltage.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:33.200
 The principle is that low-energy radiation is more easily absorbed by tissues.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:38.480
 Gamma rays will penetrate through a meter or more of concrete, which means that passing

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.760
 through your body, relatively little of their energy is absorbed by the tissues.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:50.680
 So the extremely low energy of ultraviolet, for example, 100% of it stops in the first

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.400
 few millimeters of your skin, so you get a very intense sunburn.

01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:01.700
 The higher the energy is, the less tissue damage there is for a given amount of radiation,

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.680
 because it passes through without doing anything.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:11.440
 The radiation you get in an airplane, it's similar to living at a high altitude.

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:14.680
 This is high-energy cosmic radiation, primarily.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.200
 Isn't that a gamma ray?

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:23.400
 It releases gamma rays, which are much less harmful than low-energy x-rays.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.360
 Much less of it is absorbed.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.040
 With cosmic rays, it almost all passes through your bodies harmlessly.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:38.400
 It's going at such a high velocity that it leaves a stream of minor ionization, but it

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:42.640
 seldom produces carcinogenesis.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.160
 Studies looking at the cancer incidence in the United States or even within a state like

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:54.160
 Texas where there's a variation of stable population at different altitudes, they see

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:59.280
 that there's a negative correlation between cancer and altitude.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:05.480
 That corresponds to the fact that at high altitude, you get a lot of cosmic rays, but

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.840
 they're high-energy and pass through you.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:14.280
 At low altitude, those same rays have passed through a thicker layer of atmosphere, running

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:21.720
 into more oxygen and nitrogen atoms, causing collisions that release radioactive particles.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:27.240
 So you're actually getting more radiation from cosmic rays at sea level than at high

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240
 altitude.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:34.600
 But the industry, which has known that, and that the actual incidence of cancer increases

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.360
 at the lower altitude.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.640
 The industry has been lying about that for 50 years.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:45.680
 You know, I just found out I'm taking this trip to Spain this May, and I found out that

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:50.680
 Spain is the second highest country elevation in Europe.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.840
 First is Switzerland, and the second is Spain.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840
 Have you ever been?

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.380
 No, I've never went to Spain.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:03.480
 So I'll be at a very high altitude having a good laugh.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.000
 Do you live in the mountains?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
 No.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.160
 You live at low altitude?

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.160
 I'm surprised.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:17.280
 I have a house in Mexico that I hope to get to soon at 6,600 feet, but it's close to the

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.000
 volcanoes where you can get up to 17,000.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.160
 Oh, wow.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:26.680
 The only times I've been up that high, the higher I went, the better I felt.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.680
 It's something you can feel immediately as a lack of stress.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.880
 Let's go back to how we get more protective CO2, because I don't think we finish that.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880
 Do you?

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880
 No.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.880
 In an acute situation, you can apply it for high blood pressure, for example, or anxiety

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.240
 or other acute symptoms.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:49.860
 You can breathe, re-breathe into a paper bag for a minute or two at a time until you've

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.800
 got the feeling that you're suffocating, and then breathe some fresh air.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:59.120
 And doing that two or three times a day is usually enough to, over a period of a few

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:04.920
 days to lower your blood pressure, and it'll stop the anxiety quickly.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:11.680
 But for something like arthritic knee or foot or a broken bone or sprained ankle or such

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.120
 that you can put in a plastic bag filled with carbon dioxide, this has been done mostly

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.120
 in Europe.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.320
 That's the only place I know of hospitals that have done it, but I've seen people do

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:28.160
 it and radically increase the healing of injured tissue.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:34.240
 Once I was coming home with a huge tank, must have been a 35-pound tank or so, holding it

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:41.440
 with the valve at the top, and I stumbled on the steps to a brick walk, and I didn't

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:47.160
 want to drop the tank and risk breaking the valve off, which would create a rocket effect.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:53.560
 So I hugged the tank to my body and went down, fell on my wrist against the bricks with my

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.120
 body and the tank on top of it.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.400
 I think I'm going to faint just with the imagery of this, but go ahead.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:04.760
 I saw it immediately start to turn blue, and I rushed in the house, got a plastic bag and

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:11.040
 filled it with carbon dioxide and held my hand in it for an hour and brought my hand

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040
 out.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.040
 There was no injury.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.760
 How did you get the CO2?

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.480
 I had the tank right there in my hand.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480
 Okay, it was the tank.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.640
 How did you get the CO2 in the tank?

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.120
 I bought it from a welding shop.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.120
 Very cool.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.120
 You're very creative.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.480
 Are you still doing your art?

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.480
 Oh, yeah.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.480
 You're still painting?

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.480
 Yeah.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:35.920
 I think of myself primarily as a painter who doesn't have any customers.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.680
 Do you want customers?

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.440
 I tried to be a portrait painter for a while, but I decided that I didn't want to paint

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.440
 the way they wanted.

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:48.520
 They, for example, would have fairly silly looking kids that they wanted to look like

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.480
 classical storybook illustrations or something, but I like doing realistic things that actually

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:59.280
 show the personality, but my customers didn't like that.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.520
 That would be scary if that happened with its rain making time.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:08.600
 Sometimes the customers may not like what we talk about, but we got to talk about it.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.040
 Want to talk to you about modern lighting for a moment.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:17.800
 Are you aware that the modern lighting of society, that these tablets and the cell phones

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:23.680
 and the computers are all interfering with our melatonin day and night cycles and the

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.680
 pineal gland functioning?

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.840
 Yeah.

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.880
 That's another reason why some people can't sleep at night, even if they're not going

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.200
 through menopause or they're not in any major hormonal change.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.200
 Yeah.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:40.280
 If you get your hormones and carbon dioxide up where they should be, you're pretty resistant

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:46.400
 to those minor field disturbances, but they are constant drains on our system.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.400
 One of the reasons I picked out the town in Mexico for my house was that it was known

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:55.560
 as a radiation quiet zone.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:15:02.440
 The National University built a radio telescope just outside of town because it was so free

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.200
 of telephone pollution and such.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.400
 You couldn't get radio or telephone or television signals there.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:14.640
 You know, we have so much wifi and cell tower infiltration of society.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.880
 I'm not sure we're going to be able to understand why people are so sick in so many different

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880
 areas.

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.880
 Exactly.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.840
 It's not even on the radar, no pun intended, of the health field.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.860
 If you work with an electrical machine, for example, you're constantly eight hours a day

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:38.240
 exposed to fields that probably are not as intense as some people get when they live

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.160
 near a phone tower.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.760
 But those electrical machine operators are known to have had a very high rate of Alzheimer's

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.600
 disease and other degenerative diseases.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:54.480
 So I think the zones around high electromagnetic emissions are going to turn out very sick.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.800
 Oh, for sure.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.240
 We've done a lot of shows on this.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.120
 Is there a test to measure the CO2 in your body so you can see if you're improving your

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:04.120
 CO2 levels?

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120
 Yeah.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:11.280
 I don't know how expensive the gadgets are, but I got one, I guess, 15 years ago that

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:18.920
 cost $1,300 that you blow into it at the end of your exhalation and can see how much CO2

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.920
 you're producing.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.280
 Do you know the name of the machine?

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.320
 Oh, it's a capnometer or a capnograph.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.040
 You can find them on the internet.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:33.280
 They should be available for about $35, but I don't know whether anything is commercially

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.480
 available right now.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.520
 Well, we're in the age of miniaturization, right?

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:38.520
 Yeah.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.600
 Things are getting smaller and smaller and being produced faster and faster and cheaper

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.960
 and cheaper.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.600
 So maybe it's at a level of affordability for most people who might be interested.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:54.840
 When I first wanted a meter to measure carbon monoxide in the breath, the cheapest I could

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.040
 find was $10,000, but now they're $30.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.200
 You mean monoxide or carbon dioxide?

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.760
 Well, that was monoxide, and if they can do it with carbon monoxide, they should be able

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.440
 to do it with carbon dioxide.

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.440
 Most certainly.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.720
 Most certainly.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:14.200
 Let's hit the big one and talk about pregnenolone.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.520
 You're a big pregnenolone advocate.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.480
 Tell us what it is and why you suggest we use it.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:31.560
 When we metabolize cholesterol, what happens is under the influence of thyroid hormone,

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:40.080
 which stimulates oxidation, and vitamin A, which activates the enzymes to clip a chain

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:48.040
 off cholesterol, thyroid and vitamin A are the factors we need mostly for producing pregnenolone

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.760
 from cholesterol.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:56.080
 So if you're low in cholesterol or thyroid or vitamin A, you're necessarily going to

01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:02.360
 be deficient in pregnenolone, and pregnenolone is the immediate precursor to progesterone

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.360
 and DHEA.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.160
 Progesterone is the precursor to cortisol.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:14.120
 DHEA is the precursor to testosterone and other androgens and estrogen.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:20.720
 If you are deficient in the precursors, the body will still have the ability to make a

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:28.280
 normal or even increased amount of the end hormones, which in the extreme situation tend

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.800
 to be cortisol and estrogen.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:39.040
 The deficiency of thyroid and/or vitamin A and/or cholesterol will, because of not making

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:44.440
 enough precursor, will tend to expose your body chronically to high estrogen and high

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.080
 cortisol.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:52.280
 And when you get the precursors, it happens that pregnenolone inhibits the stress process

01:18:52.280 --> 01:19:00.040
 and turns down your ACTH and adrenal hormone activity so that in itself, it blocks the

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:06.080
 effects of those hormones, but at the same time, it's blocking the production of those

01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.320
 hormones.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:15.480
 So it's doing many things, protecting against the harmful stress mediators and in itself,

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:20.280
 it works somewhat like carbon dioxide that's stabilizing cells.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:26.480
 So I've seen people, for example, with emphysema who were purple because they couldn't get

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.440
 enough oxygen.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:34.920
 In just a few days, they were back to normal color, breathing, walking upstairs, no problem,

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.920
 and so on.

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:41.120
 Progesterone has that same effect on the lungs, getting rid of excess water so that oxygen

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.560
 can get through to the bloodstream.

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:49.360
 And in the inflamed joints, it has that same effect, releasing water that shouldn't be

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.360
 there.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:56.120
 For example, bulgy eyes in Graves, so-called Graves disease, where the eyes are protruding.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:02.520
 I've seen people's eyes recede back into a more normal position where they could close

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.080
 their eyelids in just an hour or so.

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:12.600
 It has its intrinsic protective effects as well as its indirect effects of blocking and

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.720
 reducing the production of stress hormones.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:23.520
 And then it also is the precursor for the other protective steroids, DHEA and progesterone.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:31.000
 Around 1990, the whole idea that instead of being all produced in the gonads and the adrenals,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.440
 it was realized that steroids are being produced in many tissues.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.440
 And the brain and skin are major steroid-producing factories.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:48.400
 And the major brain steroids happen to be pregnenolone, progesterone, and some DHEA,

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.020
 and the minor products from those.

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:57.120
 But the basic protective steroids in the brain especially, but throughout the body, are these

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:58.120
 three.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:20:59.120
 Do you take DHEA?

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.480
 Yeah, I'm currently taking a couple milligrams per day.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.840
 You notice a difference?

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.240
 Yeah, it gives me nicer dreams.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240
 Nicer dreams?

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.120
 Yeah, a general feeling of euphoria.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.920
 Now how much pregnenolone do you take?

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.000
 100 milligrams?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
 What are you taking?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.580
 Oh, I stopped taking that about 10 years ago when I couldn't get a reliable source.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:31.720
 So I found out that by adjusting other things, thyroid and diet, I apparently am making enough

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.420
 that I don't feel an effect when I take some.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:39.960
 So you're taking thyroid and you're taking very little, if any, coconut oil, right?

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.640
 Yeah, very little, just for frying things occasionally.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.600
 I count on food for my nutrients.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:52.000
 I'm keeping the hormones in balance mainly by adjusting my thyroid.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
 Right.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.840
 So you're not taking pregnenolone?

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.120
 No, I haven't for quite a while.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.600
 And you wouldn't recommend it to anybody?

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:03.200
 Oh sure, I'd recommend it freely if you're not allergic to it.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.440
 Most of the products now contain strange binders.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.640
 Everyone seems to think it's necessary to put silicon dioxide.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.400
 Even some of the companies that supposedly have all these great products are putting

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.580
 all kinds of weird binders, you're right.

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:26.900
 I think they are just convinced by the salespeople, whatever the chemical companies have to sell,

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:33.440
 they convince the supplement manufacturers that they need it to make their pills prettier.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.520
 So how do you get enough pregnenolone in your system?

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.600
 Eating foods that keep my cholesterol production high.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.100
 Orange juice is my main one.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:50.880
 I've seen people go from about 130 cholesterol to 160 or 170 in just a couple of weeks just

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:57.120
 by eating an extra, oh maybe a quarter day of orange juice.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.760
 And are you talking about orange juice or are you talking about concentrate?

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:08.640
 Well, I always recommended the frozen concentrate until several years ago.

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:16.400
 A lot of people started having bad reactions to it and I got asthma from most of the types

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.760
 and so I started using only sweet, freshly squeezed oranges.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.720
 And why do you think, because see some people would say, "Oh my God, that's high in sugar."

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:31.600
 Why wouldn't that cause a problem with your glucose metabolism?

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:41.760
 No, you need sugar to make thyroid hormone and to make the various things related to

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.760
 cholesterol.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.080
 Is that really true?

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:51.080
 Yeah, sugar is the main precursor and regulator for both thyroid and cholesterol.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.080
 Wow.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:53.560
 This is news to me.

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.560
 It's news.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:57.880
 I've got a couple articles on diabetes.

01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:59.040
 Yes.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:06.520
 Talk about the effects of sugar in general and its ramifications and especially when

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.080
 it comes in the form of fruit like orange juice.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:16.440
 The minerals, potassium for example, takes on the function of insulin and so your body

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:23.120
 doesn't bother producing insulin because the orange juice is so easily metabolized without

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:30.920
 insulin so it's not fattening the way if you get the same amount of sugar from starch.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:39.600
 The starch is a powerful insulin stimulant and insulin tends to turn carbohydrate to

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.600
 fat.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:46.440
 Do you think that it's possible for people with diabetes to get off of insulin shots?

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:52.560
 I've known a couple of people who did it in a week by radically changing their diet but

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:58.360
 I think it's good to measure things carefully and figure on doing it over a period of a

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360
 few months.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:06.360
 My father had a diagnosis of diabetes when he was about 30 and had wasted away to well

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:12.760
 under 100 pounds when he found an old naturopathic book that described treating it with brewer's

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:13.760
 yeast.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.840
 And when he started eating nothing but brewer's yeast for a few weeks, he stopped producing

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.360
 glucose in his urine and started gaining weight.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.480
 He gradually added other foods but for a few weeks he ate cups full of brewer's yeast as

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.040
 his only food.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:37.600
 After he got his weight back up, he lived 48 years after that with no sign of diabetes.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.600
 How extraordinary.

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.400
 Now was that with your help?

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.880
 No, he and my mother found that themselves.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.160
 Are your parents still alive?

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.920
 No, they died 40 years ago.

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.920
 You miss them?

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.920
 Oh sure.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.760
 Did they understand you and your work?

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.760
 Oh yeah, they were collaborators.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.760
 Really?

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.760
 Yeah.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.160
 Were they scientists or doctors or?

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.400
 No, just co-conspirators in finding things out.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.200
 A lot of people dream of having parents like that.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200
 Yeah.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.200
 That's extraordinary.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:10.160
 Yeah, they helped me start the Blake College in Mexico in the 60s.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.280
 That's great.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:16.960
 And last subject and we'll still never scratch the surface with you is osteoporosis.

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.760
 There are so many opinions about how to prevent osteoporosis.

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.120
 Some people say take vitamin D3 in high quantities.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.400
 Some people say lift weights, do weight bearing exercises.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.000
 But everybody wants to go in and get one of those bone scans.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.760
 Yeah, x-rays happen to poison bone metabolism so the more bone scans you have, the more

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.800
 osteoporosis you're going to get.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:50.440
 And the doctors have known for at least 15 years that looking at the bone with ultrasound

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.520
 is many times more valid than the x-ray scans.

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.360
 And ultrasound stimulates bone strengthening.

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.200
 So it's totally crazy not to use ultrasound to test your bones.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:08.240
 Do you think it's possible to order a test to have your bone density checked via ultrasound

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.240
 today?

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.240
 Yeah.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:13.800
 There are good machines and minimal machines.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.920
 The good ones can tell you how strong the bone is.

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:21.880
 The minimal ones will just tell you where it rates on the scale of density.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:28.200
 But it's sort of hard to find them because the x-ray people discourage competition.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.200
 For sure.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:33.640
 You don't know of a single place in America that one could get their bone density tested

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.840
 via ultrasound.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:42.600
 I think someone found one in New York City but they're very hard to find around the country.

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.600
 I know the machines exist but they are probably mainly for research purposes.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.000
 I see.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.080
 And lots of doctors are steering women away from using thyroid.

01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:02.080
 An article in JAMA around 1985 reported that women who took thyroid had more osteoporotic

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:09.040
 bones but they were taking thyroid according to what was current prescribing practices

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.040
 at that time.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.400
 So when they had someone with serious thyroid deficiency, they were typically giving them

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.400
 only half as much as they needed.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:25.960
 And so what they were seeing was that hypothyroid women who were under-prescribed had more osteoporosis

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.800
 than healthy women.

01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:34.960
 But the animal studies show the actual picture in which, for example, around 1940, rabbit

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:41.320
 studies showed that giving a toxic amount of armor thyroid in their diet, rabbits normally

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:47.460
 don't have very vigorous thyroid activity but they gave them I think 1% of the mass

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:50.640
 of their food was armor thyroid powder.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:56.640
 It would be like us eating tablespoons of thyroid pills every day.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.920
 And it stimulated their metabolic rate so much that they couldn't eat enough food to

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.480
 maintain their body weight.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:04.920
 So they waste away?

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:08.480
 They wasted away and died of skinniness.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:13.520
 But when they looked at their bones, they had abnormally dense, strong bones.

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:20.440
 So the bones were the most protected tissue in the case of thyroid excess poisoning.

01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.640
 You know, it's very interesting because you can change something at a molecular level

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:27.920
 and you've changed the whole thing.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:36.000
 And very little do I hear of doctors or researchers talking about the alteration of the molecular

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.160
 level of food, water, and everything.

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:46.840
 Studies on the skull bones of young mice, a very thin bone structure that's easy to

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:53.800
 study in the dish because it can absorb its nutrients directly from the culture dish.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:30:01.480
 They found that T3, the active thyroid hormone, stimulates the metabolism of the bone cells

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:09.400
 causing the production of carbon dioxide which combines and crystallizes with calcium from

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:15.400
 the solution forming new bone directly in vitro can be demonstrated under the influence

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:17.400
 of active thyroid.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.600
 Interesting.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.760
 We really have to explore the details of things.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.240
 I like that you get into so much detail.

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.240
 It's very important.

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.760
 Very, very important.

01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.160
 I remember four and a half years ago when I was doing an examination of what's happening

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.840
 with climate.

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:37.120
 And it wasn't until I was deeper into the investigation that I found out that the climate

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:44.440
 assertions and declarations have all been done by computer simulations and not by real

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.440
 data.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.840
 But I just want to tell you, this is an example.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:53.200
 So when we talk about health and wellness, I like that you go into so much detail because

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.200
 it's in the details.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:58.880
 Obviously, it's in the synergy and it's in the whole systems and it's in the whole organism.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:04.560
 I like that you take this approach to looking at things and you look at evidence and details.

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:10.840
 But even in the anti-aging field, I've noticed that I myself have been imbued with inaccurate

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:11.840
 information.

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:19.240
 It's a constant process of trying to enlarge your context and field of reference because

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:25.760
 within one context, the medical school professor can sound very convincing.

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:30.720
 But when you look at a broader context and see what experiments people were doing 50

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:35.740
 or 100 years ago or 150 years ago, things look very different.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:42.780
 That whole context dropped out and they reconstructed the kind of context that fits basically what

01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.780
 they want to sell.

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:48.800
 What do you think of this Affordable Care Act, do I dare ask?

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.520
 I think I'd rather pay the fine than be forced to buy insurance.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:59.100
 First of all, I haven't been to a doctor since I was 10 years old, I think, except to have

01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:04.180
 obligatory examinations, like to get my driver's license in Mexico.

01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:11.080
 I have to have an exam every six years, but otherwise I avoid doctors and I would avoid

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:17.160
 insurance except that the state requires car insurance and now they're requiring health

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.160
 insurance.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.380
 But as far as possible, I'd rather pay the fine.

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:25.480
 Is there anything else you'd like to say to the audience today?

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:28.700
 Looking at the big context is the important thing.

01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:36.700
 We're constantly being subjected to misinformation and it's necessary to look at concrete experiments

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:42.480
 and then see whether someone has done counter experiments that would invalidate those.

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:48.220
 Don't you find that a lot of the testing that is done connected to the pharmaceutical industry

01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:49.820
 is not real testing?

01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:54.020
 In other words, they use the population as their test rats a lot of times?

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:59.820
 Yeah, the figures of the labs for the normal range, first of all, they're done on medical

01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.420
 populations.

01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:08.020
 No one sets aside a population that they define as healthy and finds out what the real numbers

01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:09.500
 should be.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:17.140
 One study looking at the TSH range, they sorted them out, people who had been tested at one

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:22.820
 time and looked at the ones who later over the next 10 or 20 years developed thyroid

01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:24.940
 cancer or other cancers.

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:34.820
 They found that the ones whose TSH was below 0.4 on the scale, it usually has that as considered

01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:36.080
 too low.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:39.540
 They were the ones who were freest of cancer.

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:45.740
 If you consider that the numbers represent a sick population, who wants to be standardized

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:47.660
 to a sick population?

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:51.620
 You know, some people will say, "Well, we can't test this stuff on healthy people.

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:52.820
 It's not ethical."

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.900
 What do you say to that?

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:59.660
 It's even worse to test it on sick people.

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:04.740
 At least healthy people are better apt to make a decision whether to be tested or not.

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:05.740
 Yeah.

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:06.740
 Yeah.

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:07.740
 Oh my God.

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:11.460
 Ladies and gentlemen, we have been talking with, learning from, and listening to Dr.

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:12.960
 Ray Peet.

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:19.020
 You can find out more about him and his hundreds and hundreds of articles and experience and

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:22.500
 expertise by going to rayPeat.com.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:28.060
 Dr. Peet, I hope you will come on again.

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:33.780
 I'm going to have a panel come on and I'd love to hear you share with the other panelists

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:37.920
 your expertise as we talk about other subjects to come.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.620
 Thank you so much for being with us.

01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.620
 Okay.

01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.620
 Thank you.

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.620
 Thanks for all your work in the world.

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:43.620
 Bye-bye.
