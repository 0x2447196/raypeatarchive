00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.200
 Well good evening and welcome once again to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.700
 My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.500
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 and recommend herbs, supplements and nutritional counseling.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Garboville 91.1 FM

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 You're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of rheumatism in the broadest sense.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 It's rheumatoid arthritis and the other arthropathies that I think will be related and an alternative treatment to rheumatoid arthritis.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 We're very welcome to have Dr. Peat's expertise on the show and of course as always a very counterculture viewpoint

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 but very positively associated counterculture.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 It's a very alternative scientific viewpoint not mainstream and not even naturopathic.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 There's a lot of information that he comes out with very much based and rooted in firm science.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Probably the science that some of which has been largely ignored and shelved in favor of new drug treatments

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 because we all know that new drug treatments are hugely profitable and not always beneficial.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 So we'll be introducing Dr. Peat here very shortly.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Just incidentally for people listening to the show, if they want to look at Dr. Raymond Peat's articles,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 he has a pretty extensive list of articles covering many different conditions that people suffer with.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And the articles are fully referenced, scientific articles, and they can lead you down a trail that will open your eyes

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 and illuminate for you what it is that he has uncovered, continued the research that's been done from people back in the 50s and 60s

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 and even before and brought it into a mainstream 21st century appreciation of what we now can detect

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 with our improved skills, etc., in measuring things.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 But anyway, his website, RayPeat.com, is fully referenced articles and he doesn't sell them.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 They're all available there for people to look at, print out, share, etc.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 We do encourage a lot of free material and free sharing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It's not about making money and making a profit.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 It's about sharing this wisdom with other people.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 So the other thing that people might want to make a note of is that on our website,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 we have a website, westernbotanicalmedicine.com, all of the audio archives are on the website.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So people, please feel free to download those, share and distribute them as well.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 I forgot to mention that some time ago we have a comprehensive list of shows from 2009 through 2016.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 There's one from 2008 there too, I think.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Yeah, there's a couple there.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Okay, so we can be reached toll free 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or further information Monday through Friday.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 It's going to say after the show, but we won't be here.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 So Monday through Friday, 9 until 5.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Okay, so this month's discussion is going to be on alternative approaches to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 It's an extremely crippling and debilitating condition that affects, I think, the last count was something like 30 million people in the U.S.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 and obviously people globally.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 It's not just confined to the U.S.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 So to coin this loose term arthritis, we first need to differentiate rheumatoid from osteoarthritis.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Osteoarthritis implies a type of joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Typical visual clues in the skeleton of the hand, the knuckle joints can display masses that they call Bouchard's nodes

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 and the fingertips have swellings referred to as Heberden's nodes.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 So this is what we were taught when we were studying herbal medicine.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 These were very diagnostic indicators and you can see them when people lay their hands on the table.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 These big swellings are very typical of osteoarthritis.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 The inflammation is typically not red or hot and the underlying cartilage is lost with the bone underneath affected from the wear and tear.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And typically only the joints are affected.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Now with rheumatoid, it's a long-lasting autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the joints resulting in warm swollen painful joints.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Pain and stiffness often worse following rest and commonly the wrist and hands are involved with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 There can be systemic involvement which is some of the worst presentations of this type of disease from the autoimmune condition

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 which can affect red blood cell count decreasing it, pleurisy and inflammation of the pleura and the lungs

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 and pericarditis, the same sac membrane that the heart has around it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 The inflammation of that is not also uncommon.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 A fever and low energy may be present as well.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 So it's multi-systemic.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 The lungs, the kidneys, the heart and blood vessels can all be affected.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 So you can look at osteoarthritis as just a wear and tear breakdown of the joint with years of use and rheumatoid is an autoimmune condition where the body is attacking itself.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
 Yeah.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 So it's three times.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 There's a couple of factors here that seem to differentiate it or single out the targets for it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Three times more common in smokers than non-smokers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 I think that's particularly significant especially in men.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 And vitamin D deficiency is more common in people with rheumatoid arthritis than in the general population.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 So from 7.30 until the end of the show, we're opening up the lines for people who want to call in with questions to ask Dr. Peat.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 His approach to what he'll be explaining is not particularly well treated with modern methods like methotrexate, for example,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 a very toxic compound, very harmful to the liver.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 I think also gold, sorts of gold have been mentioned as treatments for it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 But anyway, let's introduce Dr. Peat.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Dr. Peat, are you with us?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Yes.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 Thank you so much for joining us.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 I appreciate your time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 As always, folks, just recognize that we don't pay Dr. Peat and he does this very freely.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 So I do very much appreciate your time giving what you do.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 So Dr. Peat, in terms of what you are uncovering,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 I know it's linked to previous papers that you've written on cancer.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 And we've mentioned this failed war on cancer.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 And also this same war on rheumatism or rheumatoid arthritis is also kind of lost already.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 It very rarely yields anything beneficial and doesn't seem to be really providing too much for patients.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000
 In fact, probably making people, I would like to say worse in some ways through the modalities of treatment that are being used

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 because they're not very holistic and they're quite destructive.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So how do you first see rheumatoid arthritis as a systemic condition?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And how do you see it being produced and then any other viewpoints that you have around it?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 First of all, I don't make a clear distinction between any kind of arthritis

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 or even between heart failure, atherosclerosis, various degenerative diseases

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 and any of the forms of arthritis.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 I think the interesting thing is to explain how a few basic metabolic problems have these very different looking expressions.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 And the really interesting research over the last 30 years or so has been in showing how inflammation relates to metabolism

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 and what the factors are that can increase inflammation or reduce our ability to resolve it, get over the inflammation.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 And in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, many years ago I knew two women who were completely disabled

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 with huge swollen knee joints and hands that they couldn't use.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 And I was interested in the fact that the condition developed when they started taking estrogen.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 One was only in her 30s and her doctor, when she developed the arthritis,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 I think he told her that she needed to increase the dose of estrogen

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 because of the very deep belief that estrogen is protective against almost everything.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And I spent several hours over a period of two or three weeks going over some of the research with her.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 And she would, after each time we talked, she would go back to her doctor

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 and the doctor would say she had to increase the estrogen.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 But finally she was getting worse and she decided just to stop it.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 The other one had not taken so long to reconsider and had recovered within a week or two of stopping it.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And this one had the same experience, total relief, clearing of the swellings.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 And that got me interested in why they recovered so fast when they simply stopped estrogen.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 So I kept that in mind.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 And the next person I saw with rheumatoid arthritis was a man, about 48 years old,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 who every afternoon his knee would just suddenly swell up hugely.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 During the night it would get better, but he was increasingly disabled,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 hardly able to keep working at his bench fixing television.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 But remembering the way the women recovered from when they stopped estrogen,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 I thought he might have the same imbalance and got him a bottle of 500 milligrams of injectable progesterone,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 which he covered his leg with, all in one application.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 And about two hours later the inflammation was down and the next day it didn't return.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 And I saw him, I think it was 40 years later, and he was just starting to get knee inflammation again.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Never had a return in all of those years.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 So I was convinced that estrogen had a central role,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 that progesterone could be more curative apparently than cortisol.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 The glucocorticoids are the main popular treatment,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 but people usually end up using those for years.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And one of the main side effects of the glucocorticoids is loss of bone density.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Rheumatoid arthritis, which tends to involve overgrowth of the bone around the joint,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 fades over eventually into breaking of the bones from osteoporosis.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 And I started reading about the osteoarthritis

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 and found that some of the studies that were published only in books,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 not in the medical journals, made a clear association between estrogen and osteoarthritis,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 even though the medical journals are very consistent in saying osteoarthritis,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 with its loss of bone and cartilage, is caused by estrogen deficiency.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 I tended to believe that the research published in books somehow had been excluded from the journals.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 And so looking at the research on what activates the osteoclasts that cause bone breakdown in osteoarthritis,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 endotoxin is a major activator of the osteoclasts.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 So that would have a role to play in both osteoarthritis as well as osteoporosis.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 Oh, yeah. And in all of the degenerative diseases.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 And several things follow once you start having endotoxin absorbed in your system.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Then you begin overproducing nitric oxide and prostaglandins, for example.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 And Dr. Peat, can you please recap just for our listeners where endotoxin mostly comes from?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 It's produced by bacteria and it's a combination of fatty acids and carbohydrate,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 lipophilic saccharides is its chemical name.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 And the main source is from the intestinal tract?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Yeah, the intestinal bacteria are always producing it.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 And we absorb a little bit of it all the time and it acts as sort of a stimulant to the immune system

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 and other cells are being constantly irritated by it.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 So in everyday life, it doesn't have a harmful effect.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 And this is why you're a proponent of the raw carrots because they help to protect against some of that absorption of endotoxin.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Yeah, the bactericidal effect of the carrot suppresses the growth of the bacteria

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and then the fiber absorbs and stimulates the excretion.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 So even in a healthy person that has a healthy digestive tract,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 this lipophilic saccharide is still going to be produced by commensal in our own gut bacteria that we need?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Yeah, and there's always a little bit of it getting into the liver

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 and probably a little always seeping into the general bloodstream,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 but in a very small amount, it doesn't have those serious degenerative effects.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 When you let your liver function slow down, it massively gets past the liver barriers

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 and it starts poisoning all of your systems, increasing nitric oxide

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 and drastically lowering the oxygen metabolism.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 And this is where endotoxin and estrogen come together.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 They both interfere with the metabolic use of oxygen.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And so that turns on glycolysis, turning sugar into lactic acid.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 The lactic acid shifts everything throughout.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 The more irritated a tissue or organ is, the more reduced it is, the more electron excess it has.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 And this shifts everything coherently through that tissue and organ and eventually through the whole organism.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 So this is the excitotoxic stage where these electrons need to be quenched

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 or need to be taken up by electron acceptors?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Yeah. The concept of reductive stress is now pretty well established,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 but 50 years ago everyone was thinking about oxidative stress,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 but really the degenerative processes are exactly the opposite.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Not enough oxygen, too much reduction.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And so estrogen and endotoxin do many things that interfere with the use of oxygen

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 and shift us over to the glycolytic lactic acid producing condition in which we,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 since we can't oxidize glucose, then we are forced to oxidize fats.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And that's very inefficient and leads to lipid peroxidation

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 and the increased production of prostaglandins.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Right, which are pain mediators for those people listening.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 They're mediators of pain and inflammation.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 If our bodies are well loaded with polyunsaturated fats,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 which we don't want,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 yeah, then that tends to increase steadily with aging.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 And so as a person increases their stores of polyunsaturated fats,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 every little stress becomes more reductive and more inflammatory.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 So the prostaglandins act increasingly to amplify any little stress.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Let me just give out some details here and we'll carry on with your description here.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 For those people listening, from 7.30 to 8 o'clock, the lines will be open.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 For those people living in the area, there's an 8707 number, 9233911.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 There is a toll-free number, 1, let me see here, 888, no, yeah, 1-800.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 K-M-U-D, rad, so that's 800-568-3723.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 Okay, those people that are listening on the web also can contact the studio.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 We've very interestingly had people from Scandinavia, from Europe, from the East Coast.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 That's always fun.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 I think we even had one from--

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 South America, didn't we?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 South America, yeah.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 Okay.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 So Dr. Peat, can I carry on in terms of the way you understand rheumatoid arthritis

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 in terms of the processes that you've already mentioned,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 things like estrogen, obviously increasing inflammation,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 endotoxin absorption from the gut because of either poor gut bacterial habits,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 either constipation I'm sure is definitely an exacerbating factor

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 for increasing lipopolysaccharide reabsorption.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 As is diets that are deficient in non-digestible fibers.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 I know you mentioned lots of things like the carrots and bamboo shoots

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 as indigestible fibers that actually work to remove excess estrogen from the bowel,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 keep the bowel mobile so that the chances of reabsorption are minimized.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 So how else do you see the energetic aspect of rheumatoid arthritis

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 and how it manifests in such a wide range of systemic conditions,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 many of which are life-threatening?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:23.000
 There are two main directions other than these local processes

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 from the intestine to whatever organ that is failing.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 That ends up with the prostaglandin amplified inflammation.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 Meanwhile, the thyroid pituitary system are being affected by the processes of the intestine

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 and the organ itself which is wasting energy.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 The organ, part of how say an inflamed knee affects the thyroid is by leaking substance,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 a weak cell leaks its various components, proteins in particular leak out.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 When a cell is under stress, the so-called stress proteins,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 which include heat shock proteins and the glucose regulated proteins.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 These are like signals then, these are stress signals,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 they act as a stress signal to the body.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 The so-called heat shock protein is activated by too much exercise

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 or too little oxygen and glucose, anything that de-energizes,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 especially heat will stimulate the cell while wasting its energy.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 So these glucose deficiency specifically will bring up the glucose regulated stress proteins

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 and all of these are intrinsic stabilizing factors.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 They're defensive reactions that sort of hold the cell together acting as chaperones

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 but they leak out because of the cell's structure being loosened by the inflammation

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 and take up of too much water and these things leak out and become immunogenic.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 In their own right.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Yes, that's where even before there are any signs at all of swollen joints,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 people can detect the rheumatoid factor of the antibody.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Right, that's a good point to bring up.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 I think I read that 70% I think of rheumatoid sufferers have it, 30% don't

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 and there are some people that have rheumatoid factor in the absence of rheumatoid arthritis

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 but it's a co-factor in other inflammatory processes, inflammatory diseases.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Yes, I see it as a sign of stress that isn't being handled

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 that can eventually go in the direction of visibly inflamed and stiffened joints and so on.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 What you were getting to is I think is that the rheumatoid factor

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 and the other markers of inflammation are circulating in the blood

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 and they're either poisoning the pituitary, the anterior pituitary

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 or was it the thyroid gland directly?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 The thyroid is responding to the same stress signals

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 that the local connective tissue is responding to.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 So the nitric oxide for example goes up in the whole organism

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 and this shifts the brain and the pituitary to increase the thyroid stimulating hormone

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 while blocking the ability of the thyroid gland to produce the hormone.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 So your functional hormone goes down while the TSH rises

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 and even within the normal range of TSH

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 which currently is something like 0.4 to 5.0 I think.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Even though supposedly the American Association of Endocrinologists

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 lowered it to 0.3 to 3.3 I think?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Yes, but even within that normal range, the upper part of the range

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 is now known to be associated with an increased risk of death

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 from cancer and heart disease and other things.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 So I think the best evidence is that you want to keep your TSH low

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 because it's a factor that promotes all types of inflammation

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 especially the rheumatoid swelling, loss of energy, tumor necrosis factor,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 interleukins 1 and 6 in particular and so on.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 So TSH is a major responder to the stress signals

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 which come from the intestine and the degenerating joints for example

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 and the antibodies that have been defined as thyroid specific antibodies

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 turn out to be joint specific antibodies as well.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Wow, so things like the TPO, the thyroid peroxidase?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And the thyroglobulin?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 Yes, the thyroglobulin.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Yes, I think the thyroid globulin specific enzyme is also specific for joint tissue.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Probably they'll turn out to have even more overlaps than that

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 if people begin looking for them.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Like with heart disease?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Yes, and the known atherosclerosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 actually doesn't seem to involve attack on the blood vessels by antibodies

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 but simply something going wrong in the whole organism

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 that causes more or less simultaneous degeneration of the blood vessels and the joints.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 It isn't a specific autoimmune process

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 even though the whole organism can be said to be in an autoimmune state.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 When people were studying viral encephalitis for example,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 they found that an antibody in the autoimmune process seemed to be involved.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 So they engineered the animals so that they could prevent the autoimmune antibody production

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 and they found that the animals died quicker when they lacked the autoimmune process.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 So that supports the Jamie Cuddenliffe-Polly Matsinger approach to what the immune system is really doing.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 Jamie Cuddenliffe's idea is that the primary function of what is called the immune system

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 is a maintenance of order of the body and its tissues.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 And when something goes wrong, it can be an organism causing damage to the tissues.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 In that case, the organism is destroyed and creates a specific immunity to that type of organism.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 But that's really, in his view, a side effect of the basic cleanup process.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 There are many theories of virus or bacteria of various types causing rheumatoid arthritis

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 and the other inflammatory diseases, but I don't think you need those.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 When you have an energetically precarious tissue condition,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 it just takes any little cause to tip it over the edge into an uncontrolled degeneration and inflammation.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 I think what comes over time and time again, I think most people really kind of lose sight of,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 is that if you want to put out that glib term, you know, we're all connected as human beings on a planet.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 The same interconnectedness exists in our body where nothing is done in isolation.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 So if you mention an organ or a tissue in any part of the body being affected,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 obviously the blood is passing through that organ or through that tissue and carried to the rest of the body,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 whether it's through the vasculature or through the lymphatics.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 Anything that is in any kind of degenerate state in one small location, the effects of that are far-reaching.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 And like you said, when things like the thyroid stimulating hormone is picked up again and is in circulation,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 even in relatively low amounts, none of it is actually good.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 It's pretty much an inflammatory marker in itself.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 And so the same thing with gut-related dysbiosis or, you know, whether it's a local trauma to one small area in the body,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 it all has a potential to seed the whole body with these signals, these markers, these shock proteins,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 these defensive cries for immune cells to come in and start unloading various chemicals

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 in a kind of defensive mechanism to try and restore or repair.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 But it's very important to get the concept of healthy eating and healthy living is not just, you know, one day and then not the next.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 You know, it's got to be a lifestyle change.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 And so what reaffirms everything that you're saying and have been saying for years and years now,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 and that we've been interviewing you for quite a few years, I sometimes catch myself thinking, well, you know what?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 A lot of it is thyroid and progesterone and all these other anti-inflammatories.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 But they are so key.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 They're so key to maintaining structural integrity, energetic resilience.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And these people that you've mentioned, Jamie Cunliffe, Matt Singer, and then Metchnikoff

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 and all the other, you know, kind of brilliant minded people that you've mentioned in the past all have this very holistic picture.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 And then we talk about holism as a very glib term and kind of think about, you know, I don't want to say what it is just in case it offends anybody because they do it.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 But the holistic approach is very much a way of life.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 And these things that you've mentioned, whether it's progesterone, whether it's thyroid, whether it's vitamin D,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 these are all things that we should have adequate quantities of, but our diets have been radically degraded over the years.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 Our environment, food in the water.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 Everything.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 So it's a constant.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Plastics.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 Our own bodies are a constant melee, you know, it's just a constant war going on to try and maintain homeostasis and energy.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 It doesn't always work.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And there are plenty of things that can be introduced into someone's lifestyle on a daily basis that will certainly mitigate these effects.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 It's 735.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And I just want to let people know that the phones are open.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 Local number is 923-2511, 923-3911, beg your pardon.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 And the 800 numbers 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 So we're taking calls until 8 o'clock.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I think I see the lights flashing.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 Yeah, Dr. Peat, I wanted to have you go over a little bit more since it seems to be over the intestinal tract and the effect we can have on that in reducing these inflammatory mediators that seem to be starting up the whole inflammation.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Well, before we do that, hold that thought, Sarah.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Let's take this caller because they've been waiting here.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 Where are you from?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 What's your question?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 Hi, what's your question?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 Hi, I listened to your July 2013 recording on your website, Western Botanical Medicine's radio archive page.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Okay.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 And, Dr. Peat, you mentioned that it's beneficial on that recording for women to have their monthly menstrual cycles throughout their entire life, which I was really surprised about.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 So I have two questions regarding that point.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 One, why is lifelong fertility beneficial for women?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 And two, what do women need to do to achieve that?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 One of the things about the cycle and degenerative diseases that people have noticed is that rheumatoid arthritis is frequently completely resolved during a pregnancy and then returns afterwards.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 And I think it's the huge production of progesterone that placenta takes over during pregnancy.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 And in both animals and humans, the number of pregnancies during a lifetime correlates very well with longevity.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 The more babies produced, the longer the mother lives and the better the health is.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 And that, if you look at the age of puberty, the mortality rate decreases from infancy when the organism is very dependent on conditions.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 As it grows and becomes more autonomous, at around the age of 12, the likelihood of dying is very, very low.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 Then from puberty on, there's a steady increase in the risk of dying from any cause.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 And I think that's the same estrogen risk factor that when the organism is detecting something in the environment that is threatening, it turns on the reproductive apparatus.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 And when that apparatus is working efficiently, it produces these huge amounts of progesterone that have a life-protecting, anti-inflammatory, life-extending effect.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 But if the estrogen isn't adequately compensated because of low thyroid or toxins, anything interfering with progesterone,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 then the estrogen cyclically produces damage to the organism and accelerates the aging process.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 So the reason that a cycle is valuable to maintain is that what shuts it off is the failure to produce enough progesterone.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 So even though the actual production of estrogen decreases somewhat at menopause,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 the effect of estrogen making the inflammatory factors that lead to degeneration,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 those become persistent in the absence of the cyclic production of progesterone.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 So it would be better if you could delay puberty to the age of 70 or 80,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 but in the absence of that ability, then having the regular early generous production of progesterone is what makes it valuable to keep cycling as long as you can.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 Wow, that's fascinating. Thank you so much and thank you for all your work, Dr. Peat.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Okay, thank you for your call, Carla.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Okay, so the number here if you're in the area is 9233911, the area code is 707.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 If you're on the web or you're outside, toll free number is 1800KMUDRAD, R-A-D.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 So we're taking calls until 8 o'clock.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 So Dr. Peat, getting back to rheumatoid arthritis and the manifestations,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 I came upon a fairly old, gosh, encyclopedia if you like, but it was quite an old text

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 and they mentioned quite a few different types of arthritis and some of which I didn't recognize,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 but obviously I think some of these older documents would list things that we've kind of tend to forget now.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 One was an arthritis from mumps and I don't even know if people know what mumps are anymore because I mean I had them when I was a child,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 but mumps are not that common these days.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 And then arthritis of leprosy, so there were infective arthritis, either gonococcal or tuberculosis arthritis.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 So these types of arthritis could also be bacterial in origin.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Now whether or not any of the compounds that I kind of made a note of here,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 whether they are herbal or isolated chemical compounds that have been used in the treatment of arthritis

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 are directly due to the antimicrobial effect and probably the antimicrobial effect in the gut is unknown,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 but berberis and berberine-containing herbs were certainly implicated in reducing bacterial load

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 and this antibacterial action I would think probably has a definitive action on endotoxin production and/or general gut health.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 So herbs like Oregon grape, barberry, bark, golden seal root, and you mentioned a couple Chinese herbs.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 Yeah.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 Have you had much experience with berberine and knowing its antimicrobial activity?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 No, none at all. I've eaten the Oregon grapes as jelly, but that's the extent of my experience with berberine.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 Okay. I know they mentioned coptis, which is a Chinese medicinal golden thread, I'm pretty sure it's called,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 and that's actually an adulterant of golden seal because it's a lot cheaper,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 but apparently it's a very bright yellow, very much like golden seal root,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 but it contains a pretty high concentration of berberine.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 That's definitely was indicated here for rheumatoid and I think from an antibacterial point of view.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 I thought I read in one of those articles that Dr. Peat sent the abstracts that berberine actually blocks nitric oxide.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 Yeah, that would be my first thought about how it's working,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 because infections of any sort are going to increase nitric oxide and impair oxidative energy production.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 Which goes back to what I was trying to say earlier about the intestines and eating foods that feed the bacteria

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 that then make the endotoxin that then poisons the system and creates that vicious circle of inflammation.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 The berberine containing herbs are very antibacterial and then they're also stopping that nitric oxide production

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 if they're antibacterial and stopping the bacteria.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 Okay, well we've got a couple of callers here, so let's take the first caller.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Hello?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 Yeah, you're on the air, where are you from and what's your question?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 I'm calling from a little farther north than you are.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 I had some questions about vitamin D.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Okay.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Why are the stores selling vitamin D3 and not vitamin D2?

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 I had a doctor prescribe me vitamin D2.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 And then what are the effects of vitamin D on weight gain and weight loss?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 And what are the issues having to do with toxicity, maybe taking too much vitamin D?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat, the difference between vitamin D3 and D2, you said you were prescribed D2?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 Yeah, the doctor told me he thought I was low and then I was tested and I was low

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 and he told me take 5,000 units of vitamin D3 a day.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 Oh, you said D3.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 And that's on the shelf.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 And then he prescribed me 50,000 units once a week of vitamin D2

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:41.000
 and then I know it seemed like six weeks or two months later I noticed a change in my hunger patterns.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 And the last couple times I went to the doctor I had lost weight.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 I haven't really checked on it since to see if things are happening like that,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 but it seems like my hunger has returned a little bit more back the way it was.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 But it occurred to me that I could see that vitamin D might--you know, you get more in the summer

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 and it might fit in with weight gains and weight losses that would be normal to people in northern and southern hemispheres.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 But when I go to the store, I'll see if you can just buy vitamin D on the shelf.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 It's not there. Vitamin D2 is not there.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 And I mean if it is going to help me lose weight, you know, I'd like to take lots of it.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 It's really nice not to be like starving hungry all the time.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 Sure. Dr. Peate, from an energetic point of view, how would you--would you describe the difference between D2 and D3?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 No, I don't know of any real evidence, but there were some publications around 1970

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 and arguing that D2 was contributing to atherosclerosis and calcification of blood vessels.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 And up until that time, milk had been reinforced with vitamin D2.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 And suddenly, every milk producer in the country around that time had just quietly shifted to D3.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:25.000
 And that was really just a few papers with superficial, largely opinions rather than facts.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 But it convinced most people to stop taking the risk of using the fungal form of vitamin D.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 Do you think there's an energetic--I'm sure there is a metabolic energetic improvement, of course,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
 then from D2 that might explain that--from D3 or D2 that would explain its weight loss?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Well, I think it's the parathyroid hormone which is suppressed by calcium and vitamin D.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Both types of vitamin D will keep the parathyroid hormone down.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 And so calcium and vitamin D both reduce inflammation in multiple ways.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 And the reduced inflammation goes with a more productive, efficient, higher rate of metabolism,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 keeping the weight gain down, stopping the production of fat from protein and sugar.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Okay.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 And from taking too much or monitoring your levels so you don't get too much,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
 you want to have a blood test every couple of months until you find a stable level.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 You don't really want it any higher than 75, and you don't really want it any lower than 50.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 So 50 to 75 is a good reference range to have for your vitamin D level, and you'd want to check it.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 You wouldn't want to just take a load of it because it can be harmful in high levels.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 Okay.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 Well, what I noticed was--and I'm not sure this is due to the vitamin D, but not much else has happened--

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 was that I would come in the house, say, after doing a lot of physical labor,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 and I could actually take a shower and take a rest, and I wouldn't have to eat, like, immediately.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 And that is very noticeable, not to be hungry like that all the time.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 That's probably helping your liver store sugar better.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 And then when I was going to the doctor, I kept losing weight.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 And I'm not sure what's causing that.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 But thanks a lot.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
 Yeah.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 Okay, you're welcome.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 There are really a lot of publications showing that a high calcium and vitamin D intake

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 will do almost everything good, including the avoidance of abdominal fat,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 tending to have a leaner body, and keeping especially inflammation down.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 And it's just important to note that, listeners, when you want to take vitamin D,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 if you change your dose or start taking it,

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 it takes eight weeks to get to a plateau level before you'd want a blood test.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 And you can do finger prick tests.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 They're available online.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Okay, so milk and vitamin D are very beneficial.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
 So we have another one or two callers.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
 Let's take the next caller on the air.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 You're on the air.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 And where are you from, caller?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 Hello.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 I'm from Arcata.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Arcata.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Okay, and what's your question?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 My question is I'm diabetic, and I read some research that said the little cells

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 that put out the insulin don't really die.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 Correct.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 They just sort of -- in your pancreas, they just become like juveniles again.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 Yeah.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 Pancreatic beta cells?

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 And I just wanted to know if it is possible to wake them up,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 if Dr. Peat has any advice about diabetes.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 I believe it's type 1.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:59.000
 So, Dr. Peat, senescent pancreatic beta cells.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 For type 1 diabetes.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 Yeah, the beta cells are always tending to regenerate,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 but they die quickly when you're having diabetes.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 And the factor that seems to be the main thing that kills them as they are being reborn

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 is lipid peroxidation.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 And so getting your polyunsaturated fats down, I think aspirin would be one of the protective things,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 but glucose happens to be the thing that maintains the renewal,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
 constant regeneration of the beta cells.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 So keeping the metabolism under control so that you aren't degenerating the polyunsaturated fats

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:04.000
 into lipid peroxides and prostaglandins is the thing to keep in mind.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 And this takes a long time.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
 It takes four years to replace your fat cells completely.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 Totally.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
 But you can make a big change right away.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 So replace your vegetable oils.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.000
 Yeah, I've tried using polyunsaturated fats based on your advice,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 and will continue to do so and appreciate the advice and your research.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
 Are you saying aspirin is helpful?

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
 You said that?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
 Yeah, aspirin improves insulin sensitivity.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
 Oh, it does?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Like the baby aspirin, 81 milligram dosage, would you recommend?

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Or like a regular big old aspirin?

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:51.000
 One thing to remember, if you're going to supplement any quantity of aspirin for a long time,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000
 is to make sure your vitamin K is adequate.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:07.000
 Taking a supplement of vitamin K is a good idea because chronic aspirin will tend to give you a bleeding syndrome

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 if you're deficient in K.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 So the dose is for one aspirin, 325 milligram aspirin, you'd want to be taking one milligram of vitamin K.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
 And it is on Amazon.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000
 The Thorne Research is a very pure form that's just in a medium chain triglyceride drop form.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 And one drop is one milligram.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000
 And that would counteract the bleeding tendency you could get from taking one aspirin.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 But Dr. Feig, how much would you recommend is a good kind of dose for helping to block that lipid peroxidation?

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
 Well, vitamin E and aspirin have overlapping effects.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:59.000
 And so the amount of PUFA that you have stored in your tissues is what governs the amount of those that you need.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 Okay, we've got two more callers I think, so let's get these next callers.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
 Thank you for your question, caller.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 And let's take the next one.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 Where are you from?

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
 What's your question?

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
 I'm from Ukiah.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 Okay, what's your question?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
 I have a question about T3.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 Does it affect TSH?

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
 Certainly does.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
 Dr. Peat?

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
 What was the question?

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 Does T3 affect TSH?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
 Oh, yeah, it does.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:35.000
 But since you normally have a much higher level of T4 circulating in the body,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:43.000
 the pituitary has the ability to convert T4 to T3 locally.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
 So usually T4 is what is suppressing the TSH.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:59.000
 But if you get enough T3 into your brain and pituitary, then it's at least as effective as T4.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 Okay, we've got two more callers.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
 Can I ask one more question?

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
 Reverse T3, what's the mechanism of action?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 How does that affect metabolism?

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:22.000
 Apparently it's partly occupying the same response site that the active T3 would

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 and simply competing against it.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 And even T4 can outcompete T3 if there's too much T4.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 But there are local deiodinase enzymes that some of them can eliminate reverse T3.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:56.000
 And if those are blocked by some stress substances, then the local reverse T3 can accumulate.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:05.000
 So the systemic level of T3 and reverse T3 are both important,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 but they aren't the absolute factor that determines how effective T3 will be.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.000
 That's why taking temperatures and pulses will tell you if you're getting enough T3

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 or if your body is converting the T4 that you might be taking or producing naturally into T3.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
 All right, thank you.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
 You're welcome.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
 Okay, we have two more callers.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000
 So let's see if we can get through these callers with quick answers that will satisfy the next caller.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
 Where are you from?

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 What's your question?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
 Is that me?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
 Yes, go ahead.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 Your question?

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 Hi.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 I have two quick questions.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000
 One, you mentioned about endotoxin and causing a problem in the bacteria.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 And I have been confused about whether probiotics are a good thing or a bad thing as far as that goes.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
 So that was one question.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
 And then the other question is about how much exercise is too much exercise.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 Right.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 Okay.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
 Well, I'll quickly speak with Dr. Peate for the exercise one.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 Any exercise that keeps you or makes you out of breath is not good for you.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 So gentle, moderate exercise, gentle weight-bearing exercise, definitely what you want.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
 Or if you do have those cardiac bursts, then don't let them last for too long

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 because what you will do is go into the anaerobic respiration.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
 And produce that.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 So if you're just walking and, you know, your heart rate is raised a little bit, you know,

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
 but you're breathing fine, I mean, you're not like huffing and puffing, is that okay?

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 That's ideal.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000
 You don't want to be over-breathing and you don't want to get your heart rate up too much.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
 So walking is gentle walking or just gentle weight-bearing exercise.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 So Dr. Peate, what do you say about probiotics in terms of the addition to the endotoxin load,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 pros and cons of probiotics?

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 Usually they're helpful but not always.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
 And it depends on the particular species.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 And the individual probably can judge best by how you feel when you take it.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
 Yeah, like some species will cause a lot of gas in people and I think that's harmful.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:20.000
 Yeah, some people really get worse when they take certain prebiotics or probiotics.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 So your particular reaction, I think, should determine that.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 Because everybody's a commensal bacteria and their intestines are different anyway,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 so you're introducing another one in the interactions.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
 Okay, we've got about two minutes left and we do have one more caller.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000
 So rather than not giving him a chance, let's just take this next call away from him.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 Hello.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 Yeah, I heard you say that having more babies would prolong your life.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 I didn't hear the whole answer because I was interrupted for a few minutes,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 but you were saying that the more babies you have, the longer you tend to live.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 Before there was birth control, women got worn out having too many babies.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000
 Well, there were women that had 12 and 13, 14 children,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 so they must have been doing pretty good to produce that.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 Anyways, the guy that built the Taj Mahal, his wife died having her 14th child.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000
 And, you know, I have a friend who got pregnant at 48 with her 7th child,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000
 and they told her she would not probably make it through the pregnancy.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 I mean, one lady I know had 10 children and almost died having a 10th.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
 Dr. Peate, do you have a comment on that?

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 There was a study in Hungary that looked at the whole population over a span of a lifetime,

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
 and they graphed the number of babies and the age at death of the mothers,

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:51.000
 and it was a very smooth, perfectly straight increase in longevity

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 with the number of babies up to eight.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
 When was this?

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000
 Up to eight babies.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000
 Did you hear that, Carla?

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
 Yeah, I heard she said eight.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 That's not 13 or 14.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
 When was this study done in Hungary?

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 Dr. Peate, did you hear it?

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 The caller is asking when was the study done in Hungary.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
 Oh, I read it in the 1970s.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 I think it was probably done around 1968 or '69.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Okay, we better hold it there, folks.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Thanks for your call.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 As always, Dr. Peate, thanks for being so giving of your time and your energy and your knowledge.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 Thank you so much.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
 I'll just give people your details.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 Okay.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
 Thank you.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 Good night.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 Okay, so for those people who've heard the show tonight and maybe not heard Dr. Peate explain

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 his scientific rationale of approaching things that we often find bad evidence for,

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.000
 his website is www.rayPeate.com, fully referenced articles, well worth a look.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
 Go check it out.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
 He doesn't charge any money for them.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 They're all free.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.000
 We can be reached toll free 1-888-WBMO Monday through Friday.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 Thanks for listening and have a good night.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Until next November.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 See you then.
