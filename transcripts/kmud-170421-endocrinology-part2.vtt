00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Ob Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.400
 My name is Sarah Johannison Murray.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.800
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.800
 they run from 7 to 8 p.m., third Friday of every month,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.400
 and from 7.30 to 8 p.m. we invite callers to call in with any questions related or unrelated to the subject,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.200
 and do encourage people to try and stay on topic wherever possible,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200
 although I know people have questions that they've probably been longing to ask,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
 and we get them also.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.800
 So anyway, it's all good. It is an open discussion from 7.30 on,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 so I wanted to give the outline of this evening's show, which will be a continuation of endocrinology, so part two.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600
 Last month, as always, we are joined by Dr. Ray Peat,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.200
 and last month Dr. Peat was discussing some of the Parkinsonisms,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.200
 and some of the symptoms and causality.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.600
 A lot of what we read, and it's part of this evening's show too, in terms of the intro to it,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 is subject to bad science, or no science at all, or just downright lies.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.000
 So I'll get going by introducing the intro for the show,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.600
 and then we'll get Dr. Peat to join us and see where the show goes.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.600
 It's a big old subject. I think when I first started thinking about doing endocrinology as a subject,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 what I don't want is for people to get too bored, because I know some of it's pretty dry.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 But we'll try and keep it lively, but wanted to give you an overview of endocrinology

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.600
 and the organs that secrete the hormones and the target organs that are either stimulated or inhibited by them,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.200
 just to bring out Dr. Peat's understanding of hormone physiology that is after all his specialty,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.800
 and for which he has the last 35-40 years been working, studying through his PhD,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.000
 and through his working life putting into practice.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 I think it's more like 45 years now.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Okay, it's probably 45. We've been doing this show for 10 years nearly.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.600
 So we've been doing this show actually for 13, but getting on close to 10 with Dr. Peat.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.800
 So in a search for truth, there seems an endless variety of rabbit holes that one can travel through

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 in so many disciplines and probably none more so evident as riddled in medicine.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.600
 Sometimes ignorance plays a part, sometimes it's plain corruption,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 other times it's sheer malevolence and eugenics based, and science's greatest ally is verifiable observation.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.400
 And hard facts speak volumes to the truth.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.000
 How we perceive the world influences our very being in the world,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.800
 and our understanding shapes our response and interaction with our environment.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.000
 Two ends of the spectrum being the example of learned helplessness and its counterpart,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.400
 environmental enrichment, both of which have been discussed on previous shows of Dr. Peat.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.800
 All of these shows, incidentally, for people listening perhaps for the first one or two times,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:19.000
 they're all accessible as an audio archive either from kmud.org, looking at the audio archives,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.800
 look for Friday Night Talk and the third Friday of every month.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.200
 They do unfortunately only keep six months of the archives.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.400
 But we have got every show that we've done from 2009, 2008, yeah, there's a couple in 2008,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.600
 from 2008 right up until January of 2016, and I'm busy putting the rest of 2016's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:53.800
 and this three months of this year on up on our website, which is www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.400
 So those archives there are freely downloadable and a great resource for people to want to find out more about Dr. Peat's work.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.800
 So anyway, how we understand physiology, it shapes our approach to aberrations within it,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.400
 and the outcome is modulated by this faithful scientific approach through verifiable observation.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400
 On the one hand, and the holistic realization that the web of life is indeed fluid

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.800
 and open to events so strange at this point in our evolution,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:28.200
 from transcendental meditation as a healing modality through to the latest theories of quark entanglement and quantum physics.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.400
 And nowhere else does this multiverse exist within our very being as living organisms than the nervous system,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.000
 and particularly the endocrine system, which begs the question,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.200
 what do we know, how have we arrived at this knowledge, and how accurate is it?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.800
 After all, hard facts are a good start.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 And Dr. Peat has been a long-time guest on this show, and I'm constantly reminded things are not the way I thought they were.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.000
 That is, I was taught an incomplete account of what was understood then from the scientific perspective,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 because often it was not scientific, but a bogus interference of the truth,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.800
 a truth which has been elucidated somewhat, but buried in the past,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.600
 fast moving into the new paradigm of medicine's cause and effect,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.800
 a drug for a deficiency approach, as it were, a lock and key, fallibility.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.400
 So to understand the interplay of glands, their hormone secretions,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.400
 and distant targets affected by the secretion takes a scientific approach

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.800
 which understands the fluidity of the organism and a questioning of the current paradigm

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.200
 to see a new way through the rabbit hole.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.000
 So what is a hormone, or what model of the organism is implied?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.400
 Do you need a head in order to run the body?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.800
 This is not an actual question, as a head houses a brain to which all is connected and answers to,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.800
 but a rhetorical question to understanding what it is we are seeking.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.600
 So I had this conversation with Dr. Peat this afternoon, and wanted to ask you, Dr. Peat, first of all,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.400
 the question then, what is a hormone? Because I know you've got a very different outlook on it.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:06.800
 That was a question I brought up with my endocrinology students at the Naturopathic College in the 1970s.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:19.200
 And against the background of classical endocrinology, it has a different meaning

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:27.000
 than when you look at it against contemporary theory of what they're teaching medical students.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.600
 So my students were sort of confused by the way I presented the question.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:46.000
 But if you look at the standard definition, a hormone is something secreted by cells somewhere in the body

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:55.800
 into the body fluids, and moves in those fluids and acts on cells somewhere else in the body.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:06.600
 If that's the working definition of a hormone, then can't you say that lactic acid and carbon dioxide

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:17.400
 are just as much hormones as anything else, because they're created by various cells and move in the body fluids

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.400
 and definitely act on cells in other parts of the body.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:34.600
 But what has developed over the last 30, 40, 50 years incorporates the idea of genes

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.200
 as the really controlling agent of any cell.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:47.400
 And so if a substance is going to act on a cell in a different part of the body,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.600
 it must be somehow activating on its genes.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:59.200
 And so the idea of a receptor is something that picks up something from a cell's environment

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.400
 to activate the genes within that cell.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.800
 That has come to the center of the textbook type of medical endocrinology.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:21.000
 But the way I see the subject really is an extension of the very beginnings around the middle of the 19th century.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Charles Edward Brown Seckard, for example, he took over as a professor following the glycogen researcher

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 whose name I can't get right now, but he was a major physiology figure throughout France and pretty much around the world.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:05.200
 He became famous when he, in his old age, claimed that squashing testicles in a watery solution

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.200
 and injecting the solution would rejuvenate a man's virility.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:19.200
 He described the changes that he saw in himself and it took off around the world.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:28.200
 But for various reasons in the 20th century, almost every textbook of endocrinology

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.200
 and every course of endocrinology starts out by ridiculing that as a complete mistake,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.200
 that it was nothing but a placebo because they say testosterone isn't water soluble.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:47.200
 But he wasn't saying that he was injecting testosterone.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.200
 He was making a squash solution of testicles.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:10:05.200
 And the testicle is full of hormones, many of which are fairly insoluble in water,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:14.200
 but it's also full of lipids which solubilize and emulsify any of the more or less insoluble.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:21.200
 Hasn't that been a part of ancient medicine, the ingestion of ovaries and testicles?

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.200
 Yes, you can eat them and get the same hormones out of them.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:34.200
 But if you do squash them and make a watery extract, you're getting emulsified a whole range of,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:41.200
 not just testosterone, but many other steroids closely related to testosterone.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:54.200
 So it's a very ideological thing that these textbooks and professors have to put down Brown and Thacker before they can get on with their business.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:11:02.200
 So they wanted to put him down for this theory and discard it as a rational thought and then...

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:12.200
 He was saying that the gland itself is producing substances that are vitally important

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:21.200
 and that can simply bypass many medical problems and reverse degenerative processes.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:33.200
 So it's really a subject that's right at the leading edge of research now, how to stop the degenerative processes.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:43.200
 For example, in Parkinson's disease, simply giving testosterone has a very powerful therapeutic effect.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 But it's outside of the main line of thinking with the dopamine deficiency as the core of theorizing.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:05.200
 But when you start working from the classical observations of people like Brown-Thacker

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:17.200
 and look at the reasons that the whole field changed, I think it happened around the time of August Weissmann,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:27.200
 who is famous for supposedly disproving Lamarckism, cutting off the tails of over 1,300 mice

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 and saying the offspring still had tails.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:42.200
 He was pretty much an idiot, but his idea was that an animal differentiating the various types of tissue

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:52.200
 from an ovum, fertilized ovum, involved the progressive loss of genetic information from each tissue

00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:02.200
 as it became specialized, sort of analogous to the idea that was popular in brain research

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:12.200
 that memory is formed by the destruction of neurons, a negative way of looking at what an organism is.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:21.200
 He believed that the brain and the skin and the eyes and such, each one had its own genetic composition.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:28.200
 The egg had them all, but each of the adult tissues had only a fraction of them.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:37.200
 And so for the whole organism to work, to function as a unit,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.200
 these genetically discrete parts had to have some way to communicate.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:57.200
 And so that theory, that ideology, which related to a whole political, biological, medical...

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200
 Yeah, construct, huh?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.200
 Yeah, a culture.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:15.200
 It was designed for religious, political purposes to explain that an organism is basically mortal,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.200
 that there's nothing more that you can do.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:26.200
 You can't cure the incurable diseases and so on because they're predetermined.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:42.200
 And that genetic idea took over and totally displaced and attacked the potential-filled way of looking at biology of people like Brown-Seckard.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.200
 Interesting. Brown-Seckard, okay.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200
 Brown and his last name?

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.200
 Hyphenated Brown-Seckard, S-E-Q-U-A-R-D.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.200
 Q-A-R-D. I always spell it differently than I was expecting.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 Anyway, getting back to what you mentioned about the structural organization,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 the way that you would look at it and the way that I think I can see it being logical

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:16.200
 is that the brain's structural organization of neurons leads to a better genetic pattern or blueprint

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.200
 in terms of, it's like an enrichment.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:25.200
 It's not the same thing, of course, I'm sure, but it's like an environmental enrichment scenario

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.200
 where if the structure of the brain is being organized in a confluent way,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:38.200
 then the neurons make better connections and therefore that can improve the outcome in terms of...

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:47.200
 Yeah, each cell and each part of a cell is adapting and adjusting itself to the other parts.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.200
 And it doesn't have anything to do with that model,

00:15:51.200 --> 00:16:02.200
 but you have to send a signal from a cell that has one group of genes to other cells that have other groups of genes

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:08.200
 by way of receptors and so on.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:20.200
 The implication, when you look at the fact that a skin cell contains all the genes needed to make a brain cell and so on,

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:29.200
 the idea of cloning an organism from a single cell means that every cell is full of potential.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.200
 So it's just the environment that it's exposed to that determines its...

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:43.200
 And the way the organism comes into being is by each cell confronting its environment.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 And when it divides, the new cell becomes part of its environment.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:55.200
 So each time cells divide, they experience themselves in a new environment,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.200
 which at the beginning includes the uterine fluids and so on.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:17.200
 And so the whole development of the organism is a process of perceiving its environment and adapting to what it perceives.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:33.200
 So the perceived world for any cell is always complex and always includes every byproduct of all of its other cells.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:45.200
 So the things such as carbon dioxide and glucose are very central to the function, development,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:55.200
 and possibilities of each cell and of the whole.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:11.200
 So hormones, as we currently talk about them, are just one of thousands of components of substances produced by cells and acting on other cells.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:23.200
 One of the meanings of this is that we're all in slightly imperfect environments.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:31.200
 Our history is continuously a matter of overcoming environmental limitations.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:47.200
 And that process is going on in the uterus as we develop and determining how the parts relate to each other.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:53.200
 That brings me back to a... I don't mean to cut you short, but that brings me back to the point of in utero nutrition

00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:01.200
 and how pivotal that is in terms of what the mother is exposing the fetus to, in terms of the outcome of the fetus,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:11.200
 and the growth and longevity and potential and possibility and all the rest of it that can be affected at a cellular level just from maternal nutrition.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:25.200
 Yeah, the ratio of the person's brain to body and their longevity, life expectancy, and the amount of energy they have at any stage of life.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:31.200
 This is pretty much set by the intrauterine condition.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.200
 Let me hold you again there Dr. Peat. Unexpectedly we have a caller who's called in early.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.200
 So let's go and take this caller and see where it's coming from and then we'll carry on with the show.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:47.200
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? Australia. Australia. Cool. All right.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.200
 Well, it's always good to get people from all over the world. We don't want them just from Humboldt County or the West Coast.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.200
 We appreciate callers from everywhere. We do, of course. Especially our local ones.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.200
 Yeah. What's your question, caller? I have a question for Dr. Peat.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:10.200
 It's a bit off topic. I'm hypothyroid. I have Hashimoto's. I've been obviously fighting it for many years.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:18.200
 My pulse in the morning is around 56 and at night it's around 75. I've got low temperatures in the morning as well.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:25.200
 So all of those are using Dr. Peat's information points to inactive thyroid.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:32.200
 Obviously I'm in the subtropics. We've just had long, hot summer sweating for six months.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:43.200
 And the sun is too intense to get out into. It's really too hot to sit too long.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.200
 So sometimes I'll put my legs in it. Are you getting enough vitamin D with just a small exposure?

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:55.200
 And how does that work? My main question is, I haven't had PUFA for about five years.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:07.200
 And with having -- with trying to increase sugar and having milk and orange juice and reducing cruciferous vegetables and things like that,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.200
 I've ended up being 30 kilos overweight.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:18.200
 And I'm really desperate to try and find a way to lose that weight without having to go on a starvation routine.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:24.200
 Any ideas? And I take pretty much primarily only T3.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:31.200
 Okay. All right. Well, Dr. Peat, we could go for this, but I know you could -- and I'm sure the lady would like to hear from you.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:39.200
 So in terms of, I guess, three questions here, one was a vitamin D exposure in terms of what kind of area or surface of skin would have to be exposed

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.200
 given that it's such an intense heat.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:48.200
 But I would also suspect that using a vitamin D liquid supplement would be -- would get around that.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.200
 But -- so there was a question about the skin and vitamin D absorption, how much --

00:21:52.200 --> 00:22:00.200
 Well, you could test your vitamin D with a blood test and then you'd know where you're at and then supplement accordingly with sun and/or supplement.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.200
 And then the weight gain, how old are you, out of interest?

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200
 50.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:07.200
 50. Okay. And how much did you say you'd gained?

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.200
 30 kilos.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.200
 30 kilos. Wow.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200
 In five years.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.200
 66 pounds. Wow.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:20.200
 Okay. So, Dr. Peat, potentially in terms of sluggish thyroid, that could be some of the reason for it.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:29.200
 Otherwise, in terms of increasing metabolic rate to help this person lose weight and the fact that they're only using T3

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.200
 and not a supplement of T3, T4, or T4.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.200
 The important thing is to keep your body temperature up.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:48.200
 It should be in the range of 98 to 99 and a half or so during the daytime, around 37 Celsius.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:58.200
 A little higher is fine because it promotes the healthy oxidation of the fat.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:11.200
 But keeping your liver well nourished with protein and B vitamins especially, the liver is able to throw off the polyunsaturated fats,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.200
 recognizing them as toxic material that it would be better not to oxidize.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:26.200
 So your liver can get rid of quite a bit of stored fat largely during the night.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.200
 Your free fatty acids tend to increase during the night.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:38.200
 In the morning, that shows up as foamy urine, a soapy effect from the free fatty acids.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:55.200
 Keeping your body temperature up fairly well during the night by a good amount of protein, calcium, and all of the trace nutrients in your diet.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:05.200
 And if necessary, supplementing T3, progesterone, and either pregnenolone or DHEA.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:13.200
 DHEA is anabolic for the muscles, but it activates heat production.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.200
 It causes you to waste heat, so to speak.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:25.200
 It isn't really wasted because it's keeping your nerve function up and your inflammation down.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:33.200
 So making sure that you're not deficient in progesterone and DHEA is important.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.200
 So how's that, Carla?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.200
 Well, I do a lot of those things.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:47.200
 Most of the time in Brisbane here, it's 30.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.200
 We've just come from months of over 30 degrees every day.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.200
 So I'm sweating all of the time, but how do you keep your temperature up?

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.200
 How do you make your body increase its temperature?

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.200
 How many grams of protein do you think you're getting a day?

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.200
 I have about two liters of milk and a liter of orange juice.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:11.200
 Right, so that's a quart of orange juice.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 And maybe a bit of lamb or steak or something, if you like it, but not always.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:23.200
 A hundred grams of protein, if you're at all active, just moving around normally,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.200
 you pretty much need a hundred grams of protein to keep your metabolic rate up.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:34.200
 And the calcium in two liters of milk is probably enough.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.200
 Calcium promotes heat production.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:45.200
 And getting a normal amount of sodium and magnesium in your diet is important.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.200
 Sodium works with the calcium to produce heat.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:26:01.200
 And progesterone helps to set your temperature so that your body temperature stays up during the day towards 37 degrees,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.200
 but not dropping extremely during the night.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.200
 It's okay to cool down maybe as much as one degree Fahrenheit during the night,

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:19.200
 but it shouldn't go much below 97.7 or 98.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:29.200
 I want to just discuss the calories because with two liters of milk, that's anywhere from 800 to 1,200 calories there.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:39.200
 You do have 400 calories in 400 to 600, depending on what, well, I guess a liter, so that's a little bit more than a quart.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:47.200
 And depending on what your metabolic rate is, if you're not getting, if your morning pulse is in the 50s,

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.200
 and you're never getting above 75, your metabolic rate probably isn't even burning that amount of calories,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.200
 plus anything else you might eat during the day besides two liters of milk and a quart of orange juice.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.200
 I mean, don't you think for a 50-year-old woman this might be an issue, Dr. Peat?

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:10.200
 Yeah, that's where the DHEA comes in and adjusting your T3 or thyroid.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:20.200
 And the progesterone setting your temperature is important.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.200
 Estrogen tends to lower your temperature,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:30.200
 so you want to keep the ratio of progesterone to estrogen pretty high, 100 to 1 is good.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:38.200
 Out of curiosity, I think I heard you correctly say that you've been poo-free for five years?

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.200
 Yeah.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.200
 And have you gained these 30 kilos over those five years, is that what you're saying?

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.200
 Pretty much.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.200
 Okay. Do you take your temperature in pulses?

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:53.200
 I mean, do you know pretty reliably what your temperature is?

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.200
 Pretty reliably, yeah.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:00.200
 It used to be around 63, and it's recently gone lower down to 56, 50.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.200
 How about your temperature? What are your morning temperatures?

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:11.200
 My temperature is around 35.8, 36 in the morning, and it does raise.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.200
 And I do feel heat sometimes after I eat certain things,

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:20.200
 but I think I'm just taking--in order to put the amount of protein in for my liver to work,

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.200
 I'm gaining weight at a rapid rate.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:28.200
 And just with the progesterone, I take a squeeze of progesterone pretty much every night when I wake up.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.200
 In the middle of the night, I have a squeeze of that and go back to bed.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.200
 And how much T3 are you using?

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.200
 I take about between 20 and 40 micrograms a day.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.200
 20 to 40, okay.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:48.200
 One of the things that can cause you to produce nitric oxide,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.200
 which lowers your temperature working with estrogen,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.200
 reversing the effects of thyroid, progesterone, and DHEA,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:08.200
 is intestinal inflammation produced by bacteria eating some kind of food that isn't fully digested.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:18.200
 Avoiding anything that's hard to digest, such as maybe potatoes or undercooked vegetables,

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:29.200
 can reduce the nitric oxide, reduce the estrogen, and help you to raise your temperature.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:36.200
 Sometimes just having a raw carrot every day or a good portion of cooked mushrooms

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.200
 can reduce the endotoxin and nitric oxide production enough

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:48.200
 to switch your progesterone-estrogen ratio in a favorable direction

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.200
 and raise your temperature over a period of just a few days.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.200
 Did you have any history as a menstruating female of estrogen dominance? Do you know?

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.200
 Yes, absolutely.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200
 You did?

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.200
 Yes, I went through menopause at 43.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.200
 Prior to that, my estrogen level was about 1,000 times what it was supposed to be.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.200
 Right.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:20.200
 Have you ever noticed an antibiotic having a good effect?

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.200
 Yes.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:29.200
 Yes, but of course I'm afraid to take the antibiotic for the yeast overgrowth and things like that.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:36.200
 For yeast overgrowth, the mushrooms and carrot sometimes is enough,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:45.200
 but flowers of sulfur, just a pinch of it will clear up a yeast infection pretty quickly usually.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.200
 Is that just once?

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:55.200
 Just two or three days will usually eliminate a yeast infection.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.200
 In a fertility clinic about 30 years ago,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.200
 they were giving antibiotics to see if it improved fertility, which it did,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:11.200
 but a lot of the women noticed they were having drastic improvements in their general health,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.200
 stopping migraines and other estrogen-related symptoms.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:23.200
 It turned out that the antibiotics were very quickly lowering the stress hormones

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.200
 and estrogen and raising progesterone,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.200
 and that's been done on animals as well as people.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:44.200
 It is apparently eliminating the endotoxin to the extent that it stops producing nitric oxide

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:50.200
 and lets your cells begin oxidizing intensely.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.200
 Okay.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.200
 But really, I think if I compared your body to my body, Collar, I'm 39,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.200
 and in order to lose a pound a week, I had to eat 1,500 calories a day,

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:08.200
 and I'm active riding my bike and walking and still menstruating, obviously, at 39.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.200
 But as you get older, your metabolism slows,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:18.200
 and so what I found helpful for some clients is that you use eggshell powder

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.200
 so you don't have to drink that same quantity of milk,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:27.200
 although, like Dr. Peat said, you can live for several months with no nutritional deficiencies

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.200
 on two quarts of milk or two liters of milk and a liter of orange juice.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.200
 So it depends where you want to get it,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.200
 but basically I don't know how someone at the age of 50 who hasn't been menstruating since 43

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:46.200
 is going to lose weight very fast on just the two liters of milk and the liter of orange juice,

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200
 and maybe some other food.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.200
 Well, the other thing is that pulses definitely seem very low in terms of the mid-50s.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.200
 I would probably call that a sub-metabolic rate for pulse.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.200
 I know Dr. Peat, he always recommends from a healthy perspective that your pulse is around about 75,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.200
 between 75 and 85 is actually pretty good,

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:11.200
 as a good indicator of metabolic rate for somebody who's actively burning glucose oxidatively

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:18.200
 and his thyroid is working properly in order to typically generate the heat that we would expect to reach 98.6

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.200
 on a kind of daily, midday from there on and/or above basis every day.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.200
 Well, yeah, and if you're not even reaching those normal temperatures,

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.200
 then your metabolism is even slower than normal,

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:36.200
 because with my metabolism of 1,500 calories a day and one pound weight loss a week after my pregnancies,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:45.200
 my pulse was up to 90, 92, and my temperature was up to 98.6, 99 after 8.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:52.200
 Sometimes a little bit of coconut oil can increase your heat production.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.200
 Yep, I use coconut oil for cooking.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:03.200
 But it sounds like that it's pointing to endotoxin in the gut.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.200
 Well, that and the suboptimal metabolic rate,

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:14.200
 you don't sound metabolic from a thyroid temperature and pulse perspective,

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.200
 regardless of using 20 or 40 micrograms of T3.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.200
 I know that's a fair amount of thyroid really, but it's very different from person to person.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.200
 I've known quite a few people who use significantly more than that are still not getting rapid pulse.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:32.200
 They're still round about the temperature they want to be,

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.200
 but especially in people -- and here's the other thing, and Dr. Peel can come with this --

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.200
 people that are overweight definitely have more of an uphill struggle using thyroid

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.200
 in order to generate metabolic rate to help shed weight,

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:54.200
 because the very weight itself makes it kind of resistant for thyroid hormone to be absorbed by the cells.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:35:04.200
 And keeping your serum vitamin D around the middle of the range, 50 to 55 or 60 nanograms per milliliter,

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:10.200
 middle of the range, is helpful for keeping your temperature metabolic rate up.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:16.200
 And the carrots will also help absorb the fat in the food too.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.200
 Can you have the carrot at the same time as other food?

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.200
 I thought that sort of stopped the digestion or slowed down the digestion of other things.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:29.200
 It slows it down, but it's helpful for losing weight because it binds some of the fat you've eaten

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200
 and carries it out of your body too.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:40.200
 And some of the material that your liver is excreting in the bile is carried out,

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.200
 especially estrogen, which is excreted in the bile.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:49.200
 It'll be reabsorbed if you don't have a constant flow of material,

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.200
 such as carrots or mushrooms through your intestine.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.200
 Okay.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:03.200
 I think the other perspective, just to wrap this up, in terms of liver support,

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:08.200
 I think that would be a pretty good direction to be going in making sure that you've got,

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.200
 obviously you're getting enough sugars in terms of glycogen storage from the fructose.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:20.200
 But I'm thinking about liver stimulants, liver bitters, or even things like milk thistle

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.200
 that would support hepatic function.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:29.200
 That hepatic function in its own right would go to remove waste.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:35.200
 And given that you have an estrogen dominance picture in your life,

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.200
 that the estrogen itself would be totally responsible for increased water gain

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.200
 and weight gain through that estrogenizing effect.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.200
 And what Dr. Peat is talking about with the ratio of progesterone to estrogen,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.200
 it would be quite useful to get your estradiol and your progesterone tested

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.200
 so you see what your ratio is because--

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.200
 Although in menopausal women, didn't you say, Dr. Peat,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.200
 that it can just be mostly stored in the cells and not in the blood?

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:06.200
 Oh, if you're using progesterone, that will bring the--

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:13.200
 It knocks out the estrogen-binding protein, liberating the estrogen into the bloodstream.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.200
 Okay. So it would be--

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.200
 Yeah, you can measure it.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.200
 If you're using progesterone, the measurement is meaningful.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.200
 Okay. That's what I meant to say. It would be a meaningful measurement then.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:32.200
 So that would also be another useful piece of data to corroborate.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:39.200
 Either a continual estrogen dominance that is predisposing you to water weight gain

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:45.200
 and that raising your progesterone to estradiol ratio would help that.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.200
 You definitely would need to get your temperature and pulses up beyond where you're currently at.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.200
 And that would probably mean increasing slowly your dose of T3 in order to achieve that

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.200
 and taking note of your temperature and pulses.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.200
 And then liver stimulants, even things like milthistle to be liver supportive

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:09.200
 and also help excretion of waste products in terms of the fiber from raw carrot in the bowel

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.200
 would also help to reduce excess estrogen that way.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.200
 That would lower your overall toxic burden.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.200
 And like Dr. Peat was saying, the mushrooms because they're a good fiber

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.200
 and then they're also anti-estrogen.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.200
 And bread-button mushrooms.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.200
 Yeah.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.200
 Just make sure they're really well cooked.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:36.200
 And two drugs that help the liver maintain its high activity are cascara sagrada, which--

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.200
 Yeah, I take that.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:44.200
 It's anti-inflammatory and sort of a liver tonic and aspirin.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.200
 Yep.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.200
 Excellent.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:53.200
 I will thank you very, very much and I will put your advice into work.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.200
 So it's detrimental to actually reduce my caloric intake.

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200
 Is that right?

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200
 No.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200
 Well, not too low.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.200
 Yeah, you wouldn't want to get--you want to keep your protein up as 75 to 100 grams

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.200
 like Dr. Peat mentioned and your sugars.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.200
 I think I was getting one pound a week weight loss.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.200
 I think I was getting 150 grams of non-starchy carbohydrates from juice and milk.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:22.200
 So you don't want to go too low on the sugars because then you'll run on stress hormones.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:27.200
 So really in order to lose weight, you just have to really calorie count but make sure

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.200
 you're getting the right nutrients--getting the calories from the right nutrients like

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.200
 proteins and sugars rather than from very calorific sources like fat because you can

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.200
 make your own fat from the good sugars.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:45.200
 And doing a little muscle building exercise such as a dumbbell lift just two or three

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.200
 minutes at a time helps to shift the hormone ratio.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200
 How much did you say?

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.200
 Sorry, the phone cut out.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:00.200
 He said some gentle weight-bearing exercises with dumbbells because that will stimulate

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.200
 muscle production and muscles are very effective means for burning sugars and burning calories.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.200
 Okay.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200
 All right.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.200
 Thank you so much.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.200
 Yeah, thank you for your call, Carla.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.200
 If you ever need to get in contact with us, you can email me, Andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200
 Okay, let's take this next caller.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.200
 See where you're from, Carla.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.200
 Hi, Carla.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.200
 You're on the air.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.200
 Where are you from?

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.200
 What's your question?

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.200
 I'm from Garboville.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.200
 My question is about poison oak.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:34.200
 I got my first case ever and I wanted to know what kind of botanical aid I could get.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:39.200
 Well, we produce a product called Allergy Ease and it's sold at Chautauqua and it's

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.200
 a whole bunch of different antihistamine herbs.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.200
 Allergy Ease.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.200
 Allergy Ease and I've had lots of good reports from people.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:54.200
 They start that as soon as they start itching before it gets too out of hand, before the

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.200
 histamine gets too out of control.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:04.200
 Otherwise, a clean diphenhydramine product or Benadryl if the herbs are not effective

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.200
 enough.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.200
 Yeah, I did that right away and that did help a little, but as a first timer, I just kept

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.200
 coming back.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.200
 Are you breaking out and kind of weeping?

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200
 No, not that badly.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200
 Not that badly, but swelling.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.200
 You know, it corners one side of my mouth.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.200
 It might not be too late.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.200
 It all depends.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200
 It's a rash.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200
 It all depends how far along you are.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.200
 If you can get it early enough, the Allergy Ease could be quite useful.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.200
 Yeah, you want to try to get on it as soon as possible because you don't want to end

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.200
 up having to take cortisol or something like that.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.200
 But keeping your sugars up, your good sugars, your fructose, fruit sugars and honey and

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200
 sugars.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200
 I'm so good.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.200
 I'm glad I'm doing that because I'm really craving them in the evening.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.200
 Well, yeah, it will help to keep histamine from being released.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.200
 I have one other question.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:01.200
 It turned out I had my first ever wart on the bottom of my foot.

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.200
 I was wondering, I think it's a plantar wart.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:11.200
 It's not huge, but I was wondering what besides these band-aids with salicylic acid on them

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.200
 can you recommend or just nutritionally how to fight it?

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.200
 I'll give you a botanical perspective of a plant that's actually excellent for the treatment

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.200
 of warts.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.200
 And that's Caledonia magus, the greater selendine.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.200
 And right now, spring is a good time to find it because it's actually growing right now.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.200
 And it hasn't flowered yet, which is ideally when you should pick it.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.200
 You'll know greater selendine from its yellow flowers and it's in the poppy family.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.200
 And when you break the stem of it, it exudes a yellow latex.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.200
 It's actually not a latex, but it's an exudate.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.200
 It's a bit like a latex, but it's bright orange-yellow.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:54.200
 And if you dab that all over the plantar wart and you do that for probably a week, you'll

00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:00.200
 find that the wart will just go black, the skin will start to peel off, and you'll effectively

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.200
 have gotten rid of it.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.200
 That sounds wonderful.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.200
 It's a woodland plant, so you need to--

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.200
 Yeah, but it's not native here.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.200
 It is in England.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.200
 Well, yeah, we have it.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.200
 Where can you find it around here?

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.200
 Because I do live in the woods.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.200
 Well, it's not native around here.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.200
 And the other thing that is what you could find is dandelion sap.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:26.200
 It's not as effective as the greater selendine, but it can also help with warts.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:31.200
 And you just pick the stem of the dandelion, of the leaf or the flower, and a white exudate

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.200
 comes out and you dab that on the wart.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.200
 So you could try that if you have dandelions.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:40.200
 Yeah, I'm sure I have those, but I'd really love to get the greater selendine.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.200
 If you know anybody who can find it around here.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.200
 Well, I'm sure people are growing it in their garden.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.200
 It's a weed, essentially.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.200
 It's a kind of woodland weed.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.200
 It's become a weed in our garden, but it's not really a weed in Northern California here.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.200
 But, Dr. Peat, what do you recommend for warts?

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.200
 That sounds as good as anything I know.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200
 Okay.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.200
 All right, go on.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:05.200
 And salicylic acid, that's a pretty safe treatment as well.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.200
 I think it's good.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.200
 What about formic acid?

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.200
 I think salicylic is best.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.200
 Okay.

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.200
 Thank you very much.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.200
 You're welcome.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.200
 I'll try to find the selendine.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.200
 Thank you.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.200
 Thank you for your call.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.200
 Okay, well, Dr. Peat, gosh, it's 10 to 8 and we haven't done anything.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.200
 I haven't even given the number out.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.200
 I guess we'll just take the next 10 minutes as they come and let me just tell people what

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.200
 the call-in number is, if they'd like to call.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.200
 Local number, 707 area code, 923-3911.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:44.200
 Or if you're outside the area or in Brisbane, Australia, it's 1-800-568-3723.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.200
 So we'd love to hear you.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:52.200
 Well, from Australia or any other international, they'll have to dial 707-923-3911 because

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.200
 800 numbers don't work outside of the country.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:55.200
 That's correct.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.200
 But, Dr. Peat, getting back to what you were saying about the environment on the developing

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.200
 fetus, and then, doesn't that -- haven't there been studies to show, like, babies that are

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:08.200
 left to cry themselves to sleep raises the cortisol in the brain and that affects the

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.200
 structure and function of the brain cells?

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.200
 Yeah.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:17.200
 Everything is a stress to different extents.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:21.200
 And you want to minimize all of the stresses.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:32.200
 And I think the earlier you begin prenatally or in newborns, minimizing the stress is going

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.200
 to maximize the life potential.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:41.200
 So crying is a sign of stress.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:45.200
 And so finding out what the cause is is important.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.200
 Okay.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:56.200
 Well, getting back to the topic of this month's show, in terms of the endocrine system, I

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:01.200
 was going to go next to the hypothalamus as being the next structure to open up and look

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.200
 into.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:10.200
 And I think really what I wanted to try and generate in people is an amazing fascination

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:17.200
 of something so complex and so intricate and such a miracle that is still very hard to

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:25.200
 grasp even when you read hardcore scientific texts elucidating every known fact, as it

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.200
 were, in terms of the quest for knowing all about it.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:36.200
 And the hypothalamus is just one of those organs that is classed as an endocrine organ.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:42.200
 So I think I probably just wanted to just run through, and that was the hope.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.200
 And obviously, I think we're going to have to carry this on next week.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.200
 It was going to be a several...

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.200
 Next month.

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.200
 Sorry, next month.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:53.200
 It was going to be a several-month topic, the endocrine system, because it's not a small

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.200
 subject.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:00.200
 But I obviously wanted to pull out many different perspectives from each organ secretion and

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:06.200
 how they interplay, because I know there's all sorts of hormones involved.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.200
 And thyroid hormone is one of them.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.200
 And then there's things like luteinizing hormone.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.200
 You've got all the sex hormones.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:19.200
 And then all those hormones that control even mood.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:27.200
 I mean, there's fairly new research out now that's showing a lot of interference between

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:35.200
 mood and people's aggression, male behavior in terms of aggressiveness, and the hormones,

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:42.200
 how they interplay, and how an organ secretion is either turned down or turned up by the

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:48.200
 target that it's reaching, and how the target, when it's sufficiently stimulated or inhibited,

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:53.200
 has a feedback back to the point of origin to tell it to calm down again.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.200
 So the whole thing is really quite an amazing engine.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:04.200
 But I guess starting with the hypothalamus, looking at, I guess, thyrotropin releasing

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.200
 hormone.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.200
 And again, the hypothalamus seems to direct a lot of its attention towards the anterior

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200
 pituitary.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:18.200
 So Dr. Peat, in terms of structure function, I wondered, I was reading this when I was

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:29.200
 putting this material together, that the hypothalamus itself, TRH, thyrotropin releasing hormone,

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:34.200
 stimulates TSH release, which is a thyroid stimulating hormone, which is something we

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:41.200
 talk about a lot in terms of moving into action the production of thyroid hormone.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.200
 And this comes from the pituitary, as well as thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulating

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.200
 prolactin from the anterior pituitary.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.200
 And I was wondering, it might be a stupid question, but I thought I'd have to ask you,

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:57.200
 because you probably know the reason, and hopefully it's not too simple, but the fact

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:05.200
 that prolactin is released as well as thyroid stimulating hormone from thyrotropin's action,

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:13.200
 how come it doesn't generate any kind of milk production in non-lactating females?

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.200
 It very often does.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:27.200
 For many, many years I've noticed that when a woman complains of menorrhagia or a prolonged

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.200
 excessive menstruation, they're often secreting milk.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:41.200
 Even if they've never been pregnant, or especially if they've had a couple of kids, the hormone

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:49.200
 changes that lead to the excessive menstruation also are causing prolactin excess, probably

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.200
 growth hormone excess too.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.200
 Too much growth hormone causes lactation.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:03.200
 But it's really not uncommon for a middle-aged woman to have chronic milk formation associated

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:12.200
 with the overactivity of the thyroid system because their thyroid gland itself isn't able

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:20.200
 to produce the active hormones and the feedback process to turn off the pituitary.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:27.200
 Almost everything the pituitary does, it has its constructive adaptive effect overcoming

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:35.200
 whatever is causing stress to the whole organism in response to the changed feedback system.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:45.200
 But in itself, the substances produced in the pituitary are all harmful if they are

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.200
 continued.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:54.200
 So what you want to do is have such a responsive, high metabolic system that the tissue can

00:50:54.200 --> 00:51:00.200
 respond fully to a little bit of pituitary hormone and turn it off quickly.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:07.200
 Animals that have their pituitaries removed, that are given a supplement of cortisol and

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:14.200
 thyroid, will often live two or three times longer than animals that are normal with a

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:21.200
 normal pituitary function, showing that the pituitary, to the extent that it's overactive,

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:25.200
 is shortening your life and shrinking your potential.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:32.200
 So this is why you recommend TSH being as low as possible and ACTH being as low as possible?

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:37.200
 Yeah, all of the pituitary hormones I think should be kept minimal.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.200
 Interesting.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:44.200
 Because if your body is producing enough thyroid and enough cortisol and enough estrogen and

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.200
 progesterone and testosterone, then your pituitary hormones will be minimal.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:55.200
 Yeah, and your skin, if you get sunburned or have an inflammation, poison oak or anything

00:51:55.200 --> 00:52:04.200
 that's hurting your skin, your skin can produce the pituitary hormones as well as stress hormones

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.200
 of various types.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.200
 Wow.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:15.200
 So every simple little tissue, your tonsils, any simple looking tissue, if it's stressed,

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.200
 will produce pituitary hormones, estrogen.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:25.200
 You see, this is really what I wanted to get into, the meat and potatoes of what you understand

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:31.200
 in terms of the physiological effects, because when we're at med school or other schools

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:38.200
 that study physiology and other types of disciplines surrounding medicine, it's not what you get

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.200
 taught.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.200
 Anyway, it's three minutes to eight, so...

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.200
 Well, we did get taught that hormones can be stored in the fat cells and released.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.200
 Well, yeah, okay, but I wanted to bring out a little more.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200
 But anyway, thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.200
 I really appreciate your spending your time here.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.200
 Okay, well, thank you.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.200
 Thanks for joining the show, Dr. Peat, and thank you, callers.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:59.200
 Okay, so we are going to run through this next month.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.200
 So we'll carry on endocrinology part three and we'll get into the rest of these hormones

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:08.200
 and things like corticotropin releasing hormone, dopamine, you've heard of growth hormone releasing

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:15.200
 hormone, somatostatin, gonadotropin, oxytocin, and how these exert their effects, the mechanisms

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.200
 by which they exert their effects, how they can be disrupted, how they can become aberrant

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.200
 and cause disease.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:29.200
 But in the basis of the understanding of metabolic energy, concerned with the ordered structure

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:34.200
 function arrangement in the body, there'll be lots of examples of how things can be pulled

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.200
 back into a normal pattern.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.200
 But anyway, for those people who've listened to Dr. Peat this evening and for the callers,

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:48.200
 if anybody wants to find out more about Dr. Peat and his fully referenced scientific articles

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:55.200
 that he has on his website freely for downloading or reading or printing or whatever, it's raypeat.com.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:00.200
 So www.raypeat.com.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:05.200
 Similarly, like I said at the beginning of the show, we archive all of the shows that

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.200
 we've done with Dr. Peat over these last nine or ten years.

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.200
 I'm in the process of getting all the 2016s and the few months of 2017s uploaded to the

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.200
 server, but all the other years are there.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.200
 So for those people who've called in, thanks for your questions.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:25.200
 For those people who've heard a little bit about Dr. Peat, there's plenty more to be found

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.200
 out from his website.

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:33.200
 And we can also be reached Monday through Friday, 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:37.200
 And our website is westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.200
 Thanks so much for your time.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.200
 See you next month.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200
 Thank you.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200
 Good night.
