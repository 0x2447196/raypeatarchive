00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.240
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.280
 Know the source, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.000
 - Okay, here we are back with part two

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 of our little show here as we're live.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.120
 December 17th, 2019, Patrick Timpone, oneradionetwork.com.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.600
 On the third Tuesday of each month,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
 we're honored to have Dr. Ray Peat,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.280
 PhD, University of Oregon.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.520
 He's specialization in physiology.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.800
 Started his work on hormones in '68, 1968.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.960
 That's the year I started in radio, Dr. Peat.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.760
 We started together, oh.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.200
 And his dissertation in '72 where he was on hormones,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.360
 and he's been working in this field ever since.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.400
 He's taught university level,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.080
 and he writes so many different articles.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.060
 His website's very popular,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.520
 and he does a little newsletter we'll tell you about.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.800
 And Dr. Ray Peat is up,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.160
 and you're in Washington, right, Doc?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.000
 - Oregon.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.600
 - Oh, you're in Oregon, in Oregon.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.040
 You're near Portlandia?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.420
 - No, Eugene.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.920
 - Eugene, is that more towards the coast,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.400
 or are you more eastern?

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.760
 - About 60 miles from the coast,

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.920
 and 100 miles south of Portland.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.560
 - Ah, uh-huh.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 Do you have nice weather?

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 Like, what are your winters like up there?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.440
 - Oh, some snow.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.920
 We've had up to four feet of snow,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160
 but some winters, no snow at all.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.080
 - Uh-huh, yeah.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.320
 And how are you doing, how's your life?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.720
 - Oh, very good.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240
 Weather's cold right now.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 - Yeah, uh-huh.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.600
 You do quite a bit of research, ongoing, right?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.760
 And you paint as well.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.600
 - Yep.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.420
 - Yeah.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.800
 You doing any particular research right now?

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.480
 - Yeah, the last few weeks,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.400
 I've been particularly interested

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.120
 in why the lifespan is decreasing.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.600
 Life expectancy is decreasing now in the US,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.120
 and the government is finally admitting it.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.600
 That, on top of the rapid increase

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.540
 in autoimmune disease, degenerative disease,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.300
 and the cancer rate and mortality

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.160
 increasing in younger people,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.300
 I've been looking for explanations for that.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.020
 - So the autoimmune thing, when did that really start?

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.060
 Was it about 15, 20, or 15 years ago?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.820
 People used to start talking about the autoimmune--

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.980
 - Yeah, 50 years ago was pretty rare.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.820
 - Yeah.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.540
 Is the basic principle that we've heard over the years

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.780
 that there's, let's see if I understand

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.100
 what I've heard about it,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.180
 and tell me if this is close,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.680
 where the body gets like an infection,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.980
 a virus, a bacteria, or a fungus,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
 and the body is trying to get after that,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.620
 the immune system, and it actually attacks its own tissues?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.540
 Is that the classic--

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.540
 - That's the classic standard story.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.260
 - Is that correct?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.100
 - I don't think so.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.460
 - Oh, good, see, I didn't think so.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.420
 (laughing)

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.420
 - For example, studies in animals

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.020
 trying to duplicate that process,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.980
 they give them a viral infection of the brain

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.940
 that increases the antibodies,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.300
 just like in multiple sclerosis

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.180
 and the other human diseases,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.420
 and they find that if they prevent

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.660
 those so-called autoantibodies,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.660
 if they block the cells that produce those autoantibodies,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.180
 the animal dies,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.220
 that the autoantibodies are actually there

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.560
 repairing tissues,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.260
 and I've seen this in people

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.260
 with very high autothyroid antibodies.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.020
 That's a pretty common thing now

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.620
 to have chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.700
 with high antibodies,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.700
 but just very high thyroid-stimulating hormone

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.980
 causes inflammation of the gland,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.740
 and the immune system is attempting to clean up

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.640
 the way it does in the virus infection

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.580
 of the brain in animals.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.820
 The immune system needs those antibodies

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.140
 as part of a tissue cleanup process,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.880
 and actually, our immune system,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.700
 if you go way back to the Nobel Prizes

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.820
 in immunity with Ehrlich and Metchnikoff,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:20.340
 who shared the Nobel Prize, I think it was 1908 or '10,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.460
 Ehrlich worked for the chemical drug industry

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.620
 and created the antibody theory of immunity.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.060
 Metchnikoff was an embryologist,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.220
 and he saw the immune system as a process

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.440
 of maintaining the structure of the body,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.620
 removing damaged tissues so that the body

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.980
 remained entire and healthy,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.100
 and you can see that process happening in the thyroid,

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.100
 or if you just injure a cartilage, for example,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.180
 your body will produce autoimmune antibodies,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.100
 but it's a process of removing damaged tissue

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.860
 so that the cartilage will be restored.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.260
 - So the body's doing what it's supposed to do.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.460
 This is the body's way of protecting the thyroid

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.280
 or cleaning it up after this high TSH level

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.020
 causes inflammation?

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.420
 - Yeah, preservation and restoration.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.140
 - Preservation, restoration.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.860
 But now, as I understand it,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.620
 they're all doing antibody tests for thyroid,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.780
 and if they see the antibodies, they don't,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.140
 even the natural community,

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.380
 they're treating the antibody thyroid issue differently,

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.900
 right, if it's autoimmune thyroid, they call it,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.940
 then they're treating it differently,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.780
 but you're saying they're incorrect.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.020
 - There are some really terrible drugs

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.820
 that they put people on chronically

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.340
 to basically suppress or kill the cells

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.080
 that are creating those antibodies.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:19.340
 Now, for about 50 years, it's been very clear,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.620
 especially with animal research,

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.860
 that estrogen is an extremely powerful factor

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.860
 in disrupting the immune system, creating inflammation.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.780
 Women have several times the incidence

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.420
 of autoimmune diseases,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:44.060
 possibly even 10 times as much thyroid inflammatory disease

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.700
 as men, and that's because estrogen

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.700
 is suppressing the restorative part of the immune system

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.340
 and activating the inflammatory part.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.940
 - So what's going on now, if you go

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.620
 to a natural naturopath or anybody, or a natural doc,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.260
 or even a regular conventional doc,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.620
 and they give you the whole thyroid panel,

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.340
 lots of them, if they're a little bit more educated,

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.640
 they'll wanna do an antibodies

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.540
 to see if it's an autoimmune issue, right?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.260
 So you're saying the research really shows

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.380
 that that's what the body's supposed to do,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.660
 and you would just leave that alone

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.860
 if you were giving medical advice, which you don't do?

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:33.740
 - No, over the last 40 years, I guess,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.740
 I've seen probably 20 or 30 women with that condition,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.940
 probably much, much more than that,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.940
 but if their doctor will give them

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.740
 a full replacement dose of thyroid hormone,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.580
 glandular thyroid, over a period of five or six months,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.100
 those antibodies fade away.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.300
 - They fade away.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.500
 That would be a nature, or what's the correct term now?

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.420
 Is it nature thyroid, or just where it's got everything,

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.180
 the T4s, the T3s, and everything?

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.180
 - Desiccated thyroid. - Desiccated thyroid.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.260
 - That's a traditional, or thyroid USP,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.300
 was the standard term.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:28.540
 In just the last few weeks, I've run across two women

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.820
 who, during their pregnancy,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.500
 went to the doctor just for a checkup,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.340
 and against their preference,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.100
 they were given a vaccination,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.220
 one of the compound multiple vaccines,

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.220
 and almost immediately, their blood pressure went up,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.620
 their blood sugar went up,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.180
 they were diagnosed as having preeclampsia

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.220
 and gestational diabetes,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:05.980
 and both of the first one was sure

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.860
 that the vaccination had rather done,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.780
 and so she kept alert, watching what was happening.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.500
 She developed rheumatoid arthritis symptoms,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.620
 went back for thorough exams,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:28.260
 and found she had the lupus typical antibody,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.540
 so she was diagnosed with SLE lupus,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.820
 and they wanted to put her on the immune system

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:45.060
 killing drugs, but she was, by that time,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.980
 very skeptical about their judgment,

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.820
 and so she started taking thyroid and progesterone

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.820
 and changing her diet, and the arthritis faded away,

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.660
 the lupus antibodies faded away.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:06.740
 I think in probably any case of autoimmune antibodies,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:13.820
 if you remove the problem, the sources of inflammation,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.620
 the antibodies after about six or eight months

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.780
 will fade away.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.100
 - So this autoimmune model,

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.460
 it's always creating antibodies

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.420
 to try to repair the particular organ,

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.380
 whether it be pancreas or stomach or anything

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.660
 with H. pylori, and you can see H. pylori antibodies,

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.860
 the body's doing what it's supposed to do.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.180
 - Yeah, the antibody is like,

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.180
 some people have described it as butter

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.660
 on the food you're going to eat,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.580
 it makes it more appetizing for the white blood cells

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.900
 to eat whatever the antibody sticks to.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.180
 So sometimes it's a germ, but very often

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.180
 it's the broken down tissue, one's own tissue

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:08.380
 that's damaged has to be cleaned up and removed.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.300
 - Is there any case in the literature or the research

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.620
 showing where the immune system is actually

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.300
 harming the body or attacking the body,

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.100
 like we've been told that arthritis is

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.780
 where the immune system is attacking the joints

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.900
 and the knees and stuff?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.060
 - Yeah, there are hundreds and hundreds of papers

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.940
 supposedly demonstrating that by experiments,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.940
 but there are also hundreds of examples of those people

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.400
 who almost overnight, in a few cases,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.740
 literally overnight recovered from those

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.980
 so-called autoimmune diseases.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.140
 - Because the body took care of the infection

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.380
 that was the original cause?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.180
 - Or the hormone deficiency that was leading

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.940
 to the inflammation instead of just

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.700
 a quiet cleanup process.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.220
 - Kind of lost you there.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:18.540
 - If the white blood cells are slightly poisoned

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:23.900
 by a bad diet and your thyroid hormone

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.900
 doesn't provide the energy, then there tends to be

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.180
 quite a bit of lactic acid in circulation,

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.460
 and maybe only 50% above average,

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:42.460
 but that's enough to start the inflammation process.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.100
 And so just by increasing the energy production,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.100
 you lower the lactic acid and reduce

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.980
 the basis of the inflammation.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.860
 And with the lactic acid removed,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.460
 then the oxidative metabolism can get going,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.220
 energize the process of cleanup.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.720
 - And what are some of the causes of the high lactic acids?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:19.540
 - Probably the basic general cause is

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:25.740
 anything that shifts you over to having

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.200
 free fatty acids circulating in your blood.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.700
 Any kind of stress that runs into a limitation

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:42.340
 of energy capacity will break down

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.300
 the fatty acids in your tissues,

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.300
 put them into your bloodstream as a source of energy

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.260
 which can keep the organism running for weeks,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.100
 eating its own tissues.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.100
 But when the fatty acids are being circulated,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.820
 they block the ability to oxidize glucose.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.660
 And when you aren't oxidizing glucose,

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.820
 you aren't producing as much lactic acid,

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.820
 and you aren't producing as much carbon dioxide

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.940
 and carbonic acid.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.740
 And that lack of carbonic acid inside the cell

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.620
 allows the cell to shift over

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.560
 to the production of lactic acid.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.100
 The healthy cell is oxidizing glucose

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.300
 which produces a lot more carbon dioxide

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.540
 than oxidizing fat does.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.260
 And that higher carbon dioxide suppresses

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.100
 the process of glycolysis and making lactic acid.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.260
 - That was a little geeky for me, complicated.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.260
 But so in more simple terms of dietary things,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:12.460
 what do we do unknowingly to increase this lactic acid

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.100
 or to improve it with the foods?

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.500
 - You need all of the trace minerals

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.140
 and essential vitamins and adequate protein.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:29.140
 And then ideally you would get all of your energy

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.500
 from carbohydrates, sugar or starches,

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:39.460
 and not have to rely on burning fat

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.980
 because stress turns on the fat burning.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:49.140
 And that turns on almost always

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.860
 some background lactic acid formation.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.580
 - Oh, there goes the old keto thing.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.380
 I mean, isn't that the whole pitch on ketosis

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.540
 where you're burning fat?

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.780
 - Yeah, and for example,

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:12.300
 when the brain is given ketones,

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.780
 or especially the short or middle

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.740
 medium chain triglycerides,

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:24.740
 when you are making an argument

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.740
 by doing a particular set of experiments,

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:35.580
 you take a frame of reference

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.580
 and you can seem to have made your point

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.100
 within a certain context.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:49.100
 But for example, if you're advocating

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:55.020
 the ketone-based brain energy,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:02.060
 you shift your argument over to make lactic acid

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:07.660
 a virtue rather than a menace.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.660
 And the medium chain triglycerides, for example,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.380
 are oxidized by the astrocytes,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.080
 the connective tissue of the brain.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.100
 It causes them to produce a lot of lactic acid.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.100
 And so if you see lactic acid as a virtue for energy,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.700
 then that seems to support the fat diet.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.100
 - Oh, it's kind of with many things on planet Earth,

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.820
 whether it is, I don't know,

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.320
 just all kinds of things why it's not legal

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.420
 to pay taxes or something.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.220
 When you cherry pick information

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.700
 and bring out to prove your point,

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.700
 you can prove your point,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.620
 but you're not saying looking at the whole thing,

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.940
 it's a more reductionist way of looking at it?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.980
 - Yeah, narrowing the frame,

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.780
 if you can control the frame,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:08.480
 the universe of reference of your discussion,

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.960
 the frame will determine the outcome.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.960
 But if you look at a broader picture, for example,

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.080
 a lot of disagreement currently

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.980
 is on the meaning of lactic acid.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.980
 And there is a whole line of publication

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.220
 going on saying that lactic acid

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.740
 is the greatest stuff in the world.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.640
 It feeds the brain and makes you athletic and so on.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.140
 But really, it's the background shift

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.020
 towards lactic acid metabolism

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.940
 is the essence of stress, inflammation, and degeneration.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.780
 - And so it's really key when you're looking

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.160
 at the lactic acid production

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.300
 and with the muscle of the heart, for example, too, isn't it?

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.700
 - Oh, yeah. - It's a big deal, yeah.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.700
 - Yeah, I think there should be a regular test

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.420
 of lactic acid content in the blood.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.100
 You could see oncoming heart disease and cancer

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.300
 much earlier.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.700
 - And so the big producers of lactic acid, stress,

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.220
 too much-- - And fats.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.540
 Too much fat in your diet.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.040
 - Too much fat, even that good old grass-fed

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.000
 whatever, animal fat?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.720
 - Yeah, too much fat. - Too much butter, too?

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.560
 Too much butter?

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.120
 - Yeah, you could eat so much butter

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.920
 that it can have that effect even though it's good fat.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:43.880
 - Pretty good.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.960
 So how is butter different from, say,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.600
 oh, I don't know. - Fish oil, for example.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.080
 - Yeah, well, fish oil, yeah.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.960
 - It's the most extreme.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.960
 When you eat butter, the highly saturated fats,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.560
 uric acid, for example,

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:10.800
 it has an anti-inflammatory effect in most tissues

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:17.600
 and doesn't, it has an antioxidant action

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.360
 because it is so stable.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.280
 Fish oil and safflower oil, soy oil,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.920
 have so much highly unsaturated fat

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.800
 that they are spontaneously oxidizing

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.880
 even before it reaches your bloodstream.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.760
 - Wow. - Fish fat.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.360
 - They oxidize. - Oxidizing.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.360
 And it's the oxidized fat molecules,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.280
 in the case of fish oil,

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.280
 that will temporarily produce an anti-inflammatory effect

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.820
 by poisoning your immune system.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.880
 - What about if you were getting fat from, say,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.880
 I don't know, well-tended pigs or something,

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.520
 that other kind of saturated fat?

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.720
 - Yeah, if the pigs-- - Is that okay?

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.000
 If the pigs are all healthy and cool?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.360
 - Yeah, if they were eating-- - Good stuff.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.040
 - Foy and apples, for example,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.040
 their fat would be just like butter.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.080
 - Interesting, we have a farmer's market

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.920
 here in Dripping Springs,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.440
 and they have these big pictures,

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.240
 and these folks have these pigs on a vegetarian diet,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.280
 and they must know something about what you've just said.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:43.440
 - Yeah, in Mexico, lots of pigs are fed basically a fruit.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.680
 - Yeah. - Very interesting.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:54.200
 But did I hear you say that the energy

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.560
 from more of the sugars and the carbs are preferable?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.280
 Is it preferable, actually, over meat in general?

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.840
 - Well, meat should provide the protein,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.680
 which is essential, and lots of the vitamins and minerals.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.880
 But meat has a very high content of phosphate,

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.920
 and almost no calcium in proportion.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.760
 - Right.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.760
 - And phosphate imitates the stress condition.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.480
 When you're under stress and break down ATP,

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.880
 you liberate phosphate, which activates tissue,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.880
 and is part of the muscle contraction and excitation.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.240
 But if you don't eat enough calcium in proportion,

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:47.760
 you start having an average condition of overexcitation.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:52.000
 - So you can do too much, let's say,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.720
 say too much meat and not enough dark greens

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.360
 with calcium or whatever.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.800
 - Yeah, the cooked greens are the richest source of calcium,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.800
 and so cows eat mostly greens when they can.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.680
 And so the milk is a very good source of magnesium

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.400
 and calcium from the greens they eat.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.920
 - People wonder why, like you, you drink milk,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.700
 and other folks are drinking good milk,

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.600
 that the calcium doesn't end up in the wrong spot,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.080
 like in the arteries.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.480
 - Yeah, it's the phosphate excess that pushes the calcium

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.240
 into your arteries and out of the bones.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.240
 And that's very closely related to the problem

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.660
 of inflammation, degeneration, and immune failure.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:49.000
 The phosphate out of proportion

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.420
 triggers your parathyroid gland,

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:57.680
 and the parathyroid hormone specializes

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.880
 in moving calcium out of your bones,

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.240
 bringing it into the blood to balance the phosphate.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.800
 But the parathyroid hormone does that,

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.840
 mobilizes calcium out of the bone

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.680
 by blocking oxidative metabolism,

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.920
 creating local lactic acid production,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.520
 which breaks down the bone.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.520
 And that happens anywhere in the body

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.240
 that is exposed to parathyroid hormone.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.840
 So it's one of the emergency hormones,

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.240
 which is, if it's turned on chronically

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.880
 by eating a high phosphate intake,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.880
 that becomes a chronic block to your energy production,

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:53.080
 shifts you to the generalized lactic acid formation.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.080
 And in your soft tissues, that dominance of lactic acid

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:04.040
 in the presence of phosphate de-energizes the tissue,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.560
 and allows the formation,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.240
 starting right in your mitochondria,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.280
 the calcium phosphate crystals form

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.440
 as the mitochondrion dies.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.440
 And the lactic acid production

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.120
 has shifted the pH of the cell

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.120
 so that the crystal calcium phosphate is insoluble

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.160
 as long as you're producing lactic acid

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.080
 under the influence of parathyroid hormone.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.400
 The calcium crystals become insoluble in your soft tissues,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.440
 but are broken down, taking the calcium out of your bone.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.240
 - And what would be the metric on a blood test

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.360
 to connect up a high parathyroid hormone

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.760
 circulating in the body to cause this issue?

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.880
 Would it be a high TSH level?

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.920
 - Yeah, that and aldosterone is part of it.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.720
 The angiotensin system is a big part of it.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.320
 They all go with parathyroid hormone,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.400
 but the common blood test,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:27.000
 the most often identified feature

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.640
 is a low vitamin D content in the blood,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.640
 because vitamin D helps to shift the ratio

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:41.280
 in your body towards calcium, away from phosphate.

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.280
 And the vitamin D or a high calcium intake

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.720
 turns off the parathyroid hormone.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.480
 - Which is good, right?

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.880
 Which is good to turn, yeah.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.880
 - And so eating lots of calcium surprises a lot of people,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.440
 will prevent calcification of the soft tissues.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.640
 - It's crazy, yeah.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.680
 So the vitamin D, is it the same as taking

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.400
 a vitamin D supplement or being out in the sun?

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.120
 - Better to be in the sun.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:10.960
 - The sun?

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:15.280
 - And eventually when your tissues

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.080
 have assimilated the calcium and vitamin D,

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.160
 you actually become resistant to the sun,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.160
 because it's the de-energized tissues

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:33.680
 liberating fatty acids and such that make you sunburn

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.080
 and age your skin in the sun.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.160
 In rabbit experiments many years ago,

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.800
 they fed one batch of rabbits corn oil,

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.680
 the other some more saturated fat,

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.480
 and they shaved them and exposed them to sunlight.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.000
 The rabbits that ate the good diet

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 didn't get wrinkly skin or sunburn.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 The ones on the corn oil diet got prematurely aged skin.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.180
 - Very interesting.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.360
 Dr. Ray Peet is with us, we have lots of emails

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.780
 we're gonna get to, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.560
 I got an email from somebody

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.560
 and they were trying to make the argument

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.000
 that sugar, that you don't seem to be too concerned about,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.760
 I mean, let's see how they're saying this,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:30.540
 it's a long email, I just tried to condense it a bit

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.880
 just to put up their argument forward

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.880
 and see what you think, where high,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.640
 let's see, with sugar the HGH level goes down

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.400
 so that ages the body, the insulin level goes up

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.680
 with sugar so that lowers HGH, the cortisol goes up

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.680
 which causes aging, sugar raises insulin too much,

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.640
 the glycation, so making the argument

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.240
 that insulin in the system

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:06.240
 is causing aging in the body.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.600
 - Well, lowering human growth hormone

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.600
 is one of the great advantages of carbohydrate,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.880
 sugar or starch.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.280
 - That's good?

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.480
 - Yeah, because the growth hormone

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.640
 is one of the stress-related hormones,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.680
 it rises when your blood sugar is low

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.720
 and liberates free fatty acids

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:38.060
 tending towards diabetes.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:45.360
 If you give an excess of growth hormone

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.360
 it imitates most of the degenerative features of diabetes.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.960
 - So--

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:58.800
 - And animals that spontaneously lack the growth hormone

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.920
 live about twice as long as ones

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.960
 with the normal growth hormone.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.960
 - So high HGH levels are not pro-euthane at all,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.320
 they're just the opposite.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.480
 - Pro-aging, pro-diabetes.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.560
 - Wow, man, how can--

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:21.840
 - Experimenters have removed animals' pituitary glands

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:26.840
 and replaced the, I think they gave cortisol

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:31.200
 in moderation and thyroid hormone,

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.160
 but didn't replace growth hormone

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:40.160
 or luteinizing hormone or ACTH, supposedly essential.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.120
 And the animals lived twice as long or more,

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.640
 just like the ones who, by mutation,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.520
 naturally lack the growth hormone.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.760
 - This classic meme called, what is it,

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.880
 metabolic syndrome, where if you eat too many carbs

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.600
 and insulin levels and then that can cause inflammation

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.440
 in the arteries.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.400
 - Yeah, that's basically caused by eating too much fat.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.880
 Not enough-- - Eating too much fat.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.400
 - Not enough carbohydrate.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.360
 - Not enough, so the metabolic syndrome model

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.800
 is incorrect in your opinion, in the research.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.600
 - You can create it very quickly

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.880
 by especially polyunsaturated fat.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.240
 - Yeah, the PUFAs.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.480
 - Yeah.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:30.040
 - But when you say eating too much fat,

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.760
 even all the good fats or just the bad fats,

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.680
 just the fish oils and those kind of things?

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.880
 - Butter and coconut oil, for example,

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.680
 have about 3% of the bad fats,

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.640
 the PUFA.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.120
 And so even though the stearic and palmitic acids

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.760
 are, in some way, they can be protective,

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.920
 but chronically, you're going to accumulate

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.920
 and store these PUFA because you preferentially

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:05.360
 oxidize the saturated fats.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.320
 They're safer, don't destroy the mitochondria

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.680
 as quickly.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.680
 So you store and build these PUFA into your tissues.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.480
 If you look at a newborn calf or baby,

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.480
 the brain of either is almost perfectly free

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.840
 of polyunsaturated fats.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.900
 But in the human, very quickly,

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:39.760
 by the time they're 10 or 12 years old,

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.760
 the brain is already showing high accumulation of PUFA.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.880
 And the metabolism, meanwhile, is slowing drastically.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:55.880
 And after the age of 12, up until about 20,

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.440
 when the growth slows down or stops,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.320
 the tissues are loading up more and more with PUFA.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.280
 And after the age of 20, when there's no dilution by growth,

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:17.200
 the concentration of PUFA increases steadily

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.200
 for the rest of your life because they are preferentially

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.320
 stored and built into your tissues,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:29.320
 including your brain tissue, rather than being oxidized.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.440
 And they tie up the cholesterol,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:37.080
 which is synthesized in the brain

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.800
 as part of a normal brain physiology.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.800
 But the PUFA bound to the cholesterol makes it insoluble.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:50.160
 And so it's like ashes or clickers building up

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.760
 in your brain throughout the lifespan,

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.760
 primarily because of the accumulation

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.520
 of unmetabolized PUFA.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.240
 - And what are some of the more popular

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.960
 and prolific PUFAs out there that we would know?

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.400
 - Fish oil. - Fish oil.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.720
 - Safflower and cottonseed and--

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.760
 - Corn oil, soy oil, that kind of stuff.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.200
 - All of the things which make good paint and varnish.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.000
 - Paint and varnish, yeah.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 So when you say bad fats, you're really referring to PUFAs.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.280
 - Yeah. - Yeah, uh-huh.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.080
 - Hmm.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:35.800
 Oh, man.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.320
 So here's one for you.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:45.560
 Quite interested in Ray Peet's consumption of milk.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.240
 And it seems, I've been trying, it says,

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.560
 "Dolly," she's in Seattle up near you,

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.760
 "I just can't seem to drink even raw grass-fed milk

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.080
 "and not get constipated.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.520
 "Does that mean that I just don't need this

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.080
 "or could something else be going on?"

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.760
 - What the cow eats shows up in the milk.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.760
 A mother who is breastfeeding often will eat peanuts

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.280
 or tomatoes or something and find that the baby

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.960
 gets diarrhea and rashes.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.320
 It's the same with the cows.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:30.320
 If the cow is fed something, could be weeds in the pasture,

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.000
 something that you're sensitive to,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.120
 then it will cause inflammation

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.200
 just like the baby that gets diarrhea.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.560
 - Wow, so how, man, so you would, how would you do that?

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.360
 Would you just have to try to find a source

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.560
 that doesn't make you constipated?

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.520
 - Yeah, I've known people who tried

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.960
 five or six different brands.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.000
 Sometimes they will settle on something

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.320
 which isn't really very tasty,

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:07.640
 ultra-pasteurized milk, basically cooked until it's sterile.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.160
 (both laughing)

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.520
 - Just they cook the life out of it,

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.120
 but do you still get the same, similar benefits, though?

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.360
 - Yeah, lots of people find that they can tolerate that

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:23.120
 without constipation or diarrhea or asthma symptoms.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.320
 - So even, so when they say grass-fed cows

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.320
 and say you rely on the source,

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.240
 you don't really know where they've been.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.000
 I mean, they could be eating something,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.040
 a patch of something that could make you constipated.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.500
 - There is one famous organic milk source.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.880
 I've heard half a dozen other people had the same reaction.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.240
 I tried it several times and got sick each time.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.160
 Several people have told me the same experience

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.760
 with that organic company.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.760
 But I've tried three or four other organic milks.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.960
 One of them tasted especially awful.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.960
 And I looked up where their farm was, organic certified,

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.500
 but it was downwind from a very stinky, horrible factory.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.720
 - Oh, good.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.120
 - And the air the cows were breathing,

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.400
 possibly something was settling on the grass

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:23.120
 that they didn't detect in their organic certification.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.320
 But I think probably just cows breathing that stinky air

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.560
 were contaminating the milk.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.500
 - My goodness.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.720
 It's easy to see then how so many people

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.000
 have different experiences with milk.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.560
 - Yeah, I think the good taste of the milk

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.660
 should be the most reliable guide.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:51.040
 The one I use most often is Safeways Lucerne milk.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:56.640
 - Here's an email for you.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:03.680
 Considering that one was following Dr. Pete's information

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.440
 in living a healthy as possible,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.120
 according to some of his research and information,

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.480
 how long does he think one is expected

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.100
 to live a healthy life?

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:16.600
 Also, how much damage can be undone

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.640
 if living unhealthy for say several decades?

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.560
 Is there damage that is irreversible,

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.680
 such as if one starts late in life

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.240
 with decades of unhealthy living?

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.160
 Does this affect their lifespan

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.840
 if they begin living more healthy?

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.520
 That's a great question.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:40.520
 - Yeah, just taking the PUFA into account,

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.860
 your blood vessels and your brain, for example,

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.380
 deteriorate in proportion to the amount

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:53.380
 of the polyunsaturated esters of cholesterol.

00:39:53.380 --> 00:40:00.700
 Those become hard to excrete and build up

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.600
 and inactivate the cells.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:09.600
 But I've looked for things that can shift the balance

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.540
 towards de-esterification to help the system

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:20.780
 to break down and liberate the free cholesterol

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.500
 from the polyunsaturated fat.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.720
 And estrogen makes the balance worse

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.540
 and progesterone tends to help the balance.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:36.540
 And I don't know of any prolonged experiments

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.620
 in which they've tried to reverse an animal's aged brain

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:48.100
 by giving them a high balance of progesterone.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:53.240
 But you can see improvement in many of the tissues,

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:58.660
 possibly because of the anti-inflammatory effects

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.140
 of the progesterone.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:05.140
 But I think prolonged dominance of progesterone

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.720
 tends to reverse those brain and blood vessel changes.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:16.540
 - So, but to your points about the body repairing,

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:22.580
 over time the body will repair bad activity?

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.660
 - Yeah, that's part of the function of the immune system.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.860
 - That's what it does.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:31.260
 - Is to break down the damaged tissue

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.620
 and let new cells form.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.300
 - Do you have any theories, or if you had to pick a number,

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.540
 if you were on a game show,

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:44.060
 about what lifespan humans these days,

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.200
 I know you're studying now how the lifespan is going down,

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.480
 how long we should be able to hang around and be healthy?

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:57.100
 - The official view, since the authorities themselves

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:02.820
 aren't likely to live more than 70 or 80 years,

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:07.340
 they won't accept evidence of anyone outliving them,

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.040
 basically, so since the French woman,

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:19.700
 I forget her, Jeanette, lived to be 122,

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:24.820
 and she was on TV reminiscing about meeting Vincent Van Gogh,

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:30.820
 people now accept 122 as the maximum.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.820
 But over my lifetime, I've seen examples,

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:42.140
 like when I was in Florida, a local newspaper

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:48.140
 reported on a man who had been picking oranges

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:53.140
 since he was a middle-aged man.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:57.700
 He went on Social Security in the 1930s,

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:02.060
 and so according to the documentation,

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.740
 at that time he was 135,

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.140
 but the story just didn't get

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.740
 under the general wire services.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.860
 And when I was in high school,

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:19.860
 a lot of newspapers reported a little tiny guy from Peru,

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:26.060
 who, according to the best documentation,

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.220
 church records were very well kept.

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:33.020
 He was 184 when he came to the United States.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.220
 And in England in the 1800s,

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:39.620
 there was Old Parr, who,

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:45.420
 just a regular old guy living in the country,

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:50.420
 but he had remarried when he was around 100

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:55.060
 and outlived, I guess, two or three wives.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.420
 But his documentation showed him to be,

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.300
 I think it was 152.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:04.900
 He was taken to visit the king,

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.380
 had some fine dining,

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.780
 which he wasn't accustomed to, and died.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:14.460
 And so they had the chance to autopsy him.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:19.460
 And the best physician in England at the time

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:22.060
 did a thorough autopsy

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.980
 and couldn't find any cause of death,

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.980
 nothing wrong with any of his tissues.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.420
 - My goodness.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.500
 If you just hypothetically had to move to an island

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.980
 and you could only take three or four foods with you

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.860
 'cause you had nothing on this island,

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.860
 this is just a fantasy movie that is not gonna happen,

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.900
 but just for fun, I wanted to ask you,

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.420
 what foods would you take with you

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.220
 if you only, say, take three foods?

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.940
 Dr. Pete, you can only have three foods.

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:50.540
 What would you take?

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.860
 - Cheese, tortillas, and oranges.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:53.980
 (laughing)

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.260
 - I like it, it's a good,

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.740
 cheese, turkeys, and oranges, really.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.040
 - Yeah, yeah, cheese tacos and orange juice.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.060
 - Turkeys are fairly neutral food for some reason

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.060
 that people tend to do fairly well on,

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.500
 and we don't eat all that much, do we, turkey?

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.620
 - Which, which is? - Turkey, turkey.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:15.460
 - Turkey? - Yeah.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:21.460
 - Like chicken, they tend to feed them lots of grains,

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.660
 and so their fat is very unsaturated.

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:30.940
 So, I think if you eat the leanest parts,

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.980
 like the breast meat, that's pretty good food.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.380
 - But when you say unsaturated,

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:38.820
 saturated's the best, right?

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.460
 'Cause that's more stable, right, okay.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.620
 Yeah, yeah.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.900
 So, I don't even know what turkeys eat out in the wild.

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.860
 We have turkeys out here where I live,

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.340
 who live in the-- - Well, if they're wild--

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.540
 - What do they eat? - If they're wild turkeys,

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.220
 they're probably eating lots of bugs and worms.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.140
 - That's what-- - So, it would be better.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.380
 - Same way with the chickens, right?

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.580
 If you can get some real chickens

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:00.220
 that are hanging out all day,

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.540
 that's where the best eggs, the best eggs are.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.620
 - Yeah, I had a friend who, every day,

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:12.620
 chopped up the leavings, leftovers from the kitchen,

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:18.220
 lots of tortillas, and chopped up vegetables and such,

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.980
 and the eggs were very good.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:25.980
 - Yeah, Cynthia wants to know if Dr. Pete ever eats bread.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.740
 Have you ever been married?

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.340
 Do you have any children?

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.420
 If so, do they follow your work?

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.160
 So, you don't have to answer that second part

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.580
 if you don't want to.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.900
 For the first one, do you eat bread at all?

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.220
 - No to all of them.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.100
 - No to all of them, just no to all of them.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.700
 Why not bread?

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:48.340
 - Well, I, 45 years ago,

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:51.420
 liked to make bread.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.260
 - Yeah.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.180
 - I would soak it,

00:46:54.180 --> 00:47:00.260
 about 12 hours, keeping the flour wet

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.980
 so that the enzymes would break it down.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.580
 It doesn't have to be literally sourdough,

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:10.580
 but the long soaking period increases the protein

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.080
 and decreases, or practically eliminates the gluten.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:20.080
 And I found that that was very digestible, very tasty.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:26.160
 I could eat a loaf of bread at bedtime and sleep very well.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:31.320
 Or a slice of regular bread would disturb my sleep.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.640
 - 'Cause of the gluten?

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.840
 'Cause of the gluten, do you think?

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.800
 - I think so.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.920
 - Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.640
 I don't know if I've ever asked you,

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.080
 what do you, we probably have and I just don't recall,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.840
 but what do you make of all this gluten sensitivity?

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:50.840
 And you have whole aisles now dedicated to gluten-free this

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.240
 and gluten-free that at the store.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.240
 Does the literature show exactly why this is going on?

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.560
 Research, do we know?

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:04.520
 - Yeah, gluten has a string of amino acids

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.600
 with the same pattern that estrogen activates

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.440
 in the intestine.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:19.440
 And like estrogen, it can activate inflammation

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:26.200
 just by that pattern that the immune system recognizes,

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.640
 sort of a signal of stress.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.100
 - Gluten can do that.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:35.000
 But why have people eaten bread through history?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:35.840
 I mean, bread--

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.520
 - Oh, through history, they would do it

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.160
 in the traditional way of letting it soak

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.640
 hours and hours.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.640
 Or in much of Asia and the Western Hemisphere,

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.960
 they used ashes.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.960
 They would add ashes to their mush, to the dough.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.240
 And the ash alkali activates chemical processes

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:16.120
 that actually increase the niacin value

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.800
 but decrease the tryptophan,

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.680
 making it chemically much more nutritious

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.240
 and safe, non-inflammatory food.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.840
 - So when we compare things that happened long ago

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.320
 of old diets and all that,

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.080
 we have to take into consideration

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.160
 exactly what they were doing to the food,

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.160
 like I think the ashes and the corn

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.960
 and the tortillas in Mexico you talked about.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.880
 - Yeah. - Yeah, same idea.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:49.140
 - But you can do it with wheat or any grain.

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:53.600
 - I was interested in the link that Dr. Pete made

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.600
 between hypoglycemia and lactic acid from a previous show.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.240
 I've had some issues with hypoglycemia

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.800
 and relieved with diet changes,

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.640
 but now I've been diagnosed with HCM and AFib

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.320
 that are exacerbated by lactic and buildup.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.640
 Is there a link between hypoglycemia

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.840
 and cardiovascular disease?

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:22.840
 - Yeah, when your oxidative apparatus,

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.520
 when the mitochondria are damaged,

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.280
 usually by fat, but other toxins can do it,

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:35.600
 you tend to produce lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide,

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.960
 and that is many times less efficient

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.520
 than oxidizing the sugar.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.280
 And so you're producing lactic acid

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.920
 and consuming sugar at a high rate,

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.400
 but not getting the energetic benefit from it.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.920
 And to get the maximum energy,

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.800
 you use sugar at an extremely high rate

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.940
 and just have trouble keeping your blood sugar steady.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:14.320
 - Okay, Dr. Ray Pete, stay right there, sir,

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.160
 please, if you will.

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.880
 We're gonna take a little break here.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.640
 These guys are on sale right now, 50% off,

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.600
 I think, for a few more days,

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.120
 all the Living Streams, 50, hello, 50%.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.120
 Dr. Richard Ulrey, authority on minerals,

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.000
 talks about gut bacteria, making the vitamins,

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.600
 and absorbing the minerals, how it all works.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.640
 - We need vitamins from our gut bacteria

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.440
 so we can absorb minerals,

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.920
 and then minerals provide a resonant frequency.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.520
 And those minerals carry these frequencies into the body,

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.200
 and multiple minerals will give you a frequency

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.600
 that allows all of our proteins

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.320
 to have individual distinct frequencies,

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.240
 giving that three-dimensional structure.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.800
 This is where Wayne's products, Living Stream,

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.080
 and that's the only primary products I carry.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.720
 When you do a stool test

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.760
 and it says you don't have any bifalbacteria,

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.560
 well, if you don't have any bifalbacteria,

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.200
 you're not gonna absorb certain minerals.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.320
 If you don't have any lactobacillus,

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:16.520
 you're not going to absorb certain minerals.

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.460
 - Here's an idea of a couple of the Living Streams

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.880
 you can take for what we're talking about here.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.240
 The Bifido Living Streams Multi-Blend

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.760
 and the Living Minerals.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:28.960
 So we get in the minerals, the bifido, and the lactobacillus.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.320
 And these special probiotics and minerals

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:36.320
 are all in human DNA form, and they are living alive.

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.960
 In our store on oneradionetwork.com.

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.560
 - Starving for vitality,

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.920
 we're turning to energy drinks, stimulants,

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.800
 and pharmaceuticals to try to improve our focus,

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:51.080
 increase our metabolism, rescue our sex drive,

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.480
 and adapt to the stresses of modern-day living.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.900
 (elk bugles)

00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:07.080
 Each year, an elk sheds its impressive antlers,

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:10.480
 regenerating an even larger set the following year.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.600
 These velvet antlers have been a revered

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.000
 traditional medicine for thousands of years.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.040
 Elk antler harnesses the adaptogenic

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.200
 and highly regenerative growth factors

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.360
 from this natural and ethical resource

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.840
 into a concentrated, bioavailable extraction.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.420
 Its revitalizing effects span bone, muscle,

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.920
 and nerve support, improve metabolism,

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.400
 cellular repair, sexual potency,

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.920
 anti-inflammation, vascular strengthening,

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.480
 and hormone production.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.040
 Humanely harvested from free-range US elk,

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.120
 extracted in organic alcohol,

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.880
 and protected in Muron glass,

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.280
 our elk antler is available in three strengths

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.560
 to restore your vitality at any level.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.320
 (dramatic music)

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:58.920
 Elk velvet antler is just one of the many products

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.720
 that Sir Thrival has for you.

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:06.280
 Really a fine, fine organization, Daniel Vitalis.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.440
 We've been working with Daniel forever,

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.080
 and they've been having little things on sale.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.040
 It's hard to even keep up with some of the things on sale.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.160
 We like the Digestive Bitters,

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.200
 the vitamin K2 and D,

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.440
 it's called Daylight Vitamin D K2,

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.400

 Elk Velvet Antler, Colostrum,

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:31.200
 and they also have some new CBD products,

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.920
 the thing out of the hemp.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.800
 So check it out,

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.840
 any Sir Thrival link, oneradionetwork.com.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.160
 I think we have two more days of sale on this product.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.200
 Previously with Dr. Rulan Chu

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.520
 about her product called Pearlseum.

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.200
 So let's talk about the teeth first.

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.640
 Explain to me what's going on,

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.080
 because there's something magical

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.520
 when you dip your little toothbrush in water.

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.200
 Why do they look so sparkly and just, I don't know,

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:02.080
 something very energetically about the look of them.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.520
 - Yeah, it's very, very magical.

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.840
 So like a group of scientists in France

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.920
 discovered that when you put pearl next to the bones

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.120
 or skins or other connective tissues,

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.600
 and they find it stimulates new growth

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.440
 of the bones and skins and connective tissues,

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:25.120
 and also to make existing bones and the skins

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.160
 more healthy and stronger.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.280
 So brush your teeth with the pearl,

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.600
 then your teeth will make your existing teeth stronger,

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.600
 and also it will filling up teeth with the pearlseum,

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.040
 and the pearl powder will stimulate the new bone growth

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:46.360
 and also make the existing teeth very strong.

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.560
 - It's really a great product.

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.500
 You'll love it.

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.320
 Take it internally or on your teeth,

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.520
 and you can click an order.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.800
 See the ad right there, Pearlseum,

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.160
 in a nice green container.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.760
 Pearlseum on oneradionetwork.com.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.920
 We're talking with Dr., yeah, and excuse me,

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:06.200
 15% off right now, promo code OneRadio for Pearlseum.

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.080
 It's just real pearl.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.880
 I think it's calcium carbonate if you break it down.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.960
 Kind of think so.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.440
 Real pearl that they break down

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.880
 without messing up the cellular matrix.

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:21.880
 So it's gonna go where it needs to go, calcium,

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:25.160
 and also a lot of other herbs, proteins,

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.880
 and other minerals in this product.

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:28.840
 So it's a good one.

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:33.440
 Dr. Ray Peet is with us on the third Tuesday of the month,

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:34.760

 and we always put the link on the show page.

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:49.760
 You can just kind of click an order

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.680
 if you would like to get the newsletter from Dr. Ray Peet,

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.640
 and that's often fun.

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:57.440
 Doc, here's an interesting question.

00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.800
 Athletes often have low pulses

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.860
 and suboptimal thyroid function.

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:04.280
 I was a recreational athlete

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:06.960
 but did a run, a full marathon in my youth.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.280
 Pulse was always around 60,

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:13.000
 even though my body temperature at dawn was like 97.6,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.320
 and rises to 98 during the day.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.120
 I breathe about five to six times per minute.

00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:21.360
 So I'm wondering if despite adequate temperature,

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.200
 the pulse could be related

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.320
 to consuming fewer breaths per minute

00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.540
 than the average person.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:35.480
 - Yeah, endurance exercise can slow your metabolism

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:39.320
 by reducing the thyroid,

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:45.200
 and the tissue itself can become more efficient.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.880
 People who live at very high altitude

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.360
 have adapted their tissues

00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:01.360
 so that they resist shifting over to making lactic acid.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.320
 And probably some endurance athletes

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.600
 have a similar adaptation

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.360
 that simply makes their tissues more efficient,

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:18.360
 resisting forming the wasteful lactic acid.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:23.800
 Coffee drinking does some similar things,

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.440
 simply increasing the efficiency of the tissue,

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:31.040
 making it able to produce more energy

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.120
 without going over into lactic acid production.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.400
 - Wow, coffee, good old coffee.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.600
 But haven't we often been told over the years

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.400
 that too much exercise or exercise produces lactic acid?

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.880
 That's why the muscles hurt and everything?

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.520
 - Yeah, at low altitude,

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.360
 if a person is starting out with a thyroid problem,

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.240
 a deficient thyroid function,

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.880
 they are already producing too much lactic acid

00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.040
 just at rest.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:05.840
 And so the lower your thyroid function is,

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.720
 the lower the threshold is

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:11.240
 for going over into lactic acid production.

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:15.440
 And so when your thyroid is high,

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.940
 you're in effect living at a high altitude.

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.760
 People going to a high altitude,

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:26.760
 the T3 active thyroid hormone rises considerably.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:33.240
 And that's part of the ability to do full amount of work

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:37.480
 without producing lactic acid.

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.640
 But both high altitude and good thyroid function

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:47.640
 and certain types of chronic adaptation can produce that.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.080
 - And to recap, when you see a TSH,

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:56.240
 what number, if you were kind of looking at it,

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.240
 that you would like to see?

00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.080
 - .001.

00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:04.720
 - Whoa, whoa, really?

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.960
 - It's okay if it's .1.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.680
 - You're not talking about one, two, or three,

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.520
 you're talking about .00.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:17.400
 - Yeah, a large population was surveyed

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:22.200
 to see how many thyroid cancers there were

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.640
 and what the TSH in the population was.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.640
 The populations that had 0.4 and down,

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.240
 0.4 was the highest in the group,

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.680
 they were essentially free of thyroid cancer.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.600
 - So, but I mean, these tests don't even go to decimals.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.280
 The lowest they go is one, right?

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.240
 - Oh no, they're new tests that go out to three points.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.680
 - Oh really? - Three decimal points.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.040
 - You could ask for a test and say,

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.400
 "I wanna see the decimals on this baby."

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.400
 - Oh yeah, I think they, as a rule, are doing that now.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.680
 - But even general than a TSH of two, three, or four,

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.640
 you're suggesting that folks--

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.840
 - Yeah, I've never seen anyone who was free of symptoms

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.040
 who had a 2.0 or--

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.480
 - Or higher.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:19.480
 - Or higher, yeah, but very few people at 1.5

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.440
 are really fully functioning.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.520
 - And what are some of the symptoms of,

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.440
 say a two or a three TSH would be?

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:34.520
 - Some kind of inflammatory problem somewhere in the system.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.600
 - Could be insomnia?

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.120
 - Oh sure, yeah. - Oh yeah, sure.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.080
 So you don't wanna get one of those full-fledged

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.840
 little piggy thyroid desiccated and start slow and work up

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.840
 and see if you can get rid of that,

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.080
 whatever symptoms you have,

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.440
 is in general what you recommend?

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.520
 - Yeah, good general nutrition

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.600
 where you're not getting too much phosphate

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:01.600
 but are getting at least 80 to 100 grams of protein per day.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.160
 - 80 to 100 of protein?

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.080
 But milk gives you the phosphate.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.280
 - Yeah, milk gives you the phosphate

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.240
 but in proportion to calcium and magnesium.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.080
 - I see.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.760
 - And so if you drink three quarts of milk,

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.440
 you're getting an adequate amount of protein

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.480
 just from the milk.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.200
 - Dr. Pete, I've been diagnosed

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.160
 with supraventricular tachycardia,

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.120
 pulse of 200 beats, wow, almost instantly,

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.280
 ablation recommended.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.680
 I'm in my early 80s,

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:39.040
 just finished cervical cancer treatment,

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.240
 five weeks radiation, five doses of chemo.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.280
 Exammed by oncologist two months ago,

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.520
 received no visible signs of cancer.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.960
 Can you give me some advice on what I can do

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.440
 to balance things out?

01:02:54.440 --> 01:03:00.120
 - Checking vitamin D would be the very first thing

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.560
 because if your vitamin D is low,

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:07.280
 you're subject to the excitatory effects of phosphate.

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.200
 And checking the amount of calcium and magnesium

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.000
 in your diet along with the vitamin D,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.280
 those are the heart-stabilizing nutrients,

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.680
 most important one,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.680
 and selenium from seafoods in particular.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:31.120
 One good meal of seafood per week

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.120
 will provide the required selenium.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
 And that lets your tissues form the thyroid hormone.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.400
 Your T4 in circulation might be adequate,

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.760
 but without selenium,

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:55.760
 the individual tissues won't be able to produce the T3

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:02.240
 that they need, for example, for the heart metabolism.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:07.240
 And avoiding a salt-deficient diet

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.080
 goes right along with getting enough calcium.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:17.040
 40 years ago, the dogma was that high blood pressure

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.960
 went with high sodium intake,

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.520
 but a researcher named McCarran

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.640
 looked at the diets more carefully

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.440
 and showed that a calcium deficiency

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.480
 was the problem,

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:39.480
 and that the people with hypertension

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:44.760
 were actually deficient in both calcium and sodium.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.640
 - And deficient, yeah.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.680
 Are the docs still doing that whole low-self thing?

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.760
 Is that still going around, I guess?

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.720
 - I keep hearing it occasionally.

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.600
 Not as bad as it used to be.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:59.800
 - Here's a recent blood test from Trent

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.880
 indicates his estradiol is 15.1 PGM/ML.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.080
 What is the optimum estrogen blood level

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.560
 for a 70-year-old male, and do men need estrogen?

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.640
 Do you recommend nutrient prescription drugs

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.040
 to block estrogen?

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.880
 - No, that's a very fine, low estrogen.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.880
 Typically, aging men get more and more estrogen,

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.880
 but 15 PGM/ML is good.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.080
 - That's okay.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:36.920
 Here's one for you.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.680
 I've seen mixed studies about the damage caused

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.240
 by cooking food in a microwave oven,

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.880
 particularly the proteins becoming allergic.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.920
 What does Dr. Peek think about microwave ovens?

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:53.920
 - It causes the same changes that boiling your meat does,

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.720
 and it has the virtue of

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.440
 not tending to scorch things on the outside

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:06.680
 like a baking oven would.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.400
 So I think on average,

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.820
 the nutrients are safer by microwave,

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:17.720
 but it just doesn't taste as good.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.080
 - Yeah, so the nutrients are actually more with microwave

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.080
 than they are boiling,

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.840
 but not with cooking properly, though.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.200
 - No. - No.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.600
 Plus, there's a lot of EMFs that come out.

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.720
 I don't know if you've ever put one of those to the email

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.440
 or one of those RF meters on 10 feet from a microwave.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:44.480
 - Yeah, the old microwave used to put out a huge field, but--

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.400
 - Are they better now?

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:50.320
 - Yeah, they're safe about three or four feet away.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.040
 - Ah, here's an email.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.280
 Numerous recent guests on Patrick's show

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:58.440
 have stated that it is microscopic parasites, potentially,

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.740
 that cause unhealthy calcification of the tissues,

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:04.020
 like toxoplasmosis,

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.280
 contributing to calcification in the brain.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.560
 Are there any remedies Dr. Ray can recommend

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.400
 for eliminating these little tiny parasites,

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.120
 repairing the damage they can cause?

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.240
 - Just getting your immune system revved up,

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:23.120
 keeping your body temperature up around 98.6 in the daytime,

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.360
 and your oxidative metabolism going well.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.840
 The immune system can take care of those.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.360
 - So running around after, say, I do my show

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:34.660
 and I go outside and whatever,

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:37.340
 and then just do my body temperature,

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:41.440
 in that case, it should be around 98.6 or so.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.020
 That would be the ideal?

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.680
 - If you're active and walking around,

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.280
 your muscles provide the heat to keep you up there.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.000
 - And then what about first thing in the morning, though?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.200
 - Oh, it's okay to be cool during the night.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.300
 - Lower, I mean, that makes sense, right.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.280
 Dr. Ray, Pete talks about red light,

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.320
 but what does he think about colors on the walls

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.840
 and all of these kinds of things, blue and green?

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.000
 Do they provide any more happiness for us,

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.800
 colors on the walls?

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.920
 - Oh, sure.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.600
 Bright lights are essential

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.160
 avoiding gloom,

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.360
 but colors make it more interesting,

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.680
 not just the brightness.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.640
 - Dr. Ray, Pete is with us.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.280
 We'll do a few more here before we let him go.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.120
 Are there any good safe spices, writes an emailer.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.000
 Safe spices.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
 - Oh, yeah, they all have their toxic levels.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.320
 - Do they?

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.360
 - Some of them are so tasty, like chili.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.600
 Chili pepper has, the spice can burn you

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.680
 and cause serious damage and probably stomach cancer

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.680
 if you eat the hot chilies.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.720
 - Too many of them.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.000
 - Too, in excess,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
 but clove is a pretty safe spice.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.760
 Cinnamon, pepper, black pepper.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.600
 - Black pepper.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.920
 Can you please ask Dr. Pete from Amy in San Diego

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.000
 about ingesting chlorella powder, spirulina powder,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.400
 charcoal, diatomaceous earth, if no fillers,

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.840
 is it still a good way to?

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:37.240
 - No, I think all of them have their potential risks.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.000
 - You don't like the chlorella, spirulina, none of those?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.640
 - No, because occasionally they have been found

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.240
 to be contaminated with toxins.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.240
 - If they were clean, would you be okay with them?

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:56.240
 - Yeah, if somehow you could have each batch tested.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.800
 - Good luck with that.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.440
 Here's an email from Europe.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.120
 In the past half year, I have started putting sugar

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.840
 in coffee and also greatly increased intake

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.280
 of freshly processed OJ.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.240
 For me, it means, it seems to have increased dental cavities.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.080
 Wow, a recent visit to the dentist

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.080
 resulted in a great disappointment.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.960
 How do we find strength and confidence

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.800
 in adopting Dr. Pete's recommendation

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.760
 of not being afraid of sugar and fruit juices,

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.760
 especially when everyone else is convinced

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.560
 that sugar destroys the teeth?

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:36.560
 - Well, it's good to rinse your mouth after every intake.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.560
 - Because of the acidity on the, yeah.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.400
 - Yeah.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.880
 - And I think it would also have to do a lot

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.040
 with the other balances of the minerals, wouldn't it?

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:52.040
 - Oh yeah, the quality of your saliva

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.120
 varies according to your hormones.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.720
 And some cavities start inside the teeth

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.800
 when you're under stress.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:03.400
 They're called stress cavities

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:08.400
 because the tooth removes minerals under stress.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.000
 - This is from Kristen.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
 A desiccated thyroid for autoimmune thyroiditis.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.120
 Is bovine okay or does it want to be derived from pig?

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.280
 - No, both of them are good.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.720
 - Both of them are good?

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.560
 - Mm-hmm.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.760
 - Okay, so please ask Dr. Ray Pete if A2 milk is good.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.600
 If it's a store-bought and has a natural protein.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.640
 I like it warm at night and less tummy discomfort.

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.080
 They actually sell A2 milk.

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.120
 I saw it at the store, but I don't think it's,

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.160
 I've never seen one where it's antibiotic-free

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.840
 and stuff like that.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.800
 - I tried that kind for two or three months.

01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.640
 - Did you?

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.240
 - And it was okay, but they didn't have it in 1%,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.840
 only 2%, so I like the low-fat milk.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.000
 - But I thought that's good for milk, right?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.280
 - Yeah, I think 1% is okay.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.360
 - Does Dr. Ray Pete have any suggestions

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.280
 for reversing lactic acidosis,

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:15.400
 juicing, baking soda, lower fat intake?

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.560
 - Yep, both of those.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.840
 - All those?

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.000
 - Good thyroid function, vitamin D.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:29.400
 - What does Dr. Ray Pete think of She-la-git?

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.000
 - What was the word?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.840
 - She-la-git.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.040
 Oh, that's a mineral from Siberia, I think.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.640
 - Yeah, somewhere like that.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.280
 - Yeah, I don't know anything directly about it,

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.320
 just what I've read.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:50.600
 - I think the Amazon man is here again.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.400
 They just come any time, and my dog is barking a little bit,

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.000
 but it's time to go anyway.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.800
 Well, Dr. Pete, what are you gonna do over the holidays?

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.400
 Anything special?

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.040
 - Nope, just keep working.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.200
 - Keep working, yeah.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.320
 Do you travel much anymore?

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.640
 Have you ever, when's the last time

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.360
 you've been down to Mexico?

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.440
 - Oh, years ago.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:09.680
 - Uh-huh, you don't have any desire

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.400
 to go back and visit at all?

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.920
 - Oh yeah, I'm ready to go anytime I please.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:19.480
 - There's some really beautiful parts of Mexico,

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.320
 isn't there, really?

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:21.160
 - Oh yeah, yep.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:23.560
 - Phew, man, that they don't have banditos.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.240
 You just gotta be careful where you go these days.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:27.120
 - Yeah.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.200
 - Well, Dr. Ray Pete, thanks so much for being here.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.240
 Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.280
 and we will see you in January,

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.080
 and we'll have all the information

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.880
 on your website on our show page for you.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:39.960
 - Okay, thank you.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.840
 - Thank you, appreciate it, bye.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.680

 Who's out there, Doodle?

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.300
 Who is out there?

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.120
 Was there somebody at the door?

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.400
 Oh, it's probably just the Amazon man.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.260
 They just come, anytime.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.000
 The Amazon man, he just comes.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.680
 All right.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.400
 Well, kids, we'll see you tomorrow.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.560
 I'm not sure what's going on tomorrow.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.840
 It's just kind of up in the air.

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:12.960
 We may move Dr. Massey to tomorrow, and I don't know.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.320
 So it's up in the air, but we will see you tomorrow

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.440
 at nine o'clock Central Time.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.120

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.720

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:28.640

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.160
 and stuff like that, that always helps spread the word

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.840
 about our show, please let us know about some guests

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.480

 So we'll see you tomorrow morning at nine o'clock,

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.160
 and it'll probably just be a surprise of who we'll have on.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.160
 Okay, I love you all very much,

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.480
