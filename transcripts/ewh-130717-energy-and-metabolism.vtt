00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Need one more reason why your Safeway store is just better?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.100
 How about free Cuisinart Classic Cutlery or Elite Flatware?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.700
 That's right! For every $10 you spend, earn a free stamp saver you can redeem for Cuisinart items.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.800
 Once you've collected between 30 and 60 stamps, you can start shopping for a variety of Cuisinart cutlery or flatware,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.700
 available at the in-store display.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.000
 Present your items and stamp saver at checkout.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 It's simple. Spend $10, get your free stamp saver, start collecting.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
 Safeway. It's just better.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
 Love Talk Radio

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:44.700
 You're listening to Holistic Living, brought to you by EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 And now, here are your hosts, Josh and Jeanne Rubin.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 Holistic Living

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 Welcome everyone to our new episode of Holistic Living.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.500
 Today is July 17th, 2013 and today we luckily are getting Ray Peate back on our show.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 It's been a while. It's been a lot of pastoring and begging to get him back on the show.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 We finally got him on. He's a busy guy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 Today we're going to be talking about energy metabolism.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 It's going to be a 60-minute show. We're going to try to keep it as simple and efficient as possible.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.500
 We will be taking callers.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 Love Talk is having some technical difficulties with my call right now.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.500
 So, I'm not showing a calling number.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 The typical calling number that we use is 347-426-3546.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 If you call that number, it says there's no show scheduled.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 So, I'm having some technical difficulties because this is how we get Ray on the show.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.000
 So, just bear with me for the next minute or two.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.500
 Hopefully, he pops up. Jeanne pops up as well.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 So, we can get them both on the show and get the show rolling.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 I guess I'll take care of some announcements or just FYI type of information.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.500
 Of course, if you're interested in learning more about us, of course, you're calling in to learn about Ray Peat.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.500
 First, of course, if you want to learn more about Ray's work, you can visit his website at RayPeat.com.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.500
 R-A-Y-P-E-E-T.com.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500
 I'll give you a little background on him for those of you who don't know who he is.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
 We've interviewed him many times.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
 If you go to our website, EastWestHealing.com.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.500
 Hold on one second, guys.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.500
 I need to refresh this. I just got a message from BlogTalk. I apologize.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.500
 Bear with me.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.500
 The calling number, once again, it's actually different.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 It's not the number that I gave you.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.500
 It's 760-454-1100.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 Once again, 760-454-1100.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 We will be taking callers. Be patient. I want Ray to be able to answer the questions.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.500
 I just sent you the numbers so this will be going on soon.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 If you want to learn more about Ray, go to his website, RayPeat.com.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.500
 He's got great articles. He sells his books. I think three or four or five books.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.500
 On hormones, gestures, and women in nutrition and things like that.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.500
 He's got a quarterly newsletter that I highly recommend you signing up for.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 Ray got his PhD in biology from the University of Oregon with a specialization in physiology.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.500
 He's taught in many schools from the University of Oregon to Montana State University

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.500
 and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine and many others.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
 He also does private nutritional counseling.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500
 He started his work with progesterone and related hormones in 1968.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.500
 Since then, he's done more research and published more articles, of course, which he shares on his website.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.500
 I'm going to ask Ray if he wants to introduce himself and add to that.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.500
 If you want to learn more about us, you can go to our website, EastWestHealing.com.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 I was talking about our website.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500
 On the top, you'll find the fifth link.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.500
 It says Ray P. We have a list of a lot of the shows that we've done, past shows from other people, etc.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.500
 There's a list that's being shared on the Internet.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 They're actually on this page. You can listen to them all, download them all, and share them.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.500
 We don't own them.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.500
 Myself and my wife, we do nutritional counseling with clients all over the world, actually, through Skype.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.500
 We have a cookbook, a Med Evolve Blueprint cookbook, that's on our website that's based on Ray's philosophy,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 as well as an online educational program that is PDFs, audios, and live calls bi-weekly.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.500
 It's an online educational program called the Med Evolve Blueprint.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.500
 You can take a look at that on our website as well.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.500
 Of course, you can follow us on Twitter, you can follow us on YouTube, you can follow us on Facebook,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.500
 all that fun and annoying social media stuff that's out there.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.500
 So, there they are. Let me get them actually on here, because I'm getting sick of hearing myself.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 Can you hear?

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500
 Yes, hello.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500
 Oh, hey.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.500
 Yes, we're both on.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.500
 Okay. How's it going, Ray?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500
 Oh, very good.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500
 Good.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.500
 Well, I did a small introduction for yourself, just the basics of who you are, what you've done, what you've taught.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.500
 Is there anything you might want to add about yourself in regards to, you know,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.500
 I don't know, maybe what you're working on or just anything about your history that you want to let people know about?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:06.500
 Right at the moment, I've been working on some of the similarities of the different organs.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:17.500
 Recent newsletters were on the heart and the typical solid tumor as an organ,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.500
 having some of the properties of other organs during stress.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:30.500
 And currently, I'm working on both the lens of the eye and the brain

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:39.500
 because they express some of those same properties of the failing heart and of tumor physiology.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:46.500
 You see some of the same processes showing up in such different places

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:58.500
 and trying to generalize things so that various treatments and diets and programs and such don't seem arbitrary,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.500
 so you can see what's in common.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.500
 Right.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.500
 Do you want to tell people how they can get your quarterly newsletter?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.500
 Oh, yes.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:20.500
 It's for, in the United States, a two-year subscription, bi-monthly, 12 issues, is $28.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.500
 And outside of North America, it's $48.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.500
 And they just email you through your website?

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.500
 Yes, or post office box 5764 Eugene 97405.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.500
 Great. And we highly recommend it, guys, for anyone wanting to learn

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.500
 and really pass through a lot of illusions that are out there when it comes to physiology.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.500
 We've been studying Ray's work and getting these newsletters for a long time.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.500
 It's really benefited us personally as well as professionally in working with ourselves and clients.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.500
 So we highly recommend it.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.500
 So let's move on to the show.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.500
 Today we're going to be talking about NAK metabolism, kind of talk about a mishmash of topics.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.500
 And we'll take some callers if people have questions.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.500
 Once again, the phone number is 760-454-1100.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:20.500
 So I guess the first topic would be the body's alternative energy sources.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.500
 A lot of people talk about macronutrients and you have all these diets out there.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.500
 Everyone says high protein is good or high fat is good or high carb is good.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.500
 And I think we all agree that all macronutrients are important.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.500
 Of course, we all have different views on how much of one or the other we need.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.500
 But I guess we can kind of rewind it a little bit and maybe you can talk about, from your perspective,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.500
 because you mentioned it on your site, in talking about the cells and talking about metabolism,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500
 and why it's so important when we talk about energy.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:07.500
 Well, one of the things I've been interested in for a long time is the function of carbon dioxide in cells.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:23.500
 And in some observations, people have seen that the most improbable organism is unable to live without carbon dioxide,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.500
 even though they can live without oxygen.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:33.500
 And ordinarily, we think of oxygen turning into carbon dioxide as a waste product,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:40.500
 but it really seems to be even more essential for life than oxygen.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:49.500
 And carbohydrates are a very good source of carbon dioxide.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:56.500
 They oxidize and produce a lot of carbon dioxide.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:07.500
 And if carbon dioxide is that essential to life, then obviously the best food to produce it is going to be carbohydrates.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:20.500
 In these recent newsletters, I've been pointing out some of the things that are becoming fairly common knowledge now.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:28.500
 The failing heart, for example. Well, if you just look at what happens when you exercise,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:39.500
 when you're sitting at rest, the quiet muscle burns almost pure sugar and oxygen, pure glucose and oxygen.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:45.500
 But as soon as it starts exercising, it shifts over to fat oxidation.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:55.500
 And at maximum exercise, it's burning mostly fat and very little oxygen, very little sugar.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:04.500
 But it's producing quite a bit of lactic acid because it's wasting sugar.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:16.500
 It's burning the fat pretty thoroughly, but it's wasting the sugar and turning it over into lactic acid.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:23.500
 The failing heart does the same thing. It's exerting its maximum,

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:32.500
 and in doing that, it's burning fatty acids primarily rather than sugar.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:45.500
 This process in general of substituting fat burning for sugar burning was called by P.J. Randall a cycle.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:53.500
 It isn't really a cycle, but now it's called the Randall cycle, which means that if you burn fatty acids,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:59.500
 that stops your burning glucose, oxidizing glucose.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.500
 Instead, you're turning it into lactic acid.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:14.500
 And diabetes consists of living on fatty acids and not being able to oxidize glucose,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:22.500
 but still turning glucose into lactic acid so that lactic acidemia becomes a problem in diabetes.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:30.500
 Now, obviously, to make lactic acid out of glucose, it has to get into the cells.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:41.500
 So this whole thing of transporting glucose into the cell, being where the failure comes in heart failure or diabetes or whatever,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:49.500
 just isn't the case because if you're making lactic acid, obviously the sugar is getting into the cell.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.500
 But something goes wrong in the oxidation process,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:02.500
 and the cell begins to favor the oxidation of fat rather than glucose,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.500
 and that doesn't produce as much carbon dioxide,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:18.500
 and that seems to be a basic problem for the cell that leads it down the path of reduced function

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.500
 or so-called non-survival.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.500
 And a very similar thing happens in cancer cells.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:37.500
 They begin turning glucose, if not into lactic acid, then on into fat, and then they oxidize the fat.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:44.500
 And in treating heart disease, over the last five years or so,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:53.500
 there's been quite a movement towards thinking of ways to stop the oxidation of fatty acids,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:14:03.500
 allowing the heart to avoid the Randall cycle and get back to oxidizing glucose instead of turning it into lactic acid.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:10.500
 So, just based on what you said, which is great information,

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:17.500
 I guess, for the listeners, when you talk about how the cells or the muscles are using primarily fat,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:25.500
 and you talked about foods, how carbohydrates are the most important because they increase the production of energy, which is CO2,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.500
 can you define when you say carbohydrates what you mean by that, and then clarify,

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.500
 because some people are going to hear that and maybe think, "What are you talking about eating a high-fat diet

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.500
 because our bodies are using fat for energy?" Can you clarify on that a little bit?

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:51.500
 Well, we can turn protein into both sugar and fat equivalent.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:15:00.500
 So, when you're talking about energy, you have to consider that some of it might come from protein.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:09.500
 But in the case of oxidizing protein, that's very wasteful besides being expensive.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:18.500
 It produces a lot of waste material, ammonia, for example, and it turns on machinery,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.500
 which resembles the stress reaction.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:29.500
 When we're in stress, we break down protein and turn it into energy materials.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:42.500
 But the mechanism of oxidizing fat somewhat gets into the process of creating stress,

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:52.500
 especially the polyunsaturated fatty acids activate the same stress metabolites,

00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:00.500
 which are the expensive enzymes that burning too much protein will activate.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:13.500
 By carbohydrate, people generally mean both starches and sugars.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:22.500
 It's simply anything that's made up of that same proportion of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.500
 And starches are just long chains of sugars.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:38.500
 But in the case of most of the food starches, they're composed of pure glucose molecules.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:46.500
 And so when you're getting energy from starch, you're really burning pure glucose.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:58.500
 And sucrose, the standard table sugar, that's also the main sugar of sweet fruits.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:04.500
 And it consists of only half glucose and half fructose.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:15.500
 And fructose happens to be able to metabolize without relying on the use of insulin.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:24.500
 And so it has been used for feeding diabetics and for avoiding some of the stresses

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:30.500
 produced by the ups and downs of the insulin reactions.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:41.500
 So getting the right amount of carbohydrates in relation to protein and fat is one way to basically increase glucose oxidation.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.500
 And if you're relying on fat, then you're inhibiting glucose oxidation, is really what you're saying in a simplistic sense.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:56.500
 Correct. And fructose and glucose, assuming you're eating a sugar such as fruits.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.500
 Right. Right.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.500
 Now going with CO2 and talking about oxygen and things like that,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:14.500
 we talk about antioxidants and what antioxidants are and how they allow oxygen to be used productively rather than destructively.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.500
 Actually, someone quoting you.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:22.500
 So we can say CO2 is an antioxidant, right, and not so much all these supplements out there.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:28.500
 We could say the carbohydrates that you recommend like the tropical fruits and the root vegetables are antioxidants.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:37.500
 Are there more specific examples you could give in regards to antioxidants to help with the production of CO2 for the listeners?

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:54.500
 Well, running the oxidative process through the mitochondria very fast happens to be an anti-oxidative process in terms of avoiding toxic free radicals.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:01.500
 And so the faster you burn oxygen usefully, oxidizing sugars,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:09.500
 the less you have to worry about taking care of the free radical toxic products

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:19.500
 that really develop when you slow down the respiratory process of burning fats and especially polyunsaturated fats.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:30.500
 Vitamin E and vitamin C and uric acid, which is produced in our body, is a major antioxidant.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:45.500
 But the marketing of the idea of antioxidants has created a big confusion in the area.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:55.500
 The antioxidants in our body have to fit together with uric acid, which is naturally there,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:01.500
 and the enzymes which naturally break down free radicals.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:14.500
 And if you put things in that don't fit, an apparent antioxidant in a test tube can become a pro-oxidant in the body.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:23.500
 So things have to fit together so that vitamin A and vitamin E lock together,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:29.500
 and vitamin E and vitamin C lock together, uric acid and vitamin C lock together,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:46.500
 and the glucose and other sugars have to be streaming through the systems of enzymes turning into carbon dioxide.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.500
 Carbon dioxide has to be flowing out of the cell properly.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:21:05.500
 The whole antioxidant system is really one piece, and if you try to stuff in any super antioxidants like they're selling as health products,

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:11.500
 you're likely to create more oxidation than you had without it.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:24.500
 A recent publication saw that cataracts are twice as common in men over the age of 65

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:35.500
 who took big supplements of vitamin E and vitamin C, almost doubled their rate of cataracts.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.500
 So when you talk about, you know, I talk to clients a lot about this,

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.500
 when you talk about, you know, you talk about like progesterone, you talk about vitamin E, vitamin C,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:51.500
 and you're talking about all the benefits of it, are you talking more from a food sense, a macronutrient sense,

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.500
 or are you talking more from a supplemental sense?

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:13.500
 Well, the vitamin E in particular has a peculiar history that it started out in the 1930s being called a fertility drug, a fertility nutrient.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:28.500
 And the Schutz family of doctors studied it in treating women with clotting problems and fertility problems both.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:39.500
 And they saw that it prevented abnormal clotting, which is a feature of excess estrogen.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:47.500
 Estrogen has many problem side effects when it's excessive and unopposed.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:23:00.500
 And the Schutz and others in the 1930s saw that vitamin E restored fertility and prevented heart disease by functioning as an anti-estrogen.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:17.500
 And around that same time, the polyunsaturated fats were being seen to have estrogen-like effects and to cause clotting circulatory problems.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:26.500
 And animals that were fed on a high polyunsaturated fat diet were sterile.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:38.500
 And the various forces such as the estrogen industry didn't want estrogen associated with sterility and heart disease.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:48.500
 And various pressures turned vitamin E into an antioxidant rather than an anti-estrogenic material.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:57.500
 So by 1950, the whole history of vitamin E had been turned into an antioxidant.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:19.500
 So I don't see it as primarily an antioxidant. I see it as anti-inflammatory and anti-estrogenic with this potential side effect of protecting against free radicals if it's in the right concentration and balanced with other chemicals.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:28.500
 So in a sense, because estrogen creates that hypoxic environment at the cell level, correct?

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:36.500
 Where vitamin E does the opposite. You're saying it's almost like an antioxidant. It allows oxygen to be used more efficiently at the cell level.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.500
 So in a sense, because of that, it's anti-estrogen.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:52.500
 Yeah, both estrogen and anything that creates inflammation wastes oxygen and tends to lead to lactic acid production.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:25:04.500
 And vitamin E by stopping the inflammation and estrogen effect is also making more oxygen available and reducing the lactic acid problem.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:12.500
 Now going with estrogens and some of the next topics and questions that kind of correlated with that,

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.500
 and we're talking about ourselves, and we talked about pre-fatty acids.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:23.500
 Can you talk a little bit about, you know, I know it's a huge topic and how it can cause a sluggish liver.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:31.500
 It can be recirculated to the body and inhibit T4 to T3 conversion, cause a hypoxic environment at the cell level, leads with DNA, etc.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:41.500
 Can you talk a little bit about that in regards to pre-fatty acid production, cell metabolism, and the thyroid, you know, in regards to energy production a little bit more in depth?

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:55.500
 Yeah, thyroid is the hormone that activates our whole oxidative system and leads to the production of carbon dioxide when it's working properly.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:07.500
 And estrogen, besides working at the cell level to waste oxygen, happens to block the enzymes that secrete thyroid hormone.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:29.500
 The fatty acids that are saturated happen to oxidize with fair safety. The polyunsaturated fatty acids are the ones that are more likely to break down and produce free radicals.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:39.500
 Cells distinguish between these two types of fatty acids and prefer to oxidize the saturated fats.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:53.500
 That means that any time you eat a little bit of excess unsaturated fat, it primarily goes into storage because the cells prefer not to oxidize it but to store it instead.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:07.500
 But estrogen prefers those oxygen-wasting free radical-producing fats. It preferentially causes them to be liberated from storage.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:14.500
 So under the influence of estrogen, all of the free fatty acids increase.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:30.500
 Women have on average higher level of free fatty acids circulating but preferentially estrogen brings the polyunsaturated fats out of storage, especially the very long chain polyunsaturated.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:46.500
 And these are the ones that most interfere with other levels of thyroid function, not just the secretion which estrogen directly does but with the transport and metabolism of the thyroid hormone.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:28:01.500
 So at many levels, estrogen and the polyunsaturated fats are working together to inhibit the function of the thyroid hormone and the oxidative system.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:20.500
 Does that also have to do with estrogen-wasting glucose, estrogen stimulating the adrenal cortex, like putting yourself into that kind of sympathetic state, that hypoglycemic state, which as well causes the breakdown of proteins and increases free fatty acids?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.500
 Does it have to do a lot with its function of wasting glucose?

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:39.500
 Estrogen directly stimulates the secretion of insulin and that tends to lower blood sugar and create fat storage if you've eaten more than enough.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:29:03.500
 But it also directly stimulates the adrenal cortex, increasing aldosterone and cortisol and that causes the whole system to go into the emergency reaction process.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:11.500
 The cortisol tends to bring blood sugar up where the insulin tends to lower it.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:35.500
 So the more estrogen is increased and unopposed by protective things such as progesterone, DHEA, pregnenolone and thyroid, then the more system stresses and tendency to failure there are.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.500
 Right.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:48.500
 Now kind of moving forward with estrogen since we're on that topic and we're talking about today endometriosis as well as body temperature.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:59.500
 In one of your articles you talk about the work of Desjardins, D-E-S-J-A-R-D-I-N-S.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.500
 Oh yeah.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:11.500
 And you talk about how estrogen's interactions with unsaturated fats causing damage to the brain cells, increasing free radicals.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:23.500
 And this causes the pituitary to remain chronically active which basically produces a state of constant oestrus.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:37.500
 Now in regards to endometriosis, is that a major factor? What are your thoughts on endometriosis? Is it the unsaturated fats? Is it not enough carbohydrates?

00:30:38.500 --> 00:31:02.500
 Desjardins and his group were interested in many of the side effects of estrogen on the brain, not just the effects on the pituitary but the endorphins, the effects of iron accumulation and the fatty acids and their interactions.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:23.500
 And the liver is, because of the estrogen thyroid effects and the constant pushing up of the growth hormone in particular from the pituitary, the liver from an early age is feminized.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:38.500
 And this shows up in studies of liver transplant plants from female donors to male donors and male donors to female donors and various combinations.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:32:08.500
 And they found that apparently because of this process of stress hormones and the growth hormone feminizing women's livers, they make poor candidates relative to the livers of men for transplant and the women have more trouble receiving liver transplant because of estrogen's interaction with the thyroid.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:14.500
 The thyroid and liver causing stress for both of the organs.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:25.500
 So you're saying basically endometriosis is more of the inability to detoxify this excess estrogen versus a low progesterone?

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:40.500
 Yeah, it involves the liver and the pituitary but estrogen is very central to the actual lesion or abnormal tissue of endometriosis.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:57.500
 Simply by reducing estrogen exposure you can alleviate the symptoms of endometriosis.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:22.500
 So the endometriosis is actually what causes the endometrial tissue to be or express the enzyme aromatase which manufactured estrogen which they used to think existed only in the ovary then it turned out to exist in fat cells, breast cells, skin cells, bone and muscle, everywhere that's under stress will begin to produce estrogen molecules.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.500
 And that happens in the endometrial tissue.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:50.500
 It should be exposed to estrogen for only about 12 hours each month and then progesterone should surge up to 50 or 100 times higher concentration and cause the cells to give up their production of estrogen and release what they had.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:34:20.500
 But instead of that the aromatase keeps churning out estrogen and the estrogen excites the tissue turns on the cyclooxygenase enzyme which turns polyunsaturated fatty acids into prostaglandins creating inflammation that causes the pain contractions and all of the symptoms.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:34.500
 And the inflammation from the prostaglandin in turn creates more aromatase and so it gets a vicious cycle going.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:52.500
 And the simplest most physiological way to stop it is to eat a diet with adequate protein and sugar and trace minerals and vitamins but to make sure your thyroid is functioning.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:35:11.500
 I've seen people who had been constantly for months or years suffering painful endometriosis who in two or three days completely stopped the symptoms permanently just with quick acting thyroid and a good diet.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:26.500
 And aspirin or other blockers of prostaglandin production all by themselves can greatly reduce the formation of estrogen and break the cycle.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:48.500
 Can you talk about how polyunsaturated fats actually activate aromatase enzymes? So you can see that unsaturated fats are estrogenic because they waste vitamin E as well. So for people with endometriosis of course eliminating unsaturated fats will help reduce estrogen production.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.500
 Yes, they're central to endometriosis.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:08.500
 Right. Talking about aromatase enzyme, you talked about before, but correct me if I'm wrong, how aspirin therapy actually inhibits aromatase enzyme and actually can upregulate energy production. Can you elaborate a little bit more on aspirin therapy?

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:37.500
 Yes. In cancers, bowel or breast or whatever, the cells that are stressed begin to produce estrogen and the estrogen in the other tissues no matter what it is, as long as there's polyunsaturated fat available, the estrogen is going to activate the cyclooxygenase enzyme that makes prostaglandins

00:36:38.500 --> 00:37:04.500
 and keep the aromatase active producing more estrogen. So even if you aren't eating it currently, the polyunsaturated fat that was incorporated into your tissues is going to break down under stress, flow into the bloodstream and feed the production of estrogen, whatever tissue it's in,

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:11.500
 but especially in the irritated, inflamed cancerous tissue.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.500
 Okay.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:37.500
 Sugar is one of the things that can reduce the flow out of your tissues of the polyunsaturated fats into your bloodstream. Niacinamide is another thing that simply limits the release of these fatty acids from the tissues.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:45.500
 So both sugar and niacinamide back up the function of aspirin.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:56.500
 So people suffering with endometriosis, it would be like getting the right amount of carbs, regulating your thyroid, using niacinamide and possibly asthma therapy?

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.500
 Yes.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:08.500
 Now we'll go a little bit more with estrogen since we're on that topic and we're talking about body temperature and pulse, which we'll talk about a little bit more.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:23.500
 What is estrogen's role playing in this, you know, since we're on the topic of endometriosis as well? Because you talked about how estrogen increases heat loss, you know, and how it can stimulate nitric oxide, you know, and lead to vasodilation and all those things.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:30.500
 How does that, you know, maybe you can correlate that a little bit with body temperature and pulse in endometriosis?

00:38:31.500 --> 00:39:00.500
 Yeah, even though estrogen is turning on the stress hormones and the stress hormones tend to protect the body temperature, at a certain point of estrogen dominance, even the adrenaline, which tends to tighten up blood vessels in the skin and make your hands and feet cold to keep the brain and heart temperature up for the function,

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:24.500
 and the cortisol, which should keep churning your tissues over producing heat, even those aren't enough to keep your body warm and so your temperature falls after a certain total exposure to unopposed estrogen.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:50.500
 And the reason progesterone and thyroid, progesterone all by itself without driving the oxidative process, can drastically and quickly increase your temperature while at the same time lowering the stress hormones that normally keep your temperature up in an emergency.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:40:04.500
 The progesterone is blocking the estrogen's effect, simply letting you return to a more normal set point in your temperature.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:21.500
 In doing that, it stops these mechanisms that cause flushing such as nitric oxide that causes vasodilation and turning red and feeling hot, which causes the falling temperature.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:29.500
 There's actually a caller. Do you mind taking a question from a caller?

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.500
 Okay.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.500
 Go ahead, 417. You're on the air.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.500
 Yes, this is David, and thank you for having this show.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.500
 I hope this question makes sense here. I'm going to try to formulate this the best I can.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:41:01.500
 I remember reading about the Lewis and Clark expedition, and Lewis and Clark were offered, and their team were offered salmon by the Northwestern Indians, and they just did not want to eat that.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:10.500
 They'd been eating elk and deer and different ruminants and obviously were almost repulsed by the taste of the salmon.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:19.500
 My question is just about human physiology in general and about the polyunsaturated fats and about saturated fats.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:39.500
 Number one, how are these tribes, and I know we don't know a whole lot about their health in general, but how is a tribe like these Northwestern Indian tribes surviving and possibly even thriving off of living off of salmon as maybe their main protein, even though that may not be exactly true?

00:41:42.500 --> 00:42:10.500
 And is it possible that they have learned how to balance certain plants and sugars in these polyunsaturated fats and maybe even, you know, because they're maybe not storing too many of these polyunsaturated fats and maybe because they're not living in too stressful of an environment like we are in this modern age, that somehow they're able to thrive off of those types of foods?

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:17.500
 Yeah, the Northwest Indians had a lot of varied foods.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:27.500
 I don't know how much salmon they really ate year-round, but I imagine they dried quite a bit of it.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:45.500
 And various mixtures of bear fat and berries and fruits were very well able to survive travel and storage and such.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:51.500
 And so those were, I think, usual staples among them.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.500
 Is that called pomegranate?

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.500
 Something like that. I forget.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:04.500
 I think I've heard it. And was that fish or was that more of a ruminant saturated fat?

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.500
 All of it I've seen was bear fat.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:17.500
 Yeah, yeah, okay. So that wouldn't actually be even a ruminant fat, would it? Okay. Huh. But that would probably be a pretty saturated fat though, wouldn't it?

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:24.500
 Because bears like to eat a lot of fruit and grass and they aren't primarily carnivores.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:29.500
 When they've looked at their stomach contents, it looked like they were fruit eaters.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:36.500
 Well, and you know, that's the other, that was actually in my list here, kind of, and I hope this is interesting to ask the question.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:40.500
 I don't know. I think it ties things together, hopefully, in an interesting way.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:50.500
 You know, grizzly bear is another animal that, you know, gorges themselves on salmon for a short period of time, and that's probably not very long, but maybe a few months.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:55.500
 And then that may even be closer to the fall. I don't know how that spawning works.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:02.500
 But I know they go into hibernation and I know I've heard, in fact, I think I've heard that on this show way back,

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:09.500
 about talking about how they actually increase their serotonin to go into hibernation.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:17.500
 And that was also tying into the fact that you've got, like, you know, deer here, like where I live in Missouri,

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.500
 and they're ruminants and they're eating acorns, you know, all through the fall.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.500
 And I don't know, you know, they're probably eating grasses and different things.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.500
 And of course, they can convert those things to saturated fat, I know.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.500
 But then you've got squirrels and other rodent-type creatures that are eating all these different nuts and things.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:41.500
 And I just wonder how much that's been studied as far as how that affects their lives and their metabolism and everything.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.500
 The squirrels have been studied pretty well.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:54.500
 And they found that when they kept them from eating the acorn-type, highly unsaturated things in the fall, they didn't hibernate.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.500
 Wow.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:01.500
 Yeah, the PUFA increased the serotonin and put them to sleep.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.500
 And they get even good sleep, typically.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:11.500
 They'll wake up a few times during the winter to sleep normally.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:19.500
 But the serotonin, it's a type of trooper that they like to wake up from and have a sleep.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:26.500
 So, you know, and this may be getting way too deep here, but I keep thinking about all these different things like that,

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:33.500
 and I'm sure reading your books about, you know, it appears that all these different life forms, obviously including humans,

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:39.500
 we've all, you know, we've been placed around the globe in different types of environments and ecosystems.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:45.500
 And we appear to try to make the best of whatever situation we're in with what we have.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:53.500
 Is it possible animals that are hibernating kind of stumble into this polyunsaturated fat thing

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:59.500
 and realize they kind of get into the state that they go, "Well, shoot, I'm just going to go to sleep here for the next few months."

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.500
 It's a lot easier than trying to struggle through it.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.500
 You know what I mean?

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:11.500
 Yeah, I think that's a gradual adaptation to seasonal stress.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:21.500
 That people get depressed in the winter, but they aren't able to spend four or five months sleeping off.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.500
 Yeah, and so that's the other thing.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.500
 Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave, I'm sorry about that.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.500
 I have to cut you off because I've got some other questions from colleagues.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:33.500
 Okay, I'm sorry. I've been talking about this way too long, but anyway.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.500
 Okay, thank you.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.500
 We all could.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.500
 Okay, bye.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.500
 Bye.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.500
 Well, I've got a question from a caller.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:48.500
 They actually just emailed me since we're talking about, you know, the cells and estrogen and all that.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.500
 I'm just wondering your thoughts on, you know, some people say, "Well, I have hot flashes."

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.500
 You know, from your standpoint, we know the mechanism behind them.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.500
 We kind of just talked about it and what estrogen does.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:06.500
 You know, how come some women will get estrogen therapy and it actually eliminates their hot flashes?

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:13.500
 I have a little bit about that in my last newsletter on the hot flashes.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.500
 It's on my website.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:26.500
 I think it just creates a stress that keeps them from experiencing the ups and downs.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:35.500
 So it's almost like maybe then with increased heat loss, they're, you know, have such a key validation

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:42.500
 and taking that excess estrogen kind of just pushes them over the edge and almost like shuts things down?

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:49.500
 Yeah, I think it slows the metabolism enough that they aren't going in and out of the state.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.500
 Okay.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.500
 Okay.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:48:02.500
 Another question, kind of maybe on topic, off topic, I guess we could say, kind of located.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.500
 But it's talking about, here it is.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.500
 I think we've talked about it before on the show, but I'll bring it up again.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:17.500
 If you have mothers out there and their children have their babies, will have colic or eczema or something like that.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:23.500
 So of course the doctor will say, you know, you have food intolerances as a mother.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:29.500
 You know, you can't have beer, you can't have eggs, you can't have berries or melons or whatever it may be because of a lab.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.500
 You know, and that actually benefits the child.

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.500
 You know, what are your thoughts on that?

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:44.500
 How can someone, what's going on there and how can someone work out of that to get to the point where they can eat these beneficial foods?

00:48:44.500 --> 00:49:01.500
 In animal experiments, some people saw that the mildest allergen would produce a deadly allergic reaction if they lowered the blood sugar.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:17.500
 And the mother's system can pass allergens through the milk so that even the baby can experience the interaction of ups and downs of blood sugars and allergens.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:28.500
 But with these animal studies, they found that if they increased the blood sugar artificially, just putting a tube in with some glucose,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:42.500
 the deadliest allergens that had killed normal animals would just cause a little sniffling when they were getting extra glucose pumped into the bloodstream.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:57.500
 But lowering the blood sugar from whatever cause would cause a mild allergen to kill the animal in shock from an allergic reaction releasing histamine and serotonin.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:19.500
 And that I've seen many times in people who used to rush to the hospital for a shot or glucose or something or who carried an adrenaline pen with them for an allergic exposure or a bee bite or something.

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:33.500
 Instead, they would keep a big bottle of Coke in the fridge and drink the Coke quickly as soon as they had the exposure and stop going to the hospital.

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:50.500
 So, if I hear you correctly, what you're saying is that postpartum is more of a hypoglycemic reaction. It's the inability to regulate your blood glucose which is creating these allergens which are passing along.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:51:05.500
 So, if you're able to regulate your blood sugar, and you talk about in that article, how flashes enter DNA genes, how in an experiment, how flashes were found to be increased by lowering blood sugar and decreased by moderately increasing blood sugar.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.500
 Progesterone has a huge part in this in stabilizing blood sugar.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:24.500
 Do you think that it has a role postpartum, having that low progesterone and being hypoglycemic and being estrogen dominant? And if someone was able to regulate their blood sugar and increase thyroid production, it wouldn't so much have to do with the foods?

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.500
 That doing that alone would help them and the baby?

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:57.500
 Yeah, the hormones. Even when a woman has had a very happy pregnancy, sometimes because the pregnancy itself is driving her hormones and keeping things in balance, as soon as she has the baby, there's a letdown in which she discovers her own hypothyroid progesterone deficient state,

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:03.500
 which becomes very excessively estrogen dominated.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:25.500
 And that causes the postpartum depression syndrome along with a whole range of other possible consequences such as rheumatoid arthritis and MS and allergies, seizures and so on.

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:36.500
 Okay. I hope that answers the listener's question. Do you mind taking another question from a caller?

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.500
 Sure, fine.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:44.500
 Caller from 913, you're on the air, if you have a question.

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.500
 913 or 931?

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.500
 Sorry, 931.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.500
 Okay, just wanted to make sure.

00:52:52.500 --> 00:53:07.500
 Hi, this is Carmen Hunter and I've been in communication with Ray by email and he's been more than helpful. Just real briefly, I've been on the Ray P plan with orange juice and food for about 23 days or so.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:20.500
 And within three days of starting the food plan, I was able to actually stop taking my thyroid medicine and my temperatures actually went up and have stayed up and my pulse is actually going up as well.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:28.500
 My question here is, does it take the pulse a little bit longer to follow with temperatures? And if so, what does that mean?

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:36.500
 The temperatures have been 98.1 to 99.2 consistently without a break and rising after food.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:41.500
 So I'm wondering, is the pulse going to follow or what might be going on there?

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.500
 How fast is the pulse?

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:51.500
 The pulse goes anywhere in the morning when I wake up it's about 65 and then through the day it goes up to 85.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:58.500
 It's probably okay. I think 85 is a very good daytime pulse rate.

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:04.500
 Okay, is that consistent? Because it's not every day, it varies.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:18.500
 Yeah, you just should stay alert to possible fluctuations in your stress hormones and thyroid and such, but those numbers sound very good.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:30.500
 Wonderful. Okay, the other question I had briefly is, I went to the doctor yesterday and had all of my labs pulled, the lactic acid and all of the thyroid labs, everything all over again.

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:42.500
 I'm wondering after being off of medication what I can expect with my labs or does it really even matter what they say as long as I feel good and my temperatures and pulse stay the same?

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:49.500
 Well, you want to keep your eye on TSH if you have the opportunity.

00:54:50.500 --> 00:55:02.500
 You don't want it to go too high because it will start creating the symptoms of hypothyroidism.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:09.500
 It creates inflammation and changes your blood viscosity and heart rhythm and so on.

00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:20.500
 So it's safest to keep your TSH down and you can do that usually just by eating a good balanced diet, lots of fruit.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:31.500
 Okay, how high is too high to keep an eye on? The highest my TSH ever was was 3.0 and the joint pain and everything else settled in then.

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:38.500
 And by the way, since eating the way that you recommend or what your sites recommend, my joint pain has completely disappeared.

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:43.500
 Yeah, I would say that 3 is always too high.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.500
 3 is too high, okay.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:56:02.500
 Yeah, and below 1 is where I feel more comfortable with it and in a big population, the freedom from thyroid cancer is best when the TSH is below 0.4.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:09.500
 0.4, okay, great. One last thing and I promise that's it.

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:17.500
 How do you actually get rid of the stored PUFAs? Do we want to limit the release or detox or how do we get rid of them?

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:20.500
 The easiest way to do that besides avoiding them.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:40.500
 That really is a problem. It's worse than storing DDT I think because we do have the ability. The liver can treat them like a poison and excrete them so they pass out through the urine without having to be oxidized.

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:52.500
 If the liver isn't just very well supported, the polyunsaturated fats can block those enzymes in the liver the way estrogen does.

00:56:52.500 --> 00:57:03.500
 So you have to make sure that your liver isn't under stress. Don't go too long without eating or getting rest and so on.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:17.500
 Okay, great. Thank you so much for your time and everything has literally changed my life. I've been to 17 doctors over 13 years and have never felt better than I feel today in the last two and a half weeks.

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:22.500
 So I appreciate you very much and thank you for your time on email and for your interviews.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.500
 Very good.

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.500
 Thank you so much.

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.500
 Thanks for calling in Carmen.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.500
 Alright, bye-bye.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:38.500
 I have one more big question Ray and then we'll let you go because I promise I'll only take up an hour of your time.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:46.500
 Talking about body temperature and pulse, just for the listeners because these people were talking about it.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:51.500
 And this correlates with the question someone sent in for you.

00:57:52.500 --> 00:58:01.500
 What does body temperature and pulse tell us about energy metabolism? Do you find that to be more accurate than a thyroid panel?

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:11.500
 And how long do you recommend taking temper pulse? I know people hyper focus on this because I think Broderbarnes recommended 10 minutes on your armpit.

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.500
 Do you recommend axillaries? Do you recommend orally, etc.?

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:23.500
 As long as you do it in the same way in the same place, it doesn't matter very much.

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:36.500
 The mouth is quicker than the armpit usually and I found that some people had fat armpits and it would take about two hours to get the temperature up through that thick layer of fat.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:49.500
 And then in hot, humid weather, one summer we had 90 degree weather and all of the hypothyroid people had normal temperatures so I checked their pulse.

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:57.500
 These people coming in with 98.6 temperatures, a lot of them had 45 per minute pulse rates.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:08.500
 And I realized you have to look at more than one indicator when you have an environment that would keep a rock up at a normal temperature.

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:17.500
 And so there are other indicators. The pulse rate and temperature are the quickest and easiest.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:25.500
 Eardrum temperature is very quick to take if you have a good instrument. A lot of them aren't consistent.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:43.500
 The Achilles reflex relaxation test is a very quick and a very definite indicator of thyroid function as it affects the nerves and muscles.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:52.500
 Some people on the internet have demonstrated something that's useless for the thyroid.

00:59:53.500 --> 01:00:03.500
 You want the toe to hang freely and relaxed when you kneel in a chair so that if you thump it and get a twitch so your toes go away from your body,

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:15.500
 the foot should relax with complete instantaneous relaxation so that it looks just like a piece of jelly flopping there.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:23.500
 After the outward twitch, the relaxation should be utterly relaxed and floppy if your thyroid is good.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.500
 Right.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:33.500
 And what we're looking at with temperature and pulse is how our cells are using glucose, oxygen and thyroid.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:36.500
 So we're really getting a big picture of our thyroid.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:43.500
 And would you agree though that, I don't know, I just find that people think that temperature and pulse are going to change overnight when they do this.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:53.500
 Would you agree that it just shows you that you're going in the right direction and it just takes much more consistency of what you're doing to get that consistent regulation?

01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:04.500
 Yeah. If you add to the good diet a supplement of pregnenolone and thyroid, for example, you can get there pretty quickly.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:12.500
 But to get there just with diet, it depends on how much PUFA you have stored in your tissues, for example.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:20.500
 A big fat person has a lot of work to get rid of some of the toxic stuff.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:32.500
 A very skinny person can sometimes, apparently like this woman mentioned, it just took a little while for the diet to bring her metabolism up.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:40.500
 I've seen people in as little as a week pop out of a chronic state of stress and start metabolizing.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.500
 Right.

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:51.500
 Great. Well, I have kind of run through all my questions for the hour that I promised you we'd talk.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:59.500
 We had some callers, which I appreciate and definitely appreciate you taking the time to answer those questions.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:09.500
 Definitely appreciate the time for you to come out today and spend the time here and educate us all.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.500
 Is there anything you want to add in regards to what we talked about for the listeners before we go?

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.500
 Nope.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:22.500
 All right. Well, once again, Ray, we really appreciate it. I'm sure I'm speaking for everyone.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:30.500
 We really learned a ton from your research and information.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:35.500
 I'm sure you know this, but it's helping a lot of people. So I think we all thank you.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.500
 Okay. You're welcome.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:43.500
 Well, have a great week and a great weekend and we'll talk to you later.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.500
 Okay. Thank you.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.500
 Thanks, Ray.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:53.500
 So for all the listeners, of course, this show is recorded on Blog Talk Radio.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.500
 It's recorded on our Blog Talk Radio show page.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.500
 And you can find this show as well as past shows.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:32.500
 We appreciate everyone taking time out tonight to listen to the show as well as for people to listen to the show later on.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:37.500
 Hopefully, I will be able to get Ray back on the show sooner or later.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:49.500
 If I do, you guys will know, pay attention to our Facebook page, EastWest Healing and Performance, or the Metabolic Blueprint, which is a closed group, as well as our Twitter page.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.500
 Wish you all a great evening and a great weekend.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.500
 Need one more reason why your Safeway store is just better?

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.500
