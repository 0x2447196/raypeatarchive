00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 The following episode of Politics and Science features an interview with Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.360
 endocrinologist and physiologist from Eugene, Oregon.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.680
 It was recorded on July 24, 2008.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.680
 At that time we were struggling with a, how shall I say, a not very well functioning phone

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.480
 interface machine at WMRWLP Warren.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 And so the sound is a little funky.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.400
 I've put it through some sound modifying programs and it sounds a little echoey now, but the

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.340
 buzz is gone.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.220
 And I hope it's listenable.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:47.440
 More information about Dr. Raymond Peat can be found at RayPeat.com, that's spelled R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.280
 where you'll find many fascinating articles.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.440
 And if you enjoyed the show or didn't catch all of it and wanted to hear the rest, you

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.560
 can browse your way on a computer to radionumerall4all.net.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.280
 That's radionumerall4all.net.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.000
 And once you get there, search for Politics and Science and you'll find a number of episodes

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.920
 ready to download to your computer to listen to at your convenience.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.440
 All right, and now to the interview itself.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 Raymond, can you hear me?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.440
 Okay.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 Let me hang up the phone.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.440
 All right, thanks for joining us again.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.440
 Let's see if I can get my knobs adjusted here correctly.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.960
 All right, you're on the air and we're speaking with Dr. Raymond Peat out in Eugene, Oregon.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 He's an endocrinologist and physiologist who's written a lot of books about health and nutrition

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.360
 and science and has a newsletter called Ray Peat's Newsletter and you can find him on

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 the web at raypeat.com.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 Raymond, can you hear me?

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 Oh, good.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.360
 Okay.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 I thought I'd lost you for a minute.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.400
 Just yesterday we were doing a sound check and we sort of picked up where we left off

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.440
 last week talking about fats, fats in our diet and the use of fats by humans over the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.840
 years and also as animal feed.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.600
 And yesterday you were talking about cholesterol and you mentioned a fellow named Chris Masterjohn

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.240
 and I thought perhaps we could -- one of the things you said yesterday that kind of shocked

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.680
 me was that for years we've heard that cholesterol is something you get from fat, from butter,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.320
 from especially beef fat, any of those meats that are full of supposedly saturated fats

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.760
 and that's why we're being so poisoned by cholesterol and it turns out that perhaps

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.360
 cholesterol isn't the boogeyman we always thought it was.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.680
 It's actually something we need to function.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.280
 Yeah, but eating cholesterol, if you're healthy, you have to eat a tremendous amount like the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:19.400
 experiment where they had healthy, I think they were young men, eat eggs until they could

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.000
 see an increase in blood cholesterol and that took 22 eggs before they saw a rise in the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.640
 day's cholesterol and it does rise if you're very sick and can't compensate.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.880
 But in a practical situation where a person might want to raise their cholesterol, you

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.120
 can usually do it just by eating lots of fruit because for several reasons.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:57.240
 The minerals and sugar in the fruit give the liver the energy it needs to make adequate

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:08.240
 cholesterol and there's, they call it a U-shaped curve of mortality.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.880
 You have an ideal range of cholesterol for a given age and when you're below that range,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.160
 your mortality increases.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.160
 What are those ranges?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:36.080
 Oh, the published, the people who talk about the curve usually put the bottom of the U

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:48.560
 around 160 to 180, but when you look at the figures, the bottom really varies with age.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:58.400
 Like one study looked at people in a nursing home situation and saw that the ones who had

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.960
 the highest cholesterol, I think in that group, those with 270 lived the longest.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:16.040
 So you have to think about the relation of the cholesterol to the stress you're under

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.760
 and consider it an anti-stress hormone.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.440
 My father recently was told that he has to start taking statins and a lot of people are

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440
 on statins.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.720
 What's your opinion?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:40.080
 Years ago, they started seeing increased mortality as they used drugs to lower cholesterol and

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.320
 there was one, I think it was Hungarian in the 1980s that showed a great increase in

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:58.680
 cancer mortality as they lowered cholesterol and that somewhat accorded with a Veterans

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:08.200
 Administration study in the 1960s that they stopped when they saw that people on the so-called

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.120
 heart protective low-fat diet were dying at a higher rate from cancer.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:27.240
 But there are still some lingering data showing that the statins might increase total mortality,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:37.560
 but the marketing is so intense that they managed to place articles convincing people

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.480
 how good it is.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:49.520
 A recent book by Melody Peterson, I think the title is Our Daily Meds, gives a lot of

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:58.620
 information about how the drug industry manipulates the culture, paying doctors, well, writing

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.380
 articles for doctors and just getting them to sign their names and then publishing them

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:12.640
 in prestigious journals promoting their products.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:21.240
 It gives a little bit of the inside information about how they're actually buying the medical

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240
 literature.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:32.240
 And Marcia Angel, seeing it from an editor's viewpoint at the New England Journal of Medicine,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:44.680
 emphasized that the editorial decisions can completely bias the results of a topic if

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.000
 people choose not to even submit their data because it doesn't support the efficacy of

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.140
 a drug or the safety.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:08:02.140
 A lot of studies will simply not get submitted, and then if the editors introduce more bias,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:09.700
 you might have 50 studies showing a drug is harmful and useless and one that gets published

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.580
 showing that it's beneficial.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:23.460
 Increasingly, Melody Peterson shows how the drug industry is not only modifying the research

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:33.580
 that gets done and how the universities treat their research, but how the journals publish

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.020
 it and then finally how the doctors use it.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.740
 So the system is pretty well sewed up.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:51.660
 Now, anything relating to drug therapy, you just simply can't trust the Anglo-American

00:08:51.660 --> 00:09:04.820
 literature, and increasingly it has spread into Italy, Chile, France, Japan, as the industries

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.020
 become influential in those countries.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:19.140
 India and Russia were relatively outside the commercial pharmaceutical influence, but now

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.820
 they're moving in that direction, too.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.860
 So it's an effect of globalization, I suppose, is it?

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.860
 Yeah.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.860
 Same corporate policies.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:37.220
 Yeah, still some of the more backward economies still manage to do some real research.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:43.740
 So yeah, I've heard it said that we have one of the most effective propaganda systems in

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.700
 world history, basically, in this country at this time, with access to the media pretty

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:57.140
 much sewn up by the corporations and alternative voices only heard on stations like ours, which

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.660
 are community stations, which there's quite a few of them around the country, but there's

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.060
 a lot of space in between them.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:09.700
 So how's the media situation out in Oregon?

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:21.780
 Oh, well, in my lifetime, the Pacific stations have been the outstanding exceptions, but

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:33.180
 the university public radio station, about, I guess, 10 years, 15 years ago, it changed

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:39.660
 its format so that students don't have the access they used to, and now it sounds like

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:45.700
 one of those big city furniture advertising classical music stations.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.780
 It used to be more of a community station?

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:58.420
 Yeah, it used to be a really good station, but the donors made it sound like one of those

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.980
 upper class, nothing but classic music stations.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.060
 Yeah, that's, we're having, we tried to, we have a pretty small range here, but we do

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.780
 have an affiliation with Pacifica and with other community stations around the country,

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:18.180
 so we try to network our programming and share it between us all.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:28.220
 Well, getting back to cholesterol, and there was a guy, you said the last time you were

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.020
 on the air, you spoke about somebody named Chris Masterjohn.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.860
 Yeah, I've read several of his articles that are very good.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:43.620
 My only disagreement with him is that he persists in believing in essential fatty acids.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:51.660
 Yeah, that's something a lot of alternative, quote, alternative health people believe in.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:57.980
 And what's, in a nutshell, what's your view on the essential fatty acids, just so everybody

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.980
 knows?

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:10.180
 Well, the first claim was that it was linoleic acid, then maybe linoleic was added, but already

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:20.180
 after the Burr's studies of the late '20s and early '30s, by the 1940s, their disease

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.380
 was shown to be nothing but a vitamin B6 deficiency.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:34.180
 And at just about the same time, the agricultural researchers were showing that linoleic and

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:44.860
 linoleic acid were the causes of brain degeneration, testicular degeneration and infertility, and

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:54.500
 muscle degeneration, and fish oils, about the same time, were causing mink degenerative

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.500
 disease.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:04.260
 And then the yellow fat disease was showing up in more and more animals as they were fed

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:13.180
 fish waste because of an excess of the polyunsaturated fats in the fish fats.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:26.740
 And so the linoleic acid finally was recognized to be essential for cancer, but not at all

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.140
 essential for nutrition.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:39.860
 And the publicity coming out that the original essential fatty acids were essential for cancer

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:47.860
 kind of discouraged the marketing in that direction, and that's when it shifted to marketing

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:54.260
 fish oil as the new version of the essential fatty acids.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:14:03.700
 And that's where we are now at pretty much the peak of the fish oil promotion as the

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:16.620
 new fatty acids that are being recommended at higher intake levels to actually function

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:23.100
 as drugs to supposedly cure a lot of diseases.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:32.260
 But in fact, the old research going back 40, 50 years shows that it is simply a temporary

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:40.980
 suppression of inflammatory symptoms while in the long run increasing the inflammatory

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.020
 degenerative processes.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:49.660
 So the reason people have a subsiding of their symptoms is just their immune system has been

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.660
 knocked down?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.660
 Yeah.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:58.700
 David Horobin, who was a big promoter of polyunsaturated fats and who died of brain cancer and was

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:06.740
 trying to treat himself with his own fats, he published work showing that fish oil is

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.540
 very immune suppressive.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:23.540
 And others looking at why fish oil is anti-inflammatory found that it wasn't the original long chain

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:30.900
 polyunsaturated fats that are found in the fish, but when they are processed and hit

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:41.380
 the hot organs of a mammal, they break down and it's the breakdown products, the aldehydes

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:48.820
 and free radicals that are decomposed from the fish oils, which are actually the anti-inflammatory

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.820
 substances.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:16:01.100
 So it's the deterioration of the material that produces temporary relief, but it's also

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:08.180
 those things which contribute to the serious long range problems such as brain damage and

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.140
 vascular damage and so on.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.740
 And you were saying last week that fish oil does have some good properties about it.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.460
 It has lots of vitamin A and D.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:27.380
 Yeah, it depends on how it's made, but in its crude form, it does come with a lot of

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.380
 vitamin D and A.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.380
 I see.

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.140
 So if there was some way to get those vitamins out without...

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:42.620
 Yeah, there have been a lot of products on the market extracted from fish liver oil in

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:49.500
 which they concentrate the vitamin D and A a lot so that you can get your daily dose

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.340
 in a couple of drops of the oil.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.980
 And some people are taking fish oil for anti-depression.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.500
 I think they're called omega brights or something, some such.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:06.580
 Yeah, there have been studies even in the published literature.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:13.940
 The ones I've seen were just about an equal number saying it isn't effective as say it

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.340
 is effective.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:21.260
 Same with using it as a supplement to baby food.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:27.260
 There are studies that show that it retards iron brain development even though they don't

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.500
 get discussed very much.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.500
 Is that the DHA?

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.500
 Yeah.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.340
 And they've started adding that to baby food?

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.340
 Yeah.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.340
 Oh dear.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.020
 How did we get on fish oil, Raymond?

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.580
 Do you remember?

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.020
 Well it's being promoted as an essential.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.020
 Oh, that's right.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.540
 Thank you.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.220
 And so flaxseed oil has gone out of fashion.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.700
 I didn't realize that.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.820
 And now they're promoting mostly fish oil in the alternative medicine field?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.140
 I think so, yeah.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:13.340
 The literature in the 1980s just became overwhelming showing that linoleic acid in particular is

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.420
 really the basic motor for pushing cancer excess.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.820
 And linoleic isn't quite as bad.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:28.180
 So flax isn't as bad as some of the others.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.620
 We're talking to Dr. Raymond Peet.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.620
 If anybody would like to ask Dr. Peet a question, there's no other phone line here, but I can

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:46.100
 receive emails at info@wmrw.org.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:56.060
 So if essential oils are only essential for creating disease, how is it that they're so

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.420
 heavily promoted by the government?

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:05.820
 Well, several years ago the FDA had a warning not to use more than, I think it was three

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:12.940
 grams a day of those one chain unsaturated fats from fish oil.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.300
 And I think they've dropped that warning.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.700
 At least it isn't prominent like it used to be.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:29.460
 And I think right from its very beginning the FDA was captured by the food industry

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.380
 and then the drug industry.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:43.540
 And now they really are working primarily as a corporate defense system.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:50.300
 Yeah, it always seems like they absorb the liability for the corporations by if they

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.380
 approve it, then you can't sue the corporation.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:20:00.620
 Yeah, the same thing as government protecting the nuclear industry by saying you can't collect

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:07.620
 more than a certain amount of damage if you have a reactor explode in your neighborhood.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:14.620
 Right, so basically the oil industry is underwritten by the government.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:25.100
 Yeah, the public health service has a worse record than the FDA itself.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:33.620
 The FDA interfaces with the consumers and tries to keep them happy.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:47.100
 But at higher levels the agencies of the government have been more defensive of the power structure

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:53.020
 and pretty much ignoring the consumer level.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:21:02.020
 Like in the years of the fallout from atmospheric bomb testing, the public health service was

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:09.300
 destroying data and putting out false data about the safety of radiation.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:17.540
 Yeah, that is very telling of how the government can work at its worst.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:23.860
 Maybe you could talk about radiation for a minute and how the government's bias towards

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:29.580
 that has made it more widespread.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:40.020
 Well for 50, I guess 60 years I've been hearing from dentists and doctors that the dose we

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:45.140
 give you in examining you is very small and harmless.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:52.300
 And then they reduce it tenfold and they say exactly the same thing.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:22:01.900
 And the words are the same in 1940 and 1950 right down to the current.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.100
 They claim they have digitalized machines.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:13.780
 People think it's just bits of information coming through their bodies, but it's still

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.500
 the same old x-rays.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.500
 They're exciting their cells.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:31.300
 And even Linus Pauling took a less than adequate biological view.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:38.380
 He was the one warning about the dangers, but he was looking only at the DNA damage.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:47.460
 But the damage is much subtler than breaking strands of DNA.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:58.980
 The excited electrons cause chemical and physiological changes that linger completely distinct from

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:06.620
 the immediate reaction of radiation with the DNA.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:16.060
 So that for example, you can give a dose of radiation to cells in a dish and then add

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:24.140
 new cells that weren't exposed to radiation to that dish and the new cells will start

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:34.820
 mutating a day or more later from something emitted by the exposed cells.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:44.060
 And that process lingers in the tissues and the blood serum and it's called the bystander

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.940
 effect that you can demonstrate in the lab.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:53.380
 Cells that weren't exposed start behaving as if they were exposed by contact with the

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.660
 damaged cells.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:03.820
 And people exposed from the Hiroshima bomb have been studied 60 years later and they

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:10.940
 still showed essentially excited electronic states in their tissues.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:18.660
 And the same with people, I guess about 20 years after the Chernobyl exposure, their

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.300
 serum is still toxic.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:30.340
 It can be removed from their blood and added to healthy cells and the healthy cells begin

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.340
 mutating.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:42.420
 So it's the bystander effect which lingers and might continue causing mutations but it's

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.140
 a completely separate process from mutation.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:58.740
 And so the safety assumptions were based on the model of how a beam of radiation will

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.860
 affect a molecule.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:10.700
 And so it was worked out in terms of direct interaction between a molecule and radiation

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:16.340
 but in the organism that simply isn't how it works.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:26.460
 And the Russians way back in the 60s were showing that where the Western paradigm was

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:37.940
 that if you irradiated an animal's brain it would go into estrus causing supposedly something

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:45.100
 was altered in the pituitary causing the ovaries to produce more estrogen.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:52.660
 The Russians did a control experiment in which they irradiated the animal's foot instead

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.620
 of its brain and it went into estrus.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:08.820
 And so they called them some kind of radiation toxin that was emitted by the exposed tissue

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.540
 but it's the same thing that happens in the bystander effect.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:22.460
 There's some physiological biochemical change that is started by the radiation but then

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:31.420
 spreads and continues and the increased estrogen happens to imitate these processes started

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.580
 by the radiation.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:40.820
 So there are probably many levels from the single cell which emits the bystander acting

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:48.340
 substances to the whole organism in which estrogen becomes one of the bystander activating

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.340
 substances.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:56.380
 So you're saying a little bit of radiation causes this cascading effect throughout the

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.380
 body?

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.380
 Yeah.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:08.540
 Two or three years ago in Seattle they were using low level fancy latest well calibrated

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:16.500
 x-ray equipment and covering the patients with lead aprons and so on.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:25.060
 And they found that a full set of dental x-rays if the woman was pregnant at the time even

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:34.460
 though her body was shielded thoroughly her baby turned out underweight showing that basically

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.300
 the same effect as taking a dose of estrogen while pregnant.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:48.460
 It spreads a stress influence that malnourishes the developing fetus and causes its brain

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:58.060
 to develop less fully than an unexposed fetus.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.860
 Now the method you used to describe how the government assessed the dangers of radiation

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:13.540
 poisoning where they just sort of had a hypothetical theory that one molecule being affected by

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:19.900
 ionizing radiation but they didn't take into account the living being.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:26.340
 I think you've said before that that's common in how science is conducted in the West.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.300
 They do a lot of experiments in test tubes basically.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:38.460
 Yeah and worse than that rather than if you look through PubMed you see lots of abstracts

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:44.300
 described as in vitro but now they have the concept in silico.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.300
 What does that mean?

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:53.220
 It means they didn't have anything living at all it was all done in a computer.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:59.780
 But people read the article and they're used to seeing in vitro and they think real cells

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.940
 were involved but in silico means in the computer.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:10.060
 I've never heard that before in silico.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.500
 So what's wrong with that Ray?

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.220
 What's wrong with doing I guess that's modeling basically isn't it?

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:27.580
 Yeah it's like the medieval arguments about angels.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.900
 How much force base does an angel need to dance and how many can get on the head of

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.900
 a pin.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.860
 You mean it's meaningless unless it's...

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:37.860
 Worse than meaningless.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:49.700
 It is a way of amplifying your favorite hypothesis or assumption.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:30:00.180
 It'll actually promote some absolutely wrong theory if you do your modeling right.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:07.380
 So in studying science I think a lot of people are a little bit confused that we just figure

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.220
 it's empirical and they're testing theories all the time and of course the best theory

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:20.180
 will end up on top because it'll get the most positive results.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:26.980
 How come that isn't the way it works?

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:36.140
 Lots of reasons but probably the basic thing is that it's all filtered through the culture

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:53.100
 and the system of assumptions and the assumptions if you look at different cultures the whole

00:30:53.100 --> 00:31:03.740
 background of philosophy and religion influences what you think can be taken seriously as an

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:13.900
 assumption and because in the medieval times people believed in alchemy and the influence

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:27.260
 of the planets and astrology ordinary chemists and physiologists think it's absurd to consider

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:33.940
 the phase of the moon when you're doing a chemical or biological study but several people

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:45.420
 have looked at lab results done over a period of time and have seen that the phase of the

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:54.900
 moon does influence many experiments in the lab and for example I worked in the hamster

00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:05.860
 lab at the university where the indoor temperature was kept constant and the light was artificially

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:17.940
 controlled so a person would not have any cues indoors whether it was winter or summer

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:26.020
 but somehow the hamsters knew what was going on outside the walls because their thymuses

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:33.420
 would atrophy in the winter season and come back in the spring just like they do when

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:48.260
 they're exposed to changing day length and that was investigated.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:58.900
 Professor Brown in Indiana did many tests with potatoes, oysters and flowering plants

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:09.740
 and he had noticed that his experiments varied with the moon and he got some oysters from

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:19.900
 the east coast and studied their metabolism in Indiana and if it had been genetically

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:27.980
 determined the way the paradigm said it must be because hamsters can't know when it's winter

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:33.180
 if you're controlling their life cycle so it must be some kind of a genetically operated

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:37.300
 clock in their brains.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:48.100
 Brown took his oysters to Indiana and they were still metabolically cycling as if the

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:57.220
 tides were coming into Indiana and he did the same thing with potatoes which aren't

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:05.700
 susceptible to tides and so no one knew about monthly cycles in potatoes but he saw a similar

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:17.300
 metabolic moon cycle in potato metabolism and flowering plants that he saw that he could

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:25.260
 take one of these plants that opens its petals at dawn and closes them at sunset taking it

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:35.220
 indoors they still kept up the same cycle and so he took it into a big building where

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:43.980
 no cues from the outside apparently reached and they still did it so he took his plants

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:50.900
 into a mine shaft and they kept cycling until they got down I forget I think it was hundreds

00:34:50.900 --> 00:35:02.420
 of feet below the surface the plants finally didn't receive a cue and no longer cycled.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:12.660
 So he demonstrated that something lunar or planetary influence was able to penetrate

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:22.900
 hundreds of feet of shielding and his plant showed that when properly shielded they no

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:33.380
 longer cycled disproving the idea that it's a genetic clock and other people were able

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:41.580
 to train plants to move their leaves at different times of day by giving them cues that over

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:52.780
 rode the environmental cues again disproving that it's all controlled by an abstract genetic

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780
 clock.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:59.780
 I see so you're saying that genetics is a dogma that's been pretty much accepted by

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.940
 the culture as the.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:20.620
 Yeah it really is primarily a kind of religious belief that remember the Lamarck Cuvier controversy

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:30.420
 the person who took over the museum that Lamarck had been the director of for years when Lamarck

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:37.100
 was doing his work showing the inheritance of acquired traits the man that took over

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:45.380
 was a Christian catastrophist who basically said there was no evolution it was accounted

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:52.740
 for by a flood destroying the ancient species and so on.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:37:08.380
 So in history the genetics as an anti-environmental approach was strictly a biblical orientation

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:17.020
 against the whatever the Lamarckian environmentalist orientation was.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:24.740
 Yeah I always thought the genetic orientation always is very convenient for liability in

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:29.540
 terms of you know anybody causing environmental damage whether it be you know to your own

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:35.580
 body in terms of pollution or to the environment in general they can always if you can't directly

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:41.500
 link them you know in a simple cause and effect they can always just say it's genetics and

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.500
 you were genetic.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:49.380
 It's been very convenient for the medical profession for the last 50 or 60 years if

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:59.060
 it's either genetic or it's a virus and there's nothing you can do to expect a cure and especially

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:12.980
 with cancer the government was very influential in reinforcing that interpretation and that's

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:18.380
 closely related to military medical research.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:30.780
 The germ warfare people were getting government subsidies and they were inclined to the it's

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:44.980
 your own fault for having bad genes theory and much of the research was done to say that

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:52.820
 the military didn't cause the problems.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:39:05.500
 The environmentalism in cancer research simply couldn't get funding after about 1945.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.860
 Is that right?

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:13.340
 Since 1945?

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.340
 Has all been genetic?

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:21.460
 It was persisting into the early 50s but it's pretty much at the end of the second world

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:31.900
 war that the whole school of biology simply was defunded and put out of existence.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:43.100
 The idea that embryos develop according to a field, developmental field and gradient

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:51.380
 was that was the dominant theory along with the idea that cancer is a metabolic physiological

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.820
 field distortion.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:05.980
 So embryology and cancer were related to these metabolic and pattern based ideas.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:21.340
 The genetics and militaristic approach simply cut those off and the best research was done

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:27.540
 through the 30s and the war itself interrupted a lot of the research.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:35.940
 When the government came out of the war having funded the Manhattan Project, that sort of

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:44.700
 money was then directed into germ warfare research and that gradually shifted to so-called

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.380
 cancer research.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:58.740
 The Fort Detrick germ warfare lab simply changed its name while not doing very different research

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:05.420
 when it shifted over to the war against cancer.

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:13.220
 So these cultural beliefs that seem to be directing research and taking some theories

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:20.460
 for the truth and rejecting other theories regardless of the empirical evidence, they

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:28.140
 basically are also responsible for the misinformation we've heard about cholesterol?

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:32.420
 Yeah, in different ways.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:45.140
 They talk about genetically determined tendencies towards high cholesterol that you can see

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:49.380
 in the form of cholesterol receptors.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:58.300
 The whole idea of receptor is a genetic pharmacological idea.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:06.940
 It's very much like the ads you see on TV where a drug zooms around in your body and

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:12.940
 goes right to the place where it's needed.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:22.660
 The receptor idea is like a switch that turns on a gene and there are molecules that drugs

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:31.580
 and substances stick to and if they have any involvement in physiology, those are called

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.420
 the receptor.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:40.180
 But that is promoted as a genetically determined thing.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:49.260
 So one drug company was collecting genes from a village in the Mediterranean area where

00:42:49.260 --> 00:43:01.220
 people didn't have heart disease and trying to promote a gene change as a drug product.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:13.300
 But the environmental influences simply weren't of interest because if you can identify a

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:21.860
 problem as a permanent genetic feature of the patient and then work on that gene receptor

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.340
 with a drug, then you've got a product.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:33.100
 But the cholesterol receptors are regulated by hormones such as the thyroid.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:41.180
 So if a person doesn't have enough of the receptor so-called that takes cholesterol

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:49.660
 out of your blood, you can take thyroid and increase the amount of that receptor.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:56.820
 But that doesn't please anyone but the thyroid industry.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.140
 They haven't really taken advantage of it.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:27.700
 In the

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:35.380
 1930s, the main product was made by the Armor Meat Company which became the Armor Pharmaceutical

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:42.420
 Company because they had a lot of beef and pork thyroids that they didn't know what to

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.420
 do with.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:50.380
 So they would sell those or the ovaries or adrenals or whatever wasn't popular as meat.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:57.420
 They would dehydrate and sell as a drug product.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:10.660
 In the '30s, that was the standard treatment and the symptoms of hypothyroidism were identified

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:19.100
 and when they would give them the armor thyroid containing both T4 and T3, the symptoms would

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.980
 be alleviated.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:32.220
 But after the war, a company came on the market with purified thyroxine which is only a fraction

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.340
 of a fraction of the armor thyroid.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:45.820
 The thyroid contains a protein which is ejected and then it liberates the two thyroid substances

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.860
 T4 and T3.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:46:01.300
 T4 is released by the gland about four times as much as the active T3 and the liver then

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:07.900
 when conditions are right, when the environment is right, the liver completes the activation

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:14.380
 so that most of your thyroid function is really coming from the liver which the liver is an

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:21.460
 interface with the environment so when your nutrition calls for it, then your liver produces

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:27.420
 70 or 80 percent of the active thyroid hormone.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:36.540
 But after the war, the drug company had an interest in promoting a product and so they

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:43.940
 said the main substance and the easiest to make was thyroxine and they gave it to 25

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:54.060
 year old male medical students, very healthy people and said it works just like real thyroid

00:46:54.060 --> 00:47:01.540
 in these healthy young men but they didn't test it in sick people or in women.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:11.620
 Women's livers are much less active than men because of the effect of estrogen.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:18.820
 A certain amount of alcohol takes longer for a woman to eliminate from the body than a

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:30.100
 man so the liver in general is less active than females but the drug product thyroxine

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:37.220
 was sold across the board even though it had only been tested in young men and it was more

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:46.460
 than 10 years later that the real active hormone T3 came on the market.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:57.260
 It wasn't even known at the time that the thyroid supplement was being marketed as thyroxine

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:10.060
 and the tests that determined whether you were hypothyroid or not disregarded all of

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:19.580
 the symptoms that had been associated with hypothyroidism up until about 1945 and the

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:27.340
 tests at first measured only the iodine bound to protein which has very little to do with

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:35.540
 your thyroid function and according to those tests the thyroxine product would raise your

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:46.300
 protein bound iodine and so that was compatible with marketing the synthetic drug but after

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:53.300
 about 20 years they saw that the protein bound iodine test had almost nothing to do with

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.340
 your thyroid function.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.940
 If you ate seaweed you would get a lot of protein bound iodine but your thyroid function

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:07.820
 would go down and so they started looking for new ways to test the thyroid but they

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:13.820
 had established over those 20 years that instead of half of the population benefiting from

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:24.860
 thyroid the tests suggested that only 5% of the people would benefit from thyroid so whatever

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:31.740
 new tests came on the market the assumption had been established in the culture that only

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:42.220
 about 5% would need thyroid and so any new test has been standardized to that paradigm

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:51.580
 of looking at a percentage of the population rather than whether the substance cured the

00:49:51.580 --> 00:50:01.980
 symptoms and so now they are treating the thyroid stimulating hormone level and disregarding

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:07.660
 the actual effect of the hormone on the person's health and physiology.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:13.060
 So they are basically treating one of the markers instead of the actual symptoms.

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.060
 Yeah.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:20.340
 Yeah, that seems to happen a lot in medicine.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.700
 They start mistaking the marker for the actual problem.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:37.620
 Yeah, and they call it subclinical and don't even make it explicit what they mean by clinical.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:44.620
 The AIDS test I think is something like that isn't it?

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:45.620
 Yeah.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:58.980
 There have been several traditional drugs that alleviate symptoms but those tend to

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:14.380
 be suppressed or forgotten but the so-called virus has attracted very little attention.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:26.140
 What they are doing now is using a lab process to amplify a substance that relates to the

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:35.540
 virus it isn't the actual virus but they call it the viral load but it is something they

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:47.460
 create in the laboratory and meanwhile they ignore the use or consider them simply additional

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:55.100
 therapies that could be added to the valuable and profitable drugs that they use to treat

00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:00.940
 the AIDS people.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:06.740
 I was going to talk to you about Chris Masterjohn's experience in cholesterol today but maybe

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.980
 we'll save that for another day.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.940
 You were going to say something else about the AIDS drugs?

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:19.820
 Oh, there are a couple of very good books.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:28.860
 One is "Impending the AIDS Virus" by Peter Guzburg and the other one is by Harvey Bialy

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:36.780
 about Peter Guzburg and the virus and disease.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:45.580
 I've been following it now for I guess 20 years and the establishment people just don't

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.420
 want to talk about it.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:58.300
 They won't let these people publish responses to articles in the major journals so the average

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:04.820
 doctor reading it thinks they have no answer but it's just that the editors don't want

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:13.820
 to hear their answer and the mainline virus theory of AIDS people have never answered

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:22.900
 the criticism of Peter Guzburg who basically says the virus is harmless.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.180
 And that begs the question what's causing the harm?

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:30.180
 Yes, he thinks it's a drug.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:37.860
 I'm inclined to the idea that it's the interaction of drugs, polyunpatriated fats, radiation

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:42.540
 exposure and other toxins in the environment.

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:47.180
 So that would be another case of an environmental problem.

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:56.460
 When you graph the incidence over the last 60 years of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,

00:53:56.460 --> 00:54:02.660
 it's a straight progressive increase since the bomb tests began after the Second World

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:09.740
 War and there was no sudden jump at the time AIDS became official as a disease.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:15.060
 It's a steady increase going back 60 years.

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:19.820
 Well that's very interesting.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.500
 Well we're just about out of time.

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.660
 We've been talking to Dr. Raymond Peat from Eugene, Oregon.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:29.260
 He's a physiologist and an endocrinologist and puts out a newsletter called Ray Peat's

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:37.100
 Newsletter and you can find him on the web at raypeat.com where you have a lot of excellent

00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.100
 articles.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.020
 You're getting more and more articles up there I've noticed too.

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:46.420
 Yeah, I have another 10 or 15 that will go up in a couple of weeks I hope.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.420
 Great.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:51.300
 Well they're very interesting and even if you don't necessarily agree with everything

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:57.860
 that's said there, plenty of food for thought and a lot of medical history and scientific

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:03.540
 history that I certainly have never heard about before so I find it all fascinating.

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.540
 Thanks Ray for your work.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.540
 Okay.

00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.940
 And we'll talk to you soon.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.220
 Bye bye.

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.660
 And that concludes today's broadcast of Politics and Science.

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.860
 I hope you enjoyed it.
