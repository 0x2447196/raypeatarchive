00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Well, welcome once again to this month's Ask Your Ab Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.560
 As always, for those who have tuned in and have not listened to the show before, we broadcast every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.720
 on KMU DeGarboville 91.1 FM.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.280
 We're discussing a wide range of alternative medicines,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.880
 health topics related to alternatives, and I'm very pleased as always to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us once more.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.040
 For those who may not know you, Dr. Peat, would you please give our listeners a rundown of your

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.240
 academic and professional background before we introduce our next guest?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:43.360
 After studying and teaching the humanities and linguistics and various things,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.320
 except biology,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.280
 before 1968, then I went to graduate school in biology to get a PhD

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.600
 1972 and

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.880
 specialized in

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.920
 aging physiology of reproduction, but in general studied physiology and biochemistry

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.640
 and since then have been

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.600
 doing short courses and counseling and such.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.800
 Okay, excellent. All right, and this month,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.000
 very specially, I'm very pleased to welcome a second generation. Well, actually, that's not true.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.160
 I've called her a second generation medical herbalist because I didn't understand her father's actual background before.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.320
 But anyway,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.480
 Sophie Lam, daughter of distinguished medical herbalist Brian Lam. Welcome to the show, Sophie. Thank you so much. I'm so delighted to be here.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.240
 So,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.040
 let me let me ask you this. I've always called you a second generation herbalist, but actually your father's background is...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.560
 Well, my father's background is there's about four generations of doctors and surgeons going back about 200 years and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.400
 although they were

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.560
 surgeons and doctors, a big part of the medicines that they used at the time was herbal medicine,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.160
 so they had their apothecaries at lot alongside their surgeries.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.200
 Okay, I know I know Brian. He's 82 now.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.120
 He qualified, I think I think I'm right in saying he qualified in 1978 from what was then

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 the School of Herbal Medicine

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.720
 before the degrees came into place and the the honors degrees that were given to herbal medicines.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.640
 And he's been in full-time practice since and he also

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.280
 manufactures a wide range of fluid extracts, syrups and some time-honored recipes using medicinal herbs and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.160
 he has a fairly busy practice as well as working day to day. He does. He's so amazing.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.120
 So he's nearly 82 and he works full-time, gets up very early with the birds and goes, you know, works all day long and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.200
 I'm just amazed at the energy he still has at his age.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.120
 And I think it's driven by the passion that he has for his job, the love he has for the herbs,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.000
 the fact that he's 82 and is still discovering and exploring so much because

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.240
 it's something you could study for a lifetime and still not

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.280
 extinguish all there is to know. So yeah, he's driven by passion, I think. Absolutely. And he's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:20.040
 excuse me, like Dr. Peake, people that listen to Dr. Peake can clearly hear he's very, excuse me, scientifically grounded in

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.680
 what he's discussing. Although sometimes his

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.160
 explanation is different from what would be a typical understanding of it and that's because he knows something different.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.360
 Your father also, he's very much into the science in herbal medicine, isn't he? Oh, he's really into the science.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.040
 I mean, he spends a lot, I mean when he's not actually physically preparing herbs or seeing patients or working in a dispensary,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.720
 he's researching, he spends lots and lots of time researching still.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.800
 Yeah, and he loves that. Now, am I right in thinking that he, I

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.880
 don't know for how long, but he came to the America and working for a Utah company developing some products for them?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.880
 Yeah, so he's to

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.120
 to America giving lectures on herbal applications for cosmetics and

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.040
 he's worked for a few network marketing companies designing herbal products for them and supplements and encapsulating them

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.400
 and making them work for a large-scale company. Yeah, so do you know how long that was again?

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.680
 He spent how? Well, I know that he, how long ago was that? No, no, how many years he's been doing this for?

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.920
 I think it must have stretched over about 10 years. Yeah, okay good. So Sophie,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.000
 Winter coughs, colds, preparations are some favorites.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.880
 Let's get an idea of what it was like growing up in a household

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.280
 on the northernmost tip of Scotland

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.240
 with an herbalist as a father. Okay, well, where there's, so I have three sisters, there's four of us daughters together,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.240
 so when you have four young children growing up,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.080
 typically speaking, young children develop coughs and chest infections, and that was definitely the case with us.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.880
 It may have been made worse by the fact that we're growing up in the most, we're on the top of the map of the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.320
 UK, so our home looks over the Orkney Islands.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.840
 Right at the very top, but really, really incredible herbs grow locally and are very specific to this area.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.080
 So we, we have an agar in the kitchen and my childhood memories are full of

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.920
 herbs drying on top and syrups being made at the side of the agar and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.560
 yeah, so we all actually had whooping cough as children, all four of us, I believe, but my sister, my elder sister had it the worst and

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.200
 what dad did for her and he did for all of us was he sliced up thin slices of garlic,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.520
 smeared the soles of her feet with Vaseline and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.320
 applied thin slices of garlic to the soles of her feet and

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.680
 applied and wrapped around cling film and applied a sock. He would have left it on for a few minutes,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.680
 I'm not sure how long, because obviously after a time garlic can actually burn, so you don't want to leave it on for too long,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.120
 but you know within a few minutes the

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.040
 essential oils have gone up, the volatile oils have gone up through the bloodstream and you're breathing out garlic and

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.880
 that's what shortened the duration and severity of our whooping cough as children.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.440
 We used to pick Tosolago,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.720
 Coltsfoot, and it makes the most incredible syrup because the flowers themselves smell of honey,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.560
 but by the side of the agar we'd do a layer of, and I mean all four of us were

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.880
 lured out to the hills and to the sand dunes and moors

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.160
 picking herbs, or lured out by a quarter of a snicker bar each, because in those days we weren't given chocolate, and

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.040
 we'd pick sackfuls of these herbs and go home, we'd do a layer of flowers, layer of sugar, a layer of flowers,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.240
 they'd macerate by the side of the hot agar and we'd have the most incredible syrup.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.400
 One of the things that my dad is most well known for is he makes an incredible thyme syrup.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.640
 And thyme, I mean, thyme

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.280
 as a herb fits the need of the lungs like a glove.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.880
 It's an antitussive, so it reduces the cough reflex, it's anti-edema on the lungs when you get swelling of the lungs,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.440
 it's expectorant, it helps you spit out the mucus, and it's antiseptic, and he makes an incredible syrup

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.760
 using de-slide water, which in itself is a healing water, and molasses.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:14.720
 That's interesting, actually. Your father actually uses a specific water. I think you should speak about that for a little bit.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.040
 Well, all of his extracts are made using

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.080
 de-slide water. Now, de-slide is a well or a spring which comes from the Pannanock Hills around Aberdeenshire, I believe.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.080
 My dad actually worked as a consultant for this water company because he understands water very well, and that water is not just water.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:37.080
 Different waters have different values and properties, because my dad's also an engineer before he was a herbalist, and he's very scientific.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:44.080
 So, people, so the royalties, royal families, who travel to this area of Scotland to make their own herbalist,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:54.080
 they drink the healing water, this de-slide water, and my dad actually extracts all of his herbs in this de-slide water.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:03.080
 How far away, because your home is up in a place called Thurso, which is the very northernmost point of Scotland.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.080
 How far away is Deeside from Thurso?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.080
 So, it would be about a five-hour drive south.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:18.080
 Five hours, okay. All right, good. Well, you're listening to Ask Your Herb, Dr. K. M. E. D. Galbraith, 91.1 FM, from 7.30 until 8 o'clock.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:26.080
 Listeners are invited to call in with questions, any questions they might want to pose Sophie, as well as Dr. Peat, who is on the line

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.080
 and is going to be joining us and interjecting. We're going to be questioning him about some of the science,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.080
 about some of these things that Sophie's going to talk about.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:41.080
 I did want to say that a little bit of the background, just for people that are listening,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.080
 in terms of England's law and herbal medicine and it being protected.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:56.080
 In 1154, Henry II institutionalized common law, and it's been the basis of the legal systems of England, Wales, Northern Ireland,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.080
 and Ireland, plus many other countries around the world, until the present time.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.080
 And common law is based on the premise that everything is legal unless it's deemed illegal.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.080
 Pretty straightforward, huh? Now, herbal medicine throughout history has always been protected under common law.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:19.080
 However, in 1542, the medical profession at that time wanted to prevent herbalists from practicing.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.080
 Fortunately, Henry VIII, as an avid user of herbs, came to the rescue and implemented the herbalist charter,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:30.080
 which underpinned the herbalist's right to practice, and anyone with knowledge of herbs could continue to use them.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:37.080
 Quoting from the text, "That at all time, from henceforth, it shall be lawful to every person being the king's subject,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.080
 having knowledge and experience of the nature of herbs, roots, and waters."

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:52.080
 And Nicholas Culpeper, in 1616 to 1654, was an apothecary who lived in a time when fees paid or charged by the medical professionals

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:57.080
 were out of the reach of the general public. So Culpeper translated the medical texts from Latin to English

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:04.080
 and sold copies at a low price to the apothecaries and anyone who could read so that they could use these life-saving works.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:12.080
 Henry VIII and Culpeper saved herbal medicine for the people, and thanks to the work in England of Fred Fletcher Hyde and other herbalists,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.080
 the 1968 Medicines Act allowed herbalists to continue to prescribe and prepare herbal medicines

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.080
 under Section 12, Part 1, and Section 12, Part 2 of this Act.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:29.080
 However, with the current relationship with the European Union, European law is now having a profound influence

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.080
 on the daily lives of herbalists, including the jurisdiction of herbal medicine.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:40.080
 European law is founded on Napoleonic law, not common law, and Napoleonic law is based on the premise

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:46.080
 that everything is illegal unless it is deemed legal. So completely back to front.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.080
 Anyway, I know that the National Institute of Medical Herbalists is still working fairly tirelessly

00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:00.080
 to keep the practice out of the reach of exclusion from the Brussels establishment,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.080
 and I think you're probably, you're a member of the National Institute of Medical Herbalists, aren't you?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.080
 No. MCP? Yeah. Right.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.080
 Okay, in England there's two authoritative bodies on herbal medicine.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.080
 The National Institute of Medical Herbalists, which I think is founded in 1864,

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:24.080
 and then the College of Practicing Phytotherapists, which actually is probably more allied to the European ESCOP,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.080
 the European Society on Pharmacopoeia. Good.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:35.080
 Okay, so again, this mirrors a kind of restriction and influence one system of medicine has against another,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:41.080
 limiting freedom of choice to the patient. We're not quite there, both in the UK and the US,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:46.080
 but as we've mentioned many times in past shows here on KMUD,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.080
 the overreaching corporations in tandem with government and lobbyists are seeking to eliminate

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.080
 any competition in favour of monopoly in the hands of the pharmaceutical and medical industries.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:03.080
 It's only by the power of "we the people" speaking out against any restrictive legislation that this will be avoided.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.080
 A good example is the current legislation now forcing vaccination on the people using the law

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.080
 to monopolise profits in the name of the greater good, when the very industry producing vaccines

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:20.080
 is indemnified by law against punitive damages when individuals are crippled or killed by adverse drug events,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.080
 many of which are clearly identified as the adjuvants within vaccines, like aluminum for example.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.080
 It's one thing to produce safe, effective vaccines and quite another to manufacture drugs

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.080
 which have been linked to autism and other neurological impairment.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.080
 We have spoken about this at a fairly good length.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:46.080
 Dr. Peat, on the subject of autism, I wanted to ask Sophie the same question afterwards

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:52.080
 and then get your feedback about the answer that she's going to have, which I haven't really asked her at this point,

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.080
 I'm not too sure what she's going to say and I definitely don't know what you're going to say.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.080
 But what do you see as a safe approach to helping the autistic child and what do you see as a cause?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:10.080
 I think just about anything harmful to the parents, especially the mother, and especially during pregnancy,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:17.080
 almost any environmental harm is going to increase the rate of autism.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:23.080
 For example, environmental estrogens and things that cause hypothyroidism,

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:31.080
 things that cause obesity are known to be causes of autism.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:39.080
 But I think, for example, in Texas there was a study showing that Latino kids,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:46.080
 especially Mexican immigrants, were at a much lower rate of autism

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.080
 than the well medicalized white residents.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:14:05.080
 I think a major source of adversity during pregnancy is what John Goffman saw

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:11.080
 was the major cause of breast cancer and heart disease in the United States,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:17.080
 namely medical radiation or medicalization in general in the case of autism,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:25.080
 including too many x-ray exams for the mother, too many treatments in general,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:33.080
 including bad thyroid therapy, bad endocrine therapy, and the use of many toxic drugs.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:45.080
 And touching has been identified as one of the things that makes kids' emotional system

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.080
 and nervous system develop properly.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:59.080
 And there has been a kind of a culture of ignoring the babies in the standard American culture.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:05.080
 And Latinos, they are very touchy compared to the Anglo population.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.080
 So I think there are lots of causes.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:17.080
 And enriching the environment, removing toxins, and improving the thyroid and progesterone

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.080
 of the person's system, all of the endocrine system,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:29.080
 can be modified and improved to a remedy to some extent, at least the autistic.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:37.080
 Okay, Sophie, I wanted to ask you the same kind of thing and then anecdotal evidence.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:44.080
 Yeah, I have a couple of friends whose children have been quite severely autistic at some point.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.080
 And my friends have actually been incredibly dedicated.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.080
 They've been very dedicated mothers, but they've been very dedicated to bringing their children on

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:59.080
 as far as they can to help to incorporate them into mainstream education

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.080
 and just have a better hope for their futures.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.080
 And they've done a really great job of this, and they've definitely focused on their diets

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.080
 and on their gut health because with both of these children I can think of,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.080
 their digestive habits or their bowel motions have been disturbed.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:23.080
 And one friend I can think of in particular, when her autistic son used to go into what's called stemming,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.080
 which is repetitive physical movements like jumping up and down on the spot

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:35.080
 and acting kind of more hyperactively and less responsive to his mother,

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:42.080
 she used to visit a pediatrician, and this pediatrician used to prescribe her son a strong antifungal

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.080
 because it was suspected that he had a huge fungal overgrowth,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.080
 which was almost creating an alcoholic syndrome, or he was producing a lot of alcohol in his system.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:59.080
 And the antifungals would hugely modify his behavior and help him take him on in leaps and bounds.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:07.080
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about that, the presence of gut organisms that metabolize carbohydrates,

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.080
 producing ethanol, and how that could impact?

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:22.080
 Yeah, the intestinal flora produce lots of toxins, but the yeast in particular produce both alcohol and estrogen.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:28.080
 And the estrogen is I think more toxic than the alcohol.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:34.080
 Okay, there you go. Okay, Sophie, sleep disturbance then.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:41.080
 And it's a very common presentation that I think a lot of verbalists get consulted about.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:47.080
 Do you see many people with insomnia or other disturbances in sleep, and what do you treat this with?

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:54.080
 Well, I do now because I've been sort of spoken about as a bit of a sleep expert, but I have to thank Dr. Peat for that.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.080
 I was an eight-year insomniac, a rather severe insomniac.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:05.080
 It was an extremely depressing and debilitating condition and situation to be in for such a long period of time.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:12.080
 And when I re-hooked up and managed to speak to Sarah, your wife, and you about it properly,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:18.080
 you taught me about how Dr. Peat views insomnia.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.080
 And then I started to learn the actual genuine, the true physiological approach to insomnia

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.080
 is that if you can get your stress hormones down, you're most likely going to sleep well.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.080
 I was a chronic under-eater, not intentionally necessarily, but because when you're chronically stressed,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.080
 you have a chronically depressed appetite.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.080
 So I would say I was a chronic under-eater or chronically calorie-deficit.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.080
 And then I started to learn about sugars, about carbohydrates, about the right types of sugars to lay down as glycogen,

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.080
 that if we're really healthy and if our thyroid's helping us lay down glycogen,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.080
 we should be able to, or healthy individuals should be able to get an eight-hour sleep

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.080
 because that eight-hour glycogen store feeds our active brain through the night.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:04.080
 And a very, very key point of understanding insomnia is to understand, first of all, that sleep is an active process.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.080
 It is not a passive process.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.080
 Our brain does a huge amount of repair.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.080
 Our brain shrinks, and we go into a deep rinse cycle.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.080
 It's a very active process.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.080
 And Dr. Peat might want to correct me on this.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.080
 I think that the brain uses about 100 grams of glucose through the night.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:27.080
 So obviously and apparently to energize that active process of healing, we need to supply the brain with glucose.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:37.080
 And if we've not laid down enough glycogen during the day to sleep well at night for our brain to be able to dip into that reserve,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:46.080
 we're going to get a rise in stress hormones, which will catabolize our fat and our muscle to deliver that energy for the brain.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.080
 And of course, a side effect to stress hormones or cortisol and adrenaline is mental alertness, which you don't want at night.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:59.080
 So you've got to view insomnia actually as a daytime disorder which is presenting itself at night.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:04.080
 Dr. Peat, what do you speak to in terms of the liver's ability to store glycogen

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.080
 and any impairment in that which would trigger insomnia?

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:17.080
 Thyroid is the essential thing for being able to store glucose in the form of glycogen in the liver in particular.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.080
 But the muscles are a major reservoir too besides the liver.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:29.080
 And the brain itself stores, when conditions are good, stores quite a bit of glycogen locally.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:39.080
 And when you run out of glycogen in your brain, muscles, and liver, you mobilize free fatty acids out of stores.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:49.080
 And the free fatty acids create the condition of diabetes in the brain as well as throughout the body.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:21:08.080
 It turns off brain metabolism by essentially poisoning the mitochondria, blocking the ability to use any glucose that your body produces by breaking down protein with the stress hormones.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.080
 So in the UK and I'm sure in America as well, it's the same.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:17.080
 We're under this impossible situation where we're all told to keep carbohydrates and avoid sugar.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:24.080
 And some particularly health conscious mothers even try and avoid fructose and fruits for their children, especially fruit juice.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.080
 And adults are avoiding salt. And you've got a perfect storm for insomnia.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.080
 So first of all, if I have a patient with insomnia, the first place I look at is diet and the second place I look at is herbs.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.080
 There you go.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:44.080
 All right. So Sophie, getting back to the kind of foundation of your background, you know, with your father being a noblest,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.080
 did you say that it was three or four generations that he was?

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.080
 Well, I know it goes back about 200 years. I'm pretty sure it's four generations.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.080
 It's on my TED talk.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.080
 OK, there you go. Well, let's talk about that very briefly then.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.080
 Your TED talk, I think everybody who's listening has probably heard of TED talks.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:04.080
 Now, they do in all sorts of different countries and they're a wide range of subjects.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:09.080
 So tell us a little bit about your TED talk, what you did and where it was and how.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:17.080
 Well, I gave a TED talk with my sister Naomi and the title was Why We Are Dependent on Plants for Medicine.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:26.080
 We were given an opportunity to do a TED talk and I felt the most important thing for me as a herbalist anyway was to reconnect and reconnect the dots of people.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:33.080
 People often think that herbs are some kind of archaic system or even something to be degraded like, you know, as witchcraft or something.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:37.080
 Whereas actually it forms a bedrock of our most important medicine.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:46.080
 So the medicines on the essential medicines list of the World Health Organization, a significant proportion of those drugs are based on herbs.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:50.080
 We would not have those herbs if it weren't for the discoveries in plants.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.080
 So what comes to your mind?

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:58.080
 Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is morphine, because I mean, if you think about what people have gone through with the Second World War,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:04.080
 I'm not sure if it was available in the First World War, it's tended to the wounds and grotesque injuries of wars.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.080
 There's nothing that rivals morphine still as an analgesic.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.080
 And then you think about the lidocaine, novocaine that was discovered from coca leaves.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.080
 Then I think about aspirin, which I love.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.080
 You think about the diabetes medicine from Goiga.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.080
 What is that? I can't remember the name of that drug.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.080
 Metformin.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.080
 Yeah, so metformin that has its origins in goat's roe.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:36.080
 You think about 90% of our chemotherapeutic drugs have their foundations in plants and natural.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.080
 Yeah, taxol from the European Yew tree.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080
 And vinca.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.080
 And vinca, vinblastine, great periwinkle.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:50.080
 I mean, so I feel that for me personally, it's very important to get that message out there that you look out to those fields and you're walking past essential medicines.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:24:00.080
 Right. And I think, again, I know when we were discussing the outline of the show on the way in, because you didn't show back up again.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.080
 You've been out all day long.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:08.080
 But basically I drew up a guideline here of questions and answers and things that I wanted to get Dr. Peate's perspective on.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.080
 I know that you have how long have you been? Is it eight years or so?

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.080
 How long has it been you discovered that sugar wasn't bad for you and the whole thing turned around?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.080
 Eight years.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.080
 Eight years ago, right.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:35.080
 So quickly talk to me about how you implement what you've learned from Dr. Peate and everything that Sarah will have discussed with you, because I know you two are in dialogue pretty constantly by email going backwards and forwards with different patients and talking about them and how, you know, the success and what to do next and all the rest of it.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.080
 How I implement personally.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:50.080
 Yeah. As an herbalist, a daughter of an herbalist of 200 year old succession of people that are doctors, you know, herbal medicine was your be all.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080
 Yeah, it was.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:58.080
 And I think I'm fair in saying that there is no one modality to cure any body.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.080
 It's a multi, multi complex situation.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:20.080
 So whether it's herbs, whether it's certain chemicals that are, you know, drugs that are very helpful, whether it's, you know, red light, whether it's sound, whether it's, you know, there's many different modalities that can really be brought together by a good practitioner to get the best result.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.080
 Possible.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:34.080
 And when you were practicing, obviously, you would have got your knowledge from the same course, the same university and obviously from the whole background of your father having grown up in it since you were born.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:55.080
 Tell me some of the differences perhaps or maybe some of the cases that you've come to and maybe hit a wall after which treating and looking at a different angle to it or using a different compound in conjunction with herbs with or without how that's changed your practice.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.080
 Oh, how it changed my practice.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:07.080
 Okay, well, now what I do with my patients is I help them remove the good and bad tags they have all over all sorts of foods because they're often very misplaced.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.080
 And the problem with that, what that does is it stops them eating.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.080
 The bad tags you mean like brainwashing that's associated with it?

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.080
 Well, you know, sugar's bad.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080
 Right.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.080
 Salt's bad.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.080
 Yeah, sugar's bad, salt's bad, vegetable oil good, margarine good, butter bad, all that kind of stuff.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:30.080
 Because actually what that's done, I think one of the worst things that that's done is it's removed people's instinctive eatings, where it was instinctive, you know, leading of how they eat.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:42.080
 You know, they may well be hungry and they may well be craving salt but still resisting that desire to eat salt and the same with sugar and, you know, not so much protein because that doesn't have that bad tag attached to it.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:50.080
 But they're denying themselves their basic physiological needs because they have this perception that food is bad and I think that's one of the worst things that's come out of it.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:27:02.080
 Dr. Peat, what have you got to say about that in terms of sugar and salt and what you believe is the kind of undoing of the instinctual craving for it?

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:12.080
 Oh, those doctrines against them were distinctly created by the pharmaceutical industry.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:28.080
 When they came out with new diuretics around 1950, they convinced doctors that pregnant women had to use them because it would prevent weight gain and water retention in pregnancy.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:40.080
 And just absolute fabulation, making up diseases that didn't exist so they could sell their product.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:52.080
 And in the process, they destroyed many, many pregnancies in the United States with their salt restriction plus diuretics.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:28:04.080
 And the sugar thing appeared around the same time with the marketing of the polyunsaturated vegetable oils.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:29.080
 Those were defined as essential and so the food industry first promoted them as medicinal in great quantity, 100 times more than any possible theoretical essentiality would indicate.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:41.080
 But they were promoted to lower cholesterol, but then a doctor showed that sugar raises cholesterol.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:29:08.080
 So the food industry created the cholesterol myth to sell their polyunsaturated oils and then to explain away heart disease and the elevated cholesterol, which really is the result of hypothyroidism, almost all of it.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:20.080
 The ban on sugar to lower, prevent heart disease was promoted all through the 60s and 70s.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:41.080
 Again, the insulin industry and the drug alternatives to insulin were promoted along with basically a sugar-free diet, teaching people that sugar causes diabetes.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:47.080
 Yeah, and then again, of course, there's a whole sugar feeds cancer misdirection.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.080
 Sophie, what are fish oils doing in Europe and in England now?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:59.080
 I mean, are they still really advertised as really healthful and your patients are always talking about how good the fish oils are?

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:04.080
 You probably set them right, but what do you think the general current thinking is?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.080
 Yeah, I tend to steer them away, but the buoyant, definitely still very buoyant.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:17.080
 But interestingly, last year a newspaper published a study linking fish oils with liver disease.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.080
 I think actually scarring of the liver as far as I remember.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.080
 And I think that hit a mainstream newspaper last year in England.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:37.080
 I wonder, Dr. Peat, you probably have something to say about liver scarring and fish oil consumption from a physiological perspective or even an anecdotal perspective.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:47.080
 Yeah, lots of stresses contribute, but definitely not good foods like saturated fats and sugar.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:53.080
 Okay. All right. You're listening to Ask Europe's Dr. K. M. Udgar, 91.1 FM.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:31:00.080
 From now until 8 o'clock, callers are invited to call in with any questions either for Dr. Peat and/or Sophie.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:10.080
 And the number, if you live in the area or if you live outside the area or outside the country, is area code 707-923-3911.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:17.080
 So that's 707-923-3911. Questions any time from now until 8.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:23.080
 I think we have a caller on the line already. Caller, you're on the air. What's your name? Where are you from? And what's your question?

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.080
 Jeff from Long Island.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.080
 Hey, Jeff.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.080
 I have two questions for Dr. Peat.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:41.080
 One, the soils that plants are grown in obviously don't have the same minerals that they used to, as we all know.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:56.080
 And there's a couple of products that have gotten a lot of attention, fulvic and humic acids, which apparently are coming from rock formations that are very old.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:06.080
 Are you familiar with those and whether the enzymes and the natural minerals associated with those are complementary and beneficial in any way?

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.080
 No, I think they're mildly harmful.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.080
 Because?

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:21.080
 To the extent that they break down, they can be absorbed and release toxic things.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:37.080
 Any minerals such as magnesium and trace minerals would be beneficial, but the substance fulvic acid and humic acid are not in themselves safe.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.080
 Okay, are there studies on that or is that just a gut feel that you have?

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.080
 Is that something you've done research on in the past?

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:51.080
 No, you can find articles on PubMed.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.080
 Yeah, the articles I've found have all been actually favorable.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:07.080
 The reason I mention it and I'm pushing it a little bit is because I am actually the same person who told you that I had a skin rash on the insides of my armpits and elbows for literally, it went on for 12 months.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.080
 I mean literally 12 months.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:13.080
 They told me to take cortisone, which I didn't want to do.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:22.080
 So the suggestions you've refreshed were taking the salt baths with baking soda, which I think was very helpful.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:26.080
 CO2, I think you mentioned vitamin D.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:30.080
 So I did some of that stuff and it was very helpful.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:42.080
 But I must say, I believe the fulvic and humic acids, which I took more recently, have actually improved the assimilation and the enzymatic absorption of all nutrients that I consume.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.080
 I really do believe that.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.080
 It's actually a lot of articles are very positive on it.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:56.080
 Now maybe there are some mixtures that are toxic relative to others, but I strongly believe in that.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.080
 But anyway, okay, so that's one.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:05.080
 I actually would love to see if you write up on that and actually can reference specific articles that describe the damage that can be done by them.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.080
 I'd be really curious.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:11.080
 But I found in personal experience that it might just actually be the opposite.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:15.080
 Anyway, the other question I have relates to thyroid.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:26.080
 I think at one point we discussed the fact that it's not -- compared to an adrenal gland, which apparently can repair itself on its own, the same is true of any gland, including the thyroid gland.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:40.080
 But the bigger, more complicated issue I think we discussed was it's more important because PUFA and other issues may affect the production, transport, conversion, and uptake of T3 into the cell.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:35:01.080
 And so I guess my question specifically is if someone is improving their consumption where the PUFA is down and therefore the uptake, transport, and conversion is better, why isn't it possible to eliminate thyroid?

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:18.080
 It just seems to me that for some reason you're taking thyroid all the time, and if you're complying with the diet, it seems to me that the benefits of improvement of the adrenal gland should also apply to the thyroid gland for somebody who's a strict proponent of your diet.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.080
 Where am I missing?

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:31.080
 I've seen lots of people who either were able to stop their thyroid supplement or greatly reduce it, and that happens.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.080
 One or two people, it happened in a week.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.080
 They broke the pattern so quickly.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:44.080
 They didn't need it after having been in very serious condition.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:36:04.080
 Others take three or four years, for example, a fat person who is well saturated with unsaturated fats has to get rid of a lot of that stored thyroid-inhibiting fat before they can get away from a supplement.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:12.080
 What about all the electromagnetic radiation that's certainly disruptive to thyroid activity that's nothing to do with diet?

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.080
 Yeah, and the environmental estrogens.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:31.080
 There are so many things like tooth-filling material, packaging of food, just almost any food you'll get some of these estrogens.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.080
 It could block the thyroid.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.080
 All right, well, thank you for your call.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.080
 Andrew, one other question that you just raised.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.080
 If I can.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:49.080
 You mentioned red light earlier, and I just wanted to understand in Dr. Peat's mind the benefits of red light.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:37:00.080
 What does it physiologically do relative to the CO2, whether it's CO2 through putting yourself in a bag or putting yourself in a tub?

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080
 What is it actually?

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.080
 The CO2 itself, I understand, lowers or stops any production of nitric oxide.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.080
 What does the red light do?

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.080
 They're different benefits, are they not?

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.080
 Yeah, very different.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:26.080
 Red light has a variety of effects, all involving action on electrons, which are out of their normal condition or orbit,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:37.080
 especially cytochrome oxidase, copper enzyme, the blue enzyme of the crucial enzyme of oxidative metabolism.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.080
 Stress lowers that activity.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:48.080
 Just going through the night, it lowers its ability to oxidize nutrients.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:57.080
 And just a few minutes of exposure to red light will restore the electronic balance of the copper

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:03.080
 and restore the copper to its relation to the enzyme, activating the enzyme.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:10.080
 But there are a lot of other effects related to inflammation.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:21.080
 For example, radiation poisoning at a lethal dose can be neutralized to the point that the animal will survive by exposing

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:28.080
 within the first hour or so to red light following the X-ray or gamma radiation.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.080
 Excellent.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.080
 Dr. Peat, I really appreciate your reply there.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.080
 We do have two other callers, so I don't mean to rush you, but let's make sure these other callers get their calls in.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:44.080
 And anybody else listening, it's askyourabdocterkmedia@gmail.com, 91.1 FM, from now until 8 o'clock.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.080
 Oh, there goes the lights.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.080
 I think we have three callers, 707-923-3911.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.080
 Okay, let's take this next caller.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.080
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080
 Where are you from?

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.080
 From Portland, Oregon.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.080
 Portland, Oregon.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.080
 Yeah, go ahead.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:12.080
 So one question is, perhaps it's a fad, but what are the benefits of drinking 16 ounces of celery juice a day?

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.080
 Sophie, go ahead.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.080
 Well, celery juicing is a real craze in the U.K. right now.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.080
 Maybe it is here as well.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.080
 Not really, not too much.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:28.080
 Yeah, people are juicing about three whole heads and stems of celery juice each morning.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:34.080
 I don't know specifically what it is, but I think there's a huge amount of minerals in there, including potassium.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.080
 And people do seem to feel much better on it and lose some water retention.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:44.080
 Okay, Dr. Peat, what do you know about celery juice and its activity?

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:53.080
 I know celery seed is definitely used in the treatment of gout as a waste-clearing mechanism for the kidneys.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.080
 But do you know much about celery juicing?

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.080
 I think the main problem is quite a few people are allergic to it.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.080
 All right.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080
 Okay.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.080
 Can I ask one quick one?

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.080
 Yeah, go ahead, quickly.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:14.080
 So, Dr. Peat, how much sugar do you consume a day and what are the ways that you get it?

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.080
 Is it white sugar and fruit juice?

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:31.080
 I try to get it all from fruit, but when I don't have good fruit, then I fill in with white refined sugar.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:38.080
 And I try to get more than half of my calories from sugar.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080
 There you go.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.080
 So, like a thousand calories?

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.080
 Oh, no, more like 1,500 to 1,600.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.080
 Okay.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:41:01.080
 Yeah, I was going to say when you're thinking and you're processing information and you're sitting on the computer and you're researching stuff and answering calls, the brain is very hungry.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.080
 Okay, next caller.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.080
 You're on the air.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080
 Where are you from?

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.080
 What's your question?

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.080
 Hi, I'm from Australia.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:18.080
 My question is I've had some blood tests done recently and my circulating iron is fine, but my iron, my ferritin is actually quite low.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:28.080
 And I've been eating a thyroid supportive diet for over 12 months now and following a lot of your methods, Dr. Peat.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:33.080
 But the doctor is suggesting that I should have some iron injections.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:41.080
 When I eat my red meat, I have that with orange juice to try and increase the absorption, but still it's quite low.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:50.080
 I'm just wondering whether I should have those injections or if there's another method that I can use to increase my iron levels.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.080
 How was the iron measured as the first?

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:55.080
 It was blood tests.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:03.080
 The ferritin was 6 micrograms per litre.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:09.080
 Was it saturation of transferrin?

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:13.080
 Iron saturation.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.080
 Transferrin.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.080
 Yeah, transferrin saturation done.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.080
 Yes, 3.5 grams per litre.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.080
 What was the percentage?

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.080
 3.5 grams per litre.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.080
 Yes.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.080
 No, I mean the percentage of the saturation.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.080
 They haven't given a percentage.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:38.080
 The results I've got, you've got 3.5 grams per litre.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.080
 That would be hemoglobin, wouldn't it?

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:53.080
 It says transferrin and then it's got TIBC of 76 micro millimoles per litre.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:43:00.080
 Saturation 10, ferritin 6, iron 7.8.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:06.080
 We might use different measures here.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:18.080
 Well, Dr. Peat, your rationale for increasing, I know you're always wary about increasing iron as it's extremely reactive and powerful oxidant.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:38.080
 But in terms of what the lady is talking about having done those things dieterally, what would be another step so far as your perspective is concerned for raising this lady's iron and her hemoglobin and getting her saturation back up?

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:46.080
 The hemoglobin depends on body temperature for one thing.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:54.080
 Thyroid is required for absorbing copper from your diet.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:16.080
 And the copper is needed for integrating the iron with the blood and getting your waking temperature up to close to normal, close to 98 degrees at waking and 98.6 during the day.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:24.080
 And making sure that your arms and legs are warm, close to your body temperature.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:30.080
 It's possible to have a normal oral temperature and still have very cold feet.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:35.080
 And the blood is made in your long bones so they have to be warm.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:46.080
 And thyroid is the main factor keeping the blood synthesis going and the copper absorption to use the iron.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:59.080
 And you can get a very high intake of iron in a safe way if you eat some liver and eggs every day and have orange juice with it.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:09.080
 I am having liver about 200 grams per week. I have probably two eggs every second day.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:27.080
 My rising temperature is usually around 36. I don't know the conversion to Fahrenheit so I'm not sure. But I am doing all those things to improve.

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:35.080
 But my stores are still low 12 months later so there's nothing else I can do. You wouldn't recommend having the iron injections?

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:51.080
 If your iron saturation is down around 5% or lower then that might justify it. Have you tried oral supplements?

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.080
 I haven't at this stage.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:46:12.080
 I've known people who had such terrible effects from iron injections that I think if you're seriously low in saturation then I think the first thing would be if the liver and eggs haven't worked.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.080
 And oysters are another very good source.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.080
 I have those as well.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:22.080
 How about from a herbal perspective Sophie because I know you've dealt with this before.

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:28.080
 Traditionally speaking to strengthen the blood but I've also seen in practice nettle can help.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:33.080
 Is this regular stinging nettle? Is it an infusion or are you talking about an extract?

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:40.080
 It's a tea or a juice. And then also black strapped molasses but that also is because it has iron content and I think also has copper.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:46.080
 But black strapped molasses daily and strong nettle tea might help.

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:52.080
 I suppose the fear is if you have a hemorrhage or if you have an accident that your stores aren't there.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.080
 Okay we do have three other callers.

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.080
 Thank you for your time.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.080
 Thank you for calling in but we've got three more so let's get the next one call away from. What's your question?

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:04.080
 Hi I'm from Texas. I have two questions for Dr. Peat.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:13.080
 Okay we'll make them quick. Dr. Peat if we can make your responses fairly quick these next couple of people will get a chance to ask a question too before 8 o'clock.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:23.080
 Yeah so first what can be done for someone who has a high temperature and pulse but still has chronic fatigue and other hypothyroid symptoms?

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:30.080
 Okay from an adrenaline perspective. Dr. Peat somebody with a high waking temperature and still has lethargy.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:50.080
 Yeah checking your vitamin D level and your calcium intake those support your thyroid function and magnesium and calcium are necessary for the thyroid to work right.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:57.080
 And you would equate that waking temperature to be an adrenaline based stress hormone dominated physiology?

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:09.080
 Yeah you should check your pulse rate at the same time as your waking temperature but also about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:23.080
 And if your temperature is steady even after you've had some carbohydrate, fruit juice and such then it might be something other than high adrenaline.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.080
 Okay and what was your second question caller?

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:35.080
 Yeah I was wondering if you've heard of chlorine dioxide and if you think it would help for reductive stress issues like autistic symptoms.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:52.080
 I think there are lots of antiseptic agents that are safer than that. It isn't especially dangerous but long term use could promote cancer.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:49:05.080
 Things like food fibers, any kind of fibrous food that goes through you without causing inflammation or gas will help to disinfect your intestine.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.080
 And Sophie you wanted to interject here.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:13.080
 Yeah I personally have experienced brain irritation myself in the past and I've definitely linked it to my gut.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:23.080
 And one of the things I've used for patients in the past and for myself also is a herb called cat's claw which is very anti-inflammatory on the gut and anti-microbial etc.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.080
 But it's also I believe got some research for brain inflammation too.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:34.080
 Excellent. Okay so let's get this next caller. Caller you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080
 Is that me?

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.080
 Yeah that's you. Go ahead. What's your question? Where are you from?

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:45.080
 I'm from the Garberville area and I'm calling because this is a very pertinent show for me.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:52.080
 I'm nearly seven months pregnant with my first child and we're choosing to go a very natural route.

00:49:52.080 --> 00:50:01.080
 In our local paper here, The Independent just Tuesday, they published that there's a potential outbreak of whooping cough also known as pertussis in our area.

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:06.080
 There have been a few cases recorded so far this year. They're not labeling it as an outbreak yet.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:13.080
 But I had a couple of questions about the treatments recommended by Sophie with the garlic and the thyme syrup.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:21.080
 Are those safe enough and recommended to be safe enough for small children, infants?

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:29.080
 Also is the thyme syrup meant to be made from fresh thyme or dried thyme?

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:38.080
 And if Sophie wouldn't mind repeating those four wonderful useful things that the thyme syrup does that's helpful with whooping cough. Thank you.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.080
 Yeah of course. So thyme syrup is usually made from dried thyme.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:53.080
 And the four actions of thyme are it's anti-tussive, reduces the cough reflex. It's expectorant, it helps you cough the phlegm up.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:59.080
 It's antiseptic and it's also anti-edematous so it reduces swelling in the airways too.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.080
 That's wonderful. Do you think it's safe enough to use on very small children?

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:13.080
 Well I used it on my son from, I mean to be honest with you, with my son I happily gave it to him from about six months onward.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:20.080
 And if he had a need I possibly would have given it to him earlier too but in much much reduced doses.

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.080
 I mean you may be able to give drop doses even.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:30.080
 Okay good. Thank you. And do you think the garlic sounds fairly innocuous to try something like that on a small child as well?

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.080
 It is innocuous. You just don't want to leave it on for so long that it burns.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.080
 Right. So very quickly.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.080
 Well maybe a couple of minutes.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.080
 Actually I heard a trick to keep it from burning is peel it without actually damaging the skin.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:48.080
 And the trick I heard was to put it in a sock against the infant's foot and just overnight.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.080
 But if you break the actual skin of the bulb then that oil comes out and it burns.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.080
 Oh great.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.080
 So very very gentle peeling.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.080
 Yeah. Okay lovely.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:01.080
 And you get a whole clove of garlic not like sliced clove of garlic.

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:05.080
 Yeah because the oil was more irritating. That's just a trick I'd heard. I don't have a good one.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.080
 Yeah.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:11.080
 I've tried it on myself though and it is very very different. You can hold that clove against you for all day.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.080
 Right. That's great.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:17.080
 Okay Dr. Peat. Do you want to quickly say anything about whooping cough?

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:19.080
 No I haven't had any experience with it.

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.080
 Okay. Alright. Is that the call? We've got through the callers. Okay so.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.080
 Yes. Thank you so much.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:31.080
 You're very welcome. Anybody else? Have you got any calls? You can quickly squeak in a quick one between now and 8 o'clock.

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:36.080
 But I want to have a few minutes here. Okay the engineer is shaking his head going no no no.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:41.080
 Okay. Let's just leave it the way it is and I appreciate people calling in.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:46.080
 Always adds interest to the show and I'm very grateful for the acknowledgement that people are listening

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.080
 even though sometimes we have the shows and we don't get too many callers.

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:57.080
 But as always I keep saying that these things are recorded in posterity and you know they're on the internet

00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:04.080
 and they're on YouTube and I'm going to be speaking with Dr. Peat about something to do about making sure the evidence

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.080
 and the information is actually correct.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.080
 So Dr. Peat let me just thank you very much for your time again this month.

00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:15.080
 We really appreciate it and I'm going to give out some information about you right away.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.080
 Okay. Thanks.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:23.080
 Thank you. Okay so people have listened to the show Dr. Peat's website is www.rayPeat.com.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:28.080
 He's got plenty of articles there. He's been doing this for 40 plus years.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:37.080
 And Sophie Lam, medical herbalist or medical herbalist from England, sorry Scotland, not England, from Scotland.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:42.080
 Gosh you're like a probably a fifth generation or sixth generation herbalist.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.080
 Anyway it's alive and well in Scotland and your dad's 82.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:51.080
 He's been doing this for a long time and he is very much alive and well doing it.

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:56.080
 And if you've got any way that people would reach you perhaps you might want to share with people.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:03.080
 Yeah well my sleep specific site is called donecountingsheep.com.

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:06.080
 So d-o-n-e counting sheep.com.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.080
 That's dedicated to sleep.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:11.080
 But I also have my own website which is sophielam.com.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:15.080
 And you're a member of the College of Practicing Phytotherapists, CPP in England.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.080
 Very good. Okay.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.080
 Okay so for those people that have tuned in I appreciate you calling.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:28.080
 I can be reached Monday through Friday, any time I guess really because it's a toll free number

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.080
 and I may not answer the phone but leave a message.

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.080
 I will always get back to you.

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:39.080
 You can email me andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com or 1-888-WBM-HERB.

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:46.080
 And as I said before on the last couple of shows we are intending to get a, what do you want to call it,

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:58.080
 an authoritative source of Dr. Peat's information, his tireless explanation scientifically

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.080
 so that people can see it for what it really is.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.080
 And we love to see real science in action.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:10.080
 I am totally an advocate of scientifically backed medicine, herbal medicine, alternative medicines.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.080
 There's no reason to ban any of it.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.080
 Let's just be rational about this and produce good results for people.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.080
 That's all we want to do is see people get better.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:24.080
 So until the third Friday of next month, actually you know what, I won't be here.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.080
 Third Friday of next month, that's right, August next month I will not be here.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:34.080
 So it's going to be September. So I need to check in with the studio about that so I get a replacement.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.080
 But next month I will not be here.

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.080
 But back again in September.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:43.080
 So until the third Friday of September, I wish you all good night and thanks for joining in.
