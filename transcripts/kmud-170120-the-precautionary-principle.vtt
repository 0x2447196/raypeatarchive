00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Well, once again, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.480
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.240
 they run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.600
 We're both licensed medical herbalists. We practice here in Northern California.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.360
 We see a wide range of people and increasingly are consulting with people by telephone across

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:34.640
 the country. As usual, it has become very popular and almost indispensable because of the wealth of

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 information and the alternative approach to the same subjects that we felt we knew at one point

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.120
 in time, but it's certainly getting a re-education. We'll be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat, PhD,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:56.480
 who spent the last 40 years in research, providing a wealth of newsletters. He's written several

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.280
 books. It's probably more like 50 years now. And he doesn't sell anything. So that's the kind of

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.280
 neat thing. He's very altruistic. And I know from just personally how much time he gives freely

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.440
 in terms of me asking him questions about various clients with getting his perspective

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.800
 and his insight onto it. And also I've heard from hundreds of people from all over the country and

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.080
 all around the world, from people from Australia, from Europe, Canada, who have written to me and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.480
 said that they either got responses from him or they consulted in the past with him. And some

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.480
 people have talked about 20 or 30 years and they've been following what he's been advocating.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.120
 So I'm always very pleased to have him on the show. There is something new I wanted to make

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.880
 sure that people that are listening to the show tonight take note of because the call-in number

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.280
 has changed. So I'm looking at this new temporary call-in number. It used to be 9233911, but the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.960
 temporary number here is now 777. We got a 707 area code. Yeah, 707 area code. That's if you're

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:20.560
 in the area. 777-5397. I still imagine there is a 1-800 number. They haven't said anything about

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.040
 that changing and I'll confirm that with the, yeah, we think that's probably still the same.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:39.600
 That's 1-800-568-3723. 1-800-568-3723. That's 800 K-M-U-D-RAD. So the regular number for people

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.080
 in the area, the 707 number again, and I'll call this out again a bit later, is 777-5397.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.040
 So from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.560
 questions related to this month's subject of exploring the precautionary principle.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.720
 And people are welcome to call in regarding the show or if they have other questions,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.520
 Dr. Raymond Peake is always very keen to answer questions and he's always got a,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.760
 he always has a remedy or an explanation even for the strangest questions. So

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.680
 not that you should ask strange questions to test him, but anyway, so I just want to open the show.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.200
 I did a little bit of digging around this morning knowing that the subject was going to be this

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.520
 phrase "precautionary principle". So the term "cautionary" or "precautionary principle" is not

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.680
 a new concept. It has its roots in antiquity and is the maxim supporting the heritage of herbal

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.520
 medicine. First, do no harm. The Hippocratic oath by which all practitioners of medicine still swear

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.120
 allegiance is the same and its meaning remains unchanged, though modern practices have swerved

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.360
 off the road and are far from on the straight and narrow path leading to safe and effective

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.440
 medicines which we could all benefit from in this time of knowledge. We know the Greek legend of

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.280
 Pandora and her box once opened and in the world it could never be put back in and the price to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.760
 humanity was great. So I ask you the question, why does nature not come up with the best way forward

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.360
 and why do we seek to usurp it rather than learn from it and use it as a guide as we should?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.280
 Some good scientists do, no doubt, but we live in a world ruled by greed and power, especially

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.960
 over others, and are far from a universally altruistic state. GMOs, for example, are very

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:39.600
 contentious and it completely defies logic to have Chernobyls and Fukushimas all over the planet with

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:47.360
 waste-lasting millennia and weapons of truly mass destruction with us always. Pandora's box was open

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 for sure, but we are lured by the potential of virtually limitless clean energy by fusion reaction

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.080
 as we are by the lies that the GMO scientists foster regarding feeding the starving planet's

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.920
 population. The precautionary principle as applied to medicines and foods can be seen in Europe

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.960
 where it is codified into law, but purposely not here in the US. This is up for discussion and

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.160
 whilst not a political show, the politics of nations with their attendant controlling vested

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.800
 interests and lobbyists most definitely are implicated in the lack thereof. Now the world

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.320
 charter for nature adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982 was the first international

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.440
 endorsement of the precautionary principle and the principle was implemented in an international

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.040
 treaty as early as 1987 at the Montreal Protocol and among other international treaties and

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.800
 declarations is reflected in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.960
 signed at the UN Conference on Environment and Development. Now the United States has opposed

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.160
 the use of the term principle because this term has special connotations in legal language

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.320
 due to the fact that the principle of law is a source of law. Now this is the legal status of

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.640
 the precautionary principle in the European Union and it has informed much EU policy including areas

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.720
 beyond environmental policy down to general product safety, the use of additives for use in

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.320
 animal nutrition, the incineration of waste and the regulation of genetically modified organisms.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.600
 And another point as I have mentioned the nuclear industry is Chris Busby's article

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.120
 which we'll get into later and the invocation in Europe of the Euratom suicide clause.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:39.200
 So without much further ado Dr Peat are you with us? Yep. Thanks so much for joining us again we

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:46.880
 do appreciate your giving your time. So getting into the precautionary principle and I know we

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:54.480
 have covered you know the concept the Hippocratic Oath, first do no harm, medical fraud etc.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.400
 But what is it we wanted to bring out here with the precautionary principle given that it's law

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:08.160
 in Europe and it's not here and let's go and start this discussion by opening up with where you are

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:18.560
 most intimately concerned with this for the good of change. Just after I got out of graduate school

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:30.480
 and was doing consulting and practical projects people were talking about whether natural

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:40.640
 remedies were any better than pharmaceutical chemical remedies and that started me thinking

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:49.760
 about what the difference really is and a substance such as progesterone I think is a good

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:57.520
 illustration. Just yesterday someone asked me told me the story of his wife being prescribed

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:07.120
 a new synthetic progestin. I looked up some articles on it and they described it as being

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.720
 designed to resemble as closely as possible the natural molecule progesterone and a couple other

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:24.880
 molecules in the last 10 years or so have claimed that they are closer than any of the other

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:37.040
 synthetic progestins to natural progesterone and that is very interesting that progesterone

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:49.040
 has existed in animals since animals began and these other substances in the case of this recent

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:58.880
 one it has existed in the universe only for 10 years and so we pretty well know that natural

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:07.680
 progesterone is safe because it has been doing its thing in organisms forever. This new one

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:20.320
 has a group on it a cyanide group that never was attached to a natural steroid molecule

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:31.120
 so it's undoubtedly doing many things that natural progesterone doesn't do but how soon will we know

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.560
 what the ultimate side effects of this historically unique intervention in the organism,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:46.320
 what will they be 100 years from now in the descendants of the people who are being treated

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.840
 with it now. And why did they put the cyanide on there is that to make it a patentable medicine?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:00.240
 That's part of it yeah they are making things as close to progesterone as they can but they

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.480
 can't patent progesterone so they have something as close to it as they can get but the actual

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.040
 natural substance is cheap and the drug companies aren't interested in

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.320
 promoting something with very little profit because everyone can compete.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:32.560
 When you use herbal remedies even if there is one specific active agent that you're looking for

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:46.960
 like in a foxglove, the digit dallas type effect, you're not only going to have

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:55.440
 supporting surrounding metabolites that are acting somewhat like drugs but you know that

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:06.640
 that natural form of the molecule has existed in plant cells since the plant became what it is.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:18.400
 And the fact is that the structure and the biochemistry of plant and animal cells is

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:27.440
 very similar. We have the same basic types of enzymes and energy producing reactions.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.640
 Photosynthesis is the main difference between plants and animals and movement.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:44.240
 Animals have specialized movement systems but for the basic chemistry plants are very

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.600
 parallel to animals and so we know that those molecules are compatible with at least many kinds

00:11:51.600 --> 00:12:02.880
 of life where if you invent a molecule it might seem very similar but you really can't know until

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:11.920
 you have tried it for the whole lifetime of a particular organism and in the case of

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:26.000
 diethylstilbestrol, DES, it was introduced as an estrogen to treat menopause and to improve

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 pregnancy. It was called the female hormone and so the argument was that if you were having

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.360
 trouble carrying a pregnancy that was because something was defective in your femaleness so

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:52.000
 they gave you more of the female hormone and there were already many things known about the harm of

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:01.520
 the molecule at that time but it was given to millions of women and 20 or 30 years later they

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:10.240
 were seeing that the children both male and female and even the grandchildren apparently have been

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:25.680
 injured by their mother's use of this synthetic estrogen. So that shows that the development of

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:35.440
 sickness which in the case of cancer an individual might not show the fact that they got cancer from

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:43.760
 an exposure to a chemical might be 40 years after the exposure so with a six-month animal study you

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:53.200
 aren't going to have a clue as to whether it might cause cancer in the old age of the person who

00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:03.360
 uses it or even in their children or grandchildren and now in the last 15 or 20 years the idea of

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:14.000
 epigenetic change has been accepted and what you do to one individual is now recognized to have the

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:24.160
 effect several generations into the future and one of those common effects which is now recognized

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:35.120
 as a type of epigenetic change or damage is called genomic instability where even the DNA

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:45.520
 which might not be mutated in the first day or week or year of exposure but the genome itself

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:54.080
 becomes destabilized even in subsequent generations so that there are mutations

00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:00.080
 being created in later generations from an early exposure.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:14.720
 Estrogen and ionizing radiation have many overlapping similarities. You can get a

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:23.680
 synergy between a certain dose of radiation and a certain dose of energy of estrogen which is

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:34.720
 more than additive. It's like adding extra radiation to an x-ray if you have

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:41.440
 an exposure already to estrogen. So it's like a potentiating effect. Yeah.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:50.640
 So let me just expand this concept of the precautionary principle. So just for people

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:57.360
 that are listening I hadn't actually heard of this specific principle and didn't recognize

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:09.440
 that actually it was a point in law written into law in the European Union so that what it seeks

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:17.520
 to do and correct me if I'm wrong it seems seeks to bring a real legal action into play against

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:25.200
 malfeasant activities perpetrated by different companies who would bring a product to market

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:32.480
 and subsequently harm people because they either didn't do enough testing or they covered up the

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.560
 testing and will get into the fraud side of medicine which is fairly well known in terms

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:46.240
 of how prevalent it is. But that this law there actually protects well I guess it protects people

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.120
 that have been hurt and injured and or the covers the cost of environmental cleanup.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:58.480
 And I did notice that a lot of it initially was aimed at environmental effects of degradation

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.160
 degradative effects of whatever substance that was leaked into the environment,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:11.200
 polluted rivers etc. So initially there was a lot of environmental things and I think the Earth

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:19.280
 Summit etc. was the forbearer of what later became not through lack of being initiated in the

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:26.400
 beginning but from a rollover effect became things to involve medicines, food safety,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:32.080
 you know very many different things that you would come into contact with as an organism yourself and

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.520
 maybe not be directly responsible for but were you know exposed to it from the companies producing it

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:44.240
 so that there is a direct recourse in law. But the American and I'm not saying this is wrong and I'm

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:51.120
 really not saying one is better than the other but what I'd like you to bring out later is the

00:17:51.120 --> 00:18:01.360
 benefit of the obvious results of careful testing, careful planning, true scientific evaluation of

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:08.880
 the facts, not covering up any skewed results to put your product in a bad light but being totally

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:16.800
 honest and I think this is where all of the concept of fraud and damage and claims and insurance and

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:22.160
 all the things that put up the cost of everything to everybody because it's all additive in its

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:29.520
 own right. It's really just down to dishonesty at the heart of it all. I think if you look at

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:38.480
 why these things happen and why GlaxoSmithKline pay out 36 billion in reparations for drugs

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.200
 and that's just one of them. I think about things like Vioxx and other companies that have produced

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:52.400
 drugs that have been shown to give sudden death or they give people dementia or whatever it is,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.680
 you know it's a harmful effect and so the whole tenet of first do no harm it's got to be the most

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:03.600
 important thing and that really goes hand in hand with being totally honest and being scientific

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.120
 about what you're doing so that you're open to scrutiny. It's thrown out there, it's peer-reviewed

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.560
 etc and the results are what the results are and you move forward and that's how real progress is

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:22.240
 made. I'm not saying that a lot of times things can be born out of mistakes and turn out to produce

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.040
 better things but in terms of the precautionary principle and European law covering that and

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:34.960
 we'll get into the, you mentioned earlier that this character Busby, Chris Busby in England,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:41.840
 he's basically bringing this what they call the Euratom suicide clause and we'll bring out here

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:50.160
 a little bit later on just how many more deaths have now been attributed to radioactive waste

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:57.040
 either from Sellafield in England, radioactive material being incinerated and or dumped into

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.960
 the oceans, washed up on the shores, big leukemia incidences, whether it's Chernobyl and all the

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.400
 people dying there with thyroid cancer, whether it's in Japan from Nagasaki and Hiroshima and how

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.440
 that all brought out what the effects of radiation were and the American government definitely

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.240
 downplayed it so they could maintain research but what he said now and again we'll get into

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:26.880
 this a bit later on but he said that ultimately it's almost 150 times the relative risk that was

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:36.000
 given in the publication that showed this so that it was more like 90,000 people a year are dying

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.840
 as a direct result of Hiroshima and Nagasaki annually, it's not like a one-time thing,

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:47.840
 it's an annual event and it's ultimately it's complete and out corporate manslaughter and so

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:54.240
 he wants to try and through the European court ultimately bring around the end of

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:01.920
 radioactive waste being dumped and whole nuclear power stations being a thing of the past and

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:06.800
 you know nuclear energy being a thing of the past. I just wanted to get back to the medicines,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:13.360
 Dr. Eaton, you mentioned if these some of these drugs are causing genetic problems and cancers

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.400
 40 years later and then in the grandchildren of mothers who took synthetic estrogen type drugs

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.760
 whilst pregnant, how can drug companies test these products safely? I mean would they have

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:31.520
 seen some problems within a reasonable amount of time in animal studies? Yeah, by the 1930s,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.800
 years before the estrogens came on the pharmaceutical market, they were already

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:49.520
 identified as very potent carcinogens and promoters of brain defects, movement disorders,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:22:00.800
 personality changes, inflammation of practically all tissue, cancer development in every organ of

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:11.200
 the body, not just the breast and uterus but brain, kidney, lung, all types of cancer were

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:19.840
 already known at the time that these came on the market and that they were abortifacient. Estrogen

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:30.720
 was clearly identified before 1940 as a powerful birth control or actually early abortifacient.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:41.600
 And despite that, it was sold for almost 20 years to prevent miscarriage, exactly the opposite of

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:52.480
 what it was known to actually do. So fraud was the driving force behind the whole estrogen

00:22:52.480 --> 00:23:01.360
 replacement therapy so-called. It started with the knowledge that it was in many cases doing

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.160
 exactly the opposite of what they were selling it to do. But what do you think about new drugs

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.640
 that they might not have that knowledge? I mean do you think there's ways to safely test them?

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:19.920
 Yeah, often they still currently have the knowledge and hide it or don't want to look for it.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:29.840
 If someone suspects that it might have a certain kind of effect, they will carefully avoid in

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:39.680
 their applications for approval. They will avoid discussion of the mechanisms that could

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:51.760
 cause it to be harmful. The whole DNA revolution, it happens that there were changes in the way

00:23:51.760 --> 00:24:00.160
 people were thinking about the nature of science at the same time that the biology was being

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:10.640
 shifted over to a study of the DNA molecule rather than actual the facts of inheritance.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:24.960
 And I see it as a coordinated effort sponsored by the government to support

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:34.080
 industry in its ability to evade responsibility. If you just look at ordinary liability,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:44.960
 you know, the ordinary liability principles in law would make it impossible for many of these

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:56.320
 industries to function. The insurance needed for a nuclear plant would be prohibitive. The insurance

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.760
 needed for vaccines and for many drugs. Well, they're indemnified, aren't they, for vaccines?

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.560
 They're legally indemnified and held unblameable. He's saying that because the insurance would be

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:14.240
 so great. They're just, they get off without having to get any insurance. Yeah, and even

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:24.160
 without putting this explicitly into the law as indemnification beforehand, the cleanup projects

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:32.960
 of the great chemical contaminants around the country, these are being done at public taxpayer

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:39.520
 expense rather than holding the profiting corporations responsible for the full cost of

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.840
 clean up. So it's a win-win situation for the offending corporations and a lose-lose for the

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:50.800
 taxpayers and the general population. Yeah. Great. Well, you're listening to Ask Your Web, Dr. KMED

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.080
 Garboville, 91.1 FM from 7.30 till the end of the show. Callers are welcome to call in with any

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.120
 questions either related to this or unrelated to this month's subject or the precautionary principle.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:10.080
 There's a number in the 707 area that's changed and it's 707-777-5397. If you're on the web and

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.000
 you're listening and you're in different countries, like you've had people phoning from Australia and

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.080
 Well, actually, they'll have to call us. I don't know, a seven number. Okay. I'm just pointing out

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.560
 In the country. There is an 800 number and I think some people have tried the Skype number,

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.800
 but I'm not too sure if that is available. But anyway, there's an 800 number. It's 800-568-3723

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:36.640
 and obviously the show can be downloaded anytime after the end of the show for people that are in,

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.640
 you know, different countries or different time zones and they want to hear the full content of

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:46.880
 the show. So, Dr. Peat, where are we going? So, I was thinking the last things we were talking about

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:54.320
 in terms of indemnification of these corporations basically being protected by the government and

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.120
 the government being bought out by lobbyists. I think that's a very important point that adds to

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:08.160
 the fact that America did not sign on to this precautionary principle. Yeah, the government

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:17.200
 not only is working for the corporations in their immediate liabilities protecting them,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:30.640
 but if you go back to the late 1930s again in the 1940s, even the very nature of the way science is

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:40.640
 done and the philosophy of science of what explains the goodness of science, the government

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:49.840
 has intervened in ways that support this irresponsibility of the corporations. If you

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:59.680
 look at ancient science from Aristotle's time on down to about the 19th century, you see that

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:09.280
 cause and effect were central ideas and around the middle of the last century, people started

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:21.440
 as saying that with the quantum physics ideas, they were starting to question whether cause and

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:30.000
 effect was a real thing. And that's very nice for the polluting corporations. But there are people

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:41.520
 now, foundations and lawyers hired by corporations going around the country denying the common sense

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:50.640
 idea of cause and effect and saying that if you claim that this is dangerous, the thing that we're

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:59.040
 selling you, you have to prove absolutely that you are being harmed by it or killed by it or whatever.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.160
 You're saying this is the get out clause that America has in terms of its

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.720
 policy? Yeah, it's putting all the responsibility on the consumer.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:13.600
 Interesting. And then you have to have enough money and enough time and manpower to fight it.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:16.480
 Let me just hold that thought one second, Dr. Peay, I don't mean to interrupt you,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.000
 but we did get somebody calling in. So let's take this caller and see where we're going with this

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.840
 call. Where are you from, caller? What's your question? Hi, my name is Jeremy. I'm calling

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:29.760
 from Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia. Yes, sir. Cool. What's your question, Jeremy? Well,

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.160
 I have a question a little off topic for Dr. Peay. It's about progesterone and my wife.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:42.960
 We've been poof of free for about two years now, and we've been trying to kind of overcome her

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:50.320
 estrogen dominance. She's 32 and she's been struggling with estrogen dominance ever since

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.880
 she was probably about eight when she hit puberty. She's had really inconsistent periods and all that.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:05.520
 Her waking temps in the morning had been at 94.9 and just removing the poof, we were able to get

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:13.280
 it up to 97.1. And then back in June, we started doing progesterone with that. And we were following

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:20.160
 Dr. Lee's progesterone therapy and doing about 100 milligrams a day. And it actually started her

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:27.680
 cycles up. She was not having cycles at all. And they were very erratic. And then they kind of

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:33.280
 stabilized into a very short two-week cycle. And she was very consistent, but had a lot of PMS

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:38.640
 symptoms still. So I started doing more research on it and found out that some women were doing

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:44.800
 like 700 milligrams a day or more. So they were using their symptoms to dose. So we started doing

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:51.760
 the same thing using a 10% topical cream. And she's currently taking 900 milligrams per day,

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.920
 which we broke up into three, 300 milligram doses. She's doing it at each meal. And she's been doing

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.520
 that since October. And that's topical? It's topical, yeah. And are you cycling it two weeks

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:09.920
 on, two weeks off? No, because she's still continuing her two-week cycle. So she hasn't

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:18.480
 even been having any sort of-- well, until the past month, when the two-week cycle starts,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.880
 she actually won't-- the flow never begins. She'll spot for three or four days, and then it stops.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:32.160
 And so it's like something is starting to tip with it. But I was concerned because that seems

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.920
 like an incredibly high dose. We've also been doing thyroid as well. We've been doing desiccated

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:43.120
 beef thyroid. She's been doing 40 milligram tablets. And we had slowly ramped up to the

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:49.280
 point where we are now where she's doing one an hour for 12 hours out of the day.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:53.040
 One 40 milligram desiccated thyroid tablet, you're saying?

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:59.920
 That's quite a bit. Dr. Peat, what do you think about this two-week cycle? And what do you think

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:05.520
 about that amount of thyroid glandular? And topical progesterone?

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:15.520
 Yeah, depending on what the vehicle is, sometimes only a very tiny fraction, 5% or less sometimes,

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.760
 of the progesterone used topically is actually getting into the body.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:32.880
 So it's really important to check, have a blood test once in a while. And the liver is always

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:42.160
 regulating the hormones. And when you are using progesterone all month, the liver

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:52.320
 develops over the first two weeks the ability to excrete it quickly. And so the following weeks,

00:32:52.320 --> 00:33:01.840
 you're excreting it almost as fast as you can put it in. And the natural cycle has a rest of

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:09.840
 two weeks where the liver resets itself. So that a small amount being produced or absorbed

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.920
 will have a full effect. And then after about two weeks, the liver will start

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:22.880
 excreting it faster. So its effect is reduced. So that's why we recommend that you take an

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.760
 internal progesterone like the Progest-E that you can find on the internet and then cycle it from

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:34.000
 full moon to new moon and then stop from new moon to full moon. And then hopefully you'll get into

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.120
 a cycle where you're ovulating at the full moon. That's when you start your Progest-E. And then

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.840
 you take that until new moon, which then you should have a period.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:54.400
 The thyroid products are extremely variable. It's important to watch for changes in your

00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:03.680
 temperature and pulse rate and many other indicators like the color of lips and warmth

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:13.600
 of the fingers, the quality of sleep and digestion. And usually low thyroid, high estrogen,

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:24.960
 people have digestive problems. The estrogen tends to recycle when your thyroid is low. It

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:32.080
 is reabsorbed after being excreted into the intestine by the liver. It's reabsorbed

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:40.720
 and keeps the level high even when you aren't producing it. And so fiber in the diet,

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:47.920
 a raw carrot every day, sometimes is enough to get the estrogen down to the point that the cycles

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:56.240
 are normalized. And especially the combination of a daily raw carrot and thyroid enough to keep your

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.280
 pulse and temperature up. And if you want a temperature and pulse chart,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.040
 so you can chart it out and see what you're getting up to with your temperatures and pulses

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:11.040
 15 to 90 minutes after eating breakfast and lunch, you can email us and we'll gladly send that to

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.000
 you so that you can have a look at it and it has the normal values of what you should be reaching.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.600
 Because 97.1 is an okay waking temperature, but after you eat, it should go up to at least 98.2

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:35.280
 to 98.6 or 99. Yeah, she's been hitting 97.9, 98 after eating. And her temperature has been

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.760
 slowly, her waking temperature has been slowly rising. She actually hit 97.5 this morning.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.040
 So it seems like everything's moving in a positive direction. We are doing the raw carrot every day

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.800
 as well. We have been for about three months. And that's why I was just concerned because I

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.240
 know I've heard you talk about much lower doses of these things, you know, causing effects. And

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.160
 I was just worried that, you know, we're doing this really high dosing and it does seem to be

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:05.680
 working. There's no negative side effects, but it certainly seems like there should have been

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.160
 more substantial improvement in that period of time. I do find there's a very wide range of

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:16.880
 dose that people report back saying they use this much, they use that much.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:23.920
 It does happen even with herbs, well, especially with things like cascara in terms of how much it

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.600
 takes to elicit an easy bowel movement. And there are plenty of other herbs out there that some

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.760
 people quite easily consume, you know, 15 mil a day. And other people don't need anywhere near

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.240
 as much to get the same response. Things like valerian for sleep, it really wakes some people

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.440
 up, you know. So it is very variable physiologically how people react to things.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.920
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about the 40 milligrams of desiccated every hour?

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:55.840
 What would the total be in the 24-hour period?

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.200
 I think you said 12 hours, once an hour for 12 hours.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.560
 480 milligrams.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:12.320
 I've known people who needed that much of even armor thyroid.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.680
 Is that about like six grains?

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.320
 Yeah, that's, you need to make a five-grain tablet of armor. And

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:31.280
 even veterinarians would routinely prescribe that much for a cocker spaniel that weighed 30 pounds.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:39.760
 And I've known people who've needed one or two of those regularly. So it isn't unheard of to

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.760
 need that much, but it's important to watch for the signs.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.720
 Yeah. And also too, products can be different. 40 milligrams of this

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.200
 beef glandular could be very different than 40 milligrams of armor thyroid.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:38:00.240
 Gotcha. So you're saying the science to be looking for, I mean, what we did to find the

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:05.440
 dosing level was basically we had been ramping it up until she began to get nauseous, you know,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.560
 from taking it and then we backed it back down from there and that's kind of where we settled.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.560
 Yeah, that's kind of unusual.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.320
 Everything else seems to be fine. I mean, she's not having any negative side effects at all.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.960
 Everything is functioning. She feels healthy.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.560
 I know the things that Dr. Peat always points out that are symptoms of over,

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:29.120
 overdosing, over consumption will be things like sweating with very minimal exercise,

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.840
 breathlessness with minimal exercise.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.360
 Excessive appetite, overheating during strenuous exercise.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.800
 Well, not strenuous even, but just...

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.960
 And a pulse over 100. You haven't mentioned what her pulse is.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.040
 It's been in the mid 80s most of the time.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:51.200
 Yeah. Yeah. Well, you never know. Here's the other thing with glandulars is

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.760
 it's such a variable product, like Dr. Peat says, you know, I think you could take a dozen different

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.640
 glandular extracts and find different amounts within the same milligram dose of, you know,

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:09.440
 of a glandular. So that's, I think, in some part a reason to advocate synthetics just because they

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:15.360
 are very finely measured. So an Armour thyroid might be a better solution then?

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.200
 Well, Armour should be quantified. Yeah, it should be. There should be a spec sheet that

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.960
 comes with it that will tell you that there are this many micrograms of T3 and T4 and what it

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.840
 would, you know, what that ratio would be should be an ideal ratio.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.840
 Okay. Great. Well, we'll give those things a shot. I really appreciate the show. Thank you guys so

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.080
 much. You're welcome. Thanks. And Dr. Peat, thank you. You've really changed our lives and I really

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:40.560
 appreciate it. So thank you. Thank you. Be cool.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:46.800
 One more thing for that listener is, you know, if she was going to start taking the Progesterone

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.080
 internally, she'd probably want to start with like an eighth of a teaspoon once a day and then maybe

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.280
 go up to twice a day. And an eighth of a teaspoon of Progesterone has 50 milligrams of Progesterone

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.040
 in it. But you know, you absorb it pretty much all of it. Yeah. And if you keep it in your mouth.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.360
 And the cycling is very important. Two weeks off every month.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:09.360
 There you go. That should help her use it, lower dose more effectively.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.480
 Okay. Thank you very much. Yeah, you're welcome. Okay. So we have another caller on the air. So

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.200
 caller, where are you from and what's your question? Hi, I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.240
 Hey, what's your question? And I have two questions. One, what can a man do to reverse

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.840
 male pattern baldness? And then two, how can someone heal or improve a lower back herniated

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:35.040
 disc? Dr. Peat, male pattern baldness is the first question.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:45.920
 It's often associated with low thyroid function. And so for your general health,

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:54.080
 you should look at the whole picture of your cholesterol and body temperature,

00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:06.240
 energy need, calories required and so on. And specifically for the health of the scalp,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:14.080
 there are a few simple things. Caffeine, for example, is a good stimulant of hair follicle,

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:24.480
 hair production, rate of growth and so on. You don't want to put coffee on your head, but

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:34.560
 you can dissolve purified caffeine in rubbing alcohol, for example. And DHEA is another

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:46.400
 natural hormone that sometimes activates hair follicle function. And for a connective tissue,

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:57.120
 and especially the discs, the DHEA and thyroid again are crucial things. If thyroid function is

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:06.880
 low, all of the connective tissues tend to be waterlogged and somewhat soft and lacking

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:19.920
 resistance and elasticity. And DHEA is sometimes just normalizing your serum level of DHEA, which

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:28.000
 might only take five milligrams a day. That can have very quick dramatic effects on connective

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:36.560
 tissues, ligaments, tendons, discs, knee cartilage and so on. You must be careful with DHEA because

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:41.600
 it can raise your estradiol levels. So you might want to have blood checks to make sure that your

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:47.280
 estradiol progesterone ratio is good in women and then your testosterone and estrogen ratio is okay

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.400
 for men. You want to use DHEA. I think the important thing with DHEA is to make sure that

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.160
 thyroid function is adequate enough because otherwise then that conversion to estradiol

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:05.200
 can occur more likely. That's correct, isn't it, Dr. Peat? Yeah. Okay. Thank you for your call.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:12.960
 Okay. So the number, if you live in the area, 707 number has changed. It's 777-5397.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:20.240
 And there's an 800 number if you're not local, that's 800-568-3723. So anyway, to carry on with

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.800
 the precautionary principle subject of tonight, and I think we're going to have to carry this on

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:29.040
 next week because I got lots of other questions here I'd like to ask you, Dr. Peat. I mean next

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.240
 month. I don't think we're going to get a chance this evening. But anyway, it's all good. In terms

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:42.000
 of the cause and effect and what has been turned around, if like in this country whereby the onus

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.240
 is put on the consumer as it were to suffer the consequences and then bring to law or bring to

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:57.440
 court a, you know, a pursuable case, what do you think could be done that more closely models the

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:05.360
 European perspective in law codifying this precautionary principles without stifling

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.360
 innovation? I think I always hear, and I'm not against it, I'm just trying to, I want to bring

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.640
 out a balanced perspective here that in this country, and I love America, God bless America,

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:25.200
 I really do love it, there is an option, an opportunity, the chance and innovation in this

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.960
 country I think is probably world leading. I know there's very brilliant people in China,

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.800
 there's brilliant people in most of Asia. In India. In India, absolutely, you know, so there's

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.720
 many, many peoples in the world all over, they're brilliant people and they're brilliant Russians,

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:45.680
 you know, there's brilliant people all over in many different cultures and countries, but in

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:53.680
 America there is this kind of spirit of entrepreneurship and groundbreaking innovation

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.960
 and I always hear the argument, well that's going to get stifled if we put too many restrictions on,

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:05.440
 you know, say drug development that doesn't bring a product to market and it costs all these

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.400
 billions of dollars and, you know, we're going to stop people from getting involved in this kind of

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.880
 thing. What do we, and I know that's not the case, but I just want to bring out what you're trying to

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:21.360
 bring up in terms of, so this is why not, so what have you got to say about the potential of stifling

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.320
 innovation with legislation like European legislation which tends to be mindlessly

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:34.160
 bureaucratic. How does that get avoided but still have the safety that we would all want to demand

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:42.000
 from a product as consumers? If the government would just stop stifling the exchange of

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:53.760
 information that would, I think, would reduce the need for legislative power and enforcement.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:04.560
 For example, when a product, a drug comes on the market with FDA approval, the FDA should

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:13.280
 make public all of the information that the drug company had at least, but they let the drug

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:22.880
 company keep secrets as business secrets that very often relate to the safety of the product.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:31.440
 So the FDA tends to conspire to keep information away from the public that the public should have

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:37.520
 complete access to if the government is going to say this is an approved thing that

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:45.440
 has the government support. Okay, because I think I'll bring out a little bit later if we have the

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:52.000
 time because we do have a call, but if we have time we'll get into this revelational piece of

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:59.360
 work by this this Jack Chris Busby in England and what he hopes to bring to pass is called the

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:05.600
 Eurotom Suicide Clause where he's basically going to use the same legislation that Europeans have

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.880
 to bring into law the precautionary principle and apply it to nuclear power stations and they

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.480
 are going to fall flat on their face with this one because there's nowhere they can defend it.

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.640
 Okay, so we have a caller on the air, but let's take this caller. Caller, where are you from

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:24.000
 and what's your question? I'm actually from Pepperwood. Pepperwood, okay. So I live locally.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:33.600
 Yeah, okay. What's your question? My question is I have reached the age of 60 and a colonoscopy

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:41.520
 is in my, is what everyone tells me I need to have even though I'm not having any digestive problems

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:49.120
 it seems like something that you know like is a test that you're supposed to have and I'm just

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:55.600
 not sure I was wondering what you all thought about that. Dr. Peat, colonoscopy and possible

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:03.120
 revealing carcinoma in the bowel or... And or possible complications. What would you advise,

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:10.640
 Dr. Peat? Right, it's just you know seems like a routine thing when you reach a certain age they

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:16.960
 want you to have it now and it seems you know like it is I mean I know they've done

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:25.360
 thousands of them and but it seems it is another thing that's invasive and if your body's not

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:33.120
 experiencing any problems I'm wondering can you hold off or is this something that's that

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:40.480
 is important I mean I know you want to prevent colon cancer but I'm just

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:47.600
 concerned about you know complications of surgery whatnot.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:59.120
 My position is pretty extreme and I urge people to learn as much as they can but

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:10.240
 on colonoscopy if there's no radiation involved it's just a matter of the mechanics of it and

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:19.040
 possibly the toxic effects of any sedative or anesthetic that they might use but

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:35.040
 when you relate it to the commonly done CAT scans and various x-ray exams I would put it on

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:48.240
 the potentially justified medical procedure while I would exclude almost always the CAT scans and

00:49:49.840 --> 00:50:02.800
 radiation exams. The basic argument is that they find a certain amount of polyps that are

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:13.120
 precancerous or even have definite cancer in them that can be removed. I would just suggest that

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:21.120
 these no one really knows the natural history of a polyp because you would have to have

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:30.640
 colonoscopy every month or so for years to watch the actual development of an individual polyp

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:40.240
 and I suspect that many polyps are the same way that many skin melanomas

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:57.360
 simply fall off and go away without even being noticed. So there's a certain ambiguity in the

00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:05.200
 science that's used to justify them. In the few areas of the world where almost no one dies of

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:17.520
 intestinal or rectal cancer the colonoscopy is not done so that there's it happens that there's a

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:26.160
 close correlation between doing colonoscopies and having colon cancer. Right I think the other

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:31.280
 thing I'd like to bring out Dr. Peat to remind me for interrupting but anybody over the age of 50

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:38.080
 pretty much will be found to have some carcinoma somewhere in the body on autopsy correct? Yeah

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:49.360
 and it's been known for since at least the 1940s I think it was in JAMA someone published pictures

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:59.200
 of a biopsy made of various types of superficial injury cuts or stab wounds and such and

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:09.280
 showed that all of the features used to diagnose cancer in a pathological study

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:20.560
 all of these features can be found in an ordinary healing wound. So right from the 1940s

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:32.560
 the documentation by biopsy slides and exam by skilled pathologists all of that has been put

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:40.800
 into question since all of those features abnormal cell arrangement abnormal cell structure and so on

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:48.240
 can be found in any healing wound. So if they had mixed up the slides and had someone's biopsy from

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:54.240
 a healing wound with someone's cancerous polyp they'd see the same thing and misdiagnose someone

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.040
 with a healing wound with cancer is that what you're saying basically? Well it implies that

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:07.600
 if you don't follow that particular tumor or thing that you biopsied if you cut it out and study it

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:16.800
 you don't know whether it was in the process of healing or of not healing and so I think the

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:26.400
 rational approach is to do what you can that promotes healing rather than doing a biopsy.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:35.840
 When you say that Dr. Peate then you mean to eat the right foods for your colon and your basic

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:44.400
 digestive tract health is that what I'm hearing you say? Yeah the areas where they don't get

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:52.080
 colon cancer in effect are areas of Africa where they eat a high fiber diet.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:59.280
 Right. Milk and fiber are very protective for the colon.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:07.840
 Well I won't take all of your time thank you so much that is really very helpful for me.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.920
 Thank you for your call caller. Dr. Peate I know we only have about four minutes left before we

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.960
 have to wrap up the top of the hour with contact information etc but I did want you just and this

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.080
 is off the fly but I know you're going to be happy to answer it I wanted you just to reiterate the

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:33.760
 rationale behind pigments and skin melanosis pigments that are formed in the skin whether

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:42.800
 they be benign pre-cancerous or cancerous and how that effect of that cell change can be mitigated

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:50.480
 with progesterone given that the estrogenic stimulation with that area can certainly be a

00:54:50.480 --> 00:55:03.200
 trigger for carcinoma. Yeah the tanning process is probably related to the formation of molds

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:14.000
 and melanomas the injury done to the cell by ultraviolet light you can create tanning by

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.800
 practically any kind of injury to the skin not just ultraviolet light but it's a reaction to injury

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:29.120
 and so when cells are being injured for example by a progesterone deficiency

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:41.040
 stressed by stimulator substances such as estrogen or some of the nerve transmitter chemicals

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:52.560
 the stress reaction creates a pigment as a defense because the pigment is a free radical scavenger

00:55:54.240 --> 00:56:02.160
 and as long as you're producing the pigment it's defending itself against the free radicals

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:16.160
 so that I think of moles as a defensive reaction a famous Israeli researcher Gershom Zaychek

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:28.400
 has reviewed the evidence on melanoma surgery and he says it's very common for when you remove

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:37.360
 one confirmed melanoma often new ones will pop up almost immediately after the removal

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:45.440
 and he suggests that the presence of one is sending out signals that

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:55.200
 suppress the formation of new ones. Okay because there's definitely a bystander effect as well with

00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:04.640
 cancers and there's definitely the well-documented risk of spread and or alarm alarm signals being

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:10.720
 spread that would then propagate that same reproduction. Anyway Dr. Peat thanks so much

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.640
 for your time we've coming up to a couple of minutes so let me just the lights are buzzing.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:19.280
 Was there anything else you wanted to say Dr. Peat before we close out the show? No just that

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:30.560
 the bystander effect is a vastly under investigated subject it relates to radiation, estrogen,

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:35.920
 any kind of injury spreading everywhere everywhere in the body. It's in the field of quantum mechanics

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:42.080
 right? All right thanks so much for your time. Thank you Dr. Peat. Okay thanks. Okay so thanks

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.280
 for those people that called in for those people that have listened and tried to call at the end

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.240
 of the show here I'm sorry we didn't get to the phone there is a possibility here if you want to

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:56.800
 email you can email either me or Sarah you can go ahead and email me andrew@westernmechanicalmedicine.com

00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.600
 if you have any questions that you didn't get a chance to ask perhaps. Okay so for those people

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:08.640
 that heard Dr. Peat and want to find out more about him www.raypeat.com
