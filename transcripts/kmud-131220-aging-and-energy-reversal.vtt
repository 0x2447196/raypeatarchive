 [Music]

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 my wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM and from 7.30.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 In fact, what we'll do is I think this time round we'll just open up the lines straight off the bat.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 We normally open them up from 7.30 to 8 but people are welcome to call in any time.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So how about that? Let's see what that does to the show's train of thought.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Anyway, okay, so the end of the show is at 8 o'clock.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 You're all invited to call in with questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of aging and energy reversal.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area the toll free number is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Well, this month we had a small amount to finish up from last month's show on misdiagnosis of thyroid conditions

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 but something that came into the limelight if you like and I know it's been looked at for quite a while now

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 and I know Dr. Peat who will be joining us in a moment here has spent a long time researching in his own academic career

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 and that's the aging process.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Well, as it is I generally take a look at the news most every day and I look at the BBC news out of kind of a preference I suppose

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 and I saw an article in the health section of the BBC news

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 and the title was US scientists have performed a dramatic reversal of the aging process in animal studies

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 and this is what I want to bring out with Dr. Peat's history using things like progesterone and thyroid

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 which are definitely anti-aging in their own right and energy creative and energy reserving products.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 So anyway, I just want to quickly read the article out and then introduce Dr. Peat onto the show for those people

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 who perhaps have never heard of him before.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 So the article said that they used a chemical to rejuvenate the muscles in mice

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 and said it was the equivalent of transforming a 60 year old's muscle to that of a 20 year old

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 but they did put in parentheses here but muscle strength did not improve.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 So just the general quality of the muscle or the health, I think it's more appropriate,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 or the energy readiness of the muscle became that of a 20 year old's.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 So their study in the journal Cell identified an entirely new mechanism of aging and then reversed it.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 Other researchers said it was an exciting finding and aging is considered a one-way street

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 but now researchers at Harvard Medical School have shown that some aspects can be reversed.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 Their research focused on a chemical called NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 and its levels naturally drop off in the cell of the body with age.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 The team showed that this disrupted the function of the cells in built power stations and mitochondria

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 leading to lower energy production and aging as a result.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Experiments showed that boosting NAD levels by giving mice a chemical which they naturally convert into NAD

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 could reverse the sands of time.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 One week of youth medication in two year old mice meant their muscles became akin to those of a six month old

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 in terms of mitochondrial function, muscle wastage, inflammation and insulin resistance, so greatly improved.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 And Dr. Anna Gomes from the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School said,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 "We believe this is quite an important finding."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 She argues that muscle strength may return with a longer course of treatment, so is this a cure?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 Well, thanks so much for joining us this month again, Dr. Peat.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 For those people who have just tuned into the show or maybe have never heard you before

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 and they have quite a following and I think those people kind of generally tune into the show,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 but would you just give people that may be new listeners an outline of your academic and professional background?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 In the 60s, I had been working in linguistics, but on my own studying,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 I was very interested in general questions of aging and the brain in particular

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 and how the brain makes consciousness and language possible

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 and how that changes during maturation and aging.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 So I enrolled at the University of Oregon thinking I would study brain biology in 1968

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 and found that the brain biology people were extremely dogmatic,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 thinking in terms only of genetic control, membrane functions and nothing much in between.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 And I looked around the department and found that the reproductive biologists seemed to be more scientific

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 and actually looking for an explanation rather than trying to explain things in terms of what they believed they knew.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 So I worked on reproductive aging and our lab specialized in the female aging.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 And I concentrated on the energy, oxidative metabolism and the changes occurring in the uterus with aging.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 And I found that all kinds of stress converge with the changes that you see during aging,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 especially in the reproductive system.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 It was like the lining of the uterus was a very good model for things that happen in the brain and the whole organism.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 And all types of stress from radiation to a bad diet, vitamin E deficiency,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 deficiency of oxygen, all of these things mimic the changes that you see in aging.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 And basically that's the area that I've been thinking about a lot ever since.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Okay, good.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 I think some of the language sometimes is a little difficult for general listeners to get their heads around

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 if they're not medically or physiology minded or trained.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 And so I think just to open up the subject this evening of aging in light of the research that was broadcast in an article produced by Harvard.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 If we want to talk about the two types of interactions that happen in the aging process that this was looking at

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 in terms of the interaction with DNA, with methylation as a additive process which degrades the DNA,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 and the acetylation, which apparently is more protective, they talk about an epigenetic modification.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 And perhaps if you -- we mentioned in the past that, you know, unlike most modern thinking that would tell us that we are a result of our genetics

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 and there's nothing much we can do about it, I know that you found many different research articles that have proved beyond doubt

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 that there very much is something that can be done.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And the environment in its own right has its own effects on the genes, even at a very local and a very time-dependent manner.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 So it's not a case of the genes being fixed in time and space and immutable,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 but that definitely changes can be done in a relatively short space of time.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 So when the articles talk about epigenetic modification involved in gene expression, for example,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 to perhaps stave off cancer or even allow the cancer to exist, would you explain what that is, that epigenetic modification?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 Well, Luther Burbank was a person who explored the influence of the environment.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Many biologists from the time of Lamarck down through Barbara McClintock, who was ignored until just about 20 years ago,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 they sort of pulled her out of obscurity before she died.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 And these people had demonstrated that the need for a function could elicit the function in an organism

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 so that a stressful environment would cause changes in the chromosomes.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Barbara McClintock referred to jumping genes, but these things were actual movement of DNA elicited by stress in the environment.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 And all of these people for almost 200 years were excluded from science by a very dogmatic view of genetics.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 All of the dogmatic view of the geneticists of the 20th century are now defunct completely,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 but they live on in practice and medicine.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 In the last year, several dozen people have asked me what to do because they've discovered that they're a mutant by having a DNA test.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 There are a couple of popular genes that almost everyone has a mutated form of,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 but actually these make almost no difference in health or function, a very slight nutritional requirement difference.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 And if you look at identical twins, despite the fact that all of their DNA is identical

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 and they experience the same environment in the uterus and most of them experience a very similar environment because of their social economic level,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 despite all of those genetic and environmental overlaps, when you look at a serious disease, there's very little overlap.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 For example, if one twin has rheumatoid arthritis, there's only a 12% incidence of it in the other twin.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 And that's now well recognized, but still the gene testing industry is trying to sell the idea that you get sick if you have certain mutated genes.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 So you're saying it's more a product of the environment, perhaps in that arthritic type situation, perhaps?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Yeah, and constantly, like they put 40 mice, I think it was, in a stimulating environment

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 and found that just by the choices they made in their daily life, they became very different in personality and behavior.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Just by where they happen to go in the environment, influencing what they learned,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 and over their lifetime, they became very recognizable individuals.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 And that would really upset medicine if they had to consider everyone as a unique individual all the way down to the way their genes work.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Because there would be no exact definition of a disease, it would be your disease this month.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Yeah, yeah. Interesting. I wonder what it is in the animals, in that mice study, perhaps,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 that made the individual mice do things differently that gave them a better outcome.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Possibly just which one was the first one to be weaned and wander off and have an experience.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 And that stimulated them in a way that the others didn't experience.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 Thank you. Go on.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 The genes are being used constantly.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 Everything you do is using your genes in a certain way that varies according to whether you're awake or asleep, for example.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 But if you're starving day after day, this is going to pull up an accumulation of changes,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 not just a quick on and off effect of day and night or incidental experiences,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 but it will accumulate sort of an inertia and layer after layer will be laid down in the stuff around your genes,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 attaching carbon atoms to the DNA itself and attaching a great variety of molecules to the proteins that handle the genes,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 the histones that surround the chromosomes and move the genes to make them accessible for copying and functioning.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 These are relatively easy to change. The methylation is a little more sluggish.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 And when you're in an extremely stressful situation, a lot of your genes get turned off, methylated especially.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And those can be identified in the chromosomes that you inherit from your father or mother specifically.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 So if your father had a very hard life, you can identify the highly methylated genes in your chromosomes that came from that hard life.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 So that's inheritable then?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Yeah. And in animal experiments, it takes several generations for a very bad generation's experience to be removed

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 when they're put into a normal environment. But if you put them into a super environment like the...

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Enriched environment.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Enriched, yeah. It's very stimulating. You can repair the previous generation's damage very quickly.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 And some nutrients and drugs can do that, remove methyl groups from the DNA

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 and attach more of the opening groups to the histones.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Okay. Let's just let people know here.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Gallup 91.1 FM.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 And from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 perhaps to this month's subject of aging and energy reversal.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat is a specialist in hormone physiology and the aging process.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 He's having studied it for the last 35 years or so.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 So, yeah, let's just tell people the number again. I guess it's 923-3911.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 If you live outside the area, then 800 numbers, 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Okay. So let's perhaps go on then to the...

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 what you've mentioned about methylation and demethylation and how that occurs,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 how that affects the gene, how it silences it, how it allows tumors to grow

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 and how they have just found now in this piece of research that the very presence of this

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 is a very diagnostic indicator for how well the tumor will continue to grow

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 and how switching this off is actually a fairly new approach to cancer therapy.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 So, in terms of the process of methylation and how this happens

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 and how this is also related to that train of thought, a fairly aberrant train of thought perhaps,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 but that fasting is good for you and going without is actually fairly healthful

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 and if you starve yourself fairly regularly and live on a very meager caloric intake,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 you'll actually have a greater chance of longevity and it's not actually true, is it?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 No, it was definite about 70 years ago, a researcher named Clive McKay, I think it was,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 showed that restricting the food supply made animals live longer,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 but later people restricted the type of food, kept down the heavy metals in their diet alone

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 and let them eat all the fat, protein and carbohydrate they wanted and they lived longer.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 Actually, Dr. Peat, would you hold it there a minute for us if you could?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 We've actually got a couple of callers on the air, so let's get these couple of callers in.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 First caller, you're on the air and where are you from, caller?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Hi, this is Gina from Kansas.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Canada.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Kansas.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Kansas?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Kansas City.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 Okay, I'm sorry.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Sorry, it's my accent, I'm foreign as well.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Oh, no problem, we're all foreign.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Go ahead, what's your question?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 My question is not about tonight's subject, but it's about estrogen and the reduction of estrogen

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 or if there are any herbs that can function as an aromative inhibitor.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 My situation is that I'm in a high estrogen state.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 I'm in my 40s, but I am already post-menopausal.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 I enter menopause very early at about the age of 40.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 I also have or I have been diagnosed this year with Hashimoto

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 and I have gained a lot of weight, like 40 pounds in just three years.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Since the menopause, I was told that I probably also had Hashimoto for three years or so.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 But I have gone from 99 pounds to 139 in just three years.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 My progesterone is very low, even though I am supplementing with Progest-E.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Okay.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 And very high FSH and LH.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 Right.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 I'm under a lot of stress, so even though the blood test shows the estrogen is low as well,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 I believe it's only because it's trapped in the cells.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 I don't believe I have high estrogen. I don't see how I could, considering I'm fat, I'm under stress,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 I have digestive problems and a lot of other issues.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So since I can't raise the progesterone, even with supplementation and diet,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 such as raw carrots, low fiber, I still cannot pull it up.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Would you suggest perhaps that I should take something as an aromatase inhibitor?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Well, the main aromatase inhibitor that I'm familiar with is from nettle root,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 and that's really used as a kind of prostatic agent in men to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 by blocking that enzyme.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 In terms of your condition and what you said about the weight gain and your age,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 it's not uncommon at all for what you're saying to occur.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 I think it happens fairly commonly.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 Dr. Peat, in terms of this lady's supposed low progesterone levels

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 and the estrogen that she's been exposed to having gone into early menopause at 40,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 I know that you'd probably be looking at her thyroid function as a main route

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 with which to treat her situation in terms of her possible now Hashimoto's diagnosis.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Yeah, almost everyone around the age of 40, that's when the highest ratio of estrogen to progesterone exists,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 but the trouble is the estrogen seems to drop when you measure it in the serum,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 even though it was at its very highest lifetime level around the age of 40.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 When progesterone falls, the estrogen can't be released from the cell,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 and so it doesn't appear in the serum until progesterone affects the cells to release it

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 so that it can be measured.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 But that means that even without taking something to increase your progesterone,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 the aromatase inhibitors are very practical and logical.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Two fruits that contain effective aromatase inhibitors are oranges and guavas,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 apigenin.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 So this is naringenin?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Yeah, in oranges and then in guavas, I think there's one called apigenin.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Apigenin, okay.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Apigenin.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Okay.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 And aspirin, by blocking the production of inflammatory prostaglandins, aspirin helps.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 And the supplement pregnenolone is indirectly able to increase your progesterone

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 and lower the estrogen production.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 The pregnenolone is a precursor to the DHEA, correct?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 It's a what?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Precursor, yeah.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 Oh, precursor.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 Yeah.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 Right.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 My DHEA levels are quite high.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 So would taking pregnenolone make it even higher?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 No.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 When your estrogen is not being controlled, it likely over-activates your adrenals.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 DHEA tends to go up with cortisol, and cortisol is a major activator of aromatase.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 And the function of pregnenolone is to lower the excess cortisol

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 and prevent the overstimulation of aromatase.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 Okay.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 So if the pregnenolone being a precursor to DHEA, you explained how that works,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 but the DHEA is also a precursor to estrogen.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 So how would I keep it from producing even more estrogen?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Sometimes the pregnenolone in itself can do that by lowering the stress hormones,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 which drive the adrenal glands too hard.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 And the diet to correct your low thyroid function is probably the basic thing.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 Estrogen causes basically inflammation of the thyroid gland.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 It inhibits the ability to secrete thyroid hormone while allowing it to synthesize it

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 and respond to thyroid-stimulating hormone.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 And progesterone is needed for the gland to secrete.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 So you want to do things that lower the stress on your thyroid.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And polyunsaturated fats are probably the most important factor in blocking the thyroid

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 other than estrogen.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 Right.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 I have eliminated those now.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Okay.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 Well, thank you very much.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 I appreciate your help.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 Calcium in the diet is a very important thing for keeping your metabolic rate up

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 and helping to lose weight.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 How much calcium should I have a day?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Two quarts of low-fat milk will provide a pretty ideal amount of calcium.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Okay.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Low-fat milk.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 Okay.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Would that amount to be influenced by the fact that I have low stomach acid

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 and I don't have a gallbladder so I don't absorb nutrients as well?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Yeah, with one percent milk, there's enough to slow the absorption of the sugar and protein slightly

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 but not enough fat to upset your gallbladder.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Okay.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Okay, thank you very much.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 I appreciate that.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 You're very welcome.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Bye-bye.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Bye-bye.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Okay, there is another caller on the air so let's take this next caller before we carry on.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Hi, caller.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 You're on the air and where are you from?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 Yes, this is David from Missouri.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Oh, hi, David.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Hello.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 So, you know, I just thought of something that might be helpful to all of us

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 and Dr. Peat has really helped me a lot on this and he's discussed this quite a bit

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 but, you know, we're at the lowest point in getting sunlight.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 We're getting close to the winter equinox

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 and I've really been experimenting a lot with the red light, you know, using the heat lamps

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 that is basically like a chicken light that you would go buy at a hardware store

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 and having a reflector on it and really trying to get more of that light each day.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 So anybody that's having any kind of problems,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 a lot of the problems could be coming from the low light situation

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 so that might be a good place to start.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 So anyway, I just wanted to start with that.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 The other thing, I just have a few questions about food in general

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 and also about aspirin since you brought up aspirin.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 One of the problems with buying, like, you know, different brands like Bear and different things,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 it seems like they have a lot of additives in them

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 and so I've explored different ways of getting aspirin that is pure aspirin.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 The only place you can actually buy that is through pet supply places

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 which always feels a little weird, you know, buying it that way.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 But then the other thing, and Andrew, you probably know quite a bit about this as well,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 willow bark, which I guess is really the source of where Bear Aspirin originally got their,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 you know, their molecule structure to create the phyllic acid.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 I think it was also another very good rich source of acetylsalicylic acid,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 but I think it was probably the willow bark where it was first synthesized.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 Yeah, so I'm just curious, Dr. Peat, what do you think about using the willow bark

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 rather than trying to use some of these aspirin that have all the fillers

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 and different phyllic materials in them?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 The fillers definitely aren't good.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 I mean, if you have access to nothing but the pills, I think you should dissolve them in hot water

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 to let the junk settle out and then just drink the sour water.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 Okay, I never thought of that.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Okay.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 There is quite a few chemical supply companies actually that will sell it.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 I don't think it's a controlled substance.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 Dr. Peat, aspirin is not a controlled substance at this point in time, is it?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 No.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Okay, yeah.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 Okay, well, that's good.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 It seems like the only-- I've done a lot of different searches and called a lot of places,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 and it seems like the only place you can find it is like Pet Supply,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 which it seems like in America sometimes they treat pets better than they do people.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 They don't give them as many additives, that's for sure, probably.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 No, you definitely can get too much of that.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 The other thing I wanted to ask about was on pressure cooking and canning.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 And the reason I'm thinking along those lines is, you know, we just kind of live in crazy times,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 so I've been thinking about, you know, trying to come up with some foods that could be canned,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 like in Mason jars, and I bought a pressure cooker.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 And so I just want to throw this one recipe that I'm thinking about doing out,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 and it would be potatoes and kale, garlic, onion,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 and I'm thinking also about using like ground lamb.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Either cooking that in the pressure cooker in the jar or cooking it before,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 and I'm just curious if you have any thoughts about that.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 I would think the main thoughts Dr. Peat would have about that is the onion and garlic side of it.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Oh, okay, so we would rather not put the onion and garlic in there?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 Well, I think that's because some people are fairly sensitive to it,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 and they may not even notice the onions and the garlic that are doing it.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 It's like people eating a lot of vegetables and then having a lot of flatulence

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 and it's quite normal. It's actually not good for you,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 so you're probably better off without it. I think that's the logic.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Do you think, Dr. Peat, that the nutrition aspects of the canning would harm the foods?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Oh, no. There were experiments in the 1940s in which rats were fed stuff out of cans,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 the usual vegetables, beans, corn, all the standard vegetables,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 and others were fed the same vegetables, fresh and raw.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 The animals eating canned vegetables thrived. The others didn't.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 Interesting.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 So I'm thinking that the potatoes, because you've talked about potatoes actually being a fairly decent protein,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 even though I know the starch is a little bit of a problem, but if it's cooked really well,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 and I'm thinking the kale is a really good source of minerals and vitamin K,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 and then the lamb fat and the protein in the lamb I would think would all be really good.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 Yeah, the well-cooked green leaves are extremely good nutritionally,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 especially to balance meat because the greens contain very little phosphate

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 and the meat contains too much phosphate and too little calcium,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 so you've got to balance when you have greens with meat.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 Okay, well, good.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Well, I'll do some experiments on that and let everybody know how that turned out,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 but it seems like a fairly nutritious product to can, so.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 And then just one other thing, I was curious about calcium chloride,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 and I don't buy very many foods that have additives in them,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 but there's one thing that I do buy, and it's actually a really good brand of pickles.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 There's very little ingredients in them that I could see any problem with other than calcium chloride.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 I'm just curious, what do you think of calcium chloride?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 It's been used for making pickles and such, and it has a nice taste when it's added to food,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 but a lot of people are sensitive either to magnesium chloride or calcium chloride,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 and so it's good to be cautious with it.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 It can cause headaches and bowel symptoms of various types.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 So if I'm not having any problems that I can sense, then I guess it's probably fine.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Yeah, if it's chemically pure, it's good as a food additive.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 Okay.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 Okay, well, hey, thank you.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Okay, thanks for your call.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Okay.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Okay, so the number here if you live in the area is 923-3911,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 or the 800 number is 1-800-568-3723 or 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 Okay, so the lines will be open until 8 o'clock.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Dr. Peat, you were starting to talk about the --

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 well, I think between methylation and the compounds that would be useful

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
 that were brought out in the article, I know they talked about things like curcumin from turmeric.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 They mentioned resveratrol, which I know that you've looked at in fairly good detail.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 You mentioned genistein and diazine, which are other compounds that were useful in switching off that methylation.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 Do you have any other -- yeah, any other thoughts on that?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 The caller mentioned the importance of light,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 and even light can help to reverse the toxic methylation that happens from stress.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 Okay, to switch off that excitotoxicity.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Yes.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
 Because I know we've talked about that in the past, haven't we, about neurons becoming too excited,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 and that's just as bad as being inactive.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 So in terms of methylation, then, it's a bad process that happens to the genes,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 and it can happen through various mechanisms, not least of which can be nutritional.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 But you've mentioned things like red light.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 I know we've talked in the past in great detail about thyroid hormone,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 but is there any other things that would be counterproductive that you could use to counter the methylation in the genetics?

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Some of the people who have been told that they have mutated genes are being told by their doctors

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 that they need to eat lots of methyl groups, choline and methionine in particular,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 to make up for the weak gene enzyme.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 But the American Medical Genetics -- College of Medical Genetics recently said

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 that mutation doesn't call for basically any treatment.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 It's not significant clinically.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 But they didn't mention that people with that so-called mutation have a lower incidence of cancer,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 and this probably relates to what we're talking about, the epigenetic methylation of the genes.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 The people who have a slightly weaker methylation system are better off for cancer risk.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Okay, because I wanted to bring out two compounds that are actually anesthetics,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 lidocaine and procaine, kind of related to the cocaine-type structure.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 So both lidocaine and procaine have a demethylation activity.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 Is that right for the DNA?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Yeah, these are being studied in several types of cancer.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Prostate, breast, pancreas, lung, and melanoma are the ones I've seen,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 and its effects are just dramatic for reversing those changes that are characteristic of the cancer.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 So it's being considered as an important new approach to cancer treatment,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 but it's so cheap that no one is very enthusiastic about applying to the FDA.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 It definitely hasn't got a patent on it still, correct?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
 No, and it costs maybe a quarter a day or something.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Yeah, oh dear.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Okay, well, the other thing, in that BBC article they mentioned NAD being the molecule that was responsible here,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 and if I'm right in thinking that this compound can be synthesized from tryptophan--

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 I don't want to get confused here now. Have I not heard you mention that excess tryptophan is not good for you?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Yeah, women in particular are very susceptible to too much tryptophan.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 They used to be the victims of pellagra much more often than men.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 That's because estrogen redirects the metabolism of tryptophan into serotonin rather than niacin or niacinamide.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 And when corn is treated with alkali to make hominy or tortillas, the chemistry shifts it over in that pathway,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 makes niacin out of it, and doesn't let so much serotonin be formed.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 Okay, because there was another chemical, aspartic acid.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 I also saw that was a good source from which NAD can be synthesized, and that was from asparagus and asparagus juice in particular.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 Well, you don't want to take plain aspartic acid or even with minerals because it's an excitotoxin in itself.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 How about asparagus juice as a source of it?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 Oh, it's fine.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 And another amino acid that's being promoted a lot in the internet world is either arginine or citrulline to increase your nitric oxide.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 That's going exactly in the wrong direction genetically.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 And the vitamin B6 is needed to prevent tryptophan being turned into too much serotonin and to help turn it into niacinamide.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 And simply supplementing niacinamide is a very direct way to help reverse these epigenetic problems.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 Five years ago when the Harvard people were starting a drug company, I think it was called Certis, S-I-R-T-I-S,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 which was bought by a big drug company, Glaxo, and they dumped it this year and went on to something else.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
 You said that some of the chemicals that were uncovered might be useful in the future.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 Yeah, at the time the people promoting resveratrol through that company as an anti-aging chemical

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 were warning that niacinamide antagonized resveratrol and lowered the sirtuins.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 And therefore niacinamide would accelerate aging.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 But I think now they've changed their story.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 And the facts over even at that time, five years ago, it was very clear that niacinamide greatly extended cell life.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 Just a tremendous increase in human cell longevity in vitro.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 And it's very safe, so it can be used in all of these epigenetic problems, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 various types of cancer and so on.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 And it's interesting that all of these substances that have been known, some of them for thousands of years,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 as anti-inflammatory drugs, they all turn out to work in the same direction,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 protecting us from over-methylation and over-removal of the acetyl groups from the histones.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 Okay, hold it there, Dr. Peter. We've got a couple more callers, so let's take the next caller.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 You're on the air, and where are you from?

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 Actually, someone called in. Quick question. I'll ask for them.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 What is the use of lidocaine, and how is it administered, and what sort of doses are there?

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 And then there is another caller.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 Right. Not sure about the dose.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 Lidocaine for cancer was the question.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Okay. Dr. Peat.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:11.000
 These studies have been done in many different ways, but I've had several sort of random experiences

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 with both protein and lidocaine that were really just amazing to me.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 For example, a girl with lifetime terrible eczema, red and scaly all over,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 she put a handful of, I think it was rubbing alcohol mostly, with some novocaine in it,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 and she stroked it up her shin, and at the same speed that her hand moved up her shin,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 a wave of normal-looking skin appeared right behind it, and it stayed that way.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 I've seen people with terrible burns.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:05.000
 If they could get it on in the first minute or so, the burn stopped and didn't develop.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 It has antihistamine, antiserotonin effects, stopping inflammation in the tracts,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 but what it's doing, all of these well-known anti-inflammatory things

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 are also undoing the limiting and harmful genetic changes that are caused by injury.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 It's almost as if the perception of pain itself accelerates the damage and the inflammation

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 from that which caused the pain and inflammation in the first place.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 The nerves increase the release of the inflammatory materials.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 If you can block the signaling of pain, you can greatly reduce the symptoms

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 of whatever the insult was in the first place.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 Interesting. OK, we do have another caller on the air, so let's take this next caller.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 Where are you from?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 They hung up.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Oh, they hung up. OK.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 All right, well, if people would like to call back, the number's 923 3911

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 or the toll-free number's 1-800-KMUD-RAD, so the lines will be open until about 5 to 8 here.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 OK, well, going back then to, we mentioned the NAD can be synthesized from tryptophan.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Too much tryptophan is not good, especially in women with estrogen-related problems.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 And then the other thing was the asparagus juice, which also could be a source of a synthesis from that into NAD.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 You also mentioned, I read a couple of articles about how aspirin enhances the deacetylation of the histones,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 and the histones were these coils within a chromosome that kind of bundled up the DNA.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 And then aspirin itself was shown to greatly potentiate the effect of the deacetylation.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 And I know you've mentioned, you talk about aspirin a lot as being a very useful, very good anti-inflammatory,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 very inexpensive, and not at all to be considered as a life-threatening drug that will thin your blood and cause hemorrhage.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:29.000
 But what do you think about the co-administration of aspirin along with that deacetylase inhibitor?

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:38.000
 I think it works by itself or with any of the other protective inhibitors.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Caffeine has some of the same effects, and aspirin and caffeine have been used together in a lot of products.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 So a combination, all of these seem to work synergistically rather than interfering with each other.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:06.000
 Okay. And there was, I think if we want to move on to the anthraquinones as a pretty interesting group of chemicals,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:15.000
 I know Pau de Arco is being one of these chemicals that has got a long history of anti-cancer use.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 But talk about imodine as a compound, this anthraquinone, the reddish,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:27.000
 the chemical that gives the reddish color to those types of chemicals that have that laxative effect,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 so both cascara and imodine, and how they work.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.000
 If you look at the molecule for Pau de Arco, is that the same as Lapatron?

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
 Yeah.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:55.000
 If you put vitamin K and imodine and Lapatron in a row and tetracycline, the antibiotic, which is an anti-inflammatory,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 they're essentially the same structure with a different number of rings.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
 But it's like each one is an analog of the other,

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:13.000
 and each one has properties overlapping with those of the other anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-stress.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
 Can I hold you there? I think there's three callers on the line now.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
 Okay.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
 Let's take the first caller. You're on the air, and where are you from?

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
 Hello, I'm from Arcata.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 Okay, hi. What's your question?

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
 You know, I have a problem.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:37.000
 A couple of years ago, I scalded myself on my abdomen while I was cooking chicken.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 Okay.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 And the oil from the pan got on my abdomen, and a blister formed.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 And this blister was bulbous, you know.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 And since that time, I've had intervals. I've had blisters form again and again in the same location.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 And they've even, you know, spread a little bit.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:19.000
 But if I put--I also have the problem where if I put adhesive tape, like a band-aid, on my abdomen in that area, the skin comes off.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
 Yeah, it's very loosely connected to the underlying membrane.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:30.000
 Yes, and this has been, you know--the blisters aren't a great problem.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:41.000
 It's the--quite frequently, having to go through the process of healing from an open wound afterwards.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 How long after the initial accident have you found these episodes again?

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:53.000
 Oh, this--it started occurring like four months afterwards.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 The blister, the actual blister, and that went away.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:06.000
 And then one day, I noticed--I'd taken a shower, and, you know, I noticed there was a blister forming.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000
 And it got very bulbous, about the size of a silver dollar or bigger.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 Okay.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 And, I mean, just--you know, and now, it's happened so frequently that there is, like, scar tissue there.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 But it's still blisters.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, this sounds very much like a kind of genetic imprinting, a memory.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:38.000
 Yeah, and I think the nervous system is probably involved in helping with the memory.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 And there is--

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 All the skin doctors can say is, "We can replace the skin there."

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 Yeah.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
 And I don't think that's inappropriate.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:59.000
 There is a little-known branch of medicine, I think it was a German who originated--I think it was called neural therapy or something like that.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:11.000
 But it involved finding key points and injecting procaine or other local anesthetic to change the nervous system.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 And I've seen a great variety of good results from applying any of the local anesthetics topically to--

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:38.000
 It apparently helps to retrain the memory of the tissue so that it stops producing the recurrent problem, such as an ingrown toenail or recurring boils in a certain location.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
 Yes.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000
 There are a lot of fairly strong local anesthetic ointments sold over the counter.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Okay.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:59.000
 And I think benzocaine in a small area is effective and safe, but you don't want to use a lot of benzocaine on a big area.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.000
 Procaine and lidocaine are safer.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
 There we go.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 You could definitely try that because it does sound like there's some kind of imprinted memory in what happened for that to come back.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:22.000
 I tried to look it up and there were several things I found on the Internet, but none of them suggest any type of treatment.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000
 And the big thing is that I would have an open sore there until that healed.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:40.000
 And it healed rather rapidly, except at times it would form a false crust, a false scab, which would come off.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
 You could definitely try that anesthetic cream and try that as a next thing to do.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 Yeah.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 All right.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
 Thank you very much.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 You're very welcome.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 Okay.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 I think we have two more callers, so let's get the next caller on the end.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
 Where are you from?

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
 Is that me?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 Yes, you're on the air.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 Where are you from?

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
 I just have a really quick question.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:13.000
 The doctor mentioned about the woman who was using alcohol and something else, a person, and the eczema just disappeared instantly.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 What was the other thing?

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 Was it lidocaine, Dr. Peat, or was it --

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 No, that particular one was just Novocaine, Procaine.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 Okay.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
 All right.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 Well, thank you.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 That's what I wanted to know.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 Okay.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 It will dissolve in water, but a little alcohol makes it dissolve faster.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
 Okay.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 Well, there is another caller, so if we can get the next caller done in two minutes, that would be good.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 So where are you from, caller?

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 Hello, you're on the air.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 Maybe not, huh?

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
 Okay.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 Well, let's just leave that.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
 It's probably getting too late anyway.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 So, yeah, we were talking very briefly, then, Dr. Peat.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
 We've got a couple of minutes before the end of the show.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 I know that Imodine and another laxative from Cascara were definitely used to suppress bladder cancer cell growth.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
 I saw an article about that.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000
 Do you know much more about Imodine?

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 It's about 10 or 15 years ago, the FDA was attacking the laxatives of that class, such as Aloe and Cascara, as potential causes of cancer.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 But as soon as they took it off the market, the cancer industry started getting interested in it, and it relieves or cures many kinds of cancer.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:47.000
 And it turns out not to have any of the harmful effects that the FDA was claiming.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 Its mechanism seems to involve not only the usual anti-inflammatory things, but a real basic reprogramming, demethylation, and inhibiting the histone deacetylase enzymes.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 Okay, good.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
 Well, Dr. Peat, I don't want to keep you going.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
 Thanks so much for joining us.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 I just want people to find out a little bit more about you and how to get access to the articles that you've written.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 So thanks for joining us.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 Okay.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
 Merry Christmas.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 Thanks so much for all your help during the year.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
 Okay.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 Okay, so for those people that have listened to the show, Dr. Raymond Peat, his website can be found at www.raypeat.com.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 The website is full of articles that are fully referenced about a lot of interesting research that he has done himself,

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 and research which he has collated from other independent researchers far and wide.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000
 So there's a lot of very interesting information that is very scientifically referenced and backed up.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
 None of it is just hearsay.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000
 So for those people that have listened to the show, thanks so much for joining us.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 And for those people that called in, thanks for your calls.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 It's going to be the solstice tomorrow, the shortest day of the year, and days are gradually going to get longer.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 So right now is the time you need to be thinking about your low thyroid activity

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000
 and what you can do to help your thyroid through this darkest time until the beginning of the light coming back again.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
 And, yeah, for all those people that have listened, thanks so much for your input.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:35.000
 And we can be reached toll-free after business hour, during business hour, sorry, for consultations or whatever else you'd like to contact me about.

 The number is 1-888-926-4372.
