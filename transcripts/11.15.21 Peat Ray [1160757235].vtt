WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 We are listener supported, one radio network.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.520
 Well, a very pleasant good morning.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.440
 We're going to do this again and get it right this time.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.520
 We had a little problem, a little technical problem, but now things are well and we're

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.040
 back with a good connection with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.600
 He's a good one and he's with us on the third Monday of every month at about 1130 or so.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.280
 We're getting a little bit late because of all this, but he's a PhD in biology.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.720
 Goes back to the 60, about 1968.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.680
 His main work was in biological chemistry and physics and '71 and '72, dissertation

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.200
 University of Oregon in 1972.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.400
 He really has worked with the ideas of progesterone for a very long time.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.760
 He knows quite a bit about hormones and such and his website is Raypeat.com.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 If you have a question for Dr. Peat, you can join us right now.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.440
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.080
 Dr. Peat, good morning again.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 How are you, sir?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 Everything fine up there?

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.080
 Dr. Peat Good morning.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.080
 Yep, still good here.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.080
 Unusually warm autumn.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.160
 Dr. Darrell Bock Yeah, we have, it's going to be like 75 here

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.600
 in Texas as well.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800
 Do you believe in this whole man-made global warming thing?

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.200
 Do you think there's anything to it?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.160
 Dr. Peat No, very little.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.960
 I think it's mostly a solar cycle.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.000
 All of the mass media were talking about the oncoming ice age from the 1940s through the

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.360
 50s into the 70s and it was right after Three Mile Island accident and poisoning of people

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:07.040
 with radiation, but the Pentagon published a paper to defend the importance of nuclear

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.720
 energy because the public was getting afraid of nuclear energy because of that accident.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:25.040
 So they said that petroleum and coal burning are going to cause the planet to have an overheating

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 problem where right until that moment for the last 30 or 40 years, we had been predicting

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.960
 a coming ice age.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:56.640
 Right now it became politically valuable to defend nuclear power industry.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:22.280
 It reinforced the public fear of nuclear energy

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:35.760
 and so it increased the need to propagandize in favor of nuclear energy because the Pentagon

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:50.960
 to keep its bomb supply going needs the partially depleted nuclear material produced by the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.840
 scheme generating energy plant.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 The waste material from the energy industry is used by the Pentagon for making bombs and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.240
 so if the people are too afraid of nuclear power and want to keep burning more coal more

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.760
 efficiently, then the Pentagon has no more source of atomic bombs.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:26.200
 So it's powerfully in their interest to keep the nuclear power industry going.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.120
 So but now they're morphing now to this whole green thing.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.400
 Are they going to let go do you think of the nuclear power thing?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.880
 That's all part of the pro-nuclear power industry.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:51.640
 In 2004, when they were preparing Barack Obama to be the candidate in four years, they had

00:04:51.640 --> 00:05:00.640
 him speak at the Democratic convention and he didn't say it outright, but you could see

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:12.440
 that he was their big candidate for supporting the whole mess of carbon dioxide overheating

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.120
 the planet and having to go green with nuclear energy.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:27.400
 It's a big propaganda scheme and Barack Obama was one of the first to put it into political

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 practice.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:36.200
 Wow, and I've read that he was like one of the big rock stars out in this whole green

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.080
 thing in Scotland, whatever this thing was in the last two weeks.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.760
 Like he was one of the rock stars.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.640
 Many people believe that they're going to put him up as like the savior of the world

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.360
 for this whole one world government thing.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:06:08.200
 Are they talking about Michelle Obama as a transition into a new Obama era?

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.360
 Then many people feel, as you probably are well aware, that if they sell us on this idea

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.040
 Dr. Peat of a green thing, that it won't be enough juice to carry the day because the

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.520
 experts say there's just not enough and then that will allow them to control whatever they

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.240
 come up with, whether it be more coal or I guess nuclear.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:41.680
 Yeah, and deforestation is a big part of warming the planet or worse than warming it, destabilizing

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:53.640
 it, reducing not only the water vapor and clouds in the air but the carbon dioxide.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:01.880
 It gives you surges of carbon dioxide when you burn down the forest.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:14.120
 But if we have an actual increase in our year-round carbon dioxide level, that will stimulate

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.280
 restoration of the forest.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:28.520
 So if we change our policies against deforestation and adjust agriculture and land use so that

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:37.800
 we stop destroying forests and start rebuilding forests, that will adjust the carbon dioxide

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.840
 in the air very powerfully more than anything else could.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840
 Interesting.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.400
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.160
 If you care to join us, we can talk about whatever it is that you would like to speak

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.160
 about.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.160
 Just patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:59.320
 I've got a little personal question for you and people might learn from this so I'm not

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.280
 just using up my time for Patrick.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.080
 But I like to drink a lot of water, Dr. Peat, during the show because my throat gets dry

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.080
 and such.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.800
 But then lately I've been having to pee like a lot.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.720
 It's difficult when I'm on the air because you can't be breaking every time you turn

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.040
 around to do a commercial.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.400
 So what would this be something that I want to look at that needs a little work, needs

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.440
 a little energy, a little help?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.240
 Is it a bladder thing?

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:42.000
 Yes, some of it is just over sensitivity of the bladder nerves and the histamine, actual

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.640
 production of histamine.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.840
 That goes with your general energy level.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:59.000
 Women have the problem more often than men because women are about ten times more likely

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.680
 than men to have a thyroid autoimmune series of problems.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:15.480
 That basically goes with the high histamine production and sensitivity.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:24.120
 Low thyroid shifts you towards the estrogen and histamine patterns, meaning that your

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.440
 reflexes are less stabilized.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:37.040
 You need more sugar more often because your thyroid isn't efficiently conserving your

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.040
 glucose.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040
 Interesting.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.080
 So the histamine could just make the bladder more sensitive and feels like it's got

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080
 to pee.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.080
 Yes.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:57.440
 And salt and sugar are the immediate antidotes.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:04.440
 They work for half an hour or so, but the basic problem is to increase your oxygen metabolism

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.440
 rate with thyroid.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:14.040
 I kind of worked up and did the piggy thyroid thing over two or three months that you coached

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.640
 me on, just some pig thyroid.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.400
 I did a thyroid test and it's like it's 0.3.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.960
 On your TSH?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.040
 Yes, it's pretty good, huh?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:37.280
 I actually preferred just a small amount less than that, but that's in the range where

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.200
 you are likely to get thyroid cancer or other diseases.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.080
 So you could even lower than that?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.600
 Yes, just according to your personal health and needs.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.880
 I don't really have any issues, but I guess I could increase a little bit more pig stuff

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.880
 if I wanted?

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.120
 Yes, to see how it does with your bladder rhythms.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.440
 And one of the big effects is that you can go all night without having to drain your

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.680
 bladder.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:18.280
 So maybe orange juice, or orange juice during the show rather than water, maybe would add

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.320
 some sugar there and help that?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.640
 As my thyroid is getting happier?

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.160
 Yes, and salty snacks help too.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.160
 Salty snacks, yes.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.480
 You're fun to hang around, boy, more sugar.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.120
 I love to do in the middle of the night when I wake up is have some milk, warm it up with

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.720
 some beet sugar, organic beet sugar in there.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.960
 And that's sure nice to go back to sleep after that.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.960
 Where do you get your organic beet sugar?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.320
 I think I just got it online somewhere.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.960
 I bought two of them.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.600
 I think I got it through Amazon, somewhere.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:05.320
 There's a small advantage, but a definite chemical advantage to using beet sugar grown

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:13.800
 in the Midwest, for example, over the tropical cane sugar.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.840
 Oh, you mentioned that, yeah.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:22.120
 So I'll have to look and see whether it's made, so you could actually maybe find a company.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.120
 What's the advantage of getting the beet sugar in the Midwest over...

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.120
 You get less deuterium.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.240
 Deuterium, yeah.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:37.040
 The heavy water that slows your metabolism and accelerates aging processes.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.800
 That's pretty fun.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:48.040
 The tropical warm water sugar cane has more of the deuterium, but after it has rained

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:57.800
 out crossing the continent, the central continent crops like sugar cane have fairly depleted

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:02.880
 deuterium content and so tend to activate your metabolism.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.400
 So I could call the company, find out where they're getting their beet sugar and find

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.080
 one that's getting it from the upper Midwest, you say that's the best place?

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.880
 Yeah, as far as I know.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.880
 So I don't understand this whole deuterium thing.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:22.080
 I mean, why would God have some kind of an element that is not good for us in the whole

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:28.080
 milieu of nature?

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:38.040
 It probably has some general biological function of sorting things out into slower metabolizers

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:48.040
 and faster metabolizers, but organisms with a big high-energy brain definitely do better

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.040
 on low deuterium foods.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.040
 Active.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:57.000
 When you're active, you're an active thinker doing creative things with your mind.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.400
 Yeah, with a big hot brain.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.200
 I got one of those, baby.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.520
 Wow, interesting.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.920
 It does better on the lower deuterium.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.840
 So maybe I can move up to the Midwest.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.400
 North Dakota is a pretty cool place, pretty great.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:23.160
 Yeah, there are places trying to industrialize the reduction of deuterium in water and they

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.840
 sell deuterium-depleted water.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:32.920
 It's pretty expensive for a depletion of a small amount.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.920
 I wonder about rainwater.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:37.920
 That's my source.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.760
 It's well-filtered, but it's rainwater.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.000
 I wonder how that does with deuterium.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.560
 Yeah, the farther you are from the tropics, the less deuterium there is.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.560
 I see.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560
 The tropics.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.560
 Pretty cool.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:57.520
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.440
 So you're a very intuitive fellow, obviously, and that's why we like talking to you.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:07.380
 What do you think these people who are running this whole COVID thing, do you have any insights

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.960
 on where you think this is going to go from here after, what has it been, what, a year

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.960
 and a half?

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.960
 Yeah.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.640
 Have you been following videos of people like David Martin?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.080
 I have, and we've been streaming that wonderful video that he did.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.480
 He's really on it, isn't he?

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:39.480
 Yeah, and the people he identifies, they are just personally limited bad characters, almost

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.720
 uniformly.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.000
 They're people that you wouldn't personally want to associate with.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Yes.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.960
 This Moskowitz guy, did you see that?

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.840
 He's really in on all this.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.840
 Man.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.840
 Yeah.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.840
 Martin is really something, isn't he?

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.040
 He's a really interesting fellow.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040
 Yeah.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.480
 He has an odd PhD in physiology.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.200
 I think it's the only one in the world.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:17.000
 You got it from the University of Virginia, where he has been working ever since then,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.720
 but it gave him a pretty broad background in physiology.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720
 Yeah.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.440
 Well, he's a very, very intelligent fellow and doing great work.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:35.560
 I'm surprised they even let him anywhere anymore in his videos.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.560
 He's pretty out there.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.320
 This is a great question.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.840
 We'll start out with Dr. Peat, a lady that believes that she was exposed to some folks

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:51.040
 who had had the injection and got some face heat going on, some heat in her face that

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.320
 she's never experienced before.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.160
 Wondering what this could possibly be.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.160
 Face heat.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.160
 Heat in the face.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.160
 Yes, sir.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:14.400
 That is usually a combination of nerves and nitric oxide activation, all of the pro-inflammatory

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.720
 things related to the virus and the vaccines.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:29.000
 All of them make you more susceptible to ups and downs of your nitric oxide production.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Let's see.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 Nitric oxide.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Nitric oxide.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Those all tie in.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.960
 So is it possible then that folks can be getting things on some levels from the injected people,

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.060
 also known as shedding?

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:52.360
 The shedding of large molecules and nucleic acids and proteins and so on, that has been

00:17:52.360 --> 00:18:03.360
 studied very thoroughly and in understandable detail.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:11.600
 Like you put a cold piece of metal in front of a person's nose and collect the fluid that

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.160
 condenses out of your breath.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:24.480
 Going back 20 years, this has been used to analyze people's metabolism.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:31.600
 Not just small molecules that you would understand, like garlic fumes coming out of your breath

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:43.540
 and so on, but you find proteins and DNA and RNA molecules condensing out of your breath.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.560
 These reflect what's normally circulating, your own DNA and RNA.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:19:03.320
 So the FBI has known about those and that your breath condensates are identifying you

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.320
 individually by your DNA.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.400
 It doesn't have to be a saliva sample or a hair sample, but just the condensate of your

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:24.600
 breath is an identifying molecular indicator that the FBI has recognized as something that

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.880
 you can transmit.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:35.120
 One person can rub it off on another and they can leave it on things in the environment

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.120
 and confuse the FBI investigations.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.880
 But it's not necessarily negative things that we share.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:45.880
 It's just everything.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880
 Yeah, everything.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.520
 They call exosomes information, whatever it is.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520
 Yeah.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:01.240
 And the Pfizer people were aware of those pre-existing years of research showing that

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:09.120
 RNA and DNA that's already circulating is going to come out on your breath and skin.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:20.080
 And so they warned their testing people doing the preliminary tests on the vaccines not

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:30.720
 to risk contaminating pregnant and breastfeeding women by the breath or skin contact with people

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:39.640
 who have been vaccinated because they knew if they were adding novel RNA, since you're

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:47.280
 already spreading existing RNA and DNA, if they add something new, for sure it's going

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:57.080
 to get into your shed material and be a potential contaminant and harm pregnant and breastfeeding

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.080
 women.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.080
 Wow.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:07.840
 So with that said, we're always sharing things good, the bad, the ugly with others?

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840
 Yeah.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.840
 Pretty much?

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840
 Yeah.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:18.720
 And our food, there are a couple of laboratories that have for years been watching the fate

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.840
 of the DNA in the food we eat.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:29.640
 And a little bit of it tends to stay with us and get incorporated into our cells.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:37.720
 So you can find cow DNA, spinach DNA, whatever you look for, traces of it.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.960
 No matter what we eat, right?

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960
 It's all in there.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960
 Yeah.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960
 Yeah.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.360
 Getting incorporated right into our cells.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:56.120
 Often they find that algae DNA, for example, if a person is eating a lot of algae, that

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:06.760
 can affect their nervous and mental functions because the foreign DNA is getting too high

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.240
 a concentration.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.920
 Too high a concentration in what way?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:21.440
 It starts governing our behavior rather than just being treated as a contaminant.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:28.480
 It starts actually influencing the metabolism of the cell.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:43.760
 For example, some people with a high contamination of certain algae or organisms, it goes with

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.800
 the damaged memory and reasoning processes.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:54.320
 And it can be damaged because it's coming out of the ocean.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.520
 So you're assimilating too much of it.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.920
 Everyone is assimilating some traces.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:10.520
 But when you incorporate it as a major part of your diet, then it can start taking some

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.120
 control and influencing your functioning.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.120
 Wow.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.040
 Dr. Ray Peat, stay right there, sir.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.680
 We're going to take a little break and then we'll start taking some emails.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:28.440
 If you have an email, a question for him, you are just welcome to do it and you can

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.000
 do it right now.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.680
 For my first meal of the day, I like to make a blended drink and I'm always basing my

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.320
 blended drinks around colostrum.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.600
 Colostrum adds so much creamy flavor and texture that if you don't have it, smoothies start

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.760
 to seem a little bit watery to me.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.000
 Now I'm going to be combining it with a bunch of other ingredients, but it really

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.080
 is the all-star.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.960
 Colostrum has so many health benefits.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.600
 Probably it's best known for its effects on the immune system.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.000
 There's actually an article in PubMed showing colostrum to be three times more effective

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.540
 against flu and flu symptoms than flu vaccines are, even in high-risk patients.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.520
 It's incredible for fighting flu and other viral-type infections.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.600
 It's also really good for building lean muscle mass.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.780
 In fact, it contains all 89 of the known mammalian growth factors.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.360
 It's also very good for the gut lining.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:29.200
 So people who suffer from things like Crohn's, IBS, leaky gut syndrome, a lot of those folks

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:35.280
 are using colostrum in the regenerative process to heal and restore their gut lining.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.320
 And one of the things I love about it is that it's a complete food.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.040
 So colostrum contains everything a mammal needs to thrive.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.160
 It contains all of the essential amino acids.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.080
 It contains all of the essential lipids or fats.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.960
 It contains all of the essential glyconutrients.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.840
 Those are essential sugars that we need for our immune function.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:00.960
 So it's got all of that and all those growth factors, which means this is really a complete

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:10.120
 food for human beings or for any other mammals.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120
 Tastes great.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.600
 It's got the fuel I need to get through the day.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.880
 And it's got all those added health benefits thanks to the colostrum too.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.880
 And remember, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that colostrum is just one of the great

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.880
 products that Daniel has.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:30.200
 The pine pollen, the elk velvet antler, the shaga and the reishi, digestive bitters.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.480
 We also have the vitamin DK2 thing.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.800
 And I think that's about it.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.300
 But really nice products.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.040
 Everything is in myron glass.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:46.080
 So that's something that helps to keep things fresher and actually powers them up a little

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.680
 bit as Dr. Cowan does in his powders as well, the myron glass.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:57.040
 So it's a great company and we think that you'll enjoy this colostrum.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.920
 If you haven't tried it, it's really quite special.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.560
 Really quite special.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.640
 Colostrum from Daniel Vitalis and Sir Thrivell.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.360
 And this from Shen Blossom.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.040
 Previously with our conversation with Brandon Amelani.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.040
 We love the rice sprouts.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.040
 I tell you what, they're happening.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.320
 My little body likes that.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.320
 Oh man, I don't know why.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.320
 Oh yeah.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.240
 I mean people get amazing results.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.440
 Something as simple as sprouted and fermented rice is just like so nutrient dense, so easily

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.440
 absorbable.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.560
 And it builds the chi and the organ systems in the body.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.920
 It's very neutral for most people.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.560
 So it's just, you can feed it to your kids.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.560
 It's really safe.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.240
 And I get more positive feedback on that one than any of the other powders.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.600
 But yeah, it's basically an heirloom rice source that we source from a family, a small

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.840
 family in Japan.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.340
 So it's like an heirloom grade rice.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:49.120
 And then we take that and do a fermentation process on it.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:54.600
 So it combines the endosperm, sprout and the rice brand, but it makes the brand soluble.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.440
 And the fermentation process actually unlocks a lot of, fermentation has this really amazing

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.880
 ability to create nutrients out of nothing through that process.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.840
 So yeah, that's a really special product in a lot of ways.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.320
 Rice sprouts, really nice product.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.640
 Front page, One Radio Network, Shen Blossom.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.640
 You see the ad.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.960
 This is where you get the goji berries, schizandra, ginseng, a lot of cool things.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.760
 And try these rice sprouts for you and the kids.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.200
 Front page, One Radio Network dot com.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.200
 Indeed, and there's just so much to choose from there.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:31.720
 I just went on his website this morning and looked around and black bamboo, check this

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:41.360
 out, black bamboo vinegar, brown rice miso, coral seaweed, green teas.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.120
 He's got green teas.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.040
 Extra virgin olive oil, that's very, very nice as well.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.040
 We love extra virgin olive oil.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.480
 What other kind of things?

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.880
 Goji berries, schizandra, minoni honey from Hawaii.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.880
 Grotine powders, these are very, very nice powders.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.760
 Two of them, different ones, and bamboo.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.860
 Bamboo is the first ingredient on both of them.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:07.800
 And the ho-shi-wu formula.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.240
 Good things for the kidneys, on and on and on.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.800
 I think you'll enjoy what you find there on Shen Blossom.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:23.060
 There's a mountain detox formula that you can take before you eat, which is pretty cool.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:30.680
 He also has the digestive, it's called Prime, you put a little bit in your hand and then

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.120
 put your tongue there and get that before you eat.

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.480
 The Poten-C, which is a collagen vitamin C formula.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:46.080
 Pepper Plus too, which is a very extraordinary strain of pepper, different form of pepper

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.900
 that he claims is good for you.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:54.440
 So a lot of good things on any Shen Blossom link on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:01.720
 We talk about your health, wealth, and well-being on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:07.800
 It's the third Monday of the month and we get to talk to Dr. Ray Peat, who's a PhD and

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:12.000
 been around for a long time doing such good things like this.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:20.160
 Dr. Peat, I want to ask you about, what's the difference between DNA, DNA is just, it's

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.160
 there, right?

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.680
 I mean, this is just the signature of what's going on in our body like you were talking

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.680
 about, right?

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:36.800
 Yeah, it's a framework if you think in terms of inertia, it's the slowest acting, it's

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:47.440
 like a stone foundation and a structural system, very, very slow to change.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:53.360
 It offers the long-range stability of the organism species.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.800
 But does it change?

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.760
 I mean, you say slow to change, but as we grow and evolve and get healthier, does it

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.760
 change?

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:13.440
 Yeah, every time we adapt to something, we're slightly modifying the DNA background.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:24.160
 And so part of it, it becomes more and more heritable if you experience it.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:33.400
 For example, three or four or five generations in a row, then the heritability of it has

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:43.720
 increased, and that adds to your long-range inertia or foundation.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:54.480
 But the individual can modify that framework and get one or two or three generations of

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.640
 inheritance of the effect of your experience.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:06.440
 But the more the environment causes you to have that adaptation, the longer effect it's

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.680
 going to have on the species.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.000
 And then we modify it by our state of consciousness?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:23.840
 Yeah, the state of consciousness is the essence of how we meet the environment and predict

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.840
 it and profit from it.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:34.800
 If your consciousness is constantly being surprised and thrown off balance, then your

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:41.560
 adaptations are always going to be random and ineffective.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:51.640
 But the better your predictive understanding is of where your life process is taking you,

00:31:51.640 --> 00:32:00.160
 the more successful the momentary adaptation will be and the more likely to be constructive

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.880
 in the long range.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:09.680
 So if we react to the outside influences, could we argue that we're becoming a little

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:18.320
 bit weaker by reacting to them unconsciously rather than consciously?

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:27.360
 The consciousness means that we find out an aspect of the environment that is exactly

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.600
 what we need.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:36.000
 So it all comes from the environment, but with our consciousness of it, we can pick

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:43.440
 out which are just right for going ahead.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.920
 If you don't have that conscious selection of where you're going and what specific

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:58.960
 change you're making, then you don't have that long range productive progress in your

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.960
 metabolism.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.960
 Fascinating.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:08.240
 So what's the difference then between the DNA and the genes?

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:22.640
 Of the gene, the idea existed long before there was any knowledge about DNA and its

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.640
 effects.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:33.360
 But partly the language of genes is very unscientific.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:44.080
 It was originally used to deny that there can be any change.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.920
 The gene was supposed to be the eternal.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.480
 Like you had this genetic thing and this is the way you are, right?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.160
 That kind of idea.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.160
 Yeah.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:34:02.080
 But thinking of it in terms of the inertia of our response to the environment, the gene

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.400
 idea is a degree of inertia.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:19.800
 It isn't an absolute immortal always and the only feature of our species.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:33.880
 The DNA is something to be put to use, modified as far as we can modify it, expressing or

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:45.360
 repressing the expression of the DNA according to what we need to be expressed.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.880
 So that's the whole idea of epigenetics that over the last, I don't know how long,

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:57.800
 you tell me please, that we've known that the idea of these genes, they don't really

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:58.800
 matter much.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.760
 We just create them as we go.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:08.400
 They're more of a visual of what's going on in our body?

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:23.160
 Yeah, Charles Darwin sketched out the idea of the inheritance of acquired traits.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:32.240
 He was absolutely in line with his grandfather who was a pioneer in the inheritance of acquired

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:45.120
 traits and confirming Lamarck's idea that life is acquiring traits by interacting with

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.120
 the environment.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:53.160
 But the neo-Darwinists totally falsified the real Darwin.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:36:02.680
 The real Darwin said that in behavior, in our adapting to the environment, the cells

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:11.200
 which are adapting and interacting with the environment are sending out little capsules

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:20.560
 of information into the bloodstream, getting into the gonads ready to be inherited.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:34.920
 These capsules of information he called jammules, a little kind of message secreted by the tissue

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:43.360
 as it lives in the environment, describing the process, the progress it has made, and

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:52.640
 putting that into the blood ready to be inherited through the gonadal cells.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.640
 That's exactly...

00:36:53.640 --> 00:37:05.760
 It took 160 or 170 years before exactly those mechanisms were verified.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:17.000
 The exosome or endosomes, various names for them, our cells in adapting do put nucleic

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:28.440
 acids and proteins and message material into these little experience capsules to travel

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:40.160
 through the body to help repair other tissues and they gain access to the gametes and can

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:44.280
 be passed on to the offspring.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:50.800
 It's exactly the sort of jammules that Darwin sketched out.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:59.600
 We have them now identified as endosomes and exosomes, carrying information around, new

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:14.440
 information never exactly formed in this manner, but it's now recognized as a manner of communication

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:22.760
 between our experiencing and adapting cells and our gonads and the next generations.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.600
 Wow, that's pretty interesting, isn't it, the way that works?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:32.440
 Yeah, there are several labs that are making this connection now.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:37.880
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timponi, OneRadioNetwork.com, thanks for joining us.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:45.600
 Let's start out with a couple of emails here.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:54.240
 Could the extremely low DHEA levels after adrenalectomy be the reason why a 30-year-old

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.120
 guy would not respond to thyroid supplementation?

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:02.800
 Oh, sure, you need your adrenals.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:14.080
 In animal experiments, it happens that progesterone, the substance itself, contains the main functions

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:18.040
 of your adrenal steroids.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:30.600
 The androgens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids are reflected in the molecule of progesterone.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:37.720
 If your adrenals have been removed, then you just aren't able to respond to the increased

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:48.240
 metabolic rate of active thyroid metabolism unless you have some material to make up for

00:39:48.240 --> 00:40:01.280
 the missing adrenals, either the aldosterone cortisol, for example, to provide the adaptive

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.760
 flexibility or progesterone.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:10.480
 So what would be something that this emailer could kind of look at to balance things out

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.480
 for himself?

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:29.360
 Make sure that their blood tests are being recognized and used to compensate properly

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:39.920
 because it can be deadly to have a deficiency of the adrenal steroids unless you're replacing

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.240
 them.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.960
 So he's got to be working with somebody that knows what they're doing with this thing.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.440
 It's kind of a tricky biz, right?

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:56.040
 Yeah, the adrenal deficiency is a real serious thing that for the rest of your life you have

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.400
 to depend on supplements.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.840
 I wonder why they would take out the adrenals.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:13.960
 They used to do it for cancer treatments, but that has been abandoned for 60 years.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.440
 This is from Alistair for Dr. Peat.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.560
 What does Dr. Peat think about homeopathy?

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:24.760
 Do Gilbert Ling's ideas support the notion that information can be contained within water,

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:34.440
 for example, even if it is diluted to submolecular concentrations?

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:49.600
 In the vaguest way, yes, but Gilbert Ling's understanding of water is in the living state

00:41:49.600 --> 00:42:07.240
 and the living state has all of its very powerful stabilizing factors that are not in the same

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:18.520
 world as the very delicate type of information transfer that homeopaths are talking about.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:24.560
 So the takeaway from that is that in general...

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:37.600
 There's some good science behind homeopathy, but Gilbert Ling's work is not at all directed

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:45.600
 towards those ultra-sensitive therapeutic ideas.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:55.280
 Is the basic idea long ago when they created these vaccines, was that supposed to be kind

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.360
 of a homeopathic idea?

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:04.040
 A little bit of this will help your body to figure this out, that kind of thing?

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:19.920
 Yes, for the last few years I've been emphasizing that the whole antibody-centered idea of health

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:27.440
 and immunity really is just a marketing ploy of the drug industry.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:37.680
 It requires stepping back and reconsidering our 100-year history of giving out Nobel Prizes

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:45.360
 for antibody-connected research.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:58.080
 The idea was set up in the time of Pasteur with great support from the chemical industry

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:08.120
 that wanted to create markets for its patent remedies, basically.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:23.600
 It used Paul Ehrlich and his 1908 reception of the Nobel Prize for Immunity.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:42.800
 The antibody doctrine was an idea of the chemical industry to create a perpetual market for

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:50.760
 their products as a continuation of a natural immune process.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:45:02.480
 The antibody Ehrlich described as a magic bullet of the body, which is kind of true.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:12.480
 The antibody does have specificity for individual chemicals and organisms, but our immune system

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.080
 is much more than that.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:24.200
 His reason for talking about the magic bullet property of our natural immune system is that

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:36.880
 he wanted to connect the drug industry's products based on mercury and arsenic, for example,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:49.240
 as poisons to kill microorganisms that were very resistant to the immune system.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:59.560
 He used these extremely toxic chemicals and built them into a system promoted by the drug

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:13.040
 industry that he recognized that dyes, coal tar-derived chemicals that produced the dye

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:20.600
 substance, had staining specificities.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:30.840
 The fact that different chemical dyes stain different tissues and different disease organisms,

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:41.240
 he identified that as a kind of specificity analogous to the specificity of the antibody.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:56.880
 It's an entirely verbal sales pitch, no real science behind it.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:08.720
 That 1908 Ehrlich Nobel Prize was used by the industry in medicine to say that these

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:14.920
 chemicals are analogous to what the body is really doing.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:24.960
 He shared that 1908 prize with Metchnikoff, who was talking about the immune system as

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:33.600
 everything including the antibodies, but with only a very small role for the antibodies.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:42.800
 It turns out 100 years later and more of it, the Metchnikoff approach to a complicated

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:49.560
 multi-level adaptable immune system is what we have.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:59.120
 The antibody doctrine is just an offspring of the chemical industry's marketing business.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.520
 Now, of course, this whole PCR thing is all about the antibodies, right?

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:13.000
 Yeah, unless you go back and look at where the idea of our immune system is built on

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:21.240
 the antibodies, that's all powered by the German chemical industry.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:26.520
 This idea that a lot of the immune system is in our gut, is that true?

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:34.840
 Yeah, starting right at our skin and our gut membranes.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.400
 Speaking of that, I got this interesting email from Hilda.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.000
 "I just started taking probiotics.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.200
 I was having trouble with constipation and I've only been on for about two or three

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.800
 weeks but I've really seen some great results.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:57.280
 Can Dr. Peat explain to me what is going on, why I'm eliminating better digestion, and

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.800
 can I take as much probiotics as I want?"

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.760
 Okay, so why is she feeling better doing probiotics?

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:11.760
 I'm sorry, not probiotics, it's fermented foods.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.360
 Let's paraphrase it.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.560
 It was what?

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.560
 Fermented foods.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:22.080
 I substituted probiotics for fermented foods, sorry, because it was a long thing and I paraphrased

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.080
 what she was saying.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.080
 It was a very long email.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.080
 Sorry, fermented foods.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:34.160
 In fermented foods, there are many, many antibiotic substances.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:43.920
 One type of bacteria can very effectively kill and eliminate the bad bacteria.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:52.680
 So if you're lucky, your fermented food can act like antibiotics and set things straight.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:50:01.280
 But fermented foods are extremely variable and they can produce carcinogenic materials

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.480
 too, so it isn't always predictable.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:11.040
 Right, but so if somebody makes their own way with sauerkraut with salt or whatever,

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:15.920
 I mean how would we know if the fermented foods that we get are what we want?

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.440
 I mean, would it just have to be trial and success and see how our digestion elimination

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.440
 works?

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.040
 Would that be a good marker if we eliminate better?

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.600
 Yeah, trial and error is pretty much the same.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.160
 Pretty much we're going to do.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.600
 Sorry, Hilda, I substituted the words.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:39.640
 I just in my mind, I substituted probiotics for fermented foods.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.360
 Interesting.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.880
 You know, so much stuff now, Dr. Peter, seems to be coming out.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:52.980
 There's a mainstream, pretty mainstream, very popular website called Revolver that

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:57.760
 actually gets mentioned on Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.640
 Of course, Steve Bannon got arrested this morning, so let's not go there.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:07.820
 But anyway, it's all about the vaccine did nothing to stop polio disease caused mostly

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:08.820
 by pesticides.

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:14.360
 We've had other people say that about the whole polio story.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.560
 Do you have any theories on that or insights?

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.420
 Oh, yeah.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:34.400
 If you just read the history of how polio occurred, as much detail as you can get, the

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:43.720
 whole myth of polio and vaccination, it falls apart.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:54.840
 The paralytic polio, as soon as the vaccine came on the market, it appeared to have been

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.920
 curing polio.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:03.680
 All they did was rename the paralysis that occurs and no longer call it polio.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.400
 They just call it something else.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:17.440
 So with the disappearance of polio as a result of the vaccine, other types of paralysis sprang

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.480
 into the foreground and they no longer called it polio.

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.920
 So pesticides played a role in this?

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.280
 We think that's what was going on.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.280
 Yeah.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:37.040
, and chemical poisoning all contributed to paralytic results.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:49.880
 Among other things, injections were demonstrated to increase the paralytic effects of a given

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.520
 organism.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.760
 So even the vaccination was increasing.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:05.480
 In Africa, they're still seeing that if a kid is vaccinated in the right hip or the

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:14.960
 left arm for polio, the paralysis is most likely to affect their right leg or their

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.800
 left arm, depending on where they were vaccinated.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:23.400
 When I was in grade school, Dr. Peat, they gave a sugar cubes polio thing.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.400
 I wonder what was in that thing.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:31.880
 I think that was a semi-living virus.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:39.240
 Have you seen the words smallpox been starting to come up?

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:44.720
 Do you think they've got smallpox in the future of humanity or they want to run with this

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.720
 one?

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:53.320
 Oh yeah, they've saved it in freezers so that they can use it for germ warfare.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.400
 What is smallpox?

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.760
 What is it exactly?

00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.760
 It's a virus.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:00.760
 It's a virus?

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:01.760
 Yeah.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.440
 But it has to be onto the skin, right?

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.000
 You got to get it in there somewhere.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.720
 Is that correct?

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:11.880
 They do it with the blankets in the Indians and all of that?

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.880
 Yeah.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:21.320
 It's the infectivity of the different poxy diseases.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:31.920
 The herpes forms a pox, a chicken pox, all of these have some similarity.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:47.040
 Some of the viruses just around the family, if someone has a cold sore on their lip and

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:53.080
 people drink out of the same cup, that will spread the cold sore.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:55:02.360
 And it can be on pens that you write with or doorknobs or whatever.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:10.560
 It can persist for several hours and be transmitted by touch.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.320
 It wasn't a smallpox, it wasn't a thing through the air allegedly.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:18.000
 It was more by touch.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.760
 More by touch, is that correct?

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:26.000
 And then they do a smallpox vaccine by scraping the skin or something like that?

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:36.520
 Yeah, for hundreds of years they were demonstrating that if you could induce the production of

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:43.800
 one of these little sores, that that could make you resistant to the disease.

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:50.920
 And that if you injected it by scraping locally, that increased the chance that you would just

00:55:50.920 --> 00:56:00.360
 get a local swelling and local disease and that would give you immunity against the deadly

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.720
 whole body disease.

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:11.040
 So it was the manner and location of the vaccination that was so successful with smallpox.

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:20.040
 If you injected smallpox into a muscle the way they do, it would have probably been killing

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:22.920
 about 100% of the vaccinated people.

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.480
 Dr. Ray Peters is with us.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:29.920
 Martin Armstrong, he's really an interesting fellow in the world of economics.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.800
 He'll be here on Wednesday.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:36.160
 And then Dr. Andrew Kaufman is going to join us at noon on Wednesday.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.920
 It's been a long time since we've talked to him.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.120
 We recently talked with Dr. Thomas Cowan.

00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.080
 I'll send you the interview.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:52.600
 And he was speaking in the idea that more and more that he looks at it, the cells are

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:59.160
 more in the terms of the Gerald Pollack idea of the gel thing.

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:04.000
 And a lot of the different cells that they taught him in, different aspects of the cell

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.120
 they taught him in medical school was just not right.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:13.640
 And the cells are actually this gel-like material.

00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.640
 Any ideas on that?

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.640
 Oh sure.

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.960
 And that was Leng as well, wasn't it?

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:19.960
 Or Hillman?

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:20.960
 Yeah.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:32.840
 When I started in graduate school in 1968, the professors were selling the membrane doctrine

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:36.120
 and sodium pumps and so on.

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:45.960
 And I read all of the assigned papers but looked at the same journals where the assigned

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:56.360
 papers were published and found that back in the '30s and '40s, there were very productive

00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:03.000
 ideas about how cell water and minerals are handled.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:15.880
 And it was only a very superficial doctrine error, a part of the early research that came

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:24.560
 to be formed into the membrane theory and sodium pump theory.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:36.360
 And reading what was actually going on, all of the best research of the 1940s was being

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:46.400
 accumulated in the work of people related to Gilbert Lane.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:59:03.280
 And his early work in the '50s was predicting in a very coherent way how the outcome of

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.840
 the research was going.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:15.280
 But he didn't publish his definitive works until the '60s and '70s.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:25.760
 And by that time, he had completely shown the impossibility of the accepted mainstream

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:30.440
 idea that cells have membranes and sodium pumps.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:43.640
 It simply became clear that they were impossible fantasies and people didn't want to acknowledge

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.600
 the existence of Gilbert Lane.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:57.160
 So they lied about what he was writing about and basically created a slander culture against

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.800
 Lane and his colleagues.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:07.640
 So what is the takeaway for us who have bodies here listening on this November 15 day, knowing

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:13.240
 like what Colin is now talking about and what you've known for a long time, as opposed to

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.240
 the way we've been sold?

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:19.080
 How does it help us to know this?

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:26.800
 The inclination of our very substance is in the right direction.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:38.160
 So one of the implications of the Gilbert Lane orientation is that the processes don't

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.440
 take energy to survive.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:52.120
 The purpose of the energy should be to change and adapt, but merely surviving does not take

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.120
 any energy.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.560
 Surviving doesn't take any energy.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560
 That's interesting.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.560
 Wow.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560
 Yeah.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.240
 A very big change.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:06.240
 The sodium pump says it's constant uphill work, just staying alive.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240
 I see.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:17.000
 You have to spend about 15 times as much energy as ourselves can ever make just to stay alive.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
 Wow.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.640
 So that's the whole thing with the ATP and all that, which just isn't true, right?

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.640
 Just isn't true.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640
 Wow.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:33.240
 It's almost like they planned this so you felt inferior or you couldn't live a long

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.440
 time or you couldn't be healthy without their help or something.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.440
 Yeah.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.200
 It's all made up.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.280
 Made up to suit their business needs.

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.280
 Wow.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:49.880
 And the blood-brain barrier thing, that's not true, the way we've been taught?

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.320
 The blood which?

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.320
 Blood-brain barrier.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320
 Remember?

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.320
 Oh, yeah.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.320
 There's no...

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.880
 No blood-brain barrier.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:08.920
 Yeah, many years ago someone injected an emulsion of soybean oil into the carotid artery and

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:16.160
 showed that it was massively taken up on the first pass through the brain.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.440
 The oil just fell into the brain like it was running through a sponge.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.440
 Wow.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.800
 No barrier at all to certain substances.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.200
 It's a resistance.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:35.040
 The brain is a fatty organ and it's a resistance to watery substances, but there's no barrier

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.040
 to fats.

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:40.000
 Because there's blood in the brain, I mean, there's no barrier, right?

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
 I mean, where would the barrier be?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
 Yeah.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.440
 But even in natural medicine, Doc, they've talked about this blood-brain barrier for

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.440
 years.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.440
 We all bought into it.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.440
 I did.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.240
 It seemed like a reasonable thing.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.720
 You didn't because you're a smart guy.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.640
 Every difference of tissue has some difference of affinity.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:05.760
 And so each tissue picks up things according to its affinity.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:13.840
 And where you have a very different type of tissues in contact, there'll be an apparent

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.200
 partial barrier.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:23.720
 But it's only a matter of a barrier with reference to the consistency of the substance.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.720
 Yes, sir.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720
 This is great.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:34.400
 From Peter, Dr. Peat has mentioned his affinity towards coconut oil.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.600
 I'm wondering if he could explain why coconut oil is good for us to take.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.000
 Coconut oil.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.240
 Oh, it's just that it's saturated.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:56.160
 When we eat starch and sugar in excess, we turn the carbohydrate into saturated fats.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:07.760
 And a very small part of the saturated fats that we make can be turned into oleic acid

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.600
 and omega-9 fatty acid.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:23.480
 And that can be turned into a series of polyunsaturated fats derived from starch and sugar.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:29.400
 And if we eat only saturated fats, it's the same thing.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:41.120
 We can create our minus-9 series of polyunsaturated fats from saturated fats or from carbohydrates.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:52.800
 It's the minus-6 and minus-3 series that are unstable and tend to promote interference

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:58.920
 with oxygen metabolism and to create inflammation.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:05.600
 So if you are going to eat some fats, it's better if they're saturated.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.360
 Butter is one, is that?

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.680
 Butter is probably the best.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.680
 The best.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:16.040
 So if you were going to have potatoes, you could even take a teaspoon of coconut oil.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.760
 Would it help balance it out?

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760
 Or butter?

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:24.120
 Yes, if you don't have good butter and cream, coconut oil is okay.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.360
 There you go.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:30.600
 Richard writes in, "Just turned 70 and found my blood sugar is 200."

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.680
 He doesn't say here if this is fasting.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:39.400
 What are some ideas that I can do to get back into balance without drugs?

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:48.280
 It really depends on what time of day you did the test and what you were eating in the

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.360
 last 12 hours.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:06:02.760
 But you should investigate the other hormones, vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and your balance

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.560
 of calcium and phosphate in your diet.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:17.160
 Those are all things that can create the illusion of diabetes without necessarily the commitment

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.560
 to actual sickness.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:26.680
 Okay, here's one, Michael Brooklyn, "Love your show.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.400
 I've been following Dr. Rapey for a long time.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.720
 Thanks for having him on.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:37.000
 My 9-year-old son out of nowhere seemed to now have trouble swallowing.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.840
 Couldn't have anything but liquid for two weeks.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.320
 Now he's starting to get better, but still has trouble swallowing after two months.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.400
 What could this be?"

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:59.880
 It could be an allergy, but I think around that age, it's important to check their thyroid

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:08.040
 and other hormones because with the changing hormone environment of puberty, sometimes

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:20.400
 the thyroid gets blocked and that can increase sensitivity to allergens, but it can also

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:26.200
 enlarge the thyroid gland and cause swallowing difficulties.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:32.280
 Oh, so that's the idea, connection between a low thyroid and swallowing where the thyroid

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.800
 gland is enlarging.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.560
 Is it trying to reach out to get some nutrients or something while it enlarges?

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:48.680
 Yeah, when it isn't able to make the thyroid hormone that it needs, the stimulation causes

01:07:48.680 --> 01:08:04.000
 it to grow and the growth can cause sore throat, hoarseness, a sense of a lump in the throat

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:12.400
 as well as that tends to go with allergic sensitivities, so it's really important to

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.400
 have a blood test for thyroid and other hormones.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:25.640
 Aereo, Patrick mentioned his thyroid, his TSH is now 0.3 and Dr. Peat suggested it needed

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.640
 to be lower.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:33.420
 Could you repeat on what he said his recommended number is?

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:44.300
 Within the range of 0.4 downward, that group in populations is essentially free of thyroid

01:08:44.300 --> 01:09:00.700
 cancer because the higher the TSH is, the more stress and inflammation happens in the

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:10.260
 thyroid gland and so either a deficiency or an excess of iodide in the environment will

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:20.460
 cause inflammation of the thyroid and a tendency to develop cancer.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:34.100
 So when your iodide intake is just right, fairly low, your TSH stays in that 0.4 and

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.100
 below range.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:39.380
 But you had suggested I could even get lower, take it a little more piggy if I wanted to

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.380
 experiment.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:48.300
 Yeah, lots of people are very happy and healthy when they have a 0.1 or 0.1.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.940
 Wow, that's amazing.

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:57.580
 And you've seen on these blood tests where they have their, what do they call it, safe

01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:04.020
 range doctor, whatever they call it, the recommended range is like 4 to 10 or something like that.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:10.460
 Oh yeah, that's kind of a sub-cult.

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:19.620
 If you look at the history of TSH and the theory of how to measure thyroid deficiency,

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:25.740
 it goes back to what I call a fraud.

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:32.700
 It's a total destruction of our thyroid understanding.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:41.540
 Starting in the 1940s, I've got an article called "50 Years of Fraud" which superficially

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:51.580
 traces out the history of how TSH has come to be the defining trait of thyroid function.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:57.820
 So that's why to this day, you're concerned, what you look at is the TSH and you don't

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.740
 care about the other ones.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.300
 That's the standard medical opinion.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:13.060
 I look at TSH as one of the pro-inflammatory pituitary hormones that is best when it's

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.060
 minimal.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:18.300
 Low as you can go, right?

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:21.660
 Yeah, it's promoting inflammation.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:33.060
 TSH goes up in hypothyroidism and things like inflammation of the blood vessels increases

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:38.620
 because of high TSH, not just because of low thyroid hormone.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:46.780
 TSH is an active factor in the sickness of thyroid deficiency.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:51.180
 Catherine wants to know, she's in California, "Could Dr. Peat discuss the relationship between

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:56.140
 freckles and lipofuscin if there is one?

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.580
 Why do young children have freckles?

01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.980
 I thought they were hereditary.

01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:05.940
 Why do people with fair skin tones and red hair usually have freckles?"

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.260
 You usually have what?

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.260
 Freckles.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:14.420
 Yeah, why do the red hair and the light skin people have freckles?

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:23.940
 Yeah, I think partly it's an irritated inflammatory reaction.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:35.220
 I've known people who had sort of a pre-cancerous reaction when they were extremely deficient

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:44.300
 in vitamin D and then got exposed on the background of red hair and very pale skin.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:52.140
 They're more susceptible because of the lower pigment deficiency in defense against

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.900
 ultraviolet.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.020
 Brandon writes in, "After all these years, have Dr. Peat ever come up with an idea of

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:06.780
 how to get one's natural hair color back if they are gray?"

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:09.580
 Do we know why the hair turns gray?

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:20.340
 Yeah, partly it's that the skin loses or can't retain the copper enzyme that produces

01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:31.740
 the melanin pigment and a toxic accumulation of some competing metals such as iron can

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:38.260
 displace the copper and accelerate the loss of pigment.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:45.060
 So it displaces the copper so one might play around with getting more copper in.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:54.780
 And less of the competing iron and possibly other heavy metals like molybdenum.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.220
 They would come in through what pathway?

01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.220
 Foods?

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:08.220
 Yeah, just random accumulation of food materials over the years.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:09.220
 Interesting.

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:16.020
 What do you think about drinking water that's been in a copper vessel?

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:19.260
 It's okay if it wasn't acidic water.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:29.060
 People recognize the taste of copper pretty well at a toxic level if the water has a low

01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:30.060
 pH.

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:36.140
 Oh, so what would be an undoable number for you pH-wise?

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.260
 Five or six?

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:49.900
 Yeah, around six it's already absorbing more copper than you wouldn't want to drink the

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:56.140
 water if it had been standing in a copper vessel at pH six.

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.300
 But seven or eight would be okay?

01:14:58.300 --> 01:14:59.300
 Yeah.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.420
 Here's a good one.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:08.380
 Rachel, "Hi Patrick, could you please ask Dr. Peat the best foods for autoimmune poly-let

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:17.060
 me spell it for you doc, P-O-L-Y-M-O-S-I-T-I-S, it's cause and whether the current medications

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:20.500
 are of any use?"

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.900
 I just didn't get the word.

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:24.900
 Polymotis?

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.900
 Polymostis?

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.900
 Poly-M-O-S-I-T-I-S.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:27.900
 Autoimmune polymostis.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.900
 I don't know.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.900
 I've never heard of that one.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:42.460
 You've not heard of that term?

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:45.580
 No, not that spelling of it.

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.420
 Okay, maybe.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:54.940
 Does Dr. Peat suggest, oh this is the lady who had the heat, you know, on her face, that

01:15:54.940 --> 01:16:00.300
 I would need some nitric oxide to get rid of the inside, to get rid of it inside of

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:04.340
 me shedding from these jabs.

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:07.100
 Would increasing that nitric oxide help her?

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:11.700
 No, no it would probably make it worse.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:21.040
 Hot flushes consist of a surge of nitric oxide opening up the blood vessels.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.820
 So these shedding of the injection could be causing the hot flushes?

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:32.420
 Yeah, I think so.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:41.100
 The blood vessels are very responsive to such things as shed spike protein.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:47.060
 "I've been struggling with COPD for almost 10 years," writes an emailer.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:55.340
 "Every year it gets a little worse and I have to take more medication, albuterol and

01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.660
 Simbicort."

01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:04.400
 Does Dr. Peat have any suggestions on things to do to help the struggle with COPD?

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:12.060
 There is not much out there that I can find other than pharmaceuticals.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:21.620
 It depends really on what exactly the diagnosis means.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:29.460
 There are so many potential things that can increase the obstruction.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:43.020
 A friend of mine who was overweight in his mid-80s, when I visited him, his skin was

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:49.140
 very purple and he was just sitting and gasping.

01:17:49.140 --> 01:18:01.180
 He was even slow to recognize who I was, and it was affecting all of his brain processes.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:13.620
 His daughter, right from that day, started adding a little bit of thyroid hormone, progesterone

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:19.060
 and pregnenolone to his food.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:29.180
 Within two weeks, when I went back to visit him again, his skin color was normal and his

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.740
 breathing was normal.

01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:43.740
 He took me up to his upper floor office and had me panting, but he was breathing like

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:55.580
 a normal young man after having that almost terminal obstructive lung disease.

01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:07.300
 They had called it emphysema, but there are lots of variations on obstructive lung problems.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:15.060
 Adding inflammatory foods in the diet is one of the important starting places.

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:19.140
 What are some of the things he did?

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:29.420
 This person just added thyroid hormone, pregnenolone and progesterone, which are all anti-inflammatory

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:43.700
 things that happened to be just exactly what he needed.

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:44.700
 We mentioned coconut oil.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:47.700
 It's in coconut oil, isn't it?

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.700
 Pregnenolone?

01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:49.700
 Only trace amounts.

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:50.700
 A little bit.

01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:54.780
 Here's a good one.

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:59.940
 Are peanut allergies caused by the peanut products in vaccines?

01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:06.300
 Oh, I didn't know they were in the vaccines.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.940
 Yeah, we're starting to see some reports of it.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:12.700
 People who are analyzing these things.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:21.980
 The traces of proteins in various vaccines, especially egg proteins, you can find the

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:33.220
 lists of the known trace proteins in vaccines and the allergens that they can produce.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:41.660
 That's how you produce an allergic animal is to basically vaccinate it with traces of

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.660
 foreign proteins.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:46.820
 A couple more and then we'll let you go, Doc.

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:53.620
 What minerals are most important, writes John, for good tooth health?

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:59.780
 Where can we get these minerals?

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:13.900
 In animal studies, the water in the Rocky Mountains and Andes, for example, the water

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:23.700
 that happened to be high in fluoride and was thought to be good for preventing tooth decay,

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:35.660
 it turned out that the other trace minerals, molybdenum in particular, were contributing

01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:50.700
 to the resistance to decay, and calcium and the good balance of trace minerals turned

01:21:50.700 --> 01:22:01.020
 out to be the factor in the mountain water, not the fluoride.

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.020
 This is very, very long and complicated.

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:07.700
 I'm not going to do this right now.

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:26.460
 What is essential oils like doTERRA, are these good or bad for us?

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:34.220
 Some of them are good for reducing inflammation in the breathing.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:42.220
 For example, eucalyptus oil and menthol have been used to relieve chest congestion and

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.100
 coughing.

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:59.340
 Some of them have a very effective influence on behavior, for example, producing a mood

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:06.260
 change, but each one is very particular, like a drug.

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:10.540
 You can't say much about them as a category.

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:15.220
 Nancy is about 65, she says, I'm going to paraphrase because this is long, but bottom

01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:22.460
 line is, Doc, she's got some kind of eruption, kind of red, bumpy, and it scratches.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:29.900
 She says it's about three inches in diameter, and she wants to know what she can do about

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:30.900
 it.

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:36.940
 General, when things erupt like this, is it something that just wants to come out?

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:40.500
 No, it's an allergy.

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:53.220
 It's often something you ate, and you have to look at your balance, all of your nutrients,

01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:56.540
 exposure to chemicals and foods.

01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:02.420
 It really takes a detailed study to identify it.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.580
 But it should eventually go away, I guess, for her?

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:10.340
 Only if you correct the problem.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:14.620
 Anything you would put on it, you think, that could help it to dissipate?

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:22.380
 Well, checking your vitamin D balance is really one of the first things.

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:29.380
 Could you ask Dr. Peat about a woman, how does a woman know if she's at risk for osteoporosis

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:33.660
 and can sense maybe that her bones are improving without getting x-rays?

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:37.700
 What do you look at in that regard?

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:41.460
 Ultrasound of the bone is better than x-rays.

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:42.460
 Ultrasound of the bone?

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:45.100
 You can actually see how strong the bones are?

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:51.260
 Yeah, they can actually determine the strength rather than just the density.

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:54.220
 Okay, final one.

01:24:54.220 --> 01:25:04.540
 Is vitamin D, vitamin K2, and NKA better to use on a long-term basis than MK7?

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:10.940
 No, I don't think there's a big difference.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.820
 I use vitamin K1.

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:14.820
 K1.

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:15.820
 Uh-huh.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:20.140
 Well, Mr. Peat, here we are.

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.140
 It's November.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.260
 You going to be around over the holidays?

01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:24.500
 We'll have to look at our schedule.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.260
 Yeah, I think we're going to be here.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:28.500
 Yep, I'll be here.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:33.180
 We'll get in touch in case we need to move something around, but I think I'll be here

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.180
 too.

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.900
 Dr. Peat, thank you.

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:40.540
 If folks want to get their newsletter, it's raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com, right?

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.540
 Right.

 RayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:46.740
 It's a very affordable thing.

01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:52.220
 You can sign up for that little guy, and then it's raypeat.com is your website, right?

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:53.220
 Okay.

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:54.420
 Dr. Peat, thank you so much, sir.

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.780
 Take care of yourself, all right?

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.780
 Okay.

01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.780
 Thanks for coming on the show.

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.780
 I really appreciate it.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.780
 It means a lot to us.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:00.780
 Thank you.

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:01.780
 Thank you.

01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:02.780
 Bye-bye.

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:03.780
 Thanks for joining us.

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:04.780
 This is Dr. Peat, and this is Ray on RadioNetwork.com.

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:05.980
 That's so cool.

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:14.420
 We talked to people like one of our heroes, Colin and all that, are coming up with things.

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:19.780
 He was on this 30, 40 years ago.

01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:22.780
 Yep, baby.

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:26.660
 Well, I'm getting hungry.

01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:27.660
 I'm getting hungry here.

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:31.100
 Maybe I'll have a little orange juice first.

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.700
 So I'll see you tomorrow.

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:34.140
 We're going to be here at 10 o'clock.

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:36.220
 Have some fun, lots to talk about.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:42.180
 Don't forget Martin Armstrong here on Wednesday and Dr. Andrew Kaufman on Wednesday.

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:44.740
 So we've got a nice fun week for you.

01:26:44.740 --> 01:26:45.940
 So take care of yourself.

01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:48.660
 Thanks for your ongoing support.

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:51.480
 I don't get far away from these little silly computers.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:55.900
 If I can help you with anything, a question or a comment about products or anything that

01:26:55.900 --> 01:27:02.300
 we do here, email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.860
 We support ourselves by promoting products.

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:10.020
 Yours is talking about, you know, Zithrivo and all the different things, Asana and Sulfur

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.020
 and all of it.

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.740
 They're good products.

01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:18.580
 We appreciate your consideration when you want to spend some of your little dollars

01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.260
 on some things.

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:25.700
 If you go to our website, One Radio Network, we've got some very good companies, people

01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:28.180
 that we've known for a long time.

01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:31.300
 All of them, we use everything.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:37.620
 I'm drinking the aloe, you know, from the aloe people and the colostrum and Dr. Cowan's

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:40.580
 powders which are great.

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:43.940
 We just use these things and the Pearlsium of course.

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:49.940
 I'm always downing the Daniel Vitalis' products and this Arise guy from Shen Blossom.

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:54.780
 Oh, I didn't even mention the BioAge, BioSuperfoods.

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.980
 Didn't mention them today.

01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:02.420
 So we use all these things and we do pretty well for being a crazy person, Italian kids.

01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:09.780
 So thanks for your support and considering getting something through our website, OneRadioNetwork.com.

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:12.440
 So I'll see you tomorrow, 10 o'clock.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.440
 Take care of yourself.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.440
 Let me know if I can help with anything.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.440
 I love you.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.740
 Thank you and may the blessings be.

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:25.940
