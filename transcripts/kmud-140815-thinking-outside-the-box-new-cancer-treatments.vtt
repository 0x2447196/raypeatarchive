00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.220
 Well good evening and welcome to this

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.420
 month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 Andrew Murray. For those of you who

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.020
 perhaps have never listened to the shows

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020
 which run every third Friday of the month

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 from 7 to 8 p.m. we're both licensed

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.860
 medical herbalists. We trained and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.900
 graduated in England with a master's

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.700
 degree in herbal medicine and we run a

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 clinic in Garboville here in California

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.300
 that has a wide range of conditions and

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.700
 recommend herbal medicine and dietary

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.600
 advice. So you're listening to Ask Your

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.640
 Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.140
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.140
 at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.080
 with any questions either related or

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.320
 unrelated to this month's subject of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.860
 thinking outside the box and the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.120
 relevance of thinking outside the box is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.160
 novel and new approaches to cancer

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.460
 treatment. Definitely thinking outside

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.620
 the box rather than a deterministic

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.900
 viewpoint of killing cancer cells. So

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.000
 number here if you live in the area is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.960
 923 3911 or if you live outside the area

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.200
 toll free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD. So

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.500
 people that listen to the show tonight

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.400
 who either have or know people who have

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.420
 diagnosis of cancer could be very

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.920
 relevant to those people listening and

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.420
 I'd encourage you to call in with any

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.280
 questions that you might want to put to

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.560
 either myself or Dr. Peat about this

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.860
 month's show. So cancer then has

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.920
 traditionally been viewed as something

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.960
 to destroy and to this end the mainstream

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.460
 of treatment is either what's known as

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.340
 cytotoxic cell killing drugs which

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.300
 poison the body or this directed focused

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.340
 radiation which does no better. It's all

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.540
 sidle that is it kills the cells

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.280
 directly and with also the associated

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.740
 collateral damage and inflammation that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.040
 comes from the treatment either

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040
 widespread or localized. Now the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.680
 evolution of thinkers who challenge

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.180
 dogma has always hailed new

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.960
 breakthroughs in our understanding and

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.760
 novel approaches to cancer treatment are

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.100
 also making themselves known. The

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.020
 co-discoverer a Nobel Prize winner James

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.760
 Watson recently made some observations

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.440
 regarding cancer in its treatment and

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.740
 these have again been taken further and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.140
 are very much outside the box theory has

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.700
 emerged and Dr. Peat then he joins us in

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.980
 a moment here will be asking him for his

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.680
 his viewpoint on it because he's very

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.440
 much an outside the box thinker as most

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.120
 of you perhaps have tuned into him of

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.420
 recognized. Now most people are under the

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.960
 mistaken belief and myself included that

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.960
 antioxidants are always good for you in

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.560
 the diet the more the better. So but this

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.340
 is not true and sometimes these very

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.240
 antioxidants can fuel cancer metabolism.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.180
 So again let's have some lateral

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.080
 thinking here and get our heads around

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.880
 some of that I know it's going to be a

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.020
 little bit heavy for some people

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.420
 perhaps if they're not really science

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.380
 minded but Dr. Peat will hopefully

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.420
 outline the questions that I put to him

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.120
 so far as the physiology and the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.300
 chemistry of the what we call the radox

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.260
 system in the body the reduction

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.600
 oxidation processes that are so

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.400
 important and necessary for regular

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.140
 cell functioning to to occur and then

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.400
 once we elucidate the radox activity

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.000
 within the body we can also understand

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.340
 better some of the novel approaches to

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.520
 cancer treatment. So what is it what

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.520
 rather what it is that we thought we

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.680
 understood about cancer and

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.060
 antioxidants for example and in what

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.620
 context then does the latest

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.460
 understanding shed new light on the

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.000
 subject. So firstly Dr. Peat thanks so

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 much for joining us again. Hi Dr. Peat.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.500
 Hi I'm here. No problem okay so as always

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.000
 just to introduce yourself your

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.620
 professional academic background to give

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.040
 people who perhaps have never listened

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.680
 to you before an understanding of where

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.060
 your research merits are. Okay 1968 I

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.420
 had been studying more or less

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.920
 independently biology and a lot of

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.240
 related fields but 1968 I decided to go

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.840
 to graduate school for a PhD and

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.380
 graduated there in 1972 specializing in

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.380
 reproductive aging and oxidative changes

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.780
 and it was the oxidative metabolism

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.260
 that I saw changing with aging which was

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.300
 really against the grain already at that

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.160
 time I saw an increase of reductive

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.940
 activity with aging for example you can

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.200
 put a dye in young tissue and old tissue

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:01.480
 and reductive enzymes fueled by the

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.320
 energy producing system and the

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.620
 internal antioxidant system is part of

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.360
 it. The older tissue reduced the dye

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.320
 much more energetically looking like it

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.460
 was more alive for example you can test

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.300
 the vitality of any tissue by the

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.300
 intensity of staining of this

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.080
 tetrazoleum chemical and I found that an

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.940
 overdose of estrogen or deficiency of

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.380
 vitamin E or any serious injury such as

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.380
 x-rays will increase the ability of the

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.820
 tissue to stain this dye so aging and

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.820
 these various injuries all increased the

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.200
 reductive activity of the tissue which

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.460
 involves what are called the

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.040
 anti-oxidative enzyme defense systems

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.840
 and that was what got me interested in

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.780
 the fact that cancer is very rich in

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:22.220
 anti-oxidative defenses not only the

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.120
 enzymes with a lot of specific chemicals

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.520
 that will act as antioxidants at that

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.200
 time people were trying to identify the

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.000
 specific chemicals that cancers used to

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.440
 defend themselves against oxidative

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.340
 poisons the chemotherapy and and

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.740
 radiation oxidative damage but over the

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.240
 last 40 years it has developed that it

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.680
 isn't just a simple chemical that they

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.220
 produce defensively but the very basic

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.260
 life processes are shifted in that

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.200
 direction which increases the reductive

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.760
 or anti-oxidative staining of this

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.300
 tetrazoleum and dye just as an indicator

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.940
 that's easy to see. Okay so what caught

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.680
 my attention reading some of these

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.880
 articles recently was that there there's

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.780
 definitely a new new novel way of

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.980
 looking at cells I know you've mentioned

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.320
 this in the past prior to doing this

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.720
 show which is kind of more based on the

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.620
 new findings in the the extracellular

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.600
 matrix as they call it and the fluidity

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.700
 within which cells are mobile and

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.160
 constantly in motion I think it was

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.640
 always posited before that everything

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.640
 was fairly fixed and once some a cell

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.840
 had differentiated it couldn't do

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.420
 anything more its fate was sealed but

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.340
 actually the new start new theories and

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.520
 new studies are finding that there's

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.220
 much more of a kind of quantum quantum

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.920
 state going on where things are very

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.760
 fluid and cells very much communicate in

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.600
 two directions and are subject to and

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.000
 give instructions to other components

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.800
 in the body so in terms of in terms of

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.900
 what they call this extracellular matrix

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.480
 in which this in which the cells kind of

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.540
 reside what it what implications does

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.620
 this has for understanding an approach

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.840
 to cancer treatment for example. Well

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.980
 the the rigid doctrine of the organism

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:42.220
 that governs current cancer therapy it

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.920
 really was imposed on a more basic

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.660
 biological view with it started around

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.760
 1830 with Johannes Muller in Germany

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.540
 who described tumors as a problem of

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.940
 organization not of defective cells and

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.140
 that approach as it continued through

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.660
 embryology right through the 1930s and

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:17.220
 1940s in which people could dissociate

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.660
 an embryo or a primitive organism and

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.260
 show that the cells themselves could

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.860
 reconstruct the organism after they had

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:33.100
 been entirely separated so the the

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.940
 environment that they live in is

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.380
 constantly being constructed to meet

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.120
 their needs the cells have particular

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.380
 needs and they will change the

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.280
 environment to meet those needs if they

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.160
 have the energy and the resources. If

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.320
 for some reason a cell or an organ

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.440
 becomes idle it loses its sense of

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.000
 direction if there's no stimulation and

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.100
 no energy flowing through the system

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.240
 the cell doesn't have any particular

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.920
 occupation or knowledge of what it

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.680
 should be doing but ordinary cells

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.860
 everything else being ideal will if

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.400
 they see a defect in their environment

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.260
 they will reach out and correct the

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.300
 defect the extracellular matrix the

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.940
 main components are collagen for

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:47.620
 stiffness rigid linear molecules that

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.780
 surround each other and in between

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.480
 those stiff collagen molecules there

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.120
 are carbohydrate chains polysaccharides

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.360
 and some with with proteins attached

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.360
 with some just simple polysaccharides

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.440
 with amino groups on them that retain

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:18.000
 water and create an elastic or springy

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.240
 environment against the pure hard

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.140
 environment of the pure collagen system

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:30.720
 and cells prefer a certain rigidity of

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.360
 environment when you take an isolated

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.560
 cell and put it on a surface that

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.960
 varies in stiffness the cells will

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.160
 creep towards the stiffer firmer

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.340
 footing they don't like squishy things

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.940
 to sit on and if you inject broken down

00:13:54.940 --> 00:14:00.640
 collagen fibers into an organism or a

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.420
 developing embryo the cells will

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.420
 rearrange the disorganized

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.060
 collagen that you have given them

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.200
 they're sort of like bricklayers

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.600
 align it in the direction they want

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.500
 and tug on it and communicate partly

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.140
 just by the way they tug and the other

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.300
 cells sense the tugging and pull back

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.300
 and because they have an inherent

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.440
 knowledge of the structure in which

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.480
 they should be in yeah and they like a

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.280
 fairly solid but they can create more

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.920
 of the polysaccharide so that it holds

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.160
 more water and is open and able to

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.300
 diffuse things to feed them so it has

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.800
 to be just right and there are various

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.940
 specific proteins that they secrete to

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.080
 attach themselves to do that pulling

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:11.320
 and pushing but there are some proteins

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.680
 at the surface which happen to be

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.620
 chemically connected and interactive

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.800
 with the very structure of the cell all

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.900
 the way through in a very coherent

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:31.040
 unifying way of the sulfur and

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.200
 sulfhydryl system of the cell is what

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.680
 gives it much of its toughness and it

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.220
 has to be constantly broken down and

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.280
 reformed because the cell inside is

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.420
 constantly in motion. You're saying

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.060
 there's a constant connection of

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.160
 sulfhydryl from the outside of the cell

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.220
 to the center of the cell? Yeah and about

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.860
 40 years ago some experimenters found

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.840
 that if they blocked those surface

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.400
 sulfur groups the cell couldn't stick

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.700
 to its environment so the degree of

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.280
 reduction and oxidation of the surface

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:20.580
 sulfur groups is a very big part of how

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.620
 it sticks to its environment and gets

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.020
 where it has to be and helps to shape

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.720
 its environment and that degree of

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:35.860
 oxidation is governed by what has been

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.540
 called the antioxidant defense system.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.800
 Okay, all right. You're listening to

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.880
 Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMED Galbraith 91.1 FM

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.640
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.140
 people are invited to call in with any

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.340
 questions they may have regarding this

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.020
 month's subject of thinking outside the

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.820
 box for cancer therapy and Dr. Peat

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.820
 here in a bit here will get into the

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.060
 specifics of how reduction oxidation

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.760
 works in cells and how the new

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.100
 findings are showing that actually the

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.940
 concept of antioxidants are not

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.600
 necessarily positive and how perhaps we

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.840
 can influence that system to be more

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.140
 beneficial towards resolving cancers.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.580
 Also going to be bringing up a article,

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.780
 a very interesting article that everyone

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.820
 can go to the internet and take a look

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:27.180
 at written by Mina Bissell on the

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.520
 programs called TED Talks. Basically

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.560
 there's a 15-minute talk on the

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.660
 architecture and context the form and

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.360
 function of the organization of the cell

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.020
 and how cancers are viewed in a

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.300
 different light now and she has some

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.660
 pretty exciting pretty exciting results.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.040
 So Dr. Peat in terms of the we've

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.180
 mentioned very briefly the reduction

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:52.780
 and oxidation of cells or components of

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.220
 cells or molecules that are part of say

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.380
 electron transport chain or modifying

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.240
 chemicals. Can you can you want to

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.380
 describe this how this potential works

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.180
 in the matrix and how this can determine

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.620
 the outcome of disease and health? I

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.720
 guess from making the simplistic

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.220
 consumption of antioxidants for example

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.460
 a bad choice perhaps for cancer strategy.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.300
 If you look at the balance between

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.900
 oxidants and antioxidants or reductants

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.780
 in the cell many people think of it as a

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.380
 reducing environment or an

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.920
 antioxidative environment but when you

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.020
 look at specific components such as the

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.920
 the molecule that transfers electrons

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.220
 from glucose for example to the

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.460
 mitochondrion to be oxidized. NAD is the

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.300
 coenzyme and it becomes reduced to NADH

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.880
 which is the source of the antioxidant

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.980
 electrons and if you look at the healthy

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.220
 cell the ratio of the oxidized form is

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:14.680
 hundreds of times the reduced form is

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:24.960
 about 500 or more times the oxidized

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.960
 form is 500 times greater than the

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.840
 reduced form and so that that's the

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.280
 governing antioxidant. Is the oxidized

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:42.280
 form. A highly oxidized state and that is

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.520
 in balance with ascorbic acid and

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.320
 coenzyme Q10 and vitamin E and the

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.860
 sulfur system glutathione and

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.960
 glutathione disulfide. These are all

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.340
 energized by the electron from NADH

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.680
 which comes from glucose normally and so

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.840
 the cell normally is in this really

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.080
 highly oxidized state as determined by

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.580
 the ratio of NAD to NADH and if the

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.820
 cell is sick for example a cancer cell

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.960
 the ratio approaches one to one.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.460
 It's almost 50% in the reduced

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.700
 antioxidant state and if you injure a

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:45.240
 cell you turn on this signaling system

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.080
 that James Watson talked about as one of

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.680
 the problems that he says people are

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.880
 looking for some way to turn that off so

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.660
 you don't keep pushing the cell in the

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.300
 direction of too much reduction but in

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.600
 fact anything that irritates the cell is

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.760
 likely to turn on more of the reducing

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.840
 system and push it in that direction of

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.500
 stress or cancer with a higher ratio of

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.000
 NADH to NAD approaching one to one.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.040
 You're saying that you want it in a

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:23.540
 oxidized form you want the cell not to

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.880
 have access to antioxidant activity.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.480
 Yeah the healthy active cell has about

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.720
 500 times more oxidized NAD.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:41.740
 When the people who are selling their

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.480
 very powerful antioxidants a lot of the

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.540
 advertisements say it's many times more

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.480
 powerful than vitamin C or than vitamin E

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.280
 but what they're doing is testing the

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.760
 antioxidants in vitro in a test tube and

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.160
 they will attack and destroy the

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:12.340
 oxidizing fragments free radicals but it

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:17.380
 happens that just like the NAD, NADH

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:21.220
 couple which is highly oxidized the

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.220
 things in balance with that ascorbic

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.280
 acid and vitamin E for example inside

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.860
 the cell they become oxidized.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:36.360
 The dehydroascorbic acid is an oxidant

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.300
 and it's eight times more concentrated

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.900
 in the cell than outside.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.900
 It's relatively hydrophobic and it goes

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.940
 to the oily parts of the cell.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.540
 So that will itself break down an

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.180
 antioxidant from on the outside of the

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:57.220
 cell.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.120
 Irritating the cell and turning on the

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.860
 defensive antioxidant reductive systems

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.600
 and producing a lot of the fragments

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.140
 that reduce glutathione, one of the

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.180
 sulfur molecules that exchanges

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.880
 throughout the system.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.420
 When the cell is irritated that and

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.360
 the associated ascorbic acid which

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.520
 becomes reduced and the vitamin E which

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.860
 becomes reduced these will sop up the

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.000
 toxic fragments but the trouble is that

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 the system which normally should be

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 oxidized all the way through the

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.440
 ascorbic acid, the vitamin C, vitamin E

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.280
 coenzyme Q10 and so on.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.120
 The whole system gets stuck in an

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.320
 over reduced, over electrified or not

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.220
 enough oxidation going on to pull it

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.660
 back where it should be.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.960
 Since the 1930s people have seen that

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:14.140
 any cell which is dividing goes into

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.980
 this highly reduced state in which

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.880
 everything shifts to the sulfhydryl

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.340
 rather than the disulfide form.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.140
 Okay and this includes the cancer cells

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:25.980
 then?

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.140
 Yeah and normal cells go into this

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.020
 phase very quickly, divide and then

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.160
 return to their oxidized state and the

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.460
 vitamin E and vitamin C go back to

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.260
 becoming oxidants and keeping the

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.340
 system tightened up, helping to squeeze

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:51.340
 water out of the system and the balance

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:57.220
 where the membrane potential of a cell

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.020
 is normally around 100 millivolts

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.580
 difference when you measure it with an

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.920
 electrode stuck into it.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:11.460
 The redox difference is in a range of

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.200
 about 15 millivolts, a very small

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.240
 fraction of the energy which is

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.240
 available for induction.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.340
 If you measure the voltage between

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.040
 glucose and oxygen it's over a volt so

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.480
 it's about 100 times more than the

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.080
 difference of 15 millivolts which

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.020
 governs practically all of the reactions

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.060
 in the cell.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.860
 The enzymes which produce energy,

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:51.100
 synthesized protein which govern the

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.640
 economy of the cell, these are sensitive

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.640
 to being reduced or oxidized and so

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.180
 this 15 millivolt difference can shift

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.420
 the whole economy of the cell.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.220
 That's a pretty tight range within

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.120
 which normality exists.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.860
 When you measure the products such as

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.400
 pyruvic acid versus lactic acid,

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:21.700
 these are an excreted or easily

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.440
 extracted index of the oxidative or

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.740
 reductive state of the cell.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.240
 So when the cell is in trouble it turns

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.440
 pyruvic acid into lactic acid by

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.480
 reducing it.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.360
 So that's a reflection of the highly

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.060
 reduced antioxidant state when the cell

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.700
 is distressed and making lactic acid.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.560
 When oxygen is working properly it's

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.260
 not producing lactic acid,

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.840
 it's using, consuming the pyruvic acid,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.400
 turning it into carbon dioxide.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.180
 So the ratio between not only pyruvic

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.640
 acid and lactic acid but overall it

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.080
 would be between lactic acid versus

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.120
 carbon dioxide.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:12.680
 Carbon dioxide is an acid and so in a

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.220
 sense it's an oxidant.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.160
 It causes retraction of electrons.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.660
 Because the fundamental here is

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.560
 basically mopping up electrons.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560
 Yeah.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560
 Yeah.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.760
 So, okay, so let me ask you this.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.780
 The reactive oxygen species, okay,

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.780
 so a group of molecules governed

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:41.340
 electrically, the antioxidant system

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.120
 versus the reactive oxygen species

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.320
 system, in terms of inflammation and

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.620
 what free radicals, I think as I've

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.660
 understood free radical damage to be a

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.860
 result of free radical liberation that

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.960
 isn't mopped up by antioxidants, is it

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.560
 almost that free radicals are almost, I

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.640
 can almost think of free radicals now as

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.340
 being a little more beneficial than the

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.980
 antioxidants because they...

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.420
 That's Watson's interpretation but I

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.460
 think that's his 50 years as a

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.460
 reductionist when he comes out of the

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:29.000
 static mechanical view of genetics and

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.160
 looks at the metabolism of the cell, he

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:39.240
 tends to over concretize and the

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:45.040
 antioxidant system is doing good stuff

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.980
 defending against toxic free radicals

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:52.780
 but the oxidative normal functions

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.920
 involving ascorbic acid or dehydroascorbate

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.860
 and vitamin E and the sulfhydryl

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.920
 balancing system, those are able to

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.560
 control the system that he suggests the

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.000
 toxic free radicals would be doing.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.380
 So you can get both the good defensive

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:26.320
 process against free radicals and the

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.620
 limiting of the production of more free

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.140
 radicals without resorting to one of

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.280
 the toxic chemicals that he's suggesting.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.480
 Because you're advocating and I know

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.160
 you have not just further subject in

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.360
 hand but in general as a good health

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.160
 practice from advocating plenty of fruit

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.460
 consumption for example, you advocate

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.000
 vitamin C and vitamin E as very safe and

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.800
 gentle, relatively gentle in their

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.340
 antioxidant capacity to some of the

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.680
 products I know that have been mentioned.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.680
 You talk about the super antioxidants

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.480
 that are touted on the supplement market

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.740
 that people may have consumed or may

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.520
 have thought were a good thing but in

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.280
 general vitamin C and vitamin E are very

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.560
 safe and they do the work very

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.560
 effectively.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.220
 That's because they are electrically

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.020
 tuned to exactly a certain role or group

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.000
 of roles in the cell and if you put in

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:29.820
 dynamite instead of alcohol you can have

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.760
 the same overall energy expense but it

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.800
 isn't under control and some of the

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.000
 antioxidants that they're selling are

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.840
 more like dynamite, don't fit into the

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.840
 system and so they aren't helpful at all.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:50.840
 And when the good antioxidants are

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:55.880
 working properly the system can run as

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.320
 fast as it once practically oxidizing

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:05.160
 at full speed and there are examples of

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:10.660
 experiments in which as you add thyroid

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.400
 hormone or a chemical that uncouples the

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.480
 production of ATP from simply the

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.040
 burning of oxygen and fuel as you rev up

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.940
 the oxidizing process you get fewer and

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.040
 fewer free radical productions.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.240
 So, because you normally associate free

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.640
 radical production with that.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.320
 Yeah and so the good antioxidants are

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.820
 working with the mitochondria and the

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.760
 faster that system runs the fewer

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.660
 electrons get away to cause the

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.760
 dangerous free radicals.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.760
 So, this is a bit like the aerobic versus

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.200
 anaerobic glycolysis and its effects.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.100
 Yeah, when the cell gets out of control

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:07.980
 oxygen is no longer able to suck up the

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.180
 electrons and so the cell has to expel

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.780
 the electrons in the form of lactic acid

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.320
 and that's a survival mechanism but it

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.500
 happens that when you do that desperate

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.500
 production of lactic acid to draw off

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.100
 excess electrons it happens to raise the

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.840
 pH inside the cell and lower the pH

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.840
 outside the cell and I think it was the

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.280
 embryologist Holtfrater who demonstrated

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.760
 that if you put an embryo in a slightly

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.420
 acidified solution the cells simply

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:50.320
 leave the embryo and float off and do

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.720
 their own thing.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.660
 So, the cancer or the stress metabolism

00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:00.600
 acidifying outside the cell is tending

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.300
 to destroy the cell's connection to its

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.740
 environment and at the same time raising

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.680
 the pH inside the cell makes it swell up,

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:16.280
 water and shifts the self-hydro balance

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.020
 into the reduced state and tends to turn

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.460
 on constant cell diffusion.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.460
 Okay, well I guess before we get into the

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:30.000
 Danopoulos previous experiments and

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.240
 research with urea for the treatment of

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.880
 cancers including liver cancer, I know

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.300
 that from an oxidant versus antioxidant

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.480
 perspective that exercise in its own

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.780
 right then generates sufficient

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:47.720
 biological oxidants which could be

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.680
 perhaps used as a valid approach to

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.080
 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.520
 some cancers and I've seen that there is

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.560
 some research to support that they

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.500
 exercise especially for diabetes but in

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.060
 some instances for cardiovascular

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.460
 disease and cancer is actually fairly

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.460
 pertinent.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:08.840
 Exercise will cause cells to take up

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.140
 glucose in the absence of insulin and

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:19.280
 will make them operate effectively but

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.960
 just like the uncoupling protein or the

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.160
 increased thyroid, these are the cells

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:33.660
 equivalent of exercise so that when

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.160
 everything is working in an organized

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:41.400
 way the cells are exercising by simply

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.400
 burning oxygen and fuel and warming

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:50.840
 themselves up so exercise should keep

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.740
 everything active but when it doesn't

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.680
 the organism can defend itself and

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.160
 imitate exercise by running things at a

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160
 higher speed.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.460
 Okay, all right you're listening to

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.140
 Ask Your Ob Doctor on KMED Gallup 91.1 FM

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.940
 from now until the end of the show at

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.380
 8 o'clock callers are invited to call

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.820
 in with any questions they have

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.180
 hopefully surrounding tonight's subject

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.660
 of novel approaches to cancer so like I

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.120
 said at the beginning of the show we're

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.820
 hopefully going to get into a little bit

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.720
 later on about liver cancer and some of

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.920
 the work done by a pioneering doctor

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.800
 back in the 80s which is still relevant

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.160
 today concerning urea therapy.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.000
 The number if you live in the area is

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.480
 923 3911 or if you live outside the area

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.040
 there's an 800 number which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.780
 Okay so...

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.520
 Doc, can I just get in there quickly we

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.980
 got a call since the top of the hour

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.980
 someone called to say there are two

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:49.280
 loose friendly brown and white pitbulls

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.180
 running loose on Branscom Road between

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.220
 number 2015 and Laytonville and this

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.860
 phone call just came in so if those

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.460
 might be your dogs running loose on

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.220
 Branscom Road two brown and white

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:01.200
 pitbulls folks want you to know they're

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.600
 out running loose. Thanks.

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.400
 So Dr. Peat I looked earlier on at that

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:11.280
 15-minute, well it wasn't a podcast but

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.140
 it was a video basically the TED talks that

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.380
 Meena Bissel presented. It's a very

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.780
 interesting work that she was doing and

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.960
 quite amazing where she had shown

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.520
 that the context and the architecture

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:26.760
 of the cell was very much the governing

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.520
 force behind whether or not cancers

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.660
 were present and I know from your what

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.960
 you're mentioning earlier on about the

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.100
 extracellular matrix of the whole

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.800
 solution around the cell within the

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.140
 cells all very fluid the cytoskeleton

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.040
 this all starts from the outside and

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.400
 works its way in its constant and the

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.640
 energy that should be present within a

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.220
 healthy cell gives the potential to

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.480
 signal and allow changes to happen so

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.620
 that everything's ordered. Now what she

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.260
 was what she was bringing up was I think

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.100
 she was specializing in breast cancer

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.100
 and she'd showed that clip during the

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.240
 15-minute speech that she gave about the

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.640
 the duct cell one of the duct cells

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.640
 that secretes milk with a

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.240
 pre-cancerous stage and then the cancerous

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.720
 stage and then she basically proved that

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.420
 it could be the cancerous cell could get

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.320
 turned back to its normal state not by

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.720
 poisoning it or radiating it but by

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.620
 allowing the extracellular matrix in

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.960
 which it was growing to be normalized

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.500
 and I know this is an approach that

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.420
 you're positing now as a novel way of

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.660
 approaching a disease in general and

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.940
 not just cancers but other diseases so

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.740
 that it's more of a functional

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.480
 disorganization of the environment in

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.280
 which the cells operate that is the

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.640
 cause rather than the cells themselves

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.840
 becoming mutant or aberrant or just

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.740
 losing their program or whatever is

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.960
 popular vogue theory for health. The

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.920
 exercise idea is very relevant to a

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.120
 breast cancer you've probably heard the

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.000
 statistics that women who are constantly

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.160
 having babies and nursing through their

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.400
 whole fertile years have a very low

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.980
 risk of breast cancer and so what is

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.640
 working keeps working and the cells

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.480
 which are have a load and a job to do

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.980
 are keeping their extracellular matrix

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.660
 organized to support what they're

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.460
 doing. We do have a call in I want to

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.920
 get this call in very quickly but I do

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.320
 also want to ask you whether or not how

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.700
 much credence do you think the high

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.660
 exposure to progesterone during

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:53.240
 pregnancy has on the fact that they

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.100
 have very low incidence of breast cancer

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.900
 to do how much of that part do you

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.980
 think it plays? I think that's the main

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.080
 thing it erases for example looking at

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.940
 the connective tissue like like the

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.120
 tendons which are almost pure

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:15.620
 connective tissue if you expose a

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:19.460
 rabbit for example to estrogen the

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.760
 connective tissue such as the tendon

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:26.040
 becomes stiff and hardened and every

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.100
 time it becomes pregnant and the

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.080
 estrogen goes up you see a shift

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.840
 momentarily towards hardening but after

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.640
 each pregnancy it's less hardened than

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.020
 before and it's the progesterone which

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.680
 reverses those changes even in the

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.720
 connective tissue the extracellular

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.900
 matrix and it's also erasing the

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:58.100
 intracellular estrogen functions the

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:02.180
 synthesis of estrogen the failure to

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.300
 detoxify it and the tendency to bind it

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.880
 all of these are regulated by

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.680
 progesterone as an anti-estrogen. Good

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.980
 okay well let's get this caller then and

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:16.380
 see see where this callers questions

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.180
 going. Hi caller you're on the air and

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.760
 where you from? Hi Dr. Peat and Andrew

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.160
 you and I have spoken over computer

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.060
 stuff and my question is I was born with

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.960
 some interesting genetics and I've

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.360
 always wondered how it happened that I

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.500
 was born from two eggs and I have lots

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.880
 of things because of that both genders

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.940
 because of that and I I wondered how

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.780
 did that happen? Dr. Peat I think I

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.480
 think your well one moment caller I

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.960
 think your condition is chimerism isn't

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.960
 it? You are a chimera as far as I

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.400
 remember I don't know I think the caller

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.260
 might have hung up actually but Dr. Peat

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.960
 chimeras I think they're extremely rare

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.440
 in the population. You know the

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.080
 embryologists have made them and you can

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.040
 that's one of the early demonstrations

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:18.140
 that mutations aren't the cause of

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.040
 cancer somatic mutation theory was made

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.320
 defunct 40 years ago when someone took a

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.720
 cell from a tumor and stuck it in an

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.860
 early embryo the tumor came from I think

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:37.000
 it was a black hamster and they put it

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:44.900
 in the embryo from a white hamster both

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.300
 of its parents were white and the

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:53.480
 developing organism had four parents it

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.340
 was a mixture of white and black

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.180
 inheritance showing that what had been a

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.560
 cancer cell developed into an ordinary

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.660
 part of the organism and that's the sort

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:12.060
 of thing that on a more highly

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.440
 differentiated tissue that mean abyssal

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.740
 is demonstrating that it's the

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.180
 environment not the genes which make a

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.220
 cancer. So what do you do you have any do

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.720
 you have anything to say about chimeras

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.940
 in the human population and how how they

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.780
 how they come about or how how yeah how

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.320
 rare we know that rare. I think they're

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.960
 probably not as extremely rare as one

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.400
 would suppose because the the early

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.200
 embryos if they happen to get too close

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.900
 it's very easy for them to mix and form

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.080
 one one organism. Because people can have

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.880
 two two or more blood types their red

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.820
 blood cells can express the the markers

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.920
 for you know O positive and rhesus

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.160
 rhesus groups or B that could be B

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.760
 rhesus negative in the same person.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.800
 Yeah I found that quite fascinating.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:25.400
 Okay well let's let's move on then so

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.280
 oh look out I think there's another

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.940
 caller let's take this next caller

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.580
 before we move on. Hi caller you're on

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.380
 the air where you from? Yeah I can barely

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.580
 hear you for some reason. Can you hear me?

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.420
 Yeah yeah I can hear you fine but you

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:39.080
 know yeah I can hear you fine you're

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.560
 saying that you can't. Hello. Hello I can

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.260
 hear you but can't yeah I can hear you.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.600
 Oh well maybe that caller should call

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.200
 back in again if they've hung up yeah

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.840
 okay I think this is some part of what

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.240
 would hopefully get resolved. We did have

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.400
 another caller who really wanted to ask

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.300
 Dr. Peat something if I could use this

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.940
 opportunity. He wanted to know about low

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.480
 carb diets the fat-burning ketone diet

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.740
 and specifically he said it's helped him

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.240
 quite a bit he wants to know what Dr.

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.020
 Peat thought about that the ketone diet.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.580
 Yeah what do you think of that Dr. Peat?

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.720
 Um you don't produce the ketones unless

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:23.060
 you're raising your cortisol enough to

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.020
 activate the conversion of protein into

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:32.100
 the ketones to activate the conversion

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100
 of protein into glucose at the same time

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:41.060
 you're turning some of the fat into

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.800
 ketones. So it's a pretty stressful. Yeah

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.600
 and I think the problem occurs over a

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.040
 few years of exposure to that increased

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:59.220
 breakdown of protein. The cortisol is

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:02.620
 affecting your connective tissues and

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:07.920
 the Explorer I don't remember his name

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.120
 at the moment but Arctic Explorer who

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.500
 advocated the meat diet he noticed that

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:21.400
 the Eskimos were very prematurely aged in

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.340
 appearance their skin became very

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:28.780
 wrinkled and I think that's what you

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.420
 would expect from being exposed to very

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.560
 high cortisol constantly. So the

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.480
 ketone diet is a pretty stressful way to

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:40.320
 do anything like lose weight and losing

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.060
 weight in general is not a very good

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.960
 idea unless it's done slowly especially

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.600
 in people that have lots of stored

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.820
 polyunsaturates in their fat makeup

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.040
 which is most people unless they're

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.900
 really watching what they eat and

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.760
 avoiding polyunsaturates and making sure

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.340
 they consume lots of saturated fats.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.040
 Actually it's a very I want to make a

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.800
 very quick point here I was back in

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.940
 England three weeks ago for a couple of

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.780
 weeks and on my way out of the airport I

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.340
 grabbed a couple of periodicals to read

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.720
 while I was on the plane. I got a new

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.120
 scientific and I got the Daily

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.660
 Telegraph and on the cover of the new

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.080
 scientist it had a picture of a frying

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.420
 pan and the word FACT the C was a piece

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.800
 of carbonized bacon and the F and the A

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.900
 and the T of the word FACT was still

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.160
 intact and it's a what you saw was fat

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:30.800
 with a carbonized piece of bacon forming

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.280
 the C but it's blackened against the

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.880
 black background of the frying pan and

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:36.640
 it said have we really got 40 years of

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.080
 dietary advice wrong and it was actually

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.880
 a good breath of fresh air another one

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.540
 of the breaths that hopefully wake

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.920
 people up enough when they get enough

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.960
 these fresh breaths coming in that to

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.220
 say that they were very much behind

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.800
 especially dairy saturated fat and that

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.560
 all saturated fat in general was very

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.000
 good for you and that the polyunsaturates

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.200
 and the margarines and the fish oils

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.280
 actually being shown now to turn be

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.780
 turned on their head and they were

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.180
 actually saying yep we think we've got

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.440
 40 years of dietary advice wrong so

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.740
 that was good to see and then the other

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.680
 sad point I did see in the Daily

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.480
 Telegraph was that in England they're

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.320
 now running GM crops and I when I left

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.960
 England in 2001 they were actually

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.800
 Europe was all GMO free so now in

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.560
 England they're actually making a GMO

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.660
 crop to express omega-3 oils so that

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.200
 they can feed this crop to GM salmon

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.340
 that are grown in the environment that

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:35.040
 doesn't allow them to pick up the

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.540
 polyunsaturate from the algae and the

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.200
 microorganisms that they eat so they're

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.680
 now going to feed them a GM crop

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.180
 expressing omega-3s I couldn't believe

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.280
 it so not too sure what's happening

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.640
 folks but I know California is still on

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.520
 the cutting edge I think of trying to

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.160
 see sideways here with our food and

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.420
 environment and everything else that's

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.560
 going on so hopefully between the West

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.900
 Coast and the East Coast of the States

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.800
 we can keep this kind of thing going and

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.500
 alive. So anyway Dr. Peat I wanted to bring

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.800
 up Dr. Danopoulos' work with

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.540
 urea therapy from the 80s I know I had a

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:12.640
 caller some time ago that I got

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.380
 personally who was looking for some

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.240
 help and information regarding liver

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.740
 cancer and I know Danopoulos had done

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.220
 quite a bit of work in 1980 publishing

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:26.180
 clinical oncology about an 11-year

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:28.620
 experience using oral urea treatment in

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.460
 liver malignancies. How much, how

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.460
 familiar are you with urea as a

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.960
 compound for the treatment of

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.200
 carcinomas or other cancers? In the

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.400
 First World War it was used as an

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.940
 emergency treatment to stimulate healing

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:51.540
 in wounds and hold down infections and

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.880
 around the time 1920s I think it was

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:59.080
 often used for inoperable cancer to

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:03.860
 pack it with urea to it actually was

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.000
 not only keeping down infection but I

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:11.360
 think it was actually having a healing

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.940
 influence and the effect of forming

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.740
 lactic acid that I mentioned which

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:22.640
 causes the pH of the cell to become

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:27.120
 more alkaline inside that causes

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.120
 swelling and swelling promotes

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:35.620
 replication proliferation and simply an

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:40.260
 osmotic environment which could be very

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:44.800
 concentrated sodium chloride or urea

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.060
 happens to be a very innocuous

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:51.580
 substance it doesn't exactly have an

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.880
 osmotic effect like sodium chloride

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.680
 because the sodium is kept out of the

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.020
 cell but the urea acts somewhat

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:09.260
 like an osmotic dehydrator it helps to

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:12.220
 prevent excess swelling and water

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.100
 retention. You think that is one of its

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.760
 main effects and that's how it's keeping

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:18.060
 swelling down? I think so.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:25.400
 Okay. And the dehydrated cell becomes

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.140
 more oxidatively active and catabolic

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.780
 burning fuel faster where the swollen

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:36.520
 cell is anabolic and simply growing and

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:41.960
 dividing so many things can help to

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.800
 reduce that water retention. I think

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:51.800
 urea would work well with a good thyroid

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.700
 program which helps you to retain the

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.240
 normal amount of sodium chloride.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:03.880
 Hypothyroid people not only produce the

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:09.220
 matrix which is over hydrated it shifts

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.720
 the cells so that they produce molecules

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:17.320
 that hold water outside of cells but the

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.600
 low thyroid function lets your kidneys

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:27.000
 lose sodium while retaining water and so

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:29.680
 any of the osmotic therapies such as

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.120
 urea I think would work nicely with

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:37.380
 supplementing thyroid to normalize the

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.180
 sodium retention.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.080
 Good. I think we have a couple of callers

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.560
 on the air so I should start by taking

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.620
 one of these first caller. You're on the

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:47.720
 air caller, where are you from?

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.600
 This is David Back, the caller we had

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.900
 earlier who's having trouble.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.460
 Okay. Hey David, go ahead.

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:55.060
 Hello.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.460
 Hi.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.040
 Hello.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:51:59.840
 Hello.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.940
 Look out. Engineering, what's going on?

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.000
 I don't understand, he can hear me when I

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.440
 talk to him, we can hear him.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.740
 Can you hear me now?

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:11.940
 I can hear you.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.020
 We can hear you fine David.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:18.060
 Okay. So I guess I can hear you now.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:18.880
 Hopefully.

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.960
 Are we okay?

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.120
 Can you hear me David or not?

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.120
 Okay, sorry about that.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.320
 He can't hear me so you're going to have

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.160
 to say this I think.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.060
 Dr. Peat?

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:29.500
 Yes.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.500
 Yes, I have, you know, and this is I guess a

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.640
 little off topic but in a way it's not.

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.200
 When you're describing these processes, I

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:43.080
 mean you do it so beautifully and it

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.640
 seems very complicated but are you

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.040
 actually seeing images?

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.880
 Like do you actually see these processes?

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.660
 And I know of course a lot of this probably

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:56.080
 has not been photographed through

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:59.220
 microscopic techniques and different things.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:02.760
 So are you just in a way integrating all this

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.400
 information and seeing things?

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.860
 I see little models.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.200
 Not that I've seen anything exactly like it

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:16.900
 but I have mental models for example of the

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.540
 extension of the sulfhydryl groups under

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:21.880
 the surface of a cell.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:25.380
 I have very concrete pictures of how that

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.060
 works and so it helps me when I'm looking for

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.960
 information to check against the published

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.160
 research facts to have a concrete mental image.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.900
 And the reason I'm asking that question is you

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.260
 were explaining like the collagen lining up and

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.580
 a lot of times when I'm reading your work I find

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.780
 myself trying to imagine these things and then

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.280
 I'm thinking that's got to be an important part

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:56.440
 of your process in trying to imagine since

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.680
 you're a painter visual images of how this

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.460
 actually might look.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.460
 Is that true?

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.460
 Oh sure.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.460
 Yeah.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.620
 I've always been aware of having a map of

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.920
 where I'm going and I was surprised in

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.940
 graduate school when a psychology professor was

00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.600
 surprised at my description and I asked him

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.240
 how he found his way from his home to his

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.240
 office and he said go out the front door, turn

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.520
 left, turn left again, turn right.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.820
 It was all a set of rules and I think some

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.980
 professorial types actually think in terms

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:39.460
 of words and rules.

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.500
 Yeah, definitely.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.560
 You know and the other thing I thought about

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.600
 in line with you know like almost visualization

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.260
 of how this works is you know through the years

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.740
 I've heard of different healers and people that

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:57.800
 you know are more new agey kind of things where

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.180
 they try to get people to imagine certain things

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.880
 and then try to heal it but then I started

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.180
 thinking if you were really seeing this like

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:10.580
 you're seeing it you really could in a way be

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.880
 a part of the healing process in that you're

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.980
 seeing what's wrong and you're seeing what you

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.360
 need to do to fix it.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:21.060
 Yeah, we were talking about the different

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.560
 theories of what a cancer is.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:28.240
 The new theory it's called TOFT, tissue

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:32.640
 organization field theory and I think that

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.980
 needs another adjective, organismic.

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.180
 It isn't just the local tissue organization

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.660
 but it's also the way that tissue fits into

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.620
 the whole organism and how the activity of the

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:56.000
 organism keeps everything working, loading all

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.460
 of its parts so that they know what they're doing.

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:03.040
 It's very much the, and I don't want to make a

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.980
 quip here, but it's very much the holistic way

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.080
 of looking at it and that's what I found was

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.640
 so interesting with even though it may not have

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.740
 been totally accurate, Dr. Watson's comments

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.580
 that we made earlier and also this kind of novel

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.580
 approach to cancer treatment through the

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:21.620
 looking at the extracellular matrix as

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.860
 very much a holistic environment upon which

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.820
 every cell is in communication with every

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.020
 other cell.

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:29.760
 Stem cells are arising all the time and actually

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.200
 nothing is fixed.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.360
 Everything is very fluid and dynamic and very

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:39.600
 much able to change very quickly.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.100
 Individual cells, for example, pigment cells,

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:47.480
 you can sometimes see them migrating through the

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.320
 tissue and they move at the same rate that cells

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.080
 have been found to be able to crawl on a glass

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:59.520
 slide and that at body temperature that can be

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:04.700
 something like a centimeter and a half per day.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:08.900
 A very tiny cell really zips along through the

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.860
 solid tissue.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.200
 Far out.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.540
 >> Thank you.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.040
 >> I think we better wrap up.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.580
 There are two callers on the air but we are not

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:22.040
 going to be able to take them unfortunately.

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.220
 It is three minutes to the top of the hour.

00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:27.880
 Once again, we have run out of time.

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.060
 Let me let people know how to find out more

00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:32.660
 about you, Dr.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:33.820
 Peat.

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.560
 Thank you for joining.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.400
 >> Thank you.

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:39.360
 >> Once again, unfortunately, sorry for

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.700
 those callers who perhaps wanted to ask

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:42.740
 something.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:44.940
 I want to thank Dr.

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.240
 Peat for his work.

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:49.300
 His articles are available and freely

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.180
 shared on the Internet.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:52.940
 His website is www.rayPeat.com.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.280
 Most of his, well, all of his articles, not

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.920
 most, but all of his articles are referenced.

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:02.020
 So it is not just his opinion, what he has

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.920
 read, what he thinks.

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.520
 There is lots of references to the work

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:08.620
 that has been done, pioneering work by

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.360
 people that unfortunately we don't hear

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.000
 often enough that don't make the

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.120
 mainstream.

00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.100
 But there are times when people like

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.160
 Mina Bissell

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.460
 and all the other people that Dr.

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.360
 Peat just brings to the show

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.040
 in terms of the pioneers

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.800
 that have done the work

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.480
 that we are talking about

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.000
 very much make the contributions

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 that are thinking outside

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.480
 the box.

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.920
 It is that thinking outside the box

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.820
 that really fundamentally changes

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:33.540
 everything

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:36.180
 from what we do to what we eat.

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.760
 The whole quantum mechanics thing

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.160
 is also another very exciting

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.560
 field that is making

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.520
 the seemingly impossible

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.320
 possible.

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.200
 So, yeah, go take a look

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.560
 at his website.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.400
 There are lots of articles

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.360
 ranging from diabetes

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.500
 to saturated fats

00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.200
 versus polyunsaturated,

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:50.900
 cancer,

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:51.460
 dementia,

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.040
 inflammation,

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:52.660
 thyroid.

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.500
 His specialties

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:54.200
 are hormones,

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:54.740
 reproductive

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:55.300
 hormones,

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.200
 and ageing hormones.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.340
 So very interesting

00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.240
 work.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.140
 Lots of it is very scientific

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.240
 but it is also very readable.

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:04.280
 And he has a lot of

00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.480
 articles that are very

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:06.180
 interesting.

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.720
 He has a lot of

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.100
 articles that are very

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:09.640
 interesting.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.640
 It is also very readable.

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.300
 For those of you who have joined us

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.040

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:16.880
