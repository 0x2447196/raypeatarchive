 Need one more reason why your Safeway store is just better?

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.100
 How about free Cuisinart Classic Cutlery or Elite Flatware?

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.700
 That's right! For every $10 you spend, earn a free stamp saver you can redeem for Cuisinart items.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.800
 Once you've collected between 30 and 60 stamps, you can start shopping for a variety of Cuisinart cutlery or flatware,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.700
 available at the in-store display.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.000
 Present your items and stamp saver at checkout.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 It's simple. Spend $10, get your free stamp saver, start collecting.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
 Safeway. It's just better.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.800

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 You're listening to Holistic Living, brought to you by EastWest Healing and Performance.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 And now, here are your hosts, Josh and Ginny Rubin.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 [Music]

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.800
 What up everyone? This is Josh Rubin and Ginny Rubin of Holistic Living.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 We're here today to share our radio show with Dr. Raymond Peat,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.800
 and we'll get to him in a little bit once Ginny calls in and clicks him in.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.800
 Today's show is on serotonin and endotoxin distress, and of course, like I've always said,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 Ray Peat is going to school us on these topics.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 But of course, before we get started, we just want to give you a little bit of update what we've been up to.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 Of course, we do our radio show every month.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 I can't really tell you when our next radio show is, because every month we kind of set up a date that works for Ray.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 But definitely stay tuned to our Facebook page, Josh Rubin or Ginny Rubin.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 You can stay tuned to our YouTube or email us directly at info@eastwesthealing.com to find out when the next radio show is.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 It'll be sometime next month, so topic and date and time yet to be determined.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 Other than that, business is growing. Everything is going well, of course.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 We have clients all over the world that we work with.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 So if you've got questions or concerns, call us at your free consultation, 760-597-9727.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 We consult with people via phone or Skype.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 And stay tuned to our website. We've actually invested a lot of money in our website.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 We're redoing our entire website.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 We're working with a great company in San Diego called Chimera Studios, Carl and his wife.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
 And their work is fabulous.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.800
 And our website is probably going to be launched, I'd say, easily within the next month, easily.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 So it's got a lot of new, just flair to it look content.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.800
 It's going to have a little store.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 Other than that, things are going well.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 And also just stay tuned to our Facebook, YouTube page, and our Blog Talk radio show,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800
 because in the next month or so, we're going to be talking about something pretty awesome.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.800
 And I don't want to say anything yet, what it is, what it's going to be about,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800
 but we're pretty excited for it.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.800
 And it's going to allow us to really share what we've learned, developed, and studied

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 over the past 5, 10, 15 years doing this work and sharing it with people.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 So definitely stay tuned to what we're going to be launching.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 As I always say, I know a lot of people from following Facebook and from working with new clients

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.800
 and getting emails from people every day that a lot of people are contacting Ray.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.800
 And Ray is a very humble guy, very quiet guy based on my perception.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 He doesn't really ask a lot.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.800
 And just keep in mind that he's been doing this a long time.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.800
 He likes to answer questions via email, not phone.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.800
 And he really, from my experience, never says no, nor does he ever ask for money.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.800
 So like I said, please, if you could, look up his address on his website, RayP.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.800
 Please, if you're emailing him all the time and he's answering your questions and he's helping you,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.800
 please send him something, a check, whether it's $1, $5, $10, $100,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 whatever you can to compensate him for his time.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.800
 That's all we really ask because I know a lot of people are emailing him.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.800
 And if it wasn't for his research, you wouldn't have this information.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.800
 So you're just helping to facilitate his research.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.800
 So that's it. Let's get Jeannie and Ray on the line because I'm sure you're sick of hearing me talk.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.800
 Hold on one second.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 Actually, no, before I get him on, I just want to introduce him because it's much easier without him on here.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 Of course, I've introduced him many, many times, who he is, what he does.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 If you want to learn more about him, all you can say is go to his website, RayP.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 He's got tons of articles on his website. He's got books and newsletter.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 And all I can say is his articles are very in-depth and they're free.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 And what else could you ask for? And you can learn a ton from them.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 Also, check out his books.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 And you can check out some of the other people that he's referenced in the past,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 like Broda Barnes, and I don't know if I'm pronouncing her name right, Mary Shimon.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 There's many other people. So look those people up as well because they kind of align with Ray Peat's philosophy,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 like Dr. Shanklin and Dr. Brewer, Tom Brewer, and people like that.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 So if you want to learn more about Ray and where he comes from, definitely check out his website.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 He's a teacher, educator, researcher.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.800
 And today he's going to school us on serotonin and endotoxin. So let me get him on.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800
 Hello.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.800
 Jeannie, you guys there?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.800
 Yes, we're here.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 Hello.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 All righty. How are you doing, Ray?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800
 Very good.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.800
 Good. How are you doing, Jeannie?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 I'm doing a great job, thanks.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 Great.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:55.800
 So before we start, Ray, did you want to say anything, announce anything, anything to your intro

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.800
 before we start talking about serotonin and endotoxin?

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 Not really. I've just been finishing another newsletter that includes stuff on serotonin.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 Great.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.800
 And it's on osteoporosis, and serotonin turns out to be a major factor in causing that

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.800
 and other aging degenerative changes.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.800
 Maybe we can talk a little bit about that today without giving all the information away.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.800
 Now, are you still taking sign-ups for your newsletter?

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800
 Oh, sure. Yep.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 Okay. So people can go to your website at rayp.com and sign up for that newsletter.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.800
 Guys, it's super inexpensive, and it's a wealth of information.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.800
 So I highly recommend signing up for it as well as grabbing his books if you can get your hands on them.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 So today I've gotten a lot of requests to talk about serotonin.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.800
 A lot of people don't know what endotoxin is.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.800
 You talk about it a lot, and you correlate it with serotonin in the gut and all these things.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.800
 So I thought it would be great to group it in there.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 But a lot of people don't understand serotonin, what it is, you know, is it a hormone, is it a --

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.800
 look, what is it, where does it come from, is it internal, external?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 So I thought it would be great to do a show so you can kind of educate us on all these different factors,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
 as well as supplementation.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.800
 I think that's the most common question people have in regards to serotonin.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.800
 So I guess our first question is -- you know, we have a lot of questions,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.800
 and I have a lot of questions from listeners as well.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.800
 You know, you have specific focuses on your research.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 Why so much focus on serotonin?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:53.800
 You can't understand the other things that I'm working on unless you know where serotonin fits in.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:02.800
 For example, estrogen and progesterone, estrogen does a lot of its work by way of serotonin.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:15.800
 And to understand unsaturated fatty acids versus saturated, you have to understand estrogen and serotonin.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.800
 And to understand thyroid, you have to understand all of those.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:34.800
 And so it's one of the emergency defense systems so that anything involving stress or compensating for stress,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:42.800
 you can't begin to understand it without seeing where serotonin fits in.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:50.800
 Hans Selye was one of the early researchers on the biological effects of serotonin.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.800
 That was one of the first places I started running across it.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:07.800
 Aldous Huxley was another person that got me interested in its variety of effects.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.800
 So when we talk about serotonin, you know, most of the Western research, allopathic research,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:21.800
 and, you know, most of what people, when they refer to serotonin, they talk about a brain chemical.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.800
 Where do you find, sorry, most of the serotonin in the body?

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.800
 You know, where is it produced and what is its main function?

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:44.800
 It's 95% of it roughly is produced in the intestine and the biggest concentration in the digestive system is in or around the appendix.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 And part of how I got interested in the whole pattern of thyroid, estrogen, serotonin, and so on,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:04.800
 was that when I was about nine years old, I started becoming nearsighted and I occasionally had migraine headaches.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:13.800
 And I noticed that things that I ate would tend to bring on the headaches.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 And there were a couple of girls in my school class who were also nearsighted

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.800
 and I learned that one of them had migraine headaches.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:36.800
 And so I started looking at nearsighted people and over the next few years I saw that nearsightedness was much more common among girls,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.800
 especially starting around puberty.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.800
 And several of the nearsighted girls that I knew had migraines.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:52.800
 And so I started thinking about what I had in common with girls in puberty.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.800
 It was the thyroid question.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:05.800
 Estrogen and serotonin happen to be antithyroid factors.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:19.800
 And so if you're on the borderline for thyroid function, then you're very susceptible to excesses and imbalances in estrogen and serotonin.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.800
 The research was just barely starting.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:31.800
 I got interested in the symptoms before the substance was identified.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:48.800
 The ergot, a fungal disease of grains, was used for probably thousands of years to induce abortions.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:59.800
 And in the 19th century, attempts were made to use it to accelerate labor.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:07.800
 But it was fairly dangerous and would sometimes kill both of them up.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.800
 It causes spasms not only in the uterus but in blood vessels.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:26.800
 And when people were poisoned by this ergot fungus, they would develop gangrene and insanity, nausea, vomiting,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.800
 just about every unpleasant symptom you could think of.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:41.800
 In the early 1900s, people were starting to study the chemistry of the ergot fungus.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:49.800
 And histamine was the first thing they identified that caused muscular spasms

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:58.800
 and would accelerate either miscarriage or abortion or normal delivery.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:10.800
 And for about 20 years, histamine was of considerable interest and led to the development of antihistamines.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:23.800
 But in the 1920s and '30s, continuing study of ergot turned up another, well, several,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:33.800
 a dozen different categories of amines that several of them would cause muscle spasms the same way histamine does.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:43.800
 And studying ergot was what Hoffman at Sandoz was working on when he accidentally discovered

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 the nervous properties of LSD.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:14:00.800
 And that led to a whole further development of chemicals for treating problems with the uterus

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.800
 and circulatory problems and hormonal problems.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:12.800
 But at first, the connection with bodily functions wasn't understood.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:23.800
 An Italian in the '30s had identified an amine in the intestine that caused intestinal contractions.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:35.800
 And about 10 years later, some English studying huge amounts of beef blood found another amine, they thought,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.800
 that caused blood vessel contraction.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:48.800
 And then the Italian showed that that was the same thing he had found much more abundantly in the intestine,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.800
 thousands of times more concentrated.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:06.800
 And the English group wanted to learn how to assay it because they were thinking about it as the cause of hypertension,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.800
 strokes, blood clotting, and so on.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:21.800
 So they gave it to someone to try to identify a sensitive assay to measure the amount in a person

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.800
 rather than having to extract it from tons of cow blood.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:40.800
 And the person that they gave it to try to develop an assay happened to have experienced Sandoz's LSD

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 and knew about its mental effects.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:57.800
 And he was working on the assay, finding that the serotonin extracted from the blood would cause uterine contractions,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.800
 blood vessel contractions, all smooth muscles.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:14.800
 And since he knew the chemistry, it was an amine parallel to some of the things in ergot,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:27.800
 he wondered if the effect of LSD was by having the same antagonistic effects that he saw the LSD had on the serotonin.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:39.800
 LSD would block the serotonin-induced contraction of the uterus or of the blood vessel or of the intestine.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.800
 Serotonin would block the kidney function so no urine was produced.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.800
 LSD would restore kidney function.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:57.800
 So since he saw straight across antagonism between LSD and serotonin,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.800
 he proposed that the brain contains a small amount of serotonin

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:13.800
 and that LSD is having its effects by antagonizing this small amount of serotonin in the brain.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:22.800
 So we should all take a little dose of LSD every day to be anti-inflammatory and down-regulate serotonin.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:33.800
 Yeah, there's a new interest in LSD as a protective chemical.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:43.800
 They're finding that it prevents nerve damage caused by some of the serotonergic excitotoxic chemicals.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:51.800
 And they're even proposing it as an anti-psychotic treatment given in the right doses.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.800
 Interesting.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 Well, maybe by the time I get to a nursing home, they'll have that figured out.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.800
 Go ahead.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:12.800
 The disease called carcinoid was just being understood at the same time in the 1950s.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.800
 And this turned out to be the result of a tumor in the intestine,

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:26.800
 especially in the appendix, producing huge amounts of serotonin.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:34.800
 And normally the lungs destroy the serotonin as it's picked up in the bloodstream.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:43.800
 And en route to the lungs, that means that the blood rich in serotonin

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.800
 passes through the right side of the heart before it's detoxified.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:56.800
 And these people were found to have disease of the right side of the heart,

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:04.800
 the valves in the right side of the heart, and they would develop pulmonary artery hypertension.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:13.800
 And several of the problems associated with the carcinoid disease

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:23.800
 included psychosis and a belligerent, aggressive attitude and diarrhea, nausea,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:32.800
 and lots of other symptoms of clotting, fibrosis, overdevelopment of collagen systems.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:44.800
 And that was well established as the effect of overproduction of serotonin.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:52.800
 So everyone at that time was thinking about the great possibilities of antagonists to serotonin.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:20:02.800
 And by 1960, people were already proposing LSD to cure or prevent migraine headaches

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.800
 and a variety of other things associated with excess serotonin.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:18.800
 But then strange things happened all through medical research.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.800
 The government came out banning research on LSD.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:37.800
 And someone developed the idea that since LSD was an antagonist of serotonin,

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:45.800
 and the reason for banning LSD was supposedly it made people insane.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:56.800
 Therefore, the great publicity was that if LSD, by antagonizing serotonin, makes you insane,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.800
 then serotonin must make you sane.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:07.800
 That really just spread like a plague through the national culture.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:17.800
 And that seems to be about the extent of the reasoning behind all of the stuff that you now find

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:26.800
 everywhere in the Internet, television, newspapers, and so on, that serotonin is the happy drug.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.800
 Right.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:37.800
 Now, why is it found mostly in the appendix? Isn't there a lot of it in the small intestine as well?

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.800
 Yeah, there's a gradient, though, increasing as you go down the small intestine.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:53.800
 And normally the upper part, starting at your stomach, almost everyone has a sterile upper small intestine.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:59.800
 And as you go down, the likelihood of having bacteria increases.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:07.800
 And as a person's thyroid function decreases, their intestinal secretions are reduced,

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:13.800
 peristalsis is reduced, bacteria tend to creep farther and farther.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:20.800
 A really healthy person has an almost sterile, whole, small intestine.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:29.800
 And the sicker you are, the lower your thyroid function, the more bacteria live in your small intestine.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:39.800
 And that means that foods that are slower to digest are going to feed bacteria

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:45.800
 and encourage them to live more abundantly higher up in your intestine.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:55.800
 But ordinarily, the gradient of bacteria is very concentrated towards the appendix,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.800
 lower end of the small intestine.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:08.800
 And it happens that the gradient of bacterial infection increases parallel to the gradient of serotonin.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:21.800
 And it's probably that the toxins from the bacteria interacting with the physiology of the person

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:31.800
 are stimulating the production of serotonin, because the function of serotonin is to cause contraction of the intestinal muscles,

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:39.800
 get rid of what is in there, cause diarrhea, and get rid of the irritant.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:46.800
 And so if you keep feeding the bacteria and coaxing them to live farther up your intestine,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:56.800
 you can produce serotonin more abundantly and farther up your intestine.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:01.800
 So it's when you're telling them to go farther.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:10.800
 The things that encourage bacterial growth are the ones that are slowest to be broken down by your own enzymes.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:23.800
 And since we don't have enzymes for fibers such as pectin or for the lignins and various complex fibers,

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.800
 the bacteria live on those.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:41.800
 And the things that we can digest very quickly, sugars and proteins and fats, are pretty quickly absorbed.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:49.800
 These get absorbed high up in the small intestine, and the bacteria don't get a chance at it

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:57.800
 because we're absorbing it faster than they can grow.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.800
 So for the listeners, can you just identify some of those foods that you're talking about,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.800
 the pectins and lignins that are not digestible or harder to digest?

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:19.800
 Oh, lots of vegetables. The less cooked a vegetable is, the better food it is for bacteria.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:29.800
 And even the firm fruits, the ones that have a lot of fibrous material, such as pectin.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:40.800
 Crisp apples, crisp pears are very good bacterial food, very poor human food.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.800
 Pineapple too?

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:55.800
 Yeah. The cellulose itself, the more pure the cellulose is, the less bacteria are able to break it down.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:08.800
 So some cellulose is safe, and then there are the cellulose fibers that are combined with antiseptic chemicals,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.800
 like the root vegetables.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:22.800
 Carrots, they have defenses that kill mold and things that would rot the carrot plant.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:34.800
 And so raw carrots have their germicidal defense that help to kill off the bacterial population where it shouldn't be.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:42.800
 So you talked about how where it's produced and what it does helps the prostatitis, the protective mechanism,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.800
 but could something as simple as just having a blood sugar handling issue,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.800
 maybe having the wrong ratios of foods, of course eating the wrong types of foods we just talked about,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:27:04.800
 actually do that stress reaction stimulate serotonin, or does it go the other way around?

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:14.800
 When you're having an acute blood sugar decrease, you put out a lot of adrenaline and sympathetic nerve activity

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.800
 that cuts the circulation for the fight or flight reaction. You stop your digestive processes,

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:32.800
 don't deliver very much blood to the intestine so that your intestine is anemic during these emotional stress periods from adrenaline.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:46.800
 And that can give the bacteria a head start because you stop digesting and the food sits there letting the bacteria have a chance at it.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:28:01.800
 And then any kind of irritation will trigger the serotonin release, just a fairly mild irritation.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.800
 And then from there, I know based off a lot of your work, you're saying that serotonin itself will stimulate cortisol

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:14.800
 and just keep perpetuating that issue as it synthesizes with estrogen and as you keep bringing down muscle tissue

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 where you store L-tryptophan so the process can continually be exacerbated.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:32.800
 Yeah, and even though the gradient normally is for the most serotonin to be down where the most bacteria live,

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:41.800
 when you're under severe stress, experimentally they just strap a rat down so it can't move for a few hours

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:53.800
 and that causes serotonin production in the stomach that causes bleeding very quickly.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.800
 Now, what are the hormones that serotonin kind of synthesizes with?

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:03.800
 Obviously, it's not just by itself release. You talked about histamine. What is its correlation with estrogen?

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:15.800
 Estrogen activates the enzyme that turns tryptophan to serotonin, the rate limiting tryptophan hydroxylase

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:21.800
 is activated by estrogen and inhibited by progesterone.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:32.800
 And that's the route into the serotonin and the route out of serotonin is, for example,

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:45.800
 the monoamino oxidase type A happens to be inhibited by estrogen so it doesn't break down serotonin

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.800
 and it's activated by progesterone so it breaks down serotonin.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:30:00.800
 So, the in route is increased by estrogen and the out route is decreased by estrogen

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.800
 and progesterone has the opposite effect protecting you against serotonin.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:22.800
 And so, we've known in our lab we saw that estrogen treatment would cause the animals to first,

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:32.800
 it would enlarge their adrenal cortex, activate it, cause intense stress, adaptive reactions

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:43.800
 and then the adrenal cortex would start bleeding and then dying and then it would kill their adrenal cortex.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:51.800
 And the mechanism there has been worked out that the stress increases serotonin,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:31:05.800
 serotonin increases the release factor that increases the pituitary hormone which drives the adrenal cortex.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:18.800
 So, the stress acting either through estrogen or serotonin ends up overworking your adrenal cortex.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:24.800
 Well, this is quite dangerous because, you know, I mean, a lot of people we work with,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 a lot of women too that are coming in, they're on SSRIs, they're on synthetic estrogens,

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.800
 not eating the right foods or right ratios or they're starving themselves

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.800
 so they're having these huge metabolic shifts in regards to regulating their blood sugar.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.800
 So, it's almost like what they're taking and what they're doing is pushing them towards

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:50.800
 exactly where they don't want to go, where they think what they're taking is actually helping.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.800
 That's where the polyunsaturated fatty acids come in too.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:04.800
 They are specifically effective at releasing tryptophan to enter the brain

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:11.800
 or other cells to produce more serotonin.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:18.800
 And the serotonin activates the enzymes that convert polyunsaturated fatty acids

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:29.800
 into the prostaglandins as sort of executors of the inflammatory process, amplifiers of it.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:36.800
 And estrogen activates specifically, interacts with the polyunsaturated

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:48.800
 so that the estrogen becomes more excitotoxic under the influence of unsaturated fats.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:54.800
 And the unsaturated fats, again, are directed down the pathways towards inflammation

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.800
 under the influence of estrogen.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.800
 So, the unsaturated fats increase brain uptake of L-tryptophan, is that what you're saying?

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.800
 Yeah.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.800
 Now, is that why a lot of Western research shows that serotonin is a brain chemical?

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.800
 Because if you read a lot of literature, at least what I've read,

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.800
 most people don't say that serotonin is found in the gut.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:22.800
 Or if they do, it's a small amount, they say the opposite.

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:31.800
 Well, yeah, that orientation comes from the drug industry exclusively.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:38.800
 If they had been paying attention for the last 100 years, they would have known otherwise.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:51.800
 But it's just that the pharmaceutical industry subsidizes and directs research where they want it to go.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:34:00.800
 And they don't want people noticing the diseases that would be cured or prevented

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:08.800
 if people would have a different understanding of what tryptophan, serotonin,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.800
 estrogen, and polyunsaturated fats are doing.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.800
 All of those happen to have their industrial investments

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:27.800
 that really very powerfully direct medical school research, newspaper publicity.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:35.800
 Everything is herded away from understanding that just about every acute

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:45.800
 or degenerative disease would be alleviated by controlling serotonin.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.800
 So I'm sure there's a lot of women listening or people, men, that are taking SSRIs.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.800
 They think they're helping themselves.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.800
 And the Western thought you need it because you have a low serotonin, in a sense,

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.800
 low levels of serotonin.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.800
 And what you're seeing is there's actually excess in making it worse.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.800
 What are doctors basing their --

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:18.800
 It's really sort of fun to read the medical publications.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.800
 It's similar in the case of estrogen.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:33.800
 But in serotonin, for example, instead of measuring the amount of serotonin in the serum

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:40.800
 and/or the amount of breakdown product hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the urine

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:46.800
 and seeing correlations between that and symptoms, for example,

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:55.800
 men with more than 100 nanograms per milliliter of serotonin in their blood serum

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:04.800
 are tending to be imperfectly fertile or infertile or impotent the higher it goes.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:09.800
 And the normal range is said to be various numbers,

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:14.800
 but roughly 50 to 250 nanograms per milliliter.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.800
 But men are sterile at the upper end of that.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:26.800
 And when you look at the amount produced by a cell being injured by radiation,

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:33.800
 it's below 25 nanograms per milliliter until it has been injured by radiation.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:45.800
 So I would infer from those in vitro studies that everyone who has more than 25 nanograms per milliliter

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:52.800
 in their serum is experiencing some sort of inflammatory degenerative process.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:37:01.800
 The articles, instead of looking at those correlations,

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:12.800
 will say they're measuring, for example, the total serotonin in the whole blood,

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.800
 and they say there's no difference between this group or that group.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:27.800
 But it's absolutely decisive whether the serotonin is being bound in the platelets in the blood

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.800
 where it's being carried to the lungs to be destroyed,

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.800
 or whether it has leaked out of the platelets into the serum

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:42.800
 where it can act on the wall of the blood vessel and the heart and the lung,

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:49.800
 causing hypertension and fibrosis of the lungs and heart valves and so on.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:38:00.800
 And they will look at the amount of the breakdown product, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in the urine.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:11.800
 And if it goes up, they'll say, it depends on whether they see it corresponding to a good effect or a bad effect,

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:22.800
 but they'll either say that it means that there's less serotonin in the brain when they see more in the urine,

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.800
 because if it's broken down, it can't be acting.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:34.800
 In other words, they can choose what they want to interpret as happening in the brain

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.800
 by looking at something very remote, the breakdown product in the urine.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:47.800
 So if your lungs are working effectively to destroy it, you'll see the breakdown product.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:54.800
 If the lungs aren't working effectively, you won't see the breakdown product.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:03.800
 So it'll look like you might not be experiencing serotonin stimulation

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:14.800
 when that's exactly why you're experiencing it, because you aren't forming the breakdown product.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.800
 Now, can you elaborate for the listeners on the correlation between melatonin and serotonin?

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.800
 Because I know you talk a lot about melatonin and melatonin supplementation.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.800
 Yeah.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:37.800
 An Italian researcher has been seeing melatonin very closely associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.800
 High melatonin goes with high rheumatoid symptoms,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:48.800
 and the inflammation of the rheumatoid arthritis is worse at night when the melatonin is high and so on.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:57.800
 But melatonin is actually being produced in the inflamed arthritic joint

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:02.800
 or in the inflamed cancerous breast, for example.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:11.800
 And I interpret that not to mean that melatonin is causing the inflammation or the cancer,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:17.800
 but that, like in the brain, serotonin is turned to melatonin.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:23.800
 I think it's a detoxifying process.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:29.800
 When stressed, if you can destroy the melatonin by this alternate route

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.800
 rather than by the mono-amino oxidase route,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.800
 if you can turn it to melatonin,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:47.800
 then you've disposed of a good part of your inflammation problem.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.800
 Did I lose you?

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.800
 Hello?

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.800
 I thought I lost you for a second.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.800
 My phone cut out and I grabbed Jeannie's phone.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.800
 I just wanted to make sure you were still there.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:04.800
 I'm just saying that I interpret the association of melatonin with these inflammatory problems

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.800
 as being a detoxifying process.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.800
 Now, which one is a precursor to which?

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.800
 Melatonin is a precursor to serotonin?

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800
 Yes.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.800
 When you get rid of serotonin, you turn it into melatonin.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.800
 A lot of these people that are supplementing with melatonin,

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.800
 they think they're helping themselves, especially at night.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.800
 They're actually putting themselves into an immune-suppressive state

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.800
 as well as stimulating cortisol because serotonin stimulates cortisol.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:44.800
 So the very thing they're doing to help with sleep is actually going to make it worse.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:52.800
 The difference of toxicity between serotonin and melatonin is so great.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.800
 It's just sort of an indirect problem.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.800
 If you take 10 milligrams of melatonin, then that's going to be a problem,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:07.800
 but a milligram or so is probably harmless.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:15.800
 But the 5-hydroxytryptophan turns massively into serotonin.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.800
 That's where people are going to get the problem.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.800
 So the 5-HTP that people are taking for maybe depression or to help with sleep,

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.800
 you're talking about?

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:30.800
 Yes, that's really much more dangerous than melatonin.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.800
 Okay.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.800
 Because of its immune suppression and the stimulation of cortisol.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.800
 Yes, and turns to serotonin.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.800
 Right.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:49.800
 And so I've recently talked to people who had eye problems, cataracts or glaucoma,

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:56.800
 who had been prescribed to take fish oil and 5-HTP.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:03.800
 And you can create cataracts almost instantly with a dose of serotonin,

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:12.800
 and the serotonin is high in sick eyes with cataracts or glaucoma,

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:19.800
 and the fish oils break down, increasing the formation of serotonin in the eye,

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.800
 just as it happens in the blood and other tissues.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.800
 Now, while we're talking about 5-HTP,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.800
 I know there's people that are listening now, will listen later,

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.800
 that have or are taking it for an emotional issue and feel like it helped,

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.800
 food, depression, things like that.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.800
 Or, you know, what's the mechanism behind that?

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:44.800
 Is it helping at the expense of really damaging the metabolism?

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:50.800
 If it happens to drive up their cortisol,

00:43:50.800 --> 00:44:00.800
 cortisol makes everyone feel good temporarily by stopping inflammation.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:07.800
 So that's one of the possible good feelings.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:14.800
 Some of the effects of the SSRIs are really surprising.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:22.800
 Some of them do pretty directly increase your exposure to serotonin.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:27.800
 You can find it in the body fluids after taking the drug.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:35.800
 But they have treated aggressive dogs with one of the SSRIs

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.800
 and find that they work to decrease their aggressive viciousness.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.800
 And at the time that they become friendly dogs,

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.800
 they measure the amount of serotonin in their blood

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:55.800
 and find that it has decreased greatly.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:02.800
 And that was one of the symptoms of the carcinoid people in their last stages.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.800
 They were often unmanageably aggressive.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:15.800
 And that whole thing about the anti-aggression, anti-anxiety,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:21.800
 all of those happy associations are just --

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.800
 they look at something they want to look at

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:32.800
 rather than what's really present and acting in the system.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:38.800
 Can you talk about serotonin's correlation with the thyroid and CO2 levels

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:44.800
 and what does it do to lowering CO2 levels to lower thyroid production?

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.800
 What does it do to the what levels?

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.800
 CO2.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.800
 Oh, oh.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:59.800
 Serotonin activates prolactin, for example, along with cortisol.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:06.800
 When you're low in thyroid, your serotonin goes up.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:15.800
 And the TSH is partly increased by the rising serotonin.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:22.800
 And low thyroid people very often have increased prolactin

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.800
 as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:32.800
 Those both are increased by the rising serotonin from the --

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.800
 low thyroid people have high estrogen and low progesterone,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.800
 and those are involved in causing the serotonin to rise.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.800
 Rising serotonin increases the prolactin and TSH.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:57.800
 And if your thyroid can't respond vigorously to correct the whole situation,

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:01.800
 bring up your progesterone, lower the estrogen,

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.800
 turn off the production of serotonin, and get your TSH and prolactin down,

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:15.800
 then you get stuck in this high TSH, high prolactin, high serotonin situation.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:21.800
 And all of those things, the pituitary hormones included,

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:28.800
 create inflammation, promote clotting, the formation of lactic acid,

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.800
 suppression of the mitochondrial respiration, which produces carbon dioxide.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:47.800
 So your whole energy system is pushed down when you get in that pattern.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:58.800
 The absence of carbon dioxide is a place where you can start.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:06.800
 If you survived a polyunsaturated fat diet and so on,

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:13.800
 and were in good health, didn't have high serotonin or inflammatory problems,

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.800
 didn't have leaky blood vessels and water retention and so on,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:25.800
 if you just wanted to experiment and you handed hyperventilating for a minute,

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:34.800
 you would find that the loss of CO2 in your blood raised the pH in the blood platelets,

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:40.800
 which are moving the serotonin to your lungs to be destroyed.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:51.800
 Instead of carrying it to your lungs, the loss of carbon dioxide causes the platelets to spill their serotonin,

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:59.800
 causing blood capillaries and arterioles to dilate and become leaky.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:08.800
 And within a minute, you can create a hyperserotonemia edematous condition.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:19.800
 And once you get that, then it tends to become self-perpetuating if it has become too intense.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.800
 So just going back to what you said at the beginning,

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:29.800
 it's the damaged metabolism and maybe the bacterial overgrowth and the overburden on the liver

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.800
 and the estrogen dominant thing that doesn't allow the liver to detox the serotonin,

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.800
 which increases serotonin levels and pushes people into this state?

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:46.800
 Yes, and those changes make you hyperventilate, make you tend to lose even more carbon dioxide,

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:55.800
 and everything tends to reproduce itself, making the condition worse,

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:04.800
 unless you intervene with thyroid or progesterone or carbon dioxide.

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:18.800
 The carbon dioxide, besides holding the serotonin in place in the platelets,

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:28.800
 helps to detoxify and anti-inflame all the other parts of the system.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:36.800
 It prevents the overproduction of adrenaline, for example.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.800
 It tends to calm the whole system.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:50.800
 You can sedate a person if you give them a fairly high amount of carbon dioxide.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:59.800
 So it's acting on everything from your nervous system down to your bones in a stabilizing effect.

00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.800
 And at the other extreme, there's the lactic acid and serotonin

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.800
 that are destabilizing everything at all levels.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.800
 So could you say a lot of people who are being diagnosed with asthma,

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.800
 they're actually just hyperventilating?

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:22.800
 Yes. Estrogen, women taking estrogen will tend to hyperventilate,

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:32.800
 have a slightly alkalotic condition, and that increases the release of serotonin and histamine,

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:39.800
 and those cause contraction of the muscles in your breathing system,

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:49.800
 and will bring on everything from a slight flemminess to tightness of the tubes

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:58.800
 all the way up to terminal fibrosis of your respiratory system.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.800
 Great, great stuff.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.800
 Can you elaborate a little bit?

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.800
 You talk a lot about environment and all these different things in the internal system,

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.800
 and you talk about this a lot in some of your articles and in actually some of your books.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:17.800
 Can you talk about light and what does light have to do or even darkness have to do with serotonin?

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:26.800
 The popularity of the morning light treatment, everything that makes someone feel good,

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.800
 it turns out they'll say, "Oh, that's because it's increasing your estrogen and your serotonin

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:36.800
 and your prostaglandins," and everything they have to sell, they'll say,

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:43.800
 "If you feel good after doing something, it's because you need more of our product."

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:47.800
 And it's the same with the light boxes.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:54.800
 Getting enough light makes people feel good, so they say, "Oh, that's because it's increasing your serotonin."

00:52:54.800 --> 00:53:04.800
 But in fact, the peak serotonin in the blood is at midnight in the winter,

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:14.800
 and the enzymes that produce it and detoxify it are under the influence of light, too.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:19.800
 So there are direct effects of light on the enzyme systems that regulate it.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:26.800
 And when you look at the end product, being depressed and inflamed,

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:33.800
 the worst time is around midnight and the worst season is in the winter.

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:39.800
 People get sick, tend to have strokes, depression.

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:52.800
 All kinds of diseases are exacerbated under the influence of darkness and high serotonin.

00:53:52.800 --> 00:54:05.800
 [ Indistinct ]

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:11.800
 Is that better? I'm having some technical difficulties today for some reason with the host here.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.800
 Is that better?

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.800
 Yeah, you were skipping for a second there.

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.800
 Yeah, it's acting really odd today. I apologize to everyone.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.800
 I'm not sure, but I just have to keep rolling with it.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.800
 So we can say basically that in a sense, light is more stimulatory to progesterone,

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:35.800
 and darkness is more stimulatory towards estrogen, serotonin, melatonin, things like that.

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:39.800
 Yeah, that's been known for a long time.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:49.800
 It's the increased day length in the spring that makes animals turtle from rising progesterone.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:56.800
 For example, they've mated an animal that has delayed implantation.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:05.800
 They would mate the animals in the winter and then watch when the female that had been mated

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:11.800
 over a span of six weeks or so, they would watch when she actually became pregnant.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:18.800
 It was about March 21st when the days became as long as the nights.

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:27.800
 Suddenly the hormones, progesterone, would rise to the point where she would implant and become pregnant.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.800
 So if you kind of correlate this with, you know, I'm from Boston originally,

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.800
 and a lot of people in the winter get seasonal affective disorder, quote, unquote,

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.800
 because the days are shorter.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.800
 So you can kind of correlate that with people becoming almost serotonin dominant.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.800
 And if people maybe got outside a little more, eliminated glucose from their diet,

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.800
 and maybe used light therapy later on in the day,

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:54.800
 you could down regulate the inflammatory effects of serotonin.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:56:05.800
 Yeah, there are direct effects that you can demonstrate in a cell that, for example,

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:14.800
 sunlight, the ultraviolet part, will excite electrons and create free radicals.

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:22.800
 It takes usually several hours for those to fade out, but if you expose it to red light,

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:29.800
 in other words let the penetrating rays get to the tissue,

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.800
 the free radicals are quenched almost instantly.

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:41.800
 With animals, they can give them a lethal dose of gamma rays.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:48.800
 And if they, within the first hour, expose them to red light,

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:55.800
 that quenches the excited electrons and stops the death process.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:02.800
 When you get sunburned, your skin is being killed by the ultraviolet,

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:08.800
 but the red light is all that penetrates deeply.

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:14.800
 The red light from bright sunlight will go all the way through your trunk.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:21.800
 We're semi-transparent to the red light because the only thing that absorbs it significantly

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:28.800
 is the respiratory enzyme, the copper.

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:32.800
 It's a blue enzyme that absorbs red light,

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:38.800
 which is our respiratory enzyme that depends on thyroid function.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:47.800
 That happens to be what is damaged by serotonin, estrogen, and free radicals.

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.800
 Now I've got a question from one of the listeners.

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.800
 We can talk a little bit more serotonin, then we'll go to endotoxin,

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.800
 because you could probably sit here and talk about serotonin for the next couple hours

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:03.800
 and never get to endotoxin, but I want to because we don't have all day.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:08.800
 One of the listeners has a question in regards to serotonin in exercise

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:13.800
 and says that a lot of the popular articles say that aerobic exercise is good because it raises serotonin,

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.800
 and of course we know you're not a fan of aerobic exercise.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:25.800
 So is serotonin affected by exercise, and what is the best kind to make sure that excess serotonin isn't produced?

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:34.800
 Yeah, there have been some experiments showing that resistance exercise of a very moderate sort,

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:46.800
 muscle building, the kind that is best for building muscle, is best for lowering inflammation and serotonin.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.800
 So more aerobic?

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:54.800
 Yes, staying below the lactate threshold.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.800
 Okay, yeah.

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.800
 So just doing an anaerobic workout, I mean, do you recommend anything nutritionally during a workout,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:13.800
 pre or post, other than that to downregulate serotonin or focusing on specific foods?

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:23.800
 Yeah, the sugars, keeping your cell energy up, producing carbon dioxide is the best way to minimize the serotonin.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.800
 R-juice?

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.800
 Yeah.

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.800
 Okay.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.800
 Cool.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.800
 That's good stuff on serotonin.

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.800
 Let's move on to endotoxin because, you know, there's a lot of questions.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.800
 I get questions from listeners.

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:42.800
 I have questions, but the past hour definitely has flown by,

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.800
 and I want to talk about endotoxin a little because you never really hear it out there.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.800
 The first time I was exposed to it was through you.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.800
 So what is endotoxin?

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.800
 Can you explain it to the listeners?

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.800
 Yeah, its technical name is lipopolysaccharide.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:14.800
 It's some fatty acids of a specific kind attached to a short starch-like molecule, the polysaccharide,

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:24.800
 and it's made by a whole variety of bacteria, the gram-negative type, produce it,

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:35.800
 and it's part of their structure so that as they live, they're building more structure

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:42.800
 and leaking some of this fat starch molecule.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:54.800
 And it's so representative of this whole category of bacteria that animals have evolved, apparently,

01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:02.800
 to recognize the presence of lipopolysaccharide as the presence of bacteria,

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:13.800
 and it activates the innate immune system to do things that defend against the bacteria,

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.800
 to get ready to eat bacteria.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:29.800
 And it's a toxic effect that seems to be a physical effect on the cell

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:36.800
 rather than a chemical effect or even an immunological effect.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:45.800
 It seems to have a soaping-type action on cells that destabilizes them,

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.800
 lets them know that they've been irritated,

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:58.800
 and that amount of physical irritation is enough to activate things like the production of serotonin,

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.800
 the release of histamine, the activation of proteolytic enzyme systems,

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:19.800
 and creating a shower of things that are part of our very basic defense against bacteria.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:33.800
 So it's just sort of a basic threat that happens to be produced by most of our familiar bacteria,

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:41.800
 intestinal bacteria of several different genuses produce it.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:51.800
 We've adapted to living with it so that it's sort of a stimulus when it's in the right amount.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.800
 It tones up the system and gets things running,

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:08.800
 and we normally can destroy all of it that gets into the bloodstream by the time it gets to the liver.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.800
 But if your liver is overworked or under-energized,

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.800
 then the endotoxin gets through in your bloodstream

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:26.800
 where it starts having this irritating, destabilizing effect all through your system.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.800
 And its direct effect on the cell destabilizes it enough

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.800
 that it lowers mitochondrial energy production,

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.800
 forces the cell to shift over to lactic acid production.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:50.800
 So it's acting directly in harmful ways that start the leaky process,

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:56.800
 letting stuff leak out of your bloodstream into the surrounding tissues.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:04.800
 So you can demonstrate that it makes problems like multiple sclerosis worse

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.800
 by letting more stuff leak through the barrier into the brain.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:21.800
 But starting right at the intestine, if the intestine is in very great condition,

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.800
 it can stop the endotoxin before it gets to your liver.

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:31.800
 And your liver is the next layer of defense.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.800
 But at each of these, every place the endotoxin reaches,

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:45.800
 it activates the serotonin and other innate inflammatory reactions.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:05:00.800
 And those include nitric oxide, which goes with like a shower of mutual excitation.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:08.800
 Endotoxin, serotonin, nitric oxide, and the prostaglandins,

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:16.800
 these are things that normally are under control and don't do much harm.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:24.800
 But once they reach a certain level of interaction and promotion of each other,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:34.800
 then they all add up to suppression of our oxidative metabolic system.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.800
 So something as simple as a stress reaction from anything,

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:46.800
 excess cortisol production, could cause an increased production of endotoxin.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.800
 Something that simple.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.800
 Increased absorption of it, yeah.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.800
 From there is an onslaught of dysfunction.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:03.800
 A lot of starchy food, undercooked cereals,

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:11.800
 and poorly cooked vegetable material will feed the bacteria,

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:16.800
 increase their production of it.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:23.800
 And then that excess production of endotoxin increases serotonin release from the intestine.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.800
 And then just basically that cascade of everything we just talked about for the past hour,

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:30.800
 any of those possibilities could happen.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.800
 So they kind of go hand in hand in a sense.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.800
 Well, I mean everything kind of goes hand in hand,

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.800
 but there's a high correlation between endotoxin and serotonin.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:44.800
 Yeah, very close.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:52.800
 I think that's probably the closest way to account for the gradient of increasing serotonin

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.800
 as you move from the stomach to the appendix.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:03.800
 I think that's because of the increasing production of endotoxin.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.800
 Right.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:15.800
 So besides what other foods in the body can actually cause an increase in endotoxin?

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.800
 You know, besides maybe eating the wrong foods you've talked about,

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.800
 you know, eating maybe undercooked cereals and things like that,

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:27.800
 of course unsaturated foods with unsaturated fatty acids.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:39.800
 The things that are high in phosphate have some of the overlapping effects with the inflammatory things.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:44.800
 Calcium, if you have a high ratio of calcium to phosphate,

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:55.800
 calcium happens to suppress the fermentation of fiber and starch in the intestine.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:03.800
 So high calcium intake will actually reduce the production of the endotoxin

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:13.800
 as well as reducing the consequences of your reaction to the endotoxin.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:22.800
 The saturated fats, having some fat in your food does various things

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.800
 that can be helpful.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:35.800
 There's a germicidal effect of the fatty acids that helps to keep the intestine sterile

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:46.800
 and you should be able to absorb your fat by roughly half to two-thirds of the way down your small intestine

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.800
 where it's still sterile.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:58.800
 But if you eat fat with a fiber, the fat helps to suppress the bacteria

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:06.800
 and it can help the fiber persist and go all the way through your intestine.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:15.800
 So it can turn what would be a harmful fiber-supporting endotoxin

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:24.800
 into a useful sort of a bowel-stimulating bulk former.

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800
 Right.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.800
 So even, you know, like of course these cereals, uncooked foods, unsaturated fats,

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.800
 even a lot of these things that people are eating like the carrageenan, gums, beans,

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.800
 all those things can actually cause the overproduction of endotoxin as well.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.800
 So going back to the foods that actually protect against it, that's where, you know,

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:53.800
 the informatic shells and dairy come into play as being a protective mechanism.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.800
 Yes.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:03.800
 I don't know that these things could protect you even against carrageenan.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800
 Well, I mean against endotoxin.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:12.800
 I don't mean against carrageenan, but I mean against endotoxin, you know, at least.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.800
 If you'll start to eliminate those things from your diet.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.800
 Yes, against real foods, but I think they're really trying to poison us

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.800
 by putting carrageenan in our whipped cream and lunch meats.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.800
 They'll succeed.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.800
 They are succeeding.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.800
 Right.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.800
 What?

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.800
 I said they are succeeding.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.800
 Oh, yeah.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.800
 So you talked about calcium, how it's protected.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:47.800
 For the listeners, what types of foods do people get for calcium?

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:51.800
 Because I think we've talked about before, you know, people taking calcium supplements,

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:56.800
 but what's the best source of calcium for people?

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:03.800
 Powdered eggshells really are by far the next best to milk and cheese.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:13.800
 In the case of milk, you have both the fat and the lactose helping to absorb the calcium.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:20.800
 In the case of the powdered eggshell, at least it's in the form of calcium carbonate,

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.800
 which is the form that it's going to be most beneficial.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:34.800
 Calcium carbonate is how calcium is integrated into the bone.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:42.800
 I think the reason they see some counterproductive effects from calcium supplementation

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:52.800
 is that they're using such strange things as pills for nutritional supplements,

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:59.800
 calcium phosphate, orotate, gluconate, aspartate, and so on.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.800
 You don't want to use any of those.

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:10.800
 The calcium carbonate from eggshell is very pure and the right chemical.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.800
 Now, while we're talking about food and we can kind of group serotonin in this,

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:18.800
 you've talked about carrots and bamboo shoots before as well,

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:28.800
 which help the body kind of reabsorb and detoxify against estrogen, serotonin, and endotoxin.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.800
 Correct?

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.800
 Yes.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:40.800
 Now, for the listeners, can you explain why you recommend a raw carrot versus a cooked carrot?

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:49.800
 The cooking does something to make the carrot fiber acceptable to bacteria,

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.800
 and the bacteria will thrive on cooked carrot,

01:12:53.800 --> 01:13:04.800
 where almost no microorganism can multiply on a raw carrot.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:18.800
 From a cooked carrot, you absorb almost all of the carotene, and the carotene has an antithyroid action.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:27.800
 You do get more potassium, calcium, magnesium out of the cooked carrot,

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:37.800
 but the point of the carrot isn't nutrition, it's to help cleanse your intestine.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.800
 Right, it's more medicinal in a sense.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.800
 Now, what about keto proteins?

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.800
 In one of your articles, you talk about keto proteins,

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.800
 and I think it's in one of your serotonin and endotoxin articles.

01:13:50.800 --> 01:14:04.800
 Can you talk about what keto proteins are and why you recommend them in regards to maybe being anti-serotonin?

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.800
 No, I'm not sure what you're talking about. Keto, did you say?

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.800
 Keto, yes.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:18.800
 I think it's your article on, or one of your newsletters on serotonin,

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:26.800
 you talk about keto proteins for ketones and then for keto acids, you know, for potatoes.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:39.800
 Oh, yeah, these are the equivalent carbon framework of the essential amino acids,

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:47.800
 but they lack the ammonia needed to make the complete essential amino acid.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.800
 And potato happens to be very rich in these.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.800
 Probably a lot of fruits are, but they haven't been analyzed.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:15:02.800
 But we juiced a potato and ran it on paper chromatograph

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.800
 and saw that it was very rich in all of the equivalents of the essential amino acids.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:16.800
 But when you test it chemically, it has a very low amount of protein in the potato.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:24.800
 But when you eat it, these keto acids are changed once they get into your bloodstream.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:29.800
 Just by absorbing ammonia, they change into the essential amino acids

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:34.800
 and can support protein synthesis.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:44.800
 So if a person has very low kidney function and can't get rid of a lot of urea,

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:53.800
 instead of needing dialysis, if they eat these keto acids instead of protein,

01:15:53.800 --> 01:16:02.800
 they can recycle their ammonia over and over instead of making it into urea that needs to be excreted.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:09.800
 And potatoes are a very rich source of this protein equivalent,

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:18.800
 such that if you mash two pounds of potatoes,

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:27.800
 you can think of it as being equivalent to a quart of milk for protein value.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.800
 And it also has a good balance of all the other nutrients.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.800
 So if you juice it and get rid of the starch,

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.800
 then you have an extremely concentrated high-value nutrient.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:49.800
 That's good stuff. I've always wondered that and I was reading it and it was kind of confusing me,

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.800
 so I'm glad you clarified on that.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.800
 Guys, I forgot to mention, and I hope everyone knows,

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:58.800
 we're always taking callers, so don't forget to call in at 347-426-3546

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.800
 if you want to call in and ask Dr. Rapide any questions.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:08.800
 I do have some questions coming in from some listeners on serotonin and endotoxin that I could ask you.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:17.800
 One of the listeners asked if you know any correlation or cause of raised moles,

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:26.800
 moles, things like that, in regards to unsaturated fat serotonin.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:37.800
 Yeah, I was just reading some articles on the handling of tryptophan and serotonin by pigmented molds.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:45.800
 And other pigmented skin. It's just starting to be investigated.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:57.800
 But I've had a lot of experience with just the effect of thyroid and related hormones on molds.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:11.800
 A couple of doctors in about 1980 told me I should have a biopsy on a mold that had become big and rough and totally black.

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:24.800
 And I was experimenting with DHEA and progesterone at the time and knew that I didn't want to get involved with cancer specialists.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:37.800
 And after I'd been experimenting with the steroids, I saw what looked like a maraschino cherry where the mole had been.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:43.800
 And over the next three or four days, the inflammation went out of it.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:55.800
 And what was left was a small brown mole that I had had all my life in that place that had wanted to turn into a melanoma.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:06.800
 And since then, every time I have become hypothyroid from not taking a thyroid supplement, I notice that I get molds growing.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:15.800
 I've probably had 20 or 25 that would easily be diagnosed as melanomas.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:26.800
 For example, a white mole with a blue and black spot that changed position every three or four hours.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:36.800
 Extremely turbulent metabolic activity just churning around, changing shape and colors.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:50.800
 And those disappear in just a matter of hours or days, adjusting the thyroid and progesterone, pregnenolone, and DHEA.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:57.800
 Right. Now, while you're on the thyroid, I just got another email from another listener.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:10.800
 And this might be a large question, but if you could elaborate a little bit more on or talk a little bit about anemia in correlation with the thyroid.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:30.800
 Broda Barnes brought that to my attention. He believed that hypothyroidism was usually the cause of anemia and probably never recommended an iron supplement.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:40.800
 He cited an experiment in which rats whose tail bones never make red blood cells normally,

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:52.800
 their tail was inserted through a little nick in their abdominal wall and sewed inside their body.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:21:01.800
 And later, after staying at core body temperature for a couple of weeks,

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:11.800
 they took the bones out and found that they were producing red cells just like their rib bones or hip bones, whatever, would be producing.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:23.800
 And it's simply a matter of temperature. If your extremities are cold, the bones are too cold to make blood cells.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:34.800
 And low thyroid people, even if their core temperature stays up, their extremities tend to get very cold.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:43.800
 There you go. Well, thanks for answering that.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:48.800
 I got another question from a listener. I guess people decided to email in today instead of call.

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:54.800
 But like I said, guys, don't be afraid to call 347-426-3546.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:00.800
 Another question from one of the listeners, you talked about serotonin and bacteria in the small intestine.

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:05.800
 His question is in regard to candida or yeast overgrowth.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:13.800
 And if you can elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe if it has a relation to serotonin.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:22.800
 Oh, the candida normally is harmless in the intestine,

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:32.800
 but like the other organisms, it shouldn't be living very abundantly above your colon.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:40.800
 Low thyroid people sometimes have candida growing even in their stomachs.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:48.800
 And when they drink anything sugary, they brew beer or wine in their stomach

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:54.800
 and can make so much that they get drunk every time they eat sugar.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:04.800
 But ordinarily, they shouldn't be living there, and that's mainly because your thyroid function is low.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:12.800
 But if you want to make a yeast angry, don't feed it sugar,

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.800
 because a yeast needs sugar to grow normally.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:27.800
 And when it's deficient in sugar, it will sense sugar in your intestine in the blood

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:33.800
 as where any glucose that it can sense is available.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:40.800
 So it will drill holes in your intestine and send filaments down into your intestine

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:46.800
 to get some glucose, which it needs.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:58.800
 But if you keep feeding the yeast sugar, the worst you'll get is a little drunk.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.800
 That's kind of what most people recommend.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:05.800
 There's a lot of people out there that say don't sugar feed.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.800
 Well, it does. Sugar feeds on fungus, and if you have an overgrowth of starvin, it will go away,

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.800
 which in all reality, it does feed on sugar, and you actually need it to downregulate it.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.800
 And the less you take in, the more overgrowth you're going to have.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:27.800
 But the raw carrot is a very good antiseptic for candida and other fungus.

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.800
 Just one a day keeps the doctor away.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:42.800
 We've seen people who had the typical high estrogen, high cortisol, premenstrual syndrome,

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:51.800
 in just three or four days of the carrot salad have another blood test, and everything is normal

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.800
 because the carrot is preventing the reabsorption of estrogen,

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:02.800
 which is blocking your liver function and your thyroid function.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:11.800
 The carrot, by eliminating the endotoxin, lets your thyroid and other glands function properly

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:18.800
 to bring up your progesterone and lower your estrogen and cortisol.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.800
 Now, the list is when you say carrot salad, do you just mean a shaved carrot?

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.800
 Do you just mean raw? I mean, is there anything else in there, salt, pepper, oil?

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:37.800
 Raw is good, but if you want it to be really antiseptic, you shred it lengthwise preferably

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.800
 because the length of the fiber is important.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:47.800
 You don't want to put it in a blender, but you want quite a bit of the fiber to be intact.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:57.800
 And a few drops to a spoonful of vinegar without additives and an oil, olive oil,

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:02.800
 just a teaspoon or so improves the taste.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:10.800
 And either coconut or olive oil will have a germicidal action that normally you would absorb

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:19.800
 the oil high up in your intestine and it wouldn't get as far as the bacteria in the lower intestine.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:29.800
 So the carrot absorbs some of the germicidal acetic acid and olive oil or coconut oil

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:37.800
 carries them along with it and its own intrinsic germicide is increased

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:44.800
 by these other antifungal chemicals.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.800
 Same thing with the bamboo shoots.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.800
 What kind of bamboo shoots do you recommend cutting up and cooking them?

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:58.800
 Yeah, I've never tried raw bamboo shoots, but they're a very interesting vegetable.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:05.800
 I like them with a cheese or egg sauce.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.800
 Sounds good to me.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.800
 Guys, if you want to call in and ask questions, 347-426-3546.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:17.800
 Is there anything else, Ray, you want to talk about in regards to serotonin and endotoxin?

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:24.800
 Anything, of course, we probably forgot or didn't chat about based on a lot of your research over the years?

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:37.800
 Oh, keeping in mind that the so-called scientific community, the corporate product research community,

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:44.800
 is very determined to keep the public thinking a certain way about estrogen and serotonin

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:54.800
 and so they never mention certain topics and they always try to read the data

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.800
 so it looks like it's beneficial even when it isn't.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:12.800
 And if you think of anything bad, then you might consider what the role of estrogen and serotonin is in relation to that.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:26.800
 For example, ergot was used to produce abortions and that led to it being a drug to facilitate childbirth,

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:42.800
 but the ergot derivatives and serotonin are involved in impaired fertility, lack of sperm formation in men,

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:50.800
 birth defects if a woman is exposed to high serotonin while pregnant,

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:59.800
 difficult delivery because of high serotonin causing reduced circulation.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:09.800
 The whole preeclampsia syndrome is very centered on high serotonin.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:14.800
 When fat women have a problem with pregnancy,

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:24.800
 it's typically because the estrogen and serotonin are reducing circulation to the uterus.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:31.800
 Just practically any problem that people have, if you investigate it,

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:38.800
 it's going to turn out to involve those three types of systems,

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:49.800
 the prostaglandins, fatty acids, the serotonin/tryptophan system, and the estrogen stress system.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:59.800
 It's kind of scary because a lot of people are taking estrogens and synthetic estrogens and SSRIs,

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:06.800
 and infertility is up, and C-section drop, and preeclampsia, and just all these things.

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.800
 Weight gain, it's almost like the very thing that people are trying to build up and work on

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:18.800
 is actually breaking them down and just perpetuating illness.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:31.800
 The famous brain degenerative diseases, Huntington's disease, ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease,

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:36.800
 multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease,

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:46.800
 these all involve the serotonin effects.

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:56.800
 Forty years ago, someone identified increased serotonin as a demyelinating factor

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:04.800
 as well as a blood vessel leakiness factor released by platelets

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:10.800
 that concentrate around the plaques in multiple sclerosis, for example.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:16.800
 And all of those are increased by high estrogen, high prolactin,

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:21.800
 and tend to be corrected by progesterone and thyroid.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:28.800
 All of this stuff that has been known, very clearly demonstrated 30, 40, 50 years ago,

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:38.800
 the drug science culture manages to get everyone to forget.

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:41.800
 Now, just going back, one more key point that kind of popped in my head right now.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:49.800
 I know you've talked a lot about progesterone being kind of antagonistic to estrogen and serotonin

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:54.800
 and sort of a facilitator to the metabolism of the thyroid.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.800
 What about vitamin E and aspirin?

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.800
 You know, you talked about decreased circulation in the uterus,

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:04.800
 and I know you talked about aspirin actually increasing circulation in the uterus.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:14.800
 Yeah, and it's gradually being used more to treat preeclampsia and pregnancy problems,

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:25.800
 and it's very, very powerful against serotonin in many of the ways that thyroid works,

01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:35.800
 aspirin and thyroid, and some of the sugars like fructose work in the same ways against serotonin.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:47.800
 In an animal model of the very serious lung disease, pulmonary artery hypertension,

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.800
 they can cure it just with aspirin.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:33:00.800
 And cancers of various types are promoted by serotonin and inhibited or cured by aspirin.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:08.800
 Yeah, for those listening, it doesn't mean go out and start buying aspirin and popping it.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.800
 There's a rhyme and reason to everything.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:15.800
 You know, make sure you know what you're doing, but if used correctly, it can be very beneficial.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:21.800
 Yeah, the aspirin is filling in for a lack of the other natural things,

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:27.800
 calcium, thyroid, progesterone, pregnenolone, carbon dioxide.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:35.800
 Now I just got another question from a listener, and I think I know what you're going to say to this.

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:38.800
 I think you've actually already answered this question kind of indirectly,

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.800
 but he asked about serotonin's effect on libido

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:50.800
 and what could one do, a male, in regards to raising libido by lowering serotonin.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:57.800
 It's just by increasing calcium, eliminating unsaturated fats, increasing saturated fats, all that stuff.

01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:02.800
 Yeah, all of those anti-inflammatory things.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:16.800
 And keeping your carbon dioxide up high by not doing aerobic exercise, I think, is very important.

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:22.800
 Sometimes the thyroid is the crucial missing thing.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:29.800
 Sometimes vitamin B6 is all it takes to get things going very suddenly.

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:40.800
 Niacinamide to inhibit the pre-fatty acids that in most people are mostly polyunsaturated.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:46.800
 Niacinamide, especially if you accompany it with orange juice,

01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:52.800
 to reduce the breakdown of fat from your deposits,

01:34:52.800 --> 01:35:00.800
 that can stop the stress enough to get your thyroid and androgens going again.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:03.800
 Now a quick question for you on niacinamide.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.800
 Have you ever seen people take niacinamide?

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:12.800
 Have you ever seen a dose, maybe too much of a dose, cause GI upset or diarrhea?

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.800
 No, I've never known of that with the niacinamide form.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:26.800
 The old, it's still popular, the nicotinic acid that makes people turn red,

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:37.800
 what it's doing is increasing the release of serotonin and activating prostaglandin production,

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:40.800
 stuff you don't want to happen.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:48.800
 And even the kind they call no-blush, no-flush niacin,

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:54.800
 it's inositol hexonicotinate, I think is its name.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:00.800
 It still releases nicotinic acid which releases serotonin,

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.800
 where the niacinamide doesn't do that.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:14.800
 And even the slow release or the nicotinic acid are for sure going to increase the risk of diarrhea

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.800
 by increasing your serotonin and prostaglandins.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.800
 Right.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.800
 Good stuff.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.800
 Once again, anything else you want to elaborate on?

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.800
 I don't have any more questions and I don't have any more questions from callers.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.800
 And I definitely, we've got a little bit more time.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.800
 I don't know if you wanted to add any more of your two cents, which would be great.

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:45.800
 But we have covered a lot.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.800
 Anything?

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:58.800
 The idea of fibrosis, if you can find an old book with Hans Selye's work in it,

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:05.800
 you will find some interesting stuff on serotonin and the calcifying diseases

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:09.800
 and the fibrotic diseases.

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:21.800
 And he was very quick to assimilate serotonin into his study of inflammation and stress.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:31.800
 Is that what it's correlated to with prolactin in calcium?

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:36.800
 It does many things to cause calcification.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:46.800
 It increases the parathyroid hormone even, which takes calcium out of your bones

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.800
 and puts it in your blood vessels and kidneys where you don't want it.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:56.800
 And Hans Selye demonstrated that it would calcify the skin,

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:05.800
 turn a rat's skin into like a turtle shell.

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.800
 Yeah, I know a lot of people.

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.800
 I've tried to look for his books, his encyclopedias and all that.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.800
 They're out there, but you've got to drop some bank on them to get them.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.800
 They're pretty expensive.

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:19.800
 Oh, yeah.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.800
 But it's interesting stuff.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:27.800
 So obviously it would be increasing calcium intake to downregulate that internal excretion

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:31.800
 to downregulate parathyroid hormone.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:37.800
 Yeah, and sodium is sometimes a missing factor.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:43.800
 All of the trace minerals, I advocate some kind of seafood once a week

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.800
 to get your selenium and copper, for example.

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:54.800
 The copper is needed for the thyroid to work in the respiratory enzyme.

01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:04.800
 Selenium is needed for the thyroid to work in the deiodinase systems.

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.800
 Now, you talked about sodium.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:15.800
 Do you recommend people using salt, specific types of salt?

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.800
 Yeah, clean salt without additives.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:23.800
 I use Morton's Kenning and Pickling salt.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:26.800
 It seems okay.

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.800
 Because there's no additives.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.800
 Now, what are your thoughts on the Celtic or like the Himalayan and all that?

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:39.800
 The red color in the Himalayan stuff is iron mostly.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:48.800
 Where you find iron, you're likely to find worse heavy metals.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:53.800
 What about like a gray Celtic sea salt, is that gray tint iron?

01:39:53.800 --> 01:40:02.800
 Yeah, that's basically French mud that makes it gray.

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:08.800
 Is that mud high in iron content as well?

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:13.800
 Yeah, usually there's quite a bit of mineral content.

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:19.800
 Anything from the English Channel is now likely to have uranium.

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:22.800
 They're dumping their nuclear waste into the Channel.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:24.800
 Awesome.

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.800
 Yummy Celtic sea salt.

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.800
 Well, we've got about 15, 20 more minutes.

01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.800
 Like I said, I don't have any questions.

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.800
 I went through about maybe 20 or 30 of my questions.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.800
 We've had a lot of listeners email in and ask questions,

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.800
 and I think we covered a lot.

01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.800
 Before we hang up, guys, if you do have any questions,

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:54.800
 feel free to call at 347-426-3546 or pop me an email quickly before we end the show

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.800
 and before we see if Ray has anything else to add.

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.800
 Anything else, Ray, you want to elaborate on?

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.800
 Anything else you're working on or anything else about serotonin and endotoxin

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:09.800
 you want to kind of get in there before we have to go?

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:18.800
 The current newsletter is going out in about a week on osteoporosis

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.800
 and how serotonin fits into that.

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:26.800
 And the one I'm starting next is going to be on sugars,

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:33.800
 especially fructose because of the craziness that is circulating in the culture now,

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:40.800
 telling people to fear fruit even.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.800
 Yes, it is pretty crazy because if you look out the window, it's just so simple.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.800
 What people are doing is not working.

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:50.800
 Just because it doesn't fit into their paradigm, they just poo-poo it,

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:56.800
 but everyone's getting worse, and it is craziness.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:01.800
 So just a quick question regarding osteoporosis and serotonin.

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:06.800
 Is it in correlation with the parathyroid hormone and prolactin like you talked about

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:15.800
 and calcification, and it's in correlation with estrogen and cortisol that lead to osteoporosis?

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.800
 Yes.

01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:22.800
 They were noticing that people on the SSRIs for a few years

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:28.800
 were getting exaggerated degrees of osteoporosis,

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:37.800
 and that led the people who had been looking for products,

01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:44.800
 searching for genes that they could replicate and make a product out of.

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.800
 These people were looking in all of the wrong places.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.800
 They would find something that they thought would work like estrogen

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:05.800
 to prevent osteoporosis according to their way of looking at the world sideways.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:12.800
 Then it would turn out that their product caused fibrosis of the lungs,

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:20.800
 promoted cancer, and even was associated with osteoporosis increasing.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:29.800
 One of the groups that had been working on the genetics, trying to find products,

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:35.800
 they said basically when they looked up and looked around

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:41.800
 and noticed that the intestine was the source of the serotonin that was causing the osteoporosis,

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:49.800
 they said they rediscovered whole animal physiology.

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.800
 And when is this newsletter going out in a week?

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:55.800
 I didn't hear that.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:58.800
 He said when is this newsletter going out in a week, you said?

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.800
 Oh, the osteoporosis is going out in a week, yes.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:03.800
 Okay, good.

01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.800
 So everyone, you've got a week to sign up.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:10.800
 Go to his website, raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.800
 Sign up for his great newsletters, and you can get this newsletter

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:17.800
 and many more that are going to be coming out.

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.800
 We do have a caller, if you don't mind taking a call.

01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:24.800
 Sure.

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:28.800
 Caller from 253, you're on the air.

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.800
 Justin calling from Tacoma.

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:37.800
 My question was for Ray to possibly elaborate upon what he talked about earlier

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:41.800
 in regard to the healing effects of the red light.

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.800
 I live in the Pacific Northwest, and I'm sure as Ray is familiar with, up in Oregon,

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:52.800
 we have long, seemingly very stressful winters with not much light, a lot of cloud cover.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.800
 So what I was looking to see if Ray could answer is possibly some practical applications

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.800
 for the use of that light.

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:09.800
 I've heard the 250-watt infrared light, high-voltage or high-watt incandescent mercury

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:14.800
 vapor light, just a practical guide of what he would do.

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.800
 Thanks, and I'll take my question off the air.

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:26.800
 With the mercury vapor ultraviolet lights, you have to be really careful that you don't get sunburn.

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:32.800
 That will cause you to make vitamin D.

01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:41.800
 I personally prefer to use a little vitamin D, absorbing it through my skin,

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:47.800
 rather than try to fiddle with a safe amount of ultraviolet light exposure.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:55.800
 But it does work for keeping your parathyroid hormone down under control

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.800
 and your calcium where it should be.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:06.800
 Eating excess calcium is very helpful for regulating the parathyroid hormone

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:08.800
 that tends to rise in the winter.

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:13.800
 I think we need more calcium during the winter.

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:23.800
 Everyone should, in a cold, dark northern climate, you can get these.

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:32.800
 They're called 130-volt reflector bulbs, meaning that they're designed to run on a higher voltage

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.800
 than the standard 120.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:45.800
 On the normal voltage, they produce an orange-colored light that's very poor in the blue part of the spectrum

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:50.800
 and very rich in the red and orange part that's biologically good.

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:59.800
 Since they produce a lot of heat with less of the bright white light,

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.800
 they help to heat a room in the winter.

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:09.800
 I have two of them aimed at the area where I work,

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:15.800
 and two of them are generally enough to keep a room warm even in cold weather.

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:28.800
 But it wouldn't hurt to have three of them, 750 watts, aimed at you for your general well-being.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.800
 So they're 130-watt reflective bulbs?

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:40.800
 130-volt, and they're usually about 250 watts.

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:51.800
 They call them infrared, which just means they're designed for a different voltage.

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:52.800
 Good information.

01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.800
 I'm sure a lot of people up in those areas, as well as the East Coast and snow areas,

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.800
 could benefit from that in the wintertime.

01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:03.800
 Well, we've got about 10 minutes left.

01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:06.800
 We're kind of running out of time here.

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.800
 I think that was a great show.

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:11.800
 We really appreciate you coming on, Ray.

01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:17.800
 And once again, everyone really benefits from the material and the work that you're putting out there.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:23.800
 I know we get lots of e-mails from people, and I'm sure you're getting way more.

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:28.800
 And people just appreciate all the work that you're doing and the information that you're putting out.

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.800
 So I know I'm speaking for a lot of people when we say thank you.

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.800
 Okay.

01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.800
 Did you want to add any more to the serotonin/endotoxin topic?

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:51.800
 Well, the antidepressant thing, did I mention the dog that was found to have low serotonin?

01:48:51.800 --> 01:49:02.800
 The things that lower your serotonin are likely to make you less aggressive but happier.

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:11.800
 One of the interpretations of what serotonin is doing that I think makes sense,

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:17.800
 the person who founded the line of thinking was named Cloninger.

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:32.800
 It's that the behavioral system for harm avoidance and general behavioral inhibition is what serotonin is doing.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:39.800
 And so when you reduce your overproduction of serotonin,

01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:53.800
 you stop thinking about harm avoidance and have a more positive, constructive, exploratory attitude.

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.800
 So you're saying the lower the better?

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:59.800
 Yeah, the lower the better.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:02.800
 That's so great.

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.800
 I love it.

01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:10.800
 It's great because a lot of stuff that you say to me makes so much sense,

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:16.800
 but it's just opposite of what everyone is saying.

01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:22.800
 Yeah, that's pretty much an intentional thing.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:29.800
 The business culture took over science after the 1940s.

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:39.800
 There used to be a lot of doctors around who knew how to use thyroid and cure arthritis and insanity and dementia

01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:46.800
 and everything with thyroid, but they were educated before the Second World War.

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:50.800
 Then the corporations took over the medical schools,

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:57.800
 and everyone educated since the 1950s doesn't know any of that stuff about thyroid.

01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:12.800
 And the serotonin issue came in really with the introduction of fraudulent science governed by the pharmaceutical industry

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:15.800
 with their estrogen theory.

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:23.800
 A whole theory of aging and stress was invented by the estrogen industry,

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:33.800
 and that was already established for about 15 years when serotonin came on the scene.

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:45.800
 So they worked serotonin into the system so that it didn't impair the advertising campaigns for estrogen.

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:50.800
 So the whole system reinforces itself.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:56.800
 The way science is done and the way things are interpreted,

01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:04.800
 it is all designed really just to support the advertising system of the drug industry.

01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:10.800
 So buy any book before 1950 and not anything after 1950.

01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:17.800
 So you have to be very careful with the stuff after the 1950s.

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:23.800
 I know you have your books and articles, but a lot of people do ask as well,

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:34.800
 can you recommend any other books or people just off the top of your head in regards to serotonin or endotoxin that people can look up?

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:40.800
 No, not on those subjects.

01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:44.800
 Just check out your articles?

01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:46.800
 Yes.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:54.800
 You just have to be critical and look for how they're arguing.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:53:04.800
 They'll basically say anything.

01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:11.800
 When you say this product improves the situation or ameliorates it rather than increases or decreases,

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:18.800
 if they say simply it changes it, increases it, or decreases it, they might be honest.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:25.800
 When they say that they're improving the enzyme function of the rat,

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:34.800
 you can suspect that they have some product in mind.

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:37.800
 So be wary.

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:42.800
 Yes, about 90% of the things you run across.

01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:49.800
 Just in the general journals, it's biased very heavily,

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:56.800
 but by the time it's filtered through the television and newspaper system,

01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:08.800
 then it's like about 98 to 1, 98 to 2 for the industry and against science.

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.800
 It's tough. There's so much out there.

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:18.800
 I guess that's why you kind of stick with your articles and just go from there.

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:21.800
 Keep you on the right track.

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:26.800
 Keep everyone on the right track.

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.800
 Well, I think we're about to wrap it up.

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.800
 I've got a couple of minutes here to kind of say goodbye to everyone.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:34.800
 Once again, great show.

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:40.800
 Really appreciate you coming on. I know everyone appreciates you coming on.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:43.800
 Have a great weekend and a good day, Ray.

01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:45.800
 Okay, thank you. Bye.

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.800
 Bye.

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:51.800
 So another great show, guys.

01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.800
 Ray Peat, serotonin and endotoxin.

01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:55.800
 It's a lot to take in.

01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:59.800
 We probably could have talked for hours and hours and hours on this,

01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:02.800
 those two topics alone, especially serotonin.

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:06.800
 I have a lot of emails that I couldn't get in, unfortunately.

01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:08.800
 I only have a couple minutes left.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:10.800
 But definitely listen to the show over again.

01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:12.800
 If you have questions, email us.

01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:16.800
 You can email Ray, like I said, just make sure you compensate him for his time.

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:21.800
 And just keep in mind, his philosophy is based on science and how the body works.

01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.800
 It's not a diet.

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:24.800
 It's not do this to lose weight.

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:27.800
 It's based on the human body.

01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:31.800
 It's based on how it works and what the body needs, what it can break down,

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:36.800
 what's going to facilitate the metabolism, reduce inflammation,

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:39.800
 and not cause disease in a sense.

01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:44.800
 There's so much going on out there about what Ray thinks and what people should eat and this and that.

01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.800
 And just realize that he doesn't truly have a plan,

01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:53.800
 and everything out there is people's interpretation of his work.

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:59.800
 That's why I've talked to many people, and everyone's using his philosophy very differently.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:03.800
 So just, you know, study it, practice it, and realize it takes time,

01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:10.800
 it takes effort and consistence and fine-tuning to meet your body's metabolic needs

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.800
 every single meal, day, week, and so forth.

01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:20.800
 And then when you think you get it, you got to fine-tune again to keep layering that healing process.

01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:27.800
 So, hopefully everyone enjoyed the show, enjoyed my little pep talk or whatever it was.

01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:29.800
 Thanks for tuning in.

01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.800
 Stay tuned to our Facebook and YouTube for our next show with Ray.

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:36.800
 Next month I'll be posting it, hopefully in the next week or two, once I chat with Ray.

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:38.800
 And I'm out of here.
