WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 Well there we go from the Middle East to Ireland. It's this evening's Ask Your

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.320
 Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray. My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. For those of

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.560
 you who perhaps have never listened to the shows they run every Friday, every

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.240
 third Friday, sorry, from 7.30 to 8 p.m. we have callers but they run from 7 to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.880
 8 o'clock on the third Friday of every month. We've been for a long time now

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.120
 being very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us with various different

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:38.560
 topics. This month will be no exception. I wanted to try and do some kind of a

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.400
 gosh I don't know, introduction or some kind of an outline, a basis, something in which I

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.880
 know that people listening to these podcasts who I get emails from

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.800
 regularly all over the world, not just the States, who've been listening to them,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.920
 have found them interesting and informative and it's led them to read

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.560
 research from people that Dr. Peat's mentioned on the show or they've had

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.360
 conditions and illnesses and they've recovered, listening to Dr. Peat's advice

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.120
 etc etc. So I'm very much aware that this is a real resource with which people are

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.440
 being reached and there will always be those people who are looking for

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.960
 something different, something alternative, as well as those people who

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.360
 are not looking and they won't listen and they've already got their

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.400
 path set out but there's plenty of people who are looking for alternatives

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.840
 and so that's what the thrust of this show has been for the last 12 years

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.680
 probably. So as I said we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat to join

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.200
 us and I wanted to do an outline starting this month with endocrinology

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.520
 as the subject and I wanted to just to outline the nervous system as a whole

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.320
 and then we're going to get into Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.480
 and a few of the other little subsets that are similar as an introduction to

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.680
 the endocrine system and then maybe next month we'll get into the pituitary. I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.400
 know we've mentioned a lot about thyroid hormones and Dr. Peat's main

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.880
 speciality is hormone, hormone physiology so and then the thymus and the adrenals,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.320
 pancreas, ovaries and testes as other sources of hormones and how they affect

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.440
 health and how everything that we do can consciously interact for good or bad

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.440
 with our health. We're not at the mercy of anything in particular, we make

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.760
 choices and so each one of us just by hearing and listening and then going

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.200
 ahead and reading and seeing the facts and the science people can find

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.320
 further information to support everything Dr. Peat's been shouting from

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.560
 the rooftops for for the last 30-40 years. So you there Dr. Peat? Yes. Well thanks so

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.280
 much for joining us. So I wanted to try to explore the endocrine system in a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.220
 large topic I know but one I feel will be a useful exercise in understanding

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.480
 physiology from your perspective Dr. Peat and you make regular mention of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.680
 pioneering scientists whose works give a better appreciation of the physiological

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.200
 processes occurring in the body and often provide a new direction away from

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.720
 the hijacked modern scientific theories we're cultured to accept a lot of which

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.240
 are a pandora's box of ever-increasing drug dependencies and conspiracies

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.280
 abound along with that train of thought. Given we are truly complex organisms

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.440
 with a network of communication systems and feedback either positive or negative

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.480
 to that input, the pathways through which these signals travel as well as the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.560
 structures which respond to the signals and the signals which ultimately affect

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.440
 another system all need to be cohesively organized. So any deficit however small

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.520
 can have far-reaching and dramatic consequences and it is true that the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.800
 organism will do everything possible to correct or mitigate disease before

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.320
 failing sometimes resulting in disease processes that take decades to end in

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.240
 death and so communication systems and appropriate responses are key to good

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.000
 health and functioning and this is the role of the endocrine system I want to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.080
 explore with you Dr. Peat. The earliest records of recognizing the role and it

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.640
 may be earlier than this but the earliest records that I found during my

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.400
 last two days or so getting material together for the show was the Chinese

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.360
 pulling out isolated sex and pituitary hormones from human urine in 200 BC for

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.040
 crying out loud. So that's true that's certainly food for thought when we think

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.880
 we know everything that we know now with ICP-MS and other mass spectrometry being

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.320
 the kind of leading investigative machinery so and then obviously the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.240
 ancient Greeks and Romans from Aristotle Hippocrates and Galen and where we get

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 our herbal medicine background from until the emergence of the germ theory.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.080
 I know you mentioned this a lot in the 19th century then and this is I think is

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.120
 perhaps where it's veered off of normality and and common sense and it's

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.520
 real true scientific endeavor that's where it kind of just veered off the

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.720
 rails and I think we've carried on in that vein ever since and I know that

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.120
 your whole philosophy has been about challenging mainstream science for

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.280
 science's sake because it's not very scientific and I think in that in that

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.880
 regard Dr. Peat would you mind giving an overview of the basis of understanding

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.520
 disease past the present and how this has formed our approach to its management

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:49.680
 and how your rationale differs? I see it as a deviation from from the Chinese and

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:58.680
 the Greeks who had a pretty unified picture of what an organism is.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:08.760
 Aristotle actually was pretty much an organicist in his understanding of the

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.560
 organism and it was really around the time of Descartes middle of the early

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:26.120
 part of the 17th century when the things really got formalized on the wrong track.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:34.480
 Descartes described the organism as a machine completely separate from

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.680
 consciousness. Consciousness was guiding the machine possibly from

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:53.920
 some contact point in the brain but under the ground mostly of people

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.160
 who were persecuted by the monarchies and such they continued to think along

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:10.960
 the organic unified understanding of what an animal or a person is but

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:19.680
 following Descartes the organism was seen as made up of parts just like a

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:28.120
 steam engine or a clock. Each part could be defined and understood and

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.960
 mechanically interlocked with the other parts and the consciousness or the soul

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:41.440
 was seen as something completely separate from this machine and could

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:51.480
 somehow sometimes interfere with its operation but mostly it was out of our

00:07:51.480 --> 00:08:01.000
 control simply running according to causal determinism and when the idea of

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.520
 infection something from the environment causing a disease came in it happened

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:16.280
 that the use of the microscope had developed to the point that people had

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:26.040
 seen the compartments in plants and they called the compartments cells when the

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.000
 plant dried up and left the cellulose framework empty little chambers which

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.640
 they called cells and well a more underground approach looked at

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.840
 particles like red blood cells and called the units corpuscles little

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:56.040
 bodies rather than empty compartments and this idea of breaking the organism

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:06.520
 down into cells and seeing those as parts of a machine made up of material

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:19.400
 without consciousness or spirit this became the background for seeing a

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:30.000
 disease as a particular mechanical interference with the operation of the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.400
 machine. And this is where the term reductionism came from right or

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:40.360
 reductionist medicine? Yeah and the disease one line of thinking was that it

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:48.800
 was a particular little particle of evil material a germ cell analogous to the

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.120
 cells that make up the machine so it was a material particle interfering with our

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:04.160
 material particles that became identified as a disease a very concrete

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:14.120
 specific interference with the machine and as people look more closely at

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:20.960
 tumors they saw really it was a matter of organization rather than some

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:30.320
 particular concrete change or substance but this idea of organization took about

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:40.000
 a hundred and fifty years to finally catch on right up until the beginning of

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.360
 this century people were still stuck on Descartes picture of a mechanical

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:54.920
 organism being interrupted by something right down on the cellular level or even

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:03.240
 smaller the molecular level so that cancer was defined as an evil cell a

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:13.080
 mutant cell containing bad genetic material defective DNA and so all you

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.560
 had to do in the case of a germ-caused disease all you had to do was kill the

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:26.680
 germ and you were cured in the case of the cancer interpreted as a mutant cell

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:35.440
 all you had to do was eliminate every single individual mutant cell and the

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.440
 disease would be cured. I mean that's still how they treat cancer now isn't it?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:48.160
 I mean to some degree. Almost everyone is still stuck in this 17th century idea of

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:55.880
 what an organism is and what a disease is and Parkinson's disease even though

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:04.160
 in the 19th century people recognized all the symptoms of the disease

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:13.360
 stiffness generally the older a person is the more Parkinson's traits they have

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:27.720
 stiffness wobbly tremor and slowness of movement all of the extreme old age

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.040
 symptoms are simply coming on stronger and earlier when they call it

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:40.480
 Parkinson's disease but in by the latter part of the 19th century people had

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:48.280
 noticed that people suffering from this so-called disease if they took a long

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.400
 train ride to get to the doctor their symptoms might disappear or if they came

00:12:54.400 --> 00:13:01.640
 on a carriage or rode a horse their symptoms were greatly alleviated by

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:09.200
 just moving around through space and so some people proposed a vibration

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:16.720
 therapy about 40 years ago someone noticed that swimming alleviated the

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:25.720
 symptoms so simply a different kind of stimulation could reverse the symptoms

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:32.000
 and it turns out that in animals that you can create the disease by poisoning

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:40.560
 them and by giving them an enriched environment you can reverse the actual

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.760
 anatomical chemical changes of their nervous system. So in the poisoned animals

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.720
 if you place them in an enriched environment you're saying that they no

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:54.040
 longer display the... yeah similar to what they noticed in people who took a long

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.840
 train ride. All right you're listening to AskUrob Dr. K. A. D. Garboville

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.200
 91.1 FM at 715 now so from 730 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.920
 invited to call in with questions either related hopefully related to the

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.640
 question subject matter of the endocrine system and Parkinson's if you have any

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.800
 other endocrine based questions that would be fine too. If you're in the area

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:26.480
 seems like there's still a temporary call-in number which is 707 383 9007 so

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:33.440
 383 9007 the toll-free numbers should still be the same here 1-800-KMUD-RAD

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.680
 that's 800-568-3723 and the engineer I think you're gonna read some things out.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.120
 Yeah thanks Andrew I actually should have done this at the top of the hour we

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.440
 would not have this show without the support of Chautauqua Natural Foods in

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.160

00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:01.000
 viewpoints thank you so much for joining us. Okay so to continue Dr. Peat I wanted to

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.520
 explore Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism as there's several

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:11.160
 different similar related type situations that may not necessarily be

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.240
 Parkinson's per se but it does actually seem to be a fairly woolly kind of

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.360
 construct in terms of the multitude of various symptoms that can be expressed

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.000
 some of which may start early some of which may just be late onset but

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.840
 basically they go over the mechanism that's discussed today about the disease

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.160
 and its treatment and highlight your approach to this condition later on to

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.880
 understand it the way you do so the terms used to describe long-term

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.400
 degenerative disorder of the central nervous system affecting mainly the

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.160
 motor system but which can involve the sensory system with cognitive and sleep

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.360
 and mood disturbances also noted as part of the picture there's a compound here

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.800
 and I know we talked about this the other day alpha-synuclein a compound

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.960
 present in these so-called Lewy bodies that are present under microscopic

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.160
 examination found within the substantia nigra in the brain yeah as well as

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.360
 several other brain regions and they are diagnostic for Parkinson's disease

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:21.080
 okay so several Parkinson's genes are involved and they've been high been

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.560
 highlighted here I'd like to pick your brains about some of those as we go on

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.520
 through this but so far as the functioning of waste product digesting

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.320
 lysosomes that may be linked to the inability to break down alpha-synuclein

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:40.600
 there's a protein also called Dardarin now the primary symptoms of Parkinson's

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.040
 result from the loss of dopamine secreting cells within the substantia

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.800
 nigra and there are five major pathways in the brain that we know now there may

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.480
 be more but there were five when I was studying connecting other brain areas

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.320
 with the basal ganglia these are the motor so this is a movement ocular motor

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.760
 where the eyes will track the hands or the eyes the eye movement will track the

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:10.280
 movement externally the associative the limbic and the orbitofrontal circuits

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.280
 now all of them are disrupted essentially and this disruption

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:20.080
 explains the many varied presentations of the disease so in terms of how you

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:26.480
 understand the nervous system and physiology just to start with the motor

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:33.200
 circuit and how higher brain stem functions interact through nerves to

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.480
 elicit muscular contraction for example because we will talk about the tremor of

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.760
 Parkinson's disease and we'll go on later to describe some of the drugs and

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:49.600
 treatments that can be used but they are also responsible chronically for the

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.080
 same symptoms such that it's almost a worse outcome than the initial outcome

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.000
 so it's not a particularly successful treatment but in terms of the motor

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.440
 system of the nervous system and the various drugs second messengers etc that

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:11.680
 exert those controls how did how do you see this motor circuit working in the

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:18.600
 body and how would you perhaps be able to rationalize an alternative approach

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.880
 to the treatment of Parkinson's disease given given how you know my orientation

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:34.640
 is very similar to Pavlov's who saw the motor system as subordinate to the

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:40.840
 sensory system he saw the cortex of the brain as primarily an extension of the

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:50.840
 sense organs and that this formed the environment for the motor reflexes and

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.960
 the idea of a reflex is another thing that originated with Descartes and the

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:04.200
 simply wrong that the the cells aren't mechanically connected in in

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:12.480
 reflex patterns one of the first people in the West to analyze this carefully

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:19.760
 was the French existentialist so-called philosopher Merleau-Ponty Maurice

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:28.560
 Merleau-Ponty who analyzed the meaning of reflexes and he clearly shows that

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:38.520
 there are no reflexes in the Cartesian sense and if you attend a neurology

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:47.600
 course you'll probably find people still arguing that there are simple innate

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:55.320
 mechanical reflexes in the Descartes sense and for example the linguistics

00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:05.600
 system of Noam Chomsky is based entirely on this primitive false idea of the

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.840
 brain function based on mechanical reflexes and it simply doesn't work

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:18.000
 Merleau-Ponty is probably the person who most clearly explains the problems with

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:26.960
 it but in the Pavlovian picture as especially developed through the 1950s

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:39.640
 and 60s by his student P.K. Anokin the sensory system is fluid and

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:48.080
 continuously being revised as the organism explores its environment and so

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:57.720
 the sense of exploring and being stimulated by newness the idea of

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:06.120
 traveling through time and space is in charge over overriding defects in the

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:13.320
 motor system that's a relevant picture I think for seeing disease

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:20.320
 especially Parkinson's disease in a non-mechanical way the protein you

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:28.200
 mentioned dargarin yeah the interesting thing about it is that it shows up as a

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:34.280
 defect in Crohn's disease in the intestine as well as in Parkinson's

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:43.480
 disease and Parkinson's typically starts with constipation and in 19th century

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:51.760
 medicine people remembered the intestine as well as the brain in treating disease

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.040
 it was very common to diagnose death as a result of inflammation of the bowel

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:07.240
 which a pathologist typically overlook as just a side issue but the intestine

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:14.240
 was recognized as very important and the brain as the other end of the organism

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.760
 that sort of the two dimensions and now doctors are taught that if you have a

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.480
 bowel movement three times a day or once every three days it's all normal yeah

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:31.760
 and when you trace out the the chemical links between what's going wrong with in

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:38.360
 the intestine and in the the rest of the motor system the behavioral system and

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:47.560
 so on you can see links but they're they're always contextually working

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:55.760
 there is no simple pathogenic chemical in the intestine but the the bacteria

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.400
 living in the intestine the food you eat and the way your intestine responds to

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:11.920
 it and the stress you're exposed to yeah these act in in the the activating part

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:19.880
 of the brain around 1950 a part of the brain called the reticular activating

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:27.400
 system was identified and this includes the region where the substantia nigra

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:37.880
 and the basal ganglia are and this is where sensory input is dished out to

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:45.440
 activate the upper parts of the brain and when that's happening it tends to go

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:53.720
 with an inhibitory effect on the body so the stronger your mentality is dreaming

00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:02.600
 for example the more relaxed your body tends to be and in Parkinson's the

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:11.080
 system it really tends to be over activated unable to relax properly and

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:18.280
 so a characteristic thing is that during sleep and dreams the person who is

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.840
 developing Parkinson's disease doesn't relax properly the body if they have a

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:33.120
 dream they might scream and thrash around and hit people so there's a

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:41.920
 failure of consciousness to override and relax the body. Can I take you back to

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:46.400
 what you said a moment ago about reminds me of inescapable stress and the rat

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:53.240
 experiments and that being countered by the environmental enrichment that you

00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:01.360
 said could totally restore a Parkinson's created or induced effect in a mouse

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.280
 that was put into a environmental enrichment situation naturally lost the

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:12.480
 symptoms. I know that one does not directly causatively cure the other

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.600
 but you were saying here that there's a link between environmental enrichment

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:25.400
 and the progressive replacement of gosh what can we call it something

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.920
 substantially good that offsets the negative effects of the inflammation the

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:37.080
 degradation the slowing of the bowel endotoxin release etc etc reabsorption

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:43.280
 and and that this is this is a definite key feature if you think that you think

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.920
 it could be all definitely as part of a holistic program sure I can understand

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:52.080
 that would be very plausible to suggest something like that but is that where

00:26:52.080 --> 00:27:01.080
 you were going to? Yes, P.K. Anokin and all of the people in the Pavlovian

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:10.880
 tradition see a global evander process in the brain that they called the

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:22.840
 acceptor of action it's our intention and expectation in the world and this is

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:32.120
 what is integrating not only the motor system and dominating the so-called

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:40.400
 reflexes but this process which is like a model of everything we know and intend

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:50.200
 to do in the world this is supported in the organism not just in the brain but

00:27:50.200 --> 00:28:02.320
 it's a process involving sensory nerves from the whole body and this process in

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:12.160
 the brain it's sort of during during daytime at least it's based on our inner

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:25.120
 ear balance system the vestibular system and this it's a unified picture of the

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:33.720
 world and the organism and this process itself of being conscious is involved in

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:39.800
 the activation of not only the endocrine glands throughout the body but

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:50.160
 in the nerves themselves as they are supporting this model of the world or

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.720
 acceptor of action in the process of metabolizing to be conscious they are

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:06.880
 making changes internally that involves for example synthesizing turning energy

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.480
 substances sugar for example into cholesterol and turning cholesterol into

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:20.840
 pregnenolone right in the nerves for example of the substantia nigra this

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:28.200
 process is going on energy sugar cholesterol pregnenolone progesterone

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:38.960
 and the endocrine process which is then stabilizing the structure and the

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:46.400
 consciousness so that the flavor of your consciousness when it's successful is

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:53.520
 modified by the balance you have between your progesterone the ATA and other

00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:01.400
 steroids and the energy processes so can you try to explain like the personality

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:07.960
 that you're saying in people that develop Parkinson's they're not and you

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:15.080
 know they're experiencing learned helplessness I think the way they live

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:24.480
 they have incorporated duties obligations and and such that they they

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:31.480
 can manage very well but they aren't overcoming the stress adequately

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.560
 because they're not exploring new things or they're not they don't have new input

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.960
 to their brain it's just the same old like a treadmill they're on or yeah

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.680
 they're stuck in a way so that they aren't getting enough stimulation that's

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:50.840
 so interesting because I think when you read the regular texts medical texts

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:56.720
 about Parkinson's and they go through the plethora of symptoms one of them was

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:03.360
 symptom most characteristic I think is fairly emotionless expressions on the

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:12.520
 patients with Parkinson's not infused difficult to engage don't don't have any

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:19.120
 kind of what can I say any kind of joy de vivre I don't know how to say it

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.560
 apart from the French way you know kind of joy of life but that's very much part

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:31.160
 of a learned helplessness type construct that would cause an organism then to

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.680
 just see things just within the boundaries of what they have and then

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.560
 not be anything new and stimulating them and that stimulation you're saying is

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.200
 very much part of switching on what is a totally holistic approach to

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.120
 Parkinson's outside of the mechanistic view that the regular science has and

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.920
 we'll go through the drugs because the drugs are really not effective at all

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:56.200
 and they work very mechanistically and actually cause typically more problems

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.080
 than they're seeking to address so you're saying new sensory output will

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.640
 for example I mean sorry new sensory input will for example increase the

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.220
 dopamine output from the substantia nigra in the brain or the protective

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.920
 progesterone pregnenolone or the hormones that protect against those

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:22.040
 cells degrading not producing dopamine yeah the dopamine theory it's really

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:29.360
 part you have to look at it in in the history of at the beginning of the 20th

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:38.600
 century with the mechanistic view they were seeing the brain as a mechanical

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:46.000
 thing which was having defects causing the tremor and they actually started

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.160
 cutting out parts of the brain to remove the tremor oh yeah sounds like a good

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:57.600
 idea doesn't it the man who invented the word cybernetics Norbert Wiener uh-huh

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:06.640
 yeah he proposed the best surgery up to that time instead of cutting out parts

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:13.560
 of the cortex which they had been doing in the 1930s they were focusing on the

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:23.600
 brainstem and he designed the the radar searching self-control systems that

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:35.280
 would focus on an airplane and aim a gun this feedback system he saw the brain

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:45.880
 having tremors his radar gun aiming system if it was poorly aligned would

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:54.760
 have a tremor of a searching movement back and forth so he saw the tremor as a

00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:02.960
 feedback searching process and so he suggested what you would do to his radar

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:11.280
 apparatus was to knock out part of the sensitivity so he suggested the surgery

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:19.000
 to cut out as part of the searching feedback apparatus and it actually worked

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:27.960
 better than the grocer surgeries and that it's been done right down to the

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:33.440
 70s and 80s they were still simply ablating or destroying part of the brain

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:43.560
 then they got a little more refined and started stimulating it but sometimes

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:50.280
 that didn't work like Michael Fox yeah he wasn't going to have any more

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:57.160
 surgical treatments because instead of stopping the tremor of his left side it

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.520
 started the tremor in the right side yeah well that's that that's the issue

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.720
 isn't it well I guess we'll get into some of the medications now just to

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:12.280
 bring them out and to explain the mechanistic view that was constructed to

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:19.280
 support the use of these drugs but okay so the substantia nigra is part of the

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.920
 brain here that we're focusing on in Parkinson's that is the site of dopamine

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:32.320
 production now dopamine excuse me dopamine is I think I understand this

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.880
 right but I think the nervous system is pretty much wanting to be firing fairly

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.960
 constantly and dopamine actually controls that from happening ad hoc so

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.600
 that you don't get these sudden jerks etc and that dopamine allows through this

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:54.320
 inhibition the ordered movement of muscles in coordinated patterns it's not

00:35:54.320 --> 00:36:03.080
 a stimulant per se and it's it's integrated with the inhibiting systems

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:09.880
 so much more of a relaxant yeah in itself it is an activator but it runs

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:17.240
 into nerves that feedback with an inhibition right so when when somebody

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.000
 for example I think L-DOPA is supposedly the gold standard for want of a better

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 word of treatment and that within five years most patients using L-DOPA as the

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.760
 replacement for dopamine because L-DOPA dopamine doesn't cross the blood-brain

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:37.420
 barrier as far as I know but L-DOPA does and within the brain L-DOPA is converted

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:44.120
 into dopamine and then has an action directly but the long-term effects of L-DOPA

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.760
 are a condition called bradykinesia where there's involuntary

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:54.440
 movements like there is in a fine tremor a resting tremor because again there's a

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.080
 differentiation I guess without getting too medical there's a difference between

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.720
 intention tremors and resting tremors so resting tremors typically something you

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.320
 could see in the Parkinson's patients with either leg tremoring or the hand

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:11.520
 tremoring in the pill rolling fashion I always remember this from studying but

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.840
 they they talk about pill rolling tremor as one of the hallmark signs of classical

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:23.320
 Parkinson's so supplying somebody with L-DOPA to treat that tremor does

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:30.160
 initially have a positive beneficial effect but how is it I wonder that the

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.080
 administration of dopamine over a chronic period of three four five years

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.720
 actually causes worse symptoms than the tremor for which it was prescribed and

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.360
 most patients that use L-DOPA are in worse shape five years down the road

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.560
 than they are if they weren't treated I think the problem is that the whole

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:56.800
 theory of what L-DOPA and dopamine are doing is mechanistic and mistaken it's

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.240
 so they're just patching that is putting a little band-aid on it they're not

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:08.520
 treating the sensory input drug that is approved for use in Parkinson's is

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:15.920
 amandadine or memantine more recently and in the 19th century they were

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:23.200
 already using belladonna and hyocyamine and I call it nerd chicks to treat the

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:30.760
 tremors and they were pretty effective and didn't have bad side effects of

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:40.800
 increasing rigidity and so on that L-DOPA does and the it turns out that

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:52.640
 these amandadine and memantine have the anti cholinergic anti excitatory effects

00:38:52.640 --> 00:39:05.720
 but they are also anti excitatory in the glutamate ergic system the glutamate and

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:14.160
 cholinergic systems are both very powerful excitatory and the glutamate

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:25.280
 system ends up producing nitric oxide and the amandadine and the

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:32.840
 cholinergic memantine are not only stopping the the excitation that is part

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:41.680
 of the tremor but they end up lowering the exposure to nitric oxide and nitric

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:53.200
 oxide is a chronic stress-induced factor in suppressing mitochondrial respiration

00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:04.520
 and energy production and accelerating aging of the brain so using these

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:12.000
 approved drugs is it actually is giving insight into what's going on it to a

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:19.680
 much more global organismic process rather than just restoring the lost so

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:29.320
 called dopamine regulatory system it's restoring energy processes reducing the

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.960
 effects of stress in a systematic way okay you're listening to ask your

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:40.160
 doctor K. Medegaard with 91.1 FM from now until the end of the show you're

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:44.320
 invited to call in for any questions about this subject of endocrinology and

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.400
 Parkinson's disease if you live in the area the temporary number for the 707

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:58.000
 region is 383 9007 and the 800 number is 800 568 3723

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.160
 so I see the lights flashing here so let's let's take the first call and see

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.080
 where we're going caller you're on the air and what's your question hi I'm from

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.240
 the San Francisco Bay Area and I was wondering are there simple things that

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.920
 someone can do like a stepping stone to get out of learned helplessness for you

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.640
 know for people that are overcoming hypothyroidism and still find it

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.160
 overwhelming to do big tasks or big things what was the very first thing you

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.840
 said the stepping stone stepping stone to get out of the learned helplessness

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:33.720
 Dr. Peat do you think there is a progressive course that can be followed

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:39.080
 to get out what do you what do you suggest to increase sensory input to the

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:45.120
 brain oh and and to help get out of the learned helplessness painting

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:54.680
 behavioral things like going new places meeting new people doing very different

00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:01.120
 things that you've never done before but thought you might enjoy doing at the

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:09.200
 same time as you try to correct your your energy processes that are suppressed

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:17.520
 having more enjoyable more varied meals for example and making sure that your

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:25.320
 thyroid function is good I know you when I asked you what was it one of the best

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:29.320
 things I could teach our daughter or what's a good education for our daughter

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:34.040
 and you said introduce her to new people and she loves to meet new people and she

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:41.480
 gets so fired up okay so Dr. Peat I think just on the on the basis of that last

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:47.120
 call in terms of gosh new things I mean I think everybody I think arguably

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:51.720
 everybody would most people let's not say everybody that's too all-inclusive

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.960
 you know people I think have a bucket list of 20 things they'd like to do you

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.120
 know whether it's jumping out of an aircraft and with a parachute and I

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:08.960
 noticed just fast things or exciting things or going to new places I think

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.720
 outside of the scope of that because most people probably think they can't

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:19.120
 afford it or they have a time for it how do you think about creative

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.760
 outlets like painting and or constructing poetry or as long as that's

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.880
 not something you do every day anyway I'm just thinking of it as a construct

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:36.260
 that would be maybe more more easily attained rather than dr. Peat doesn't

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:41.600
 want to give a prescription here I can tell that I'm doing something

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:51.520
 unexpected out of the routine and some people actually quit their job and learn

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:59.480
 a new profession or trade okay let's get into some of the some of the things that

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:05.440
 I'd spoken with you about earlier that were things that are in keeping with the

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:11.560
 whole anti-inflammatory process that you're saying is all part and parcel of

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:18.120
 this breakdown so I guess mitochondrial function I'm getting pretty pretty

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:25.360
 interested about the whole approach to supporting mitochondria and whether it's

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:33.600
 coenzyme q10 or other kind of new nootropics and things like that I know

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.800
 you're not particularly keen on nootropics and drugs that supposedly

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.600
 enhance mental perfunction and or mitochondrial function because you you

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:48.200
 don't you don't really put a lot of value to it but in terms of mitochondria

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:53.960
 and and their obvious role in energy production and how energy in the body is

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.640
 at the root of paying for all the transactions how do you feel about

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:06.480
 mitochondrial support in the approach to a Parkinson's patient? Getting

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:14.280
 getting good rest is part of the support stopping unnecessary excitatory

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:23.280
 stimulation good stimulation should be fun rather than stressful and so not

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:32.160
 jumping out of an aircraft. Well unless you find that fun. That's stressful probably. Riding a roller coaster I mean that might be a little bit

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:38.800
 stressful it's fun right? Yeah everything that is anti-inflammatory can be

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:47.040
 relaxing as well as stimulating. Caffeine is extremely protective against all of

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:55.320
 the defects in Parkinson's disease and it activates while protecting the

00:45:55.320 --> 00:46:08.480
 mitochondria. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate which is in some plants like the passionflower

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:23.560
 yeah the tropical fruit what's it called? He was thinking you meant

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:32.580
 GABA. Oh well it's an activator gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Okay well the passion fruit or the

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:40.920
 liliquoi or what else? Passion fruit. The other name is grenadilla I think it's another name for it.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:49.640
 Yeah it's something we make along with GABA which which helps to eliminate

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:57.800
 stressful over excitation. The synuclein which is one of the things that goes

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:04.680
 wrong and is damaged in Parkinson's disease it happens to have the same

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:12.520
 effect as rotenone. Wow. The toxic thing that has been seen to cause something

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:18.600
 exactly like Parkinson's disease by blocking the complex one of the

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.840
 mitochondrion. So then all of the herbs that act on the GABA would be useful

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:32.480
 you're saying? Yeah and even cannabis has been because of its sedative effect it

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:39.240
 can be protective against the toxic types of overstimulation. And what about

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:50.240
 alcohol? Yeah I think it's an antioxidant can be anti-inflammatory and can be in

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:55.480
 the right circumstance it can be anti-inflammatory, anti-Parkinson's. Now how about this

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.000
 and the nicotine I think a fair amount of research showing that nicotine is

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.520
 actually protective significantly protective against Parkinson's in a in a

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:10.120
 big study that's been done. Yeah I think the population effect where they see

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:16.840
 that smokers have somewhat protection against Parkinson's I think part of that

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:25.160
 effect is that it relieves constipation it activates the intestine and that in

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.360
 the self has an anti-inflammatory and a toxic effect. Interesting. So what do you

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:38.240
 think is the best method for delivery of nicotine like making a tea? I think

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:47.400
 either absorbing it through the skin as in the form of an ointment or ingesting

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:53.640
 very small amounts of the leaf, the tobacco leaf. Very quickly I think while we're

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:58.700
 talking about tobacco I read an article today that's now saying that the vaping

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.880
 craze that's really starting to take off and reintroduce smoking to a

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.200
 younger generation is actually showing up with some fairly disturbing health

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:11.000
 effects kind of early days yet for the research to come through but they're

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.820
 actually saying that even could be even some even worse side effects to vaping

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:22.400
 than there would have been to smoking obtaining nicotine that way. So nicotine

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.080
 in its own right is not well I mean it's a neurotoxin for sure but it's not a

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.880
 good molecule but it's not the poisonous component in tobacco smoke is mainly the

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:35.760
 carcinogens correct and the tar but but nicotine can have some therapeutic

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:44.240
 effects. Yeah and keeping the intestine healthy because of the when

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:52.880
 endotoxin in itself reaches the nervous system it locally as well as

00:49:52.880 --> 00:50:02.080
 systemically activates processes that lead to the the same blockage of

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:10.480
 mitochondrial respiration that rotenone does or that ionizing radiation does in

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:19.120
 the chronic sense having cat scans of the head I think is probably part of the

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:28.120
 reason that Parkinson's prevalence has increased so greatly over the last 20 or

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.360
 30 years. Because they're pretty keen to give you cat scans for anything. Yeah.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:39.040
 Oh well it's a shame but I'm hopeful that in time things far less

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.880
 damaging will become more commonplace a little bit like the switching attitudes

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:48.640
 towards saturated fats from the long protected polyunsaturated have been

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:54.320
 shown to do so much damage. Now how about aspirin is another thing

00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:02.000
 mentioning the polyunsaturated fats one of the prostaglandins produced in

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:09.140
 substantia nigra is very toxic to the brain and simply having a regular use of

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:14.240
 aspirin will protect against that prostaglandin made from the polyunsaturated

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:21.600
 fats and the breakdown of the polyunsaturated fats acrolein is a

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.800
 very toxic material that we produce internally from the polyunsaturated and

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:36.560
 that is one of the things that turns synuclein into a toxic fibrous material

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.520
 sort of like the prions in mad cow disease. Interesting because now what do

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:47.800
 you think about this this concept that the I think I think I was reading that

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.800
 they haven't actually proved beyond a doubt that these Lewy bodies which do

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:58.720
 show up in a substantia on micro you know microscopical evaluation they may

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.360
 be or they may have a protective role I mean I think they've made them

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:08.640
 pathognomic and kind of diagnostic for the confirming Parkinson's but they

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.520
 they might actually have a kind of a protective role and I think somebody

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:19.840
 might be parking to get out of the way some of these synuclein fibrils and

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.880
 packing them up in little compartments that are relatively safe but some of the

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:36.880
 toxic fibrils of synuclein are known to be passed from one cell to another

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:44.800
 causing a damage to the cell that receives it. Well I wanted to ask you

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:50.480
 Dr. Peat when you were talking about this rapid movement and dream state you

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.480
 know for people who are developing Parkinson's or what about people who've

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:58.360
 had that for years and years and years is that not also a symptom of low

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.160
 thyroid because their their muscles just can't relax or is it the brain that

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:06.720
 can't relax so I'm trying to understand that a little bit better. It's the same

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:13.320
 thing nothing in the body can relax fully when your thyroid function is low

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:20.720
 that's one of the funny things that came out of the idea of the cell as a

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:29.720
 compartment enclosed in a membrane that the if you think of it as a corpuscle

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:36.520
 that has to be in a state ready to work when it's rested the state where it's

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:43.360
 ready to perform its job is a high energy state and that's the well-rested

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:51.480
 state full of energy ready to go. If you don't have enough of the thyroid and

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:59.640
 glucose and oxygen whatever to produce the energy you stay in a

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:10.640
 semi-contracted excited state so what happens in Parkinson's is this reaches a

00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:18.080
 chronically deadly cell killing condition in chronic hypothyroidism it's

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:24.680
 simply a nuisance that your sleep isn't as restful as it should be you can't get

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:32.120
 into the deep relaxing restorative sleep because you don't have enough energy so

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:37.920
 the cells are not ready to work they haven't accumulated the energy and

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:47.520
 structure needed to do a proper job and so they keep churning through the energy

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:54.360
 producing process without relaxing and storing up the energy as glycogen ATP

00:54:54.360 --> 00:55:01.640
 creatinine phosphate and so on. Okay well I know there was more questions

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:07.040
 surrounding things like the monoamine oxidase inhibitors the the A and B

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:12.560
 inhibitors and how they have been used with varying degrees but ultimately this

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.760
 condition doesn't have any real course of action for it other than trying to

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:24.340
 offset the symptoms as long as possible followed by palliative care. I would

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:28.120
 very much like to carry on this subject next month just to break down some of

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:33.640
 the things that are definitely shown like lack of testosterone is definitely

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:39.800
 shown and ameliorates makes better the symptoms of Parkinson's reducing

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.760
 estrogen because estrogens are kind of very inflammatory and kind of anti

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:51.080
 anti restful type organism molecule I know there were plenty of other things

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:55.080
 and as usual I'm sorry we only got one call I didn't really plug too much for

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.200
 people to come on the air but I kind of been a bit a little bit selfish this

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:02.680
 month maybe next month if you're able would you be willing to carry on with

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.280
 this? Oh yeah. Great I really appreciate that well for those people who've

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.880
 listened to the show thanks so much for your time Dr. Peat. Okay thank you. For those

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:15.840
 people who've listened to the show thanks so much for either calling in

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:20.480
 like you have and or listening we know that I get a such a lot of feedback from

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.200
 people I get it every week from people they just write me and they come from

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:32.160
 all over not just a guy from Norway or you know Finland yeah they come from all

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.520
 over so I get emails from people from the UK I get them from South America I

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:39.760
 get them from from Asia even you know so they listen all over the world and I

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.880
 think it's very important that it's a resource that we freely make available

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.560
 KMUD makes it available for you to download this podcast after that show

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.560
 hours on the audio archive and on our website I'm compiling what's turning out

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:58.840
 to be a pretty big compendium of Dr. Peat shows so until the third Friday of

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.960
 next month we'll carry on with endocrinology as a bigger section anyway

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.280
 going over all the rest of it in the months to come but we'll try and wrap up

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:10.880
 the Parkinson's debate next month and then Dr. Peat has other suggestions that

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.760
