00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.280
 Nothing is more expensive than bad information.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.040
 Know the source.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.040
 One Radio Network dot com.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.480
 Okay, here we are.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.800
 We're back with our second show this morning.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.680
 And on the third Monday of the month, it is Dr. Ray Peat at 1030 Central Time.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.240
 Dr. Peat is on the telephone here.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.400
 He doesn't have the whole camera thing, so we'll just do the telephone, which is fine

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.600
 because the most important thing is what the gentleman has to say with all his massive

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.040
 amounts of research that he has done.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.040
 He's a PhD.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 He got the PhD long ago from the University of Oregon.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.440
 He specialized in physiology and he started working with hormones back in '68.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.880
 Dissertation on that in '72 and talked a lot about progesterone and hormones.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.520
 His main thesis is that energy and structure are independent at every level.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.120
 He's got a great website and we'll tell you about that.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.120
 And he's here.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.160
 Dr. Peat, good morning to you, sir.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.760
 Good morning.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 How are you?

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.320
 What's going on in your life?

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.360
 Oh, I'm working on two or three new articles right now.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.800
 I learned that Gilbert Ling had died last summer and he's been such a big influence

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:48.800
 on my work for 50 years that I decided to write a little article introducing his ideas

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:57.720
 to people who don't get in the usual public media.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.760
 And Gilbert Ling, what was his specialty?

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.400
 Cell physiology.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:19.000
 He came over from China on a scholarship in the 1940s and very quickly developed a new

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:30.520
 kind of cell electrode, a very microscopically fine tip that will go into an individual cell

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.600
 to allow you to measure the voltage of just one tiny cell.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:47.320
 And that's named the Ling-Girard microelectrode, named after him and his thesis professor.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:59.080
 And despite being the first person to have the technology for measuring the electronic

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:08.120
 condition of a single cell, his observations were contradictory to the dogma that had been

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.720
 established already in the 1930s.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:26.640
 So ever since then, 70 years, his work was simply not recognized, even though he answered

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:37.680
 all of the objections that people could possibly make and showed that the whole picture of

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:46.680
 the cell that sixth graders get in their textbooks and the medical students get in their textbooks,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.920
 it's all a big fantasy.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:58.320
 He disproved all of the parts of this picture of cell physiology.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:07.960
 And how did his work then really affect, say, what you did or what we know then about health

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.200
 and how the body works?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.480
 I mean, what was the big takeaway from that?

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:25.040
 I was starting out taking courses to work in nerve biology or brain physiology, and

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:34.480
 discovering his work within the first weeks of starting to read the history of cell physiology,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:42.760
 I realized that my professor was basically talking about fantasies, and so I dropped

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:53.080
 out of the brain end of the biology research and looked around for people who were closer

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.520
 to the actual facts.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.600
 And I found that the extreme other end of the organism, the reproductive system, where

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.520
 you can look at one cell at a time, the fertilized ovum, the very beginning of the organism instead

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:19.400
 of the highest, most complicated organ, it was easier to talk objectively about the physiology

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:27.600
 of a single cell rather than the complexities of the mature brain.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.240
 And it happened that the professor working on reproductive physiology wasn't a high-powered

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.600
 prestige seeker.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:48.560
 And so when I made observations that were contrary to textbook doctrine at the time,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.000
 he said, "Well, is it reproducible?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.720
 And if so, go ahead."

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:02.960
 And if I had chosen to work with the first professor on nerve biology, he would have,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.840
 for example, in describing some of his research, he said, "Well, first we threw away the bad

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.880
 data, and data are data.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.960
 You have to explain them away.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.960
 You can't just throw them away."

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:29.720
 And what he meant was observations that didn't fit the dogma had to be discarded.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:39.640
 And when I was working in his lab, I had one of the microelectrodes inside the cell, and

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.880
 moving it around, I showed him that there were different electrical potentials within

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.080
 a single cell.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.200
 And as soon as he saw it, it was like he had been electrocuted.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:59.840
 He jerked away, and I never talked to him again.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.600
 The visualization of what seemed impossible to him, he simply couldn't direct his eyes

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.000
 in that direction anymore.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:21.600
 So I came to see the biological world from Ling's perspective, and from that perspective,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:28.720
 it's a giant business structure that doesn't care about the details of reality as long

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.480
 as it can be turned into profit.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.920
 Kind of like modern life these days, huh?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:48.920
 Yeah, the pharmaceutical industry really drives biological research and sets the rules.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:59.920
 Do they do that, Dr. Peat, on a very deep level at the medical schools and in that area, right?

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:07.760
 And medical schools, universities in general, are depending on private funding more and

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:17.440
 more, and medical schools are hugely directed by the pharmaceutical industry.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:25.520
 About 50 years ago, I saw some horrible biased research coming out of Yale Medical School,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.960
 and I wrote the dean and asked him how much research were they getting from the estrogen

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.960
 industry.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.520
 And instead of answering me, the dean wrote a letter and said he was insulted that I would

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:50.920
 imply that money would influence their research, but he wouldn't tell me how much money was

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:59.880
 accounting for their very distorted picture of what estrogen does.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:09.600
 Another school that I looked at, in this case Southern California University, USC, I was

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:19.680
 able to get some idea of their funding, and it was about 99% estrogen and almost none

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.920
 supporting progesterone research.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:32.560
 Everyone in the department, it looked like, was saying something favorable about estrogen

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.640
 and only unfavorable things about progesterone, because that's where the money was.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.080
 Yeah, wow.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:47.680
 Do you often see people that do well when they take a little extra progesterone?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:55.200
 Yeah, both men and women equally depend on progesterone.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:03.840
 It's a massively important brain hormone, 10 times as much in the brain as in the blood,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.280
 and men's brains have just as much as women's.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:18.520
 So it's basically a pharmaceutical industry fraud to call it the pregnancy hormone.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:25.280
 And we get too much estrogen just from modern lifestyle, the diet, and whatever?

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:33.520
 Yeah, and if you gain too much weight because you're eating the wrong foods that suppress

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:43.520
 your metabolism, or if you're injured or stressed, any tissue of your body can make estrogen.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:51.200
 So even if your ovaries are taken out, for example, in rat studies, thousands of articles

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.880
 have been published saying you take out the rat's ovaries and you have a rat deficient

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.800
 in estrogen.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:07.080
 But no one measured it until finally a couple of groups decided to see what happens to the

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.140
 rat's blood estrogen when they take the ovaries out.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.140
 Nothing happened.

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:20.520
 The estrogen went up slightly, because if you take out the ability to make a little

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.640
 more progesterone in the ovaries, that is a stress, and the body under stress makes

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.000
 more estrogen.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.680
 So the whole dogma about what menopause consists of, it really is a failure of the ovaries

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.640
 to produce enough supportive progesterone to support the brain.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:53.280
 And in that situation, you're deficient in progesterone, leaving the body in stress,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.840
 and in stress it makes more estrogen.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:08.440
 And since estrogen under stress tends to deposit inside cells, measuring it in the blood is

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:18.840
 useless because the body has to have progesterone to release estrogen from inside the cells.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:30.000
 And researchers in Sweden, Batra was the man's name, who did some of the first research showing

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:39.240
 that when an animal seems to be deficient in estrogen, if you give it progesterone,

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:47.280
 suddenly the enzymes that allow the estrogen to be released from cells will cause it to

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:56.120
 appear in the blood and be able to leave the body through the kidneys.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:06.320
 So the details of how stress increases estrogen and decreases progesterone have been known

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:11.720
 now for about 85 years.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:20.840
 Hans Selye was one of the first persons who started trying to define what estrogen is.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:32.400
 He said a big dose of estrogen imitates the shock phase of the stress reaction.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:43.040
 Shock turns off your ability to make energy and weakens, gives you a fast, weak heartbeat,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:51.360
 and all of the main functions fail.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:58.400
 That was what he saw as an effect of estrogen already in the 1940s.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.880
 Well, now with the lifestyles people have and everything going on with the internet

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.800
 and the world, you can see why there's so many problems with the ladies going through

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800
 menopause.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
 Unbelievable.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:19.960
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, a great researcher, as you can hear, he digs deep.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.960
 He's a PhD.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.600
 We're going to jump right in.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.320
 We have lots of emails and don't have an unlimited amount of time.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.280
 Dr. Peat, here's an ANIA.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:37.520
 She wants to know about endometrial cyst.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.160
 Can that be helped with thyroid medication?

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:52.440
 Thyroid and good nutrition will activate your liver to do what it should be doing, which

00:14:52.440 --> 00:15:02.200
 is to excrete every bit of estrogen arriving in the bloodstream to the liver so that whatever

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:10.400
 level comes in, the liver should be able to excrete it, some into the bile and some soluble

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:18.240
 into the bloodstream to leave via the kidneys.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:28.240
 Being either malnourished or low in thyroid means that estrogen accumulates in the body.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:36.600
 The tissues that primarily accumulate estrogen at the highest concentration are the uterus,

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.720
 the breast and the pituitary gland.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:52.720
 The chronically overstimulated endometrium of the uterus, it thickens and various things

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:58.640
 go wrong with it.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:07.000
 If you can establish a proper monthly cycle, then that should take care of it.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:15.520
 The cyst along with the rest of the endometrium should be sloughed off and start a new endometrium.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.800
 So the body just will let go of it.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.760
 This is from Jeff.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.000
 He's in Thar, Texas.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.480
 Dr. Peat said that he recommends drinking orange juice and milk.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.440
 Edgar Cayce said not to combine citrus with other foods.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.240
 Is he suggesting that he has orange juice and milk together?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:49.500
 Well, you shouldn't combine it with meat or an iron-rich food because it will make you

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:58.080
 absorb too much of the iron and it can react with the iron to produce free radicals.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:06.280
 But I don't know of any harm it does with milk, but still milk by itself is safe and

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.920
 orange juice by itself is safe.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.320
 But not necessarily together.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.480
 No, they don't have to be combined.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.280
 Mr. Kahn says, "Dr. Peat is recommend boiling greens and drinking the water for getting

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.120
 calcium and magnesium.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:34.320
 I would like to know how much I should have and how often, maybe in a week or so."

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:44.360
 That's a good supplement, but milk for example will normally provide enough magnesium in

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.880
 balance with calcium.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:55.600
 And if for example you're getting cramps or have some evidence that you aren't retaining

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:05.840
 your magnesium, then just an ounce or so of that concentrated water from boiling greens

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.720
 is enough to relax a cramp.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:18.040
 And again, thyroid is the regulating hormone.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:26.920
 If you need that magnesium supplement occasionally, that probably means that your thyroid function

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:36.520
 is low because thyroid is what makes your cells able to hang on to magnesium.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.560
 It helps you pull magnesium out of your food.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:49.040
 So if your thyroid is low, you have a very, very high requirement for magnesium to stay

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.200
 healthy and functioning.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:58.120
 But as your thyroid function gets normal, you can pull your magnesium out of foods like

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:04.040
 milk and fruit and meat and seafood and so on.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:12.000
 Lynn writes in, she's in Australia, "Could you please ask Dr. Pede if protein and sugar

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.880
 is best not eaten with starch?

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:23.160
 What amount should be left between starch and protein meals?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:28.840
 Does this recommendation mean that marmalade for example with tortillas or eggs with rice

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:35.080
 is best avoided and what foods would actually be considered to be protein or sugar like

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.240
 for this?"

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.400
 Marmalade is good with anything.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:55.540
 But the starches that can cause problems are combined starches of beans and overripe peas

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:01.840
 for example are starches that are hard to digest because they come with so many other

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.840
 compounds.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:14.960
 Grains that haven't been sprouted or turned into sourdough bread are harder to digest.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:26.980
 Those complex starches can feed bacteria and cause gas and bowel inflammation.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:38.140
 But starches as a pure substance, for example corn starch is relatively pure and if it's

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:49.560
 cooked it isn't so likely to cause bowel inflammation but still starches, they amount to pure glucose

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.060
 if they can be digested.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:21:02.620
 So the so-called glycemic index of a starch is the very highest thing just like pure glucose

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:12.900
 solution and that means that per calorie it's more fattening than sucrose, the sugar of

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.900
 fruit.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:24.380
 That's one of the reasons that I say it's good to emphasize fruit and the sugar in fruit

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:30.660
 rather than grains and their starches because those starches not only are fattening but

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.300
 they're tending to feed bacteria in the intestine.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:41.140
 She was wondering about, she thought she heard you say that you like cheese maybe with tortillas

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.220
 and she said what is it about cheese that makes it okay with starch since it's pretty

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.140
 high in protein?

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:54.060
 Well it's the tortilla which is a modified starch.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:22:01.740
 The Chinese and Central and South Americans many years ago, the Chinese probably 3,000

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:16.620
 years ago discovered that if you cook a grain in lime oxidized calcium compound or potassium

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:30.220
 hydroxide from ashes of vegetation, those caustic alkalis digest the grain, destroy

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:40.700
 the things that make it indigestible, turn the potentially toxic balance of amino acids

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:49.820
 that could create pellagra if you have the corn-based diet for example, convert those

00:22:49.820 --> 00:23:01.620
 into vitamins so that tortillas are very rich as a source of calcium and niacin and very

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:08.620
 easy to digest because the corn and the proteins have been partially digested already.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:21.180
 So nixtamalized corn, the kind used in hominy, tamales and tortillas is not like any of the

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.580
 other grain starches.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:29.300
 Dr. Ray Peat is with us, he's here on the third Monday of the month, Patrick Timpone

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.300
 on Radionetwork.com.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.560
 We're going to do a little show on money with Fred Dashefsky on Wednesday.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.860
 We have a couple of other things in the works.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:47.980
 Dr. Peat, before our first break here, I thought I'd ask you about your personal theory or

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:53.620
 take or do you think this coronavirus thing, have you looked at it?

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:59.060
 Do you think it's going to get bigger and bigger here or do you think it's going to

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.060
 fade out?

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.620
 Do you have any opinions on that?

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:08.020
 If the CDC and the pharmaceutical industry and the World Health Organization have their

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.900
 way, it'll get really big business.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:24.100
 But so far, it looks like it's very similar to the old coronaviruses, possibly as much

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:40.140
 as 50%, maybe twice as virulent as the average, but every variety of flu is a little different.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:49.980
 The average flu, about 1% of the people who catch it are already very sick and so it will

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.860
 kill about 1% of the infected people.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:03.060
 This one is killing 1.5% or 2% of the infected people, so it is a little worse than the average,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:08.260
 but still nothing very worrisome.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:20.420
 It should be contained, but the World Health Organization and CDC use these, blow them

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:28.500
 up as gigantic world-ending dangers to sell more vaccines.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.580
 So they'll come out in a year from now and say, "Well, we have a vaccine for this or

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.020
 that now so you can get..."

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:44.540
 Yeah, and the trouble is that those vaccines won't have been tested for safety.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:55.580
 Going back to the 1970s and the swine flu vaccine, those vaccines weren't tested and

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:05.420
 in fact, they caused vastly more deaths than the swine flu, many times more deadly and

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.940
 thousands of people were paralyzed.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:17.780
 Hundreds, I don't remember the exact number of deaths, but it was, there were only, in

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:25.820
 the United States, there was one death blamed on the swine flu and basically it was an epidemic

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:30.260
 of virulent vaccine vendors.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.180
 My goodness.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.540
 Stay right there, sir.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.780
 Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com with Dr. Ray Peat.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:45.100
 Hope you enjoy the show that we have Dr. Peat and we have people on all the time.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.800
 Every day we have something on.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.620
 Sometimes we're beginning to do archive shows on Tuesdays and Thursdays now.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:58.700
 Give me a little rest on Tuesdays and Thursdays to do some other things and then we're doing

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.580
 stacking up more shows.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.340
 Sometimes we'll do three shows, Monday and Wednesday, just to bring as many people as

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.820
 we can to you.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.900
 We always welcome your suggestions.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:09.900
 We get them all the time.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:16.060
 If there's somebody you'd like us to have on the show, just email me, Patrick@OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.220
 Patrick, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:25.100
 Previously with Brandon Amelani of Shen Blossom talking about our very special ginseng.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.660
 And you don't want something that's been corrupted coming into your body, like the ginseng is

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.420
 a super important example of that.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:37.100
 You know, when you're using aggressive alcohols and solvents, it has a strange effect with

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.540
 ginseng in the sense that when you're not only over processing it, but putting it in

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:45.340
 really aggressive alcohols, what's going to happen is that you're going to flip the chemistry

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.860
 on some of the androgenic.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.340
 Naturally it's androgenic.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:56.580
 It's going to basically protect the telomeres and add life to the body and protect the genetic

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.700
 replication of the cells, but it's also going to boost the androgens and boost the male

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.700
 hormones in the body.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.860
 But if you incubate it in a really aggressive alcohol, it flips those to become estrogenic.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.300
 Now estrogens, phytoestrogens are not necessarily bad in balance, but you really don't want

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.700
 that with your ginseng, especially if you're getting like a really high quality, a really

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.740
 old root, something that's very special.

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:22.340
 You want to like treat it with care and make sure it's delivering what ginseng has to offer.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.780
 Just a short clip from Brandon talking about the way they do the ginseng, just to give

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:32.300
 you a better idea of where this company is coming from, the quality and the ethics.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:40.700
 Brandon and the Shen Blossom link on OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:48.420
 You've heard us talk about this really terrific sauna that we have.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:53.780
 Just a relaxed far-infrared sauna.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.700
 The more I think about it and I look at the ones out there, and I've looked at a few of

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:05.380
 them, I think this is one of the best choices ever that you could make for a sauna because

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:14.740
 of its effectiveness and the cost and the ease of use that you get with this sauna.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:20.180
 Very quiet, low EMFs around your feet.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:27.140
 You know, it has some magnetic energy in your feet and your calves and things like that.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:35.220
 But no RF, no real electromagnetic fields to speak of, anything, nothing to really concern

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.540
 yourself about.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.220
 They get very, very hot.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:45.940
 You'll sweat a lot and you can use only one of the units if you like at the bottom, the

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.060
 right and the left side.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:53.060
 And then just get like half the heat and even do it for a longer period of time.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:59.140
 It's very good for the sympathetic, parasympathetic balance.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.980
 With my little kind of things I've been going on with my sleep, it's really been helping

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:12.060
 me a lot sometimes just to get more relaxed, something is going on subconsciously or in

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.060
 the tummy or something.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.340
 But it's a very powerful unit.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:26.860
 If you'd like to get one, you just give me an email, patrick@oneradionetwork.com, patrick@oneradionetwork.com,

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:35.460
 and they're $1,150, $1,150, and I think you'll enjoy it.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:42.180
 Good people, great product that's made in Taiwan, a medical university in Taiwan, and

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.340
 they've won several awards as well.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.140
 So no plumbing or anything like that.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:54.100
 You just got this silver material, which is antibacterial.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.020
 You can see on that picture there that I showed you.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.020
 They're really nice units.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.180
 I think you'll enjoy it.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.500
 If you got it in your budget to get one, just email me and we'll hook you up.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.500
 Patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.500
 We are listener supported.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.500
 One Radio Network.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.180
 Well, it's February 17th, and I hope you had a good weekend.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:24.180
 Dr. Ray Peat is here on the third Monday of the month, and that's at 10, what do we do?

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.180
 1030 Central Time.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.140
 I'm getting my times messed up.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.940
 Your main website is, I don't have it up right now, so it's drpeat.com.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:34.940
 Is that correct?

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.940
 Drpeat.com.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.940
 Hold on.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.940
 I'm sorry.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:38.940
 I had the wrong, it's drpeat.com?

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.140
 Oh, just raypeat.com.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.140
 Raypeat.com.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.140
 Yeah.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.140
 You're doing the newsletter.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.140
 You do that every couple months, right?

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140
 People want to get on your newsletter list?

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.140
 Yeah.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.140
 A subscription is for two years, 12 issues every other month.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.140
 Every other month for two years.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.140
 They can do that right on your website.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.140
 Okay.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.140
 Not on the website.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.140
 You can do it on the website.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.140
 Okay.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.140
 I'm sorry.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140
 I have a question.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140
 Dr. Ray Peat, I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.140
 I'm sorry.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:58.140
 I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.140
 I'm sorry.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.140
 I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.140
 I can't hear you.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.140
 Okay.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.140
 I'm sorry.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.140
 I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.140
 I'm sorry.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.140
 It's a...

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.140
 Email for that is raypeatnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.140
 Oh, that's right.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.140
 Yeah, sorry.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.140
 Raypeatnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.140
 Sorry.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.140
 Wow.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:38.580
 Does Dr. Peat have any ideas on what I could do for narrow, closed-angle glaucoma?

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:46.180
 Is making a hole that is commonly recommended in the iris a safe thing to do?

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:52.580
 And is it possible to reverse some of the damage from glaucoma?

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:56.060
 Yes.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.900
 Your physiology is...

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:09.220
 This physiology increases the pressure in your eye somewhat like the blood pressure.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:19.620
 And some of the same things that will lower your blood pressure will correct the glaucoma

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:31.660
 symptoms, redistributing, improving the circulation to your interior of your eye.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:41.420
 Thyroid and progesterone are the main hormones balancing the fluids.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:49.420
 The angiotensin system, you've heard of the ACE inhibitors?

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.460
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:34:04.740
 That system will, if you correct that, you don't have to use the drugs specifically,

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.100
 although those drugs do affect the pressure in your eye.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:19.140
 But improving the balance of your thyroid and progesterone to the stress hormones, estrogen,

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:32.180
 and serotonin will improve the pressure in your eye and the function of the nerves.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:42.180
 Some of the articles on my website relate to that, but it's something that takes some

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:50.500
 attention and frequent measurements of the pressure to see how it's changing.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:35:05.620
 The surgery to punch a hole in the iris, the use of a laser is considered the best technology,

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:15.820
 but any injury to tissues in the eye has the risk of increasing the pressure in your eye

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.100
 with potential harm.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:26.980
 It's good to investigate the known side effects of laser operation in the eye.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:33.380
 Do you think it's possible that we have some kind of infections going on with the glaucoma

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.820
 and cataracts, some people are suggesting that?

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:50.820
 Yeah, there's always a change in your bacteria load, but that interacts with your whole physiology

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.660
 and your hormone balance.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:36:05.300
 So very simple things like avoiding the indigestible foods, irritating and allergenic foods that

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:14.060
 cause inflammation, those cause a bad balance of bacteria and the bacteria that normally

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:21.460
 live in other compartments such as the lungs receive signals from the bacteria in your

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:28.940
 intestine and so they aren't just harming your intestine, but they're sending signals

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:33.660
 doing things such as increasing your eye pressure.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:44.780
 And if some of those inflammatory signals, if they're active inside your eye, the lens

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:52.540
 depends for its nutrition on the constant flow of liquid through the substance of the

00:36:52.540 --> 00:37:01.580
 lens, it's permeable and it's constantly pumping nutrition and oxygen through itself.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:10.140
 And so the same factors that can raise the pressure inside your eyeball can also decrease

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:19.900
 the flow of nutrition into your lens leading to the development of a swollen area that

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:27.780
 becomes opaque because it doesn't get enough energy, it can't keep regulating its water

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:36.060
 and salts and so it simply swells creating a blockage of the light.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.740
 You've done so much work with hormones and talk about it.

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:49.100
 I wondered, is there a simple kind of a test that men and women can take to really get

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:55.180
 a good overview of their hormones, their balance?

00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:03.180
 Life Extension Foundation now has some hormone panels for a very good price.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:13.060
 You can get maybe a dozen hormones special for men and women in different situations.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:21.080
 They have sales on usually in the spring where you get extremely good prices, just a fraction

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.060
 of what you would pay if you went to your doctor.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:27.020
 That's pretty good company, right, Life Extension?

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.020
 Pretty good organization?

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.620
 Yeah, pretty good.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.700
 And you do, is it a saliva?

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.700
 Is it a what?

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.700
 Saliva test?

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.700
 Oh, no, blood test.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.700
 Oh, it's a blood test.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:50.060
 Yeah, the saliva tests for certain things are very good but I don't think you can rely

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:55.900
 on the steroid hormone test like progesterone.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:06.500
 Saliva changes its composition, they're different emotional or even appetite conditions.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.860
 So blood test is the most reliable.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:17.860
 Here is a man in his mid-40s struggling for about 15 years with depression, sometimes

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:23.500
 using SSRIs but in later years they don't seem to do much for me anymore.

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.560
 I hate taking those things anyway.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:31.700
 Now I understand that Dr. Peat is no fan of serotonin.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:36.900
 I would love to hear his general view on the cause of depression and at least in my case

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:41.660
 related issues like fatigue, stress sensitivity and memory problems.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:47.380
 I appreciate your opinion.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:56.480
 The body temperature is very important and doctors instead of thinking about why it's

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:05.240
 changing, there have been publications in recent years saying the human body temperature

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:13.360
 that had been recorded as normal for more than 100 years, suddenly in recent years it's

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.600
 no longer normal.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:25.520
 Body temperature averages now well below 98.6 or 37 Celsius.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:33.800
 What's happening is the population is on average becoming sicker and hypothyroid.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:39.920
 The figures are showing that inflammatory diseases are increasing like an epidemic among

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.080
 young people.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:52.360
 The premature death incidence is increasing in young people just since the turn of the

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.240
 century.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:41:01.040
 Many things increased 40 years ago.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:12.640
 Those things seem to be contributing to increased incidence of all of the slowdown in function

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:19.000
 including depression and inflammatory diseases.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:27.440
 The first thing to check really is your temperature and heart rate and see if you're burning too

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.520
 few calories.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:39.280
 You should be able to at rest burn something like 2,000 to 2,400 calories.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:46.920
 Just your basal metabolic activity should be producing a lot of heat.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:55.840
 If your adrenal hormones and thyroid hormones are lower than average, your energy is going

00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:04.560
 to be lower and that makes everything stressful.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:15.000
 Serotonin is one of the fairly extreme indicators of a stress state, but serotonin is a universal

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.200
 indicator of stress.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:24.680
 It will turn on all of your pituitary hormones, for example.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:32.840
 Those hormones, serotonin and estrogen, are sort of like beating a tired horse.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:41.760
 They will increase some functions and make you feel better temporarily, but they're doing

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:51.760
 it at the risk of harming various vital functions.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:43:01.600
 Estrogen acts on the brain somewhat like cocaine to keep things excited all the way up to creating

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:07.000
 a seizure if it's too excited.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:20.560
 As the fever, as the energy production decreases, the brain shifts over to those emergency things

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.200
 to try to keep going.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:36.160
 Adrenaline, serotonin and estrogen rise as your thyroid and metabolic rate decrease.

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:47.240
 Those can either create mania, overactivity or depression and underactivity.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:54.240
 Keeping your thyroid up is the essential basic thing.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:03.160
 There have been experiments in recent years repairing the energy system without attending

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:11.080
 properly to thyroid using chemicals such as methylene blue, which will carry the electrons

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.720
 that the thyroid hormone should be carrying.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:26.920
 People have seen very great improvements, for example, in both depression and dementia,

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:34.520
 correcting the energy deficiencies that were causing the problems.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:41.480
 Methylene blue is just a poor chemical substitute for the active thyroid hormone, supported

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:47.160
 by things like DHEA, progesterone and pregnenolone.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.520
 All of those three steroids are brain hormones.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.240
 Here's an interesting one for you.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:45:00.520
 Does Dr. Peat know how to tell if a memory is a false memory?

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.920
 No.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:15.040
 All of our memories, we remember and put things together every time we remember.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:24.000
 The past is always with us as a potential and we have to put it together as a picture

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:32.200
 that represents what we have experienced.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:41.680
 So if you learn a new situation that you weren't aware of before, then you can create a story

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:51.880
 that explains what you now know to have been the situation.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:59.560
 So for example, if people thought they were growing up happy but then learned that their

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:08.120
 parents were doing something wrong, then they can create memories that explain what they

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:16.720
 now know to be true but that they didn't necessarily experience as they were going through it.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.720
 Interesting.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.240
 Now here's an eclectic email for you.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.680
 I'll see if I can read this properly so you can understand.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.880
 It's a little convoluted, but we'll get to it.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.880
 Let's see here.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:36.520
 "In past shows, Dr. Peat has suggested thinking of ourselves as autonomous creators.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:42.720
 However, since mitochondria seem to have a will of their own, which is for us to always

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:51.120
 be happy, as evident by how it is mainly cellular hypoxia which seems to be analogous to a lack

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:57.920
 of contentment, unhappiness, interacting with Poufers and iron to cause free radical damage,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.920
 loss of cytochrome c, degeneration, then does it mean that being a creator would mean that

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:08.840
 we are imposing personal will upon the will of the mitochondria?

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:14.360
 And if the will of the mitochondria is analogous to the will of God, then imposing personal

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.200
 will on God instead of doing God's will."

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.200
 Will.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.200
 Okay.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:26.480
 Well, I don't think of mitochondria as separate at all.

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:35.620
 They're reflecting the happy, active, energized state of the cell which we are experiencing

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:40.960
 when we're feeling happy and creative.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:49.720
 When we feel ourselves as whole and complete, that's because our body actually is functioning.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:58.640
 The nerves that are part of our present consciousness and feelings, those nerves are all the way

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.640
 through the body.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.480
 They're contacting individual cells.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:11.960
 There are these very fine filaments lying next to the individual metabolizing cells,

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:21.960
 and the nerves are interacting with those mitochondria and their energy metabolism electronically

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:29.840
 and oxidatively interacting so that every mitochondrion is in close communication with

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.360
 our central nervous system.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:44.560
 So we're an energetic, oxidizing whole with purpose and perspective on the universe.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:52.120
 So would you agree that it wouldn't be a stretch to conjecture that our state of consciousness,

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:58.300
 what we believe and what we think is real, and our state of consciousness is totally

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.760
 intertwined with every part of the body at any given moment?

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:08.520
 Is that fair, do you think?

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.280
 Exactly, yeah.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:22.280
 The picture of little compartments and machines, all of that, that's this medical, pharmaceutical

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.560
 myth that has created this machine-like picture of the body.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:36.600
 Really, it's a continuous functioning, smooth unit all the way from bottom to top.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:42.160
 Everything participates in our meaning and purpose.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:48.080
 So I wonder, just to take a hypothetical situation, Dr. Peat, if somebody has one, two, three,

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:58.120
 four, whatever, things going on that possibly just resting for a long time, believing that

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:05.080
 the body can heal and just watching that process, there'd be a pretty good chance the body

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.640
 could heal, couldn't it?

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.320
 Oh yeah, yeah.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.000
 It will, won't it?

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.760
 I mean, that's what it does.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:20.840
 And the things that happen around us can help us heal.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:28.880
 I remember once, years ago, when I had the TB, I was watching some Supreme Court judges

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:37.920
 talk, and I immediately went to measure my blood pressure within a minute of listening

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.760
 to them, and I think it was 168 over 110.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.760
 That's right.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.080
 I don't need to be watching it.

00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:50.960
 You'll get rid of your TB real quick with that.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:59.480
 And seeing possibilities open up can have the opposite effect of helping everything

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:07.200
 to heal, to come together in a functional way.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.920
 You read stories about instantaneous healing.

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.920
 I think that's what happens.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:22.880
 The body suddenly sees a perspective in which it can realize itself and stop being sick.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880
 Stop being sick.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:31.280
 I guess there must have been times in the past where this idea of resting to heal was

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.600
 taken more seriously than it is today?

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.800
 That used to be the basic thing.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800
 To heal.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:48.000
 Yeah, to lie down and stop eating the stuff that was making you sick.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 And rest.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:01.600
 Yeah, rest lets you redistribute your energy.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:07.480
 Mental rest is part of it, but then mental activity becomes part of the healing and recovering

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.600
 process too.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:14.920
 And I guess in many years gone by, even with having a baby, they would have the mom rest

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.640
 a lot longer than they do today?

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:28.680
 And just recently, someone was having a tendency to miscarry, and they said, "Wouldn't bed

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.680
 rest help?"

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.960
 It always did.

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:40.760
 Like I think Sophia Loren was said to have spent six months in bed to make sure she had

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.760
 her baby.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:50.520
 But recently, this person was told, "No, there are no controlled studies showing that

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.520
 it helps.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.520
 Therefore, don't do it."

00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:00.760
 You know, I don't know if any of the historical movies and plays and books are accurate at

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760
 all, but I'm just curious.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:07.240
 You know, two, three, four, five hundred years ago, when you just had, I guess just natural

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:12.120
 food, there were no chemicals, we had no pollution, we had no cell phones.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:21.520
 But it doesn't seem, if you go by the literature, that people lived all that long.

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.600
 We suppose that's about it, that's true.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.600
 Is it true?

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600
 No.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:33.920
 There have been areas and times when people had harder, shorter lives.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:43.560
 But the Roman Empire kept very good vital statistics.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:56.720
 So we know that during the age of 20 to 30, men had a fairly short lifespan because they

00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:00.040
 were always at war.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:09.000
 But the people who survived their 20s and the women, their lifespan, life expectancy

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:16.200
 was almost identical to 20th century Europe and America.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.960
 Into their 70s was the standard life expectancy.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.880
 Is it true that the Roman soldiers, they used to just, what did they do?

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.720
 Did I read where they knocked their teeth out because they always got their teeth knocked

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.360
 out in war and that would be terrible out in the...

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.360
 Is that true?

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.360
 And then how did they live?

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.360
 What did they eat?

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:47.640
 Some cultures have, for example, sharpened their front teeth to make them better warriors.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:58.400
 But I imagine sometimes they thought it made them, like the Germans used to put a sword

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.720
 cut scar on their cheek.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:08.720
 I imagine knocking out the front teeth could make them look heroic.

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:12.900
 What are some things that Dr. Peate might recommend to help detoxify the body of a chronic

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:22.080
 mold infection and then get after the hormone imbalances that it has caused?

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:28.720
 For an internal fungus infection, for example, a little bit of flowers of sulfur, just a

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:39.080
 pinch, two or three hundred milligrams, taken orally for two or three days will suppress

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:53.000
 the candida type fungus and some of the bacteria too and even some parasites.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:04.200
 What happens is a fungus secretes enzymes that convert the inert yellow sulfur to hydrogen

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:11.840
 sulfide locally, which is toxic and poisons the yeast.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:19.480
 But in the concentration that just diffuses into the intestine, that small amount is an

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:27.320
 antioxidant, so it's very safe to the intestine but toxic to the fungus.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:37.920
 The sulfur soap or dusting of yellow flowers of sulfur can be used on the skin as an antifungal.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920
 Very effective.

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.200
 Just about 200 milligrams for two or three days and that's it?

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.200
 Yeah.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.880
 That's flowers of sulfur.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.820
 That's different from the sulfur that we promote, right?

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.880
 This is yellow flowers of sulfur, right?

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.880
 Yeah.

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:59.080
 It's a very fine powder because it's made by precipitating it, not by grinding it.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:03.200
 Ground milled sulfur doesn't work.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:10.020
 Please ask Dr. Peat, this is from Amy in San Diego, if it is important only to eat organic

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:14.960
 grass-fed beef liver or is it okay to buy regular beef liver?

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.920
 And his feedback on anything he may have to say about that.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:28.720
 I never worry about organic liver because partly it's hard to find.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:35.260
 You can get it by mail order frozen, for example, but the liver, there were experiments years

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:44.560
 ago in which they analyzed commercial animals before they were slaughtered and then they

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:52.100
 looked at the urine, the blood, the steaks and the liver and all of the animals were

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:59.740
 contaminated with agricultural chemicals coming in, in their urine and blood and they found

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:10.620
 that in the muscles, it was coming out of the muscles even 24 hours in isolation.

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:17.140
 It was still coming out of the muscles and showing up in the blood and urine, but when

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:26.820
 they checked the liver, if there had been 24 hours isolation from those chemicals, the

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:35.580
 liver was able to capture and destroy them so the liver was the cleanest organ in the

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.580
 whole animal.

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580
 That's interesting.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.580
 Wow.

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:48.580
 Amy goes on to say, "I urinate every couple of hours, almost all the time and a full bladder

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:53.980
 and can this be a thyroid issue?"

00:58:53.980 --> 00:59:02.220
 When your thyroid is active, you're burning calories, maybe 2,500 to 3,000 calories a

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:07.540
 day if you're active.

00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:16.100
 If you're burning, say, 3,000 calories a day, you will be breathing out about three quarts

00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:29.100
 of water every day and that means that if you eat moist food and drink three quarts

00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:36.620
 of water, you won't have much left over to eliminate as urine.

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:43.460
 But if your thyroid is very low and you're burning only 1,000 calories a day and you

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:52.100
 drink two quarts of water, then you're going to form more than a quart of urine because

00:59:52.100 --> 01:00:02.860
 your metabolism is not vaporizing the water and blowing it out in your exhaled air or

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:06.180
 evaporating from your skin.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.660
 From Michael, he says, "How does Dr. Peat keep his skin moisturized during the dry winter?

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.540
 What topical substances could be used to prevent dryness?"

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:22.820
 For one thing, in the winter, you shouldn't bathe excessively.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.740
 Soap will dry your skin.

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:33.340
 In the winter, indoors in a cold climate, the air is very dry and so you want to, as

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:40.460
 much as possible, preserve the oils formed in the skin protectively.

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:46.780
 Too much washing is simply damaging the skin.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:52.220
 Second part, he says, "What are the safest antihistamines to take for seasonal allergies?

01:00:52.220 --> 01:01:00.300
 I have arrhythmia and a lot of first-generation antihistamines can induce long QT syndrome

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:04.900
 and increase the risk for cardiac events."

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:17.260
 Yeah, Benadryl, if you don't take it in excess, Benadryl is safe, especially if you're having

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.460
 itchiness on the skin.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:26.860
 You can use it topically and not absorb very much.

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:43.100
 The herb, the name doesn't come to me, but it's a stimulating herb, mawang.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:47.260
 Desert tea, ephedra.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:58.780
 The ephedra, I think, doesn't have that effect of creating a risk of heart stopping.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:08.220
 I think cyproheptadine, which reduces not only the histamine effect but the serotonin

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:12.100
 effect, I think that's safe for the heart.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:17.580
 E-mailer wants to know, "Is it okay to supplement with taurine?"

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.580
 With what?

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:20.580
 Taurine.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.540
 Oh, yeah, it's safe.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.060
 "You've spoken about various needs of the lungs.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.620
 Can you please suggest ways to help pulmonary fibrosis?

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.620
 All inhalers and meds have no effect so far.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:43.620
 I've looked at red lamps, MSM, and homeopathics."

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:57.020
 Yeah, fibrosis anywhere is something that can be prevented and to some extent remedied.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.700
 Fibrosis of the heart, for example, leads to heart failure.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:13.580
 Fibrosis of the liver and kidneys, those all have a common hormonal cause and the lungs

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:27.020
 are just an area that fibrosis is very noticeable because you have less and less ability to

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:34.980
 move the lungs and to have the oxygen diffuse through them.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:46.540
 In animal experiments, one dose of estrogen was enough to eliminate 95% of the oxygen

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.180
 getting through the lungs.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:59.060
 Estrogen creates a condition of effective oxygen deficiency by wasting oxygen and it's

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:07.740
 the oxygen deficiency that leads to the collagen formation and the development of fibrosis

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.420
 in any tissue.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:25.900
 The same hypoxia leads to the angiotensin which tightens blood vessels.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:32.420
 It will create the pulmonary hypertension.

01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:38.020
 It's very similar physiology to the fibrosis of the lungs.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:48.540
 The tightening of the blood vessels stresses the right side of the heart and leads to one-sided

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:52.340
 heart failure.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:05:03.740
 The drugs that have been found to specifically interfere with that angiotensin tightening

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:13.740
 and fibrosis process, they are approved as a treatment for high blood pressure but they

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.340
 are extremely variable.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:23.620
 There are probably 20 different drugs and you have to find out about the side effects

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.140
 of each of the drugs.

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:32.900
 They're widely prescribed but lots of doctors don't realize that they are protecting against

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.260
 fibrosis as well as hypertension.

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.460
 Excellent.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:45.220
 Amanda writes in that she has poor circulation in her hands and feet are often cold and I'm

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:50.740
 tall and thin, my hands are veiny and I'm wondering if this is a result of poor blood

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:55.180
 supply perhaps thyroid and deep tissue massage might help?

01:05:55.180 --> 01:06:02.860
 Thyroid and progesterone can have a big effect.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:13.740
 The estrogen besides creating the shock syndrome that weakens the way your heart beats and

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:23.860
 it activates the angiotensin that I was just mentioning in connection to the lungs.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:33.180
 It acts everywhere in the body and progesterone and thyroid are the main things protecting

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:43.140
 against angiotensin, fibrosis and vascular deterioration.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:49.660
 The bulging of veins on the back of the hands even though the fingers will be cold because

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:56.860
 they aren't getting enough blood, often the veins will bulge on the back and that's because

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:59.180
 they aren't getting enough energy.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:08.340
 They're in a shock-like state and I've seen progesterone make those veins disappear in

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.060
 less than an hour.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.060
 Really?

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.060
 Wow.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.500
 This is an interesting one.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:25.660
 Is it possible for stress or trauma to transform saturated fat into polyunsaturated fat?

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:41.900
 To a slight degree, those enzymes that desaturate saturated fats are responsive to stress, but

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:57.100
 I don't think it's anything harmful because if you start with a saturated fat, the polyunsaturated

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:05.980
 natural fats aren't nearly as toxic as the polyunsaturated fats that we get from the

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.940
 environment.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:18.220
 I think you've had Adam Bergstrom talking about the fats we make with our own enzymes

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:26.220
 don't go down that route to yellow fat disease or any of the PUFA diseases.

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:28.460
 That's what this second part is about.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.460
 Very timely.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:36.700
 After four years of reducing our polyunsaturated fat supply, what about lipofuscin?

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:46.900
 Are we stuck with this muck or can we get rid of our cells or at least some of it?

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:59.100
 Progesterone is a big help by blocking the estrogen that interacts with the PUFA to make

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.740
 that pigment.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:09.980
 Just by blocking those estrogen-dependent enzymes, like on a spot on the skin, I've

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:19.260
 applied progesterone and completely eliminated some of those typically senile brown spots

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.260
 on the skin.

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.260
 Just progesterone.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:26.460
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat about potatoes?

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:37.340
 I know he's recommended to eat them with plenty of butter or cream to slow starch absorption.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340
 How much butter?

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.340
 Are you talking about a lot of butter?

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.780
 Do you eat potatoes?

01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:41.780
 She wants to know.

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:46.420
 No, I haven't eaten potatoes for a long time.

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:55.060
 I did thoroughly experiment with the things that make them harmful.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:00.700
 If they're very, very well cooked, they're somewhat less allergenic if you happen to

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:09.180
 have an allergy to that family of potatoes, eggplant, peppers and potatoes.

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:16.460
 But when they're very well cooked, it just takes a little, like a pat of butter to a

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:23.060
 potato will protect against the preserption.

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:30.220
 So these allergies, are they a lifelong thing or do we grow out of some of these and they're

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:32.860
 centered in the gut?

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:44.100
 A lot of allergies nowadays, I recently saw on Robert Kennedy Jr.'s website, he mentioned

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:57.300
 that childhood allergies before the 1970s were less than 3% of kids had serious allergies.

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:05.780
 After 1989, I think he said it was about half of all kids have allergies.

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:13.300
 He was saying that vaccines are a major known cause of allergies.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:23.180
 I think there are many, many things that the culture and especially medicine are doing

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:29.900
 to pregnant women and kids that create the allergies.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.180
 We've had several vets on over the years, Doc, that conjecture that that's the same

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:38.420
 as well for the dogs and the cats.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:44.980
 The vaccines and the allergies they have to certain foods.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:48.980
 Couple more here.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.460
 Does Dr. Peat aware of a good source of pregnenolone?

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:58.780
 I know that there's been issues in the past with many sources of causing poor side effects

01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:01.780
 sometimes due to EXCIPEIENTA.

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.780
 Excipient?

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.780
 Excipient.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.780
 Oh, excipient.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.780
 Okay.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:06.780
 Excipient.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:07.780
 I should have known that word.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.780
 Yeah.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:22.420
 I think some of it has just been bad manufacturing impurities, not deliberate excipients, but

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:30.660
 just careless, incompetent manufacturing, I think, has left estrogenic materials in

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:41.300
 it because I've heard so many women saying that repeatedly every time they try several

01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:54.700
 different brands of pregnenolone, they get swollen breasts, uterine cramps, and PMS symptoms.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:13:02.380
 There shouldn't be any symptoms at all from good pregnenolone.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:11.460
 Simply in animal experiments over the years, it reduces any hormonal imbalance even in

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:12.780
 very large amounts.

01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:21.580
 It doesn't have any intrinsic hormone effects at all, but it will prevent cortisol excess,

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:22.580
 for example.

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:32.780
 Here's an email, Doc, with venous insufficiency, also known as venous reflux, enters the 60s.

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:41.140
 Would this condition be related to an imbalance or deficiency of progesterone or estrogen?

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:53.460
 The wall of the vein consists partly of smooth muscle, and when your energy is low, for example,

01:13:53.460 --> 01:14:05.500
 low blood sugar or hypothyroid as the root cause with low progesterone, the muscle is

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:14.580
 simply too weak to keep its normal diameter, and there are valves, flaps of tissue from

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:22.740
 the inside wall on each side of the vein, and so when the vein gets too big, those flaps

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.380
 don't meet each other.

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:31.860
 When you constrict it to a certain point, the flap on each side of the wall meets the

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:40.780
 flap on the other side, and you have a valve that prevents the blood from going back where

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.980
 it came from.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:52.700
 When you get, for example, enough progesterone in relation to the anti-progesterone effects,

01:14:52.700 --> 01:15:05.140
 which can be anything blocking energy use, including estrogen excess, then the pressure

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:13.340
 allows the vein to swell up so the valves don't meet, and just by getting your energy

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:20.420
 level back up with thyroid and progesterone, these veins will close up enough that the

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:24.100
 valves begin to function.

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.100
 Here's one for you.

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:31.060
 I have read that some people seem to shed more hair, scalp hair, while taking thyroid

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.060
 supplements.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.620
 Could you please ask Dr. Peter, is there any truth or science to this, and what would cause

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:40.460
 this to occur?

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:53.900
 There was a study in the 1970s in which someone had the antibodies needed to identify a real

01:15:53.900 --> 01:16:01.980
 thyroid glandular substance, and they bought 10 different brands from pharmacies in the

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:11.180
 United States that were sold as thyroid glandular USP supplements, and they found that of those

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:22.260
 10, only two of them contained thyroid substance, and eight of them were sold as thyroid but

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.780
 contained no thyroid.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:38.460
 I got one of those sold as thyroid and found that it contained only casein and iodine,

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:49.780
 an attempt to fool the USP testing because it contained protein and iodine, and that

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:54.380
 is all the USP requirement tested for.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:17:02.540
 They assumed that the supplier was providing an actual glandular material, and they used

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:09.540
 the iodine measure to indicate how much of the gland there was, but when there's no gland

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:21.940
 at all, the test can't detect that because it's looking only at the iodine and the protein.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:30.820
 My decision, without having to get antibodies and very expensive testing, I found that cats

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:42.220
 could tell the difference, and my cat loved real thyroid and would eat any quantity.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:47.860
 When I gave him other brands that were sold as thyroid, the cat looked offended and tried

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.540
 to bury them.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.540
 That's hilarious.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:57.020
 But that's not good for the cat to eat those, right?

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.020
 It didn't bother the cat eating those?

01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:00.020
 Oh, no.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:10.420
 I gave a friend a baggie with about probably 30 or more grains of thyroid in it, and her

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.660
 cat found it and ate the whole bag.

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.260
 I said, "How is he?

01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:17.260
 Does he look sick?"

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:20.060
 And she said, "No, he's just sitting there purring and smiling."

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:25.540
 Hello, thyroid man.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:31.020
 Can a 66-year-old woman take progesterone every day, without a break, every day of the

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:33.980
 month?

01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:44.340
 The liver adapts to a constant supply, and so usually the effect of a given dose is going

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:48.700
 to get weaker after using it for a month or more.

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:57.220
 And so just to keep the potency of it, it's good to stop it for a week every month.

01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:58.620
 A week every month.

01:18:58.620 --> 01:18:59.620
 Okay.

01:18:59.620 --> 01:19:04.380
 You've mentioned thyroid protects against androtension, writes another emailer.

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:10.440
 So can we help our thyroid?

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.440
 Can you help your thyroid?

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.940
 I don't know what they're asking here.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:18.100
 So can we help our thyroid?

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:27.340
 By keeping your meat intake lower and your milk, egg, and cheese intake as a higher proportion

01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:38.660
 of your protein for the day, that is less thyroid suppressive than too much meat or

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.700
 fish.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:50.820
 But often the trend, because of the polyunsaturated fats we've been exposed to increasingly in

01:19:50.820 --> 01:20:02.860
 the last 50 years, the proportion of the population who is hypothyroid has increased tremendously.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:13.820
 So the average person at the age of 35 or 40 will benefit from at least some thyroid

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:15.420
 in the diet.

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:25.860
 When people before 1940, people who ate sausages or chicken or fish, for example, were always

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.220
 getting some thyroid in their diet.

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:36.820
 The fish head was used for soup, chicken necks were put in the stew, beef and pork thyroid

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.660
 glands were put into sausages.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:47.580
 And so people were eating thyroid regularly until the US Department of Agriculture said

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:53.740
 it had to be sold to the drug companies to dispense under prescription.

01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.900
 So we all got a little thyroid.

01:20:55.900 --> 01:21:00.620
 Here's a final email for Dr. Ray Peat this morning, February 17, 2020.

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.900
 He'll be back a month from now.

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:10.500
 Hi, what does Dr. Peat think about drinking food grade hydrogen peroxide?

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.900
 It can cause serious burns.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:18.140
 Yeah, you've got to be real careful with that too.

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:30.100
 Yeah, I did enzyme experiments measuring the ability of a particular tissue or blood, for

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:36.220
 example, to oxidize, to dispose of hydrogen peroxide.

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:47.380
 And every time I did the enzyme activity curve, they would always, after usually about two

01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:53.020
 or three minutes, the enzyme would be killed by the peroxide.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:22:02.380
 So even the enzymes like catalase that are normally disposing of hydrogen peroxide, when

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:09.060
 you get just a little too much, the enzyme itself is destroyed and can no longer detoxify

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:14.380
 it, then it starts destroying other types of protein and tissue.

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:20.180
 Dr. Peat, do you have any experience over the years with using a nebulizer?

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.180
 You breathe?

01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.180
 Oh, yeah.

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:27.380
 As a kid, that was a common thing.

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:31.380
 A little tent and a vaporizer.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.380
 Oh, it's a vaporizer, not nebulizer?

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:41.380
 Yeah, the nebulizer is just a fancier way to do it.

01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.380
 Yeah, yeah.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:46.380
 Well, sir, thank you so much for being here today.

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:54.380
 Once again, I thought that email, isn't that email link on your website for your newsletter

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:58.980
 or that's just people have to know what that is?

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:04.380
 I don't think it's mentioned on the website, but it's rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:09.380
 Right, and we always put that on the show page for you, rayPeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.380
 All right, Dr. Peat, thanks a lot.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:15.380
 Happy February, and we'll see you next month.

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:18.380
 We appreciate your time this morning as always.

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.380
 Thank you.

01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.380
 Yes, sir.

01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.380
 Bye-bye.

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:25.380
 Really fun guy, man.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.380
 Remember all that stuff, all that research?

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.380
 Man, oh, man.

01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:35.380
 Well, I'm going to take a nap.

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.380
 I tell you what.

01:23:36.380 --> 01:23:42.380
 It was just -- well, I won't go into that, but I had a very difficult, very difficult

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.380
 night last night.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:48.380
 Nothing was happening, boy, especially in the sleep department.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:53.380
 Well, we're cracking the code on whatever is going on, but, you know, we'll see.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:54.380
 Appreciate your ongoing support.

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.380
 Oh, doodle.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:24:01.380
 All right, that's cool.

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:02.380
 Appreciate your ongoing support.

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.380
 Thank you so much for being there.

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:12.380
 We're going to take a day off tomorrow, and we'll have a nice show for you, an archive

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:19.380
 show in the back, do some things on money tomorrow and our Wednesday, and a couple other

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:21.380
 things are in the works that we'll have for you.

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:24.380
 So that's our show for today.

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:28.380
 Thank you for being here, and I love you all very much.

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.380
