00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Well, welcome to this month's August 2018 edition here of Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 We're calling live or we're receiving people live here from 7 till 8 p.m.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 The show runs every third Friday of the month.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 From 7.30 till the end of the show at 8 o'clock, we invite callers to phone in with questions about the topic

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 that's opened up for that month or if they have other questions related to Dr. Peat's expertise,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 they're also invited to call in.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Wherever possible, I'd like to stay on topic because I do get people from various forums commenting on how

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 sometimes some people's questions seem to take the thing completely off topic

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 and I know people really enjoy listening to Dr. Peat's wisdom and they possibly don't like too much

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 blathering on from other questions that take up a lot of time.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 But anyway, it's an open society and the program is run purely with the altruistic intention of benefiting people

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 with impartial advice and knowledge on how to find the truth in this situation in medicine.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 It's not always easy.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 923 3911 and the area code is 707.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 So if you'd like to call in with questions from 7.30 onwards, we'd love to hear from you.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 So 707 923 3911.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 My name is Andrew Murray and I studied a degree in herbal medicine back in England, graduated in '98

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 and have been living here in California since 2000 and run a business called Western Botanical Medicine

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 where my training in naturopathic medicine brought me to a love and appreciation of natural healing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Natural and organic, of course, two go hand in hand.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 And that brings me to the subject, the opening subject of tonight's discourse on critical thinking in academia

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 with relation to trials.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 But what I wanted to first open up with, and I will introduce Dr. Peat here in about five minutes

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 once I've just finished through the opening statements of this show,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 related to the latest court ruling on glyphosate's implication and its cancer-causing effects

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 that have been finally made public.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So everyone knows Monsanto probably, the big bad corporation, mega corporation,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 owning the seeds and patenting the seeds, owning plant material for the first time ever back in the '90s

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 when they genetically modified various species of very lucrative world-consumed products like corn and soy, etc.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 to provide to and protect the starving third world because it would provide these genetically modified plants

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 that would do better in drought conditions and which they could heavily spray with their own branded herbicide

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 called Roundup, of which the main ingredient was glyphosate.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 So I want to just open up by quoting an interdisciplinary toxicological paper published in 2013 about celiac disease,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 mentioning that celiac and the more common gluten intolerance being a growing problem worldwide,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 but especially in North America and Europe, where an estimated 5% of the population now suffers from it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, skin rashes, macrositic anemia and depression.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And it's a multifactorial disease associated with numerous nutritional deficiencies as well as reproductive issues

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 and increased risk to thyroid disease, kidney failure and cancer.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 And they propose that glyphosate, the active ingredient in herbicide Roundup,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 is the most important causal factor in this epidemic.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Fish exposed to glyphosate develop digestive problems that are reminiscent of celiac disease,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 and celiac disease associated with imbalances in gut bacteria

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 that can be fully explained by the known effects of glyphosate on gut bacteria.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Characteristics of celiac disease point to impairment in many cytochrome P450 enzymes,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 which are involved with detoxifying environmental toxins, and as well as activating vitamin D3,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 catabolizing vitamin A, and maintaining bioacid production and sulfate supplies to the gut.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Glyphosate is known to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 and deficiencies in iron, cobalt, molybdenum, copper and other rare metals associated with celiac disease

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 can be attributed to glyphosate's strong ability to chelate these elements.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 Deficiencies in tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and selenomethionine

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 associated with celiac disease match glyphosate's known depletion of these amino acids.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 In celiac disease, patients have an increased risk to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 which has also been implicated in glyphosate exposure.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Reproductive issues associated with celiac disease, such as infertility, miscarriages,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 and birth defects can also be explained by glyphosate.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Glyphosate residues in wheat and other crops are likely increasing recently

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 due to the growing practice of crop desiccation just prior to the harvest.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 We argue that the practice of ripening sugar cane with glyphosate may explain the recent surge

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 in kidney failure among agricultural workers in Central America,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 as written by the authors of this paper in, as I said,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 the Interdisciplinary Toxicological Report published in December 2013.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And a second source stated, "Analyzing samples from a 2017 prospective study,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 University of California San Diego School of Medicine,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 they found that human exposure to glyphosate, a chemical widely found in wheat killers,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 has increased approximately 500% since the introduction of genetically modified crops

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 like Monsanto's Roundup Ready corn and other 'terminator' species like soy, canola,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 alfalfa, cotton, and sorghum."

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 The term 'terminator' refers not to the movie by Schwarzenegger,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 but to the fact that these Roundup Ready varieties are sterile,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 and so farmers are locked into purchasing the latest seed source from Monsanto,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 holding companies instead of breeding their own.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And the FDA only recently started testing for glyphosate,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 this is interesting, a chemical that has been used for over 40 years in food production,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 which in and of itself is cause for suspicion,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 and it has only been on the California Prop 65 list since 2015.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 But it has drawn attention to itself over several decades from plaintiffs

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 whose occupation involved the regular administration of the chemical.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 And separately, FDA chemist Narong Chamkasam found

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 over-the-tolerance levels of glyphosate in corn detected at 6.5 parts per million,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 and an FDA email states the legal limit is 5 parts per million.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 An illegal level would normally be reported to the EPA,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 but an FDA supervisor wrote to an EPA official that the corn was not considered an official sample.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Chamkasam found glyphosate in numerous samples of honey.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Chamkasam also found glyphosate in oatmeal products.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 The FDA temporarily suspended testing after those findings,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 and Chamkasam's lab was reassigned to other programs.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 So how does science become corrupt, and how can we protect ourselves from corrupt science?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 So we're very pleased to have Dr. Peat with us here on the show.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Dr. Peat, you there?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Yes, hi.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Okay, well thanks so much for joining again.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 And for those people who perhaps have not heard of you or heard of your background to speak on these subjects,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 would you mind giving people an update on your previous history, your academic and research background?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 My biology study was, academically at least, was at the University of Oregon, 1968 to '72,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 biology and biochemistry, especially reproductive physiology.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 Since then I've been just continuing to study primarily with interest in nerve biology,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 reproductive physiology, and especially aging and how it relates to energy production.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Okay, so I know in the past we've mentioned this, some of your confrontations, as it were, within academia,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 and you've worked closely within the university institutions,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 and you've got first-hand knowledge of the chain of corruption.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Would you describe your experience in detail, this chain of corruption's command base and its strategy,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 and how this begins at the academic level and travels all the way through to final product and the ideology behind it?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Long before I went to the university, I had been interested in many biological fields,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 especially radiation poisoning from the various sources, especially atomic bomb testing in the atmosphere.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 As I got interested in the late '40s and all through the '50s in reading about what was available

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 before the atomic bomb took over the field and then after the government

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 and its Atomic Energy Commission began controlling the publication,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 I saw that anyone basically after sometime in the 1950s, anyone who was working in biology or radiation physics

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 who told the truth had a big campaign organized against the person.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 One of the first researchers who studied the harmful effects of radiation and got it into the media

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 found that X-raying pregnant women caused the fetus to be genetically injured

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 in a way that increased the rate of cancer in children.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 It took about 10 years for that to be somewhat recognized

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 and decreased the radiation exposure of pregnant women.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 But the government was essentially censoring everything that was published

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 and ruining the careers of all of the researchers who spoke out against the dangers of radiation.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 My main concern with an apparently very bright and confident biologist and physicist

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 who was speaking the government line was John Goffman.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 I considered him the ultimate in corrupt mouth-piecing for the government all through the '50s.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 And in the '60s, suddenly he described the event.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 He said he was talking to a group, speaking the government line,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 saying that we can't intervene to stop the bomb tests and exposing the public

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 because we don't know yet whether the radiation exposures will cause serious or lethal mutations

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 that might even kill the whole population from cancer at some point.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 He said as he was speaking, he realized that he was saying insane things,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 that he had been saying them for 15, 20 years at that point.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 But suddenly when that dawned on him that he was saying criminally insane things,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 he suddenly switched sides and began honest investigation of the effects of radiation on the organism.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Immediately his research money was cut off.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 He was fired and went into private publicizing of the problems for the rest of his life.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 He did very good work exposing the critterness all the way back to the way that the radiation exposure

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 to the atomic bomb survivors in Japan, the figures on that were completely falsified right down to recent years.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 The fake data has been put into the journals prominently.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 And one of the ways that they operate is for example, the radiation health journals,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 supposedly are scientists watching out for the public safety in exposing them to medical x-rays

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 or nuclear power plant leakage exposure and so on.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 These journals, all of them that I have known of, were basically owned by the nuclear industry.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 The public health organizations that are concerned with protecting the public,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 these are agencies of the industry, government, nuclear industry,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 work together to control the publication of safety information.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 When I was in graduate school, our lab working on reproductive physiology,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 the director decided we should have a course in radiation safety in case someone was going to work on isotope studies.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 So we went, the whole lab went over to Oregon State University where they had a full time radiation safety expert.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 And he and his graduate students did presentations on what we should know about radiation dangers and safety.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And I have never seen a university operate at such a low level as that radiation lab did at the State University.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 It's considered the land grant university.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 And the biology department is heavily influenced by agriculture, chemistry, herbicides, insecticides and so on.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 But apparently the nuclear industry got to them too.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 So maybe he wasn't being so safe with it, making it out to be a fairly harmless substance,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 perhaps that you shouldn't all worry about too much.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Basically, taking the line that there's a threshold below which it's totally safe or even beneficial.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't actually eat some in front of you just to show you how harmless it was.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Yeah. One of their main lines of argument is that in those small doses, it's supposed to be good for you.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 The Atomic Energy Commission called their project Project Sunshine.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 That sounds nice, doesn't it?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 OK, you're listening to Ask Herb, Dr. Kamey DeGarboville, 91.1 FM and from 730 to the end of the show.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 People are invited to call in the questions related or hopefully related to this month's subject of the truth within research and critical thinking.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 A lot of what I'm going to be asking here is based actually on Dr. Peate's recent newsletter about critical thinking,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 where he opens up discussion on many different topics that we've brought up in the past.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 And he's written about fairly prolifically from estrogen scandals, the SSRI scandals,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 various scandals around other well-known drugs that, you know, whether it's Viagra through to the ADD medications,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 which are essentially amphetamines for children and how these things actually come to market is quite untenable.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 But obviously, it's very successful. It's untenable when you think about it like a critical thinking person,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 but quite successful in terms of the cover ups that are made and the people that are paid off.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 And Dr. Peate, I wanted to question you specifically about several points of this, of which I understand you do have personal experience.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 I think that perhaps not the donor interest side of it, because you've not been a donor or received donor funding, perhaps,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 but freedom, you mentioned that freedom to do research is restricted by many and the same forces that shape publication.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 I think people need to hear this in terms of the mechanisms by which supposedly, quote, unquote,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 respected peer reviewed journal publications or prestigious publications, the New England Journal of Medicine or, yeah,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 some of the other publications that people will be fairly familiar with.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 How these publications come into being and the funding that is so lucrative and so seducing for both the editors

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 and other people in charge of the publications, how is this freedom to do the research?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 And it actually shapes the publication itself because of the ownership of the publication.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 It's the same thing, the same companies that control funding, even though it might be coming from the government and taxpayers.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 The culture is set by the industry and the government operating in the NIH, for example,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 are conforming to the beliefs that are favorable to the industry.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Gilbert Ling happened to have one person in the funding oversight branch of the NIH.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 His whole career depended on one person thinking that that objective research should continue in the area he was working on.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 But when that person retired, his funding was cut off.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 Same thing happened to the virus researcher.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 I can't think of his name right now. He was very famous as working in the retrovirus field

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 when he suggested that the HIV/AIDS so-called virus might not be harmful at all.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 His research money was totally cut off and he was ostracized.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 Even in something as safe-seeming as astronomy, a famous astronomer named Halton Arp was doing various studies of galaxies.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 He happened to photograph some galaxies that were obviously continuous.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 There was a band of matter between separate galaxies.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 There were no breaks in the line, but one galaxy showed a very different redshift from the other galaxy.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 You can't have a single object connected by a band of matter.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 You can't have one end of it going at a vast speed away from the other one.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 He found several of those connected galaxies with very different redshifts,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 which essentially proved that the idea that the redshift indicates acceleration away from the viewer,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 that concept must be wrong because single objects had different redshifts.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 So they cut off his access to the telescopes so that he couldn't ever use them again.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 He had to leave the country if he wanted to use the telescope again.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 You also mentioned things like these wars on various lucrative diseases.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 We've heard about the War on Terror and how that's been a complete failure,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 and the War on Cancer, another complete failure.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 These are basically brought to the front as a battle cry for funding, being a war,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 but they never objectively result in too much success.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 I can think of a number of conditions or diseases for which there's been a long time of potential time to find a cure,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 but which nothing really has been found,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 and which there is still a seemingly endless supply of funding to promote research into its discovery, into the cure.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 The people who want to wage those wars and convince the government to fund them,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 working in particular theories of how diseases work, whether it's heart disease and atherosclerosis,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 dementia or cancer, kidney disease, whatever major field they're working in,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 it always happens that the researchers love the line of research that happens to enrich the drug companies.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 They're always aiming at some solution that involves a drug that can sustain patients.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Definitely, they don't want to cure the patients at a low price.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 They want to develop drugs to keep the customers buying.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 And then also the other quote here, what I know you've said is completely erroneous science,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 and again I'm going to want to bring out a little later on that the information's been there

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 and was being followed six or seven decades ago,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 but was buried when corporations began to exert their financial clout.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 You mentioned the tumor-specific chemotherapy,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 the kind of tailored, tailor-made, personalized tumor-specific chemotherapy for particular cancers,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 and how you said that's completely ridiculous to think of it mechanistically like that,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 because it just does not make any scientific sense.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Yeah, the traditional approach to medicine, way back to the Greeks,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 they were looking for general principles that would go wrong and be correctable,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 and their approach was diet or exercise or herbs or particular drugs.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 These were designed to adjust the person's constitution

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 and make their physiology go in a healthy direction rather than a sick direction.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 That is still scientifically valid.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 It's really the only practical solution to all of these major degenerative chronic diseases,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 figuring out what it is as a general problem that causes basically everyone to go down one

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 or more of these degenerative pathways.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 But although it's the primary scientific problem in biology,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 that is constantly being attacked as unscientific.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 What they want is a mechanism that potentially leads to a drug,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 a specific drug for a specific mechanism,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 and preferably it will be so variable and unpredictable

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 that it will require a great diagnostic effort,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 more drugs involved to diagnose the particular brand of cancer or heart disease

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 or dementia that the person has,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 and then a particular individually designed treatment for that.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 If you're actually working on the idea that the organism is intrinsically whole and healthy

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 and that certain things are diverting it from the pathway of good health,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 that is where biological generality should be the basis of scientific thinking.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 But that competes and so it's considered pre-scientific or unscientific

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 if you try to look at the organism as a whole and something that can be supported

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 to make it either not get the disease or spontaneously recover from the disease.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Okay, let's hold it there for a moment, Dr. Peat.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 It is 7.30 and so from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 people that tuned in are invited to call in with questions

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 hopefully related to the discourse we're having about the "meaningful" research that's done

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 and the studies outcomes and how they are skewed and corrupted often,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 but how we can find good information that is objective.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 And I know we have a caller on the line, so let's take this first caller.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 My name is John from Buffalo.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Okay, John, what's your question?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 I actually was listening to a previous broadcast on endotoxins

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 and remembering Dr. Peat talking about the incredible falsified research

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 relating to fish oils and the seed oils back in the '50s or '40s.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And that particular show spoke about endotoxins in detail,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 and I was trying to ask a question actually about digestion,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 particularly as you age, get over 50.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Even if you eat like cooked vegetables, highly cooked,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 I know you've mentioned that's okay, or cooked meat,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 and then everything else dairy, which supposedly is easy to digest,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 my understanding is that enzymes from the foods,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 which are typically designed to digest them, are destroyed by cooking.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 So if your HCL or your digestive enzymes in the body are missing,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 it seems like no matter what you do,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 you're going to be more exposed as you age to endotoxins.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 I was just wondering what your view is on taking digestive enzymes

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 or HCL or pepsin or pancreatic enzymes,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 and how would you know which ones to take to try to optimize digestion,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 which would thereby reduce or minimize the endotoxin exposure

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 that is so prevalent, particularly with age?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 So Dr. Peat, how would you detail or I won't say diagnose,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 but how would you know that somebody was having digestive disturbance

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 or how would they describe that to you in such a way

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 as may make you feel they are compromised somewhat,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 and what's your view on digestive enzymes as a solution?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 First, two problems with products.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 The pancreatic enzymes are very much like our own enzymes

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 and can be very effective for someone who is deficient in enzymes.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 Stress and aging often slow down the digestive process

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 so they can benefit from using pancreatic enzymes.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 However, they are made from raw animal tissue.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 You can't get the enzymes out without sterilizing it.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 If you sterilize it, the enzymes are inactivated,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 so you take the risk of whatever infection the animal had.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 There are a couple of plant enzymes, papain and bromelain,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 which I think are pretty safe, but they only digest proteins.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 The non-animal enzymes that digest fats and carbohydrates

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 happen to come from a fungus,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 and there is the risk of allergens from the fungus with those enzymes.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 So I think the best approach is to keep your energy and nutrition up

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 so that your own stomach and pancreas and intestine and liver

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 produce the proper enzymes for digesting

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 and that you consider the chemistry of the plant.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 Some of the enzymes, if you chew a raw vegetable, for example,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 or a seed or a sprout, for example,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 these enzymes that are released are in many cases,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 their function is as a defensive enzyme for the plant.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 The plant doesn't want to be chewed up,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 and it can release toxins, for example.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 If you chew up raw bean sprouts or alfalfa sprouts,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 you can get a big burst of toxins.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 I think someone calculated that something like three ounces of alfalfa sprouts

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 would release a lethal dose of cyanide if you chewed them up.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 I guess I was thinking, based on studying previously,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 that you're talking about cooked vegetables being okay.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 So if I have root vegetables or different leaves

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 and you cook the daylights out of them for 40 minutes and they're really soft,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 then they become a good food, right?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 So the issue that you're talking about, I assume, goes away completely,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 plus the PUFA is taken out so that it has nutritional value.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Am I right?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Yeah.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 If you process vegetables properly, you can get very good nutrition out of them.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 But cows and goats, rubens, are designed to do that for us.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 And so milk and cheese are basically detoxified plant nutrition.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And to do that industrially, it's very possible, and there are people working on it.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 But to get all of the PUFA out is one problem.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 To get the right ratio of nutrients is another problem.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 Leaves, for example, have very good content of calcium and magnesium and other nutrients.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 So cows can thrive on a leaf-based diet because they have enzymes to detoxify the PUFA.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 But other parts of the plant have a bad ratio of phosphate to calcium and magnesium.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 And so you have to look at the ratio of type of fat and type of mineral.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 You don't want too much iron or too much phosphate or too much unsaturated fat.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Those are pro-stress, pro-aging chemicals.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about the--as we're talking about digestion and this call is wondering what can be done.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 In terms of the herbal pharmacopoeia, using herbs like dandelion root as a cologog,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 as a liver stimulant to support bile production to emulsify fats,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 and the bitter compounds in plants like gentian and absinthe for stimulating hydrochloric acid production,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 as well as pepsin and other things in the stomach.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 Yeah, that's an extremely valuable use of herbal remedies is to stimulate--

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 --on gentian?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Yeah, gentian, the greater gentian, but there's also the lesser gentian depending on how--

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 the greater gentian probably has the stronger effect.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 But yeah, there's lots of different herbal bitters.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 I mean, some are called hot bitters, some are aromatic bitters, and some are pure bitters.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 So things like absinthe even, which is that wormwood which is put in drinks now is not banned anymore.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 It's legal, but essentially was a bitter to support stomach acid production.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Anyway--

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 So gentian, you would stimulate HCL and pepsin production in the body?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Because you could take that plus the pep and bromelain and maybe those are the best you can do,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 and then you just have to keep your energy up.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 Yeah, well--

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 And the aroma of food is extremely important.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 Yeah, there you go.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 If you don't enjoy your food or if you're anxious while you're eating it, you will mess up your digestive secretion.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 And keeping the stress down too, correct?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 Yeah.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Yeah, good.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Let's take the next caller, though, because I appreciate your caller, your call, John.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 And let's move on to the next caller.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Where are you from?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Hello, I'm calling from Garberville.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Oh, okay.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 What's your name?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Mike.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 I've got a couple of pieces of information that I've been collecting.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 Okay.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 About 15 years ago in--oh, down south of San Francisco in a very exclusive electronic show,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 I saw something called 3D computer-enhanced ultrasound that showed bones perfectly without radiation.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 And then the other one I had for you people is the ancient Sumerians.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 I believe they were the first to put in--you know, put up a writing system.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 They wrote about hemp root extract for epilepsy, for balancing the immune system, and I'm now tracing it.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 It is available, but this never gets out there.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 Oh, and another one was many years ago my health was saved by ancient Tibetan acupuncture,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 not the modern version with all the needles, very few needles, very effective.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Good.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 Thank you for your call, Mike.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 That's my information.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Thank you.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
 Thank you.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 Dr. Peay, have you ever heard of 3D-enhanced ultrasound?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 I don't recall exactly, but there are instruments that can, for example, detect cavities in teeth much better than X-rays using ultrasound

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 and it does give you a three-dimensional picture of the tooth and its insides.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 And a company in Washington announced that they were coming out with this technology,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 but something has come up and they say it won't be available for a few years anyway.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 Okay.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Let's take the next caller.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 What's your name and where are you from?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 Hi there.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 You can call me Guy.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 I'm another one from Garboville.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 I can barely hear you on the phone.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Okay.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Well, Karen, what's your question, caller?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 You mentioned glyphosate earlier in your talk.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 I want to talk specifically about that.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 I've had some recent unfortunate exposure due to an employment that I had of some pretty highly concentrated stuff.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 And once exposed, what would you recommend to possibly prevent any prolonged effects from the exposure?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 Yeah.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 I'm not too sure of its toxicology.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Apparently, when you look at the monograph of glyphosate, it seems, quote/unquote, "readily excreted" and "rapidly excreted."

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 So in terms of actually protecting somebody who's been exposed to it, I would imagine that any of the routes of elimination,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 either through the urine or the feces, you'd imagine that increasing that digestive output,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 sorry, the output from the digestive tract if you swallowed it or you've absorbed it through your skin,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 either through the kidneys or through the bowels, supporting that would be important.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 And then obviously, my mind goes to things like liver and supportives for the liver, things like milk thistle and schizandra, other detoxifying.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 Yeah. You had mentioned dandelion, too.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 And that was in relation to the previous call about digestion and dandelion root has traditionally been used to promote bile in the liver

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 and storage in the gallbladder so that when it's needed, it's released and fats can be emulsified.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 So that's dandelion.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Okay. So that's not necessarily applicable.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Not really, no. I would imagine more speeding up the process of elimination by supporting the gut and the urinary output and supporting.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Okay. And would that apply to, would you think, like most other chemical toxins like 2,4-D, for instance?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Yeah, pretty much because essentially they have to be excreted somehow in order to rid yourself of it.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 So unfortunately, some of these things are taken up by the bone marrow or sequestered elsewhere in the system in tissues or fat,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 especially as a quote unquote good source of these toxins.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 And we mentioned in the past things like the polyunsaturates are readily taken up by the fat cells and released later on to cause the damage.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 But Dr. Peter, do you have any, how would you want to go about it perhaps if you knew somebody had been exposed to high levels of a toxin like this,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 what would your approach to elimination be?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 A lot of the insecticides and herbicides are oil soluble such as 2,4-D.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 But glyphosate luckily is water soluble, but it comes in the products Roundup and Touchdown, I think they are.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 And what if you mix 2,4-D with diesel fuel?

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 It's still oil soluble.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 Yeah, but when it gets in your body, it tends to stay in your brain and fat, the oil in your body.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:58.000
 And glyphosate luckily, even though it is a nerve transmitter disruptor, it luckily is not oil soluble.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 So it leaves the body quickly, but it leaves behind damage such as genetic damage, mitochondrial damage and nerve disruption.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:22.000
 So I think if you think that you have accumulated some of the chemicals that were in Roundup or Touchdown other than the glyphosate,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 then things that will turn over your fat metabolism safely, adding vitamin E for example, protects you as you detoxify the fats.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Otherwise, it's a matter of keeping your energy up so you can restore the slightly injured mitochondria, nerves, kidneys, whatever were affected as the glyphosate passed through.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 I can definitely say there has been a definite downturn in my general energy levels since being exposed.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 I just kind of chalk it up to, well, my body is fighting back, but thank you for your advice.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 You're welcome.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:24.000
 Vitamin E, thyroid, aspirin and some of the protective steroids like pregnenolone and DHEA and progesterone can protect against many of those environmental oil soluble toxins.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 Okay, good. We've got two more callers who want to pose questions to you Dr. Peat.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 Dr. Peat, would you get a little closer to the microphone? I've been told by the engineer that your voice is very quiet and you've been turned right up to max.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 So let's take this next caller. Where are you from and what's your name?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 Hi, my name is Alex and I'm calling from New Hampshire.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 Okay, Alex, what's your question?

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 I have a question about taking thyroid hormone, T3 versus T4.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:05.000
 I've been taking about 60 micrograms of T3 spaced out every hour in six microgram doses and T4 in the evening.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:17.000
 I was wondering whether if I take too much T4, would some of that turn into reverse T3 because there's T3 present in the bloodstream or is that something I really shouldn't worry about?

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Because I haven't been able to get my body temperatures above about 97 and a half.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, the person is taking six microgram doses, presumably ten of them if he's using 60 micrograms a day,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 and he wants to know whether or not there's any issue with the T4 that he would take being turned into reverse T3

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 and he doesn't seem to have his body temperature responding the way it should do to thyroid hormone.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Yeah, it's possible if you're under stress, for example, cortisol and adrenaline can shift the metabolism of T4 into reverse T3.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:13.000
 But I would check your general nutrition, make sure you're having seafood about once a week because selenium is the most crucial nutrient for making sure you're converting T4 as needed.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Your brain and kidneys and skin, every tissue has the equipment for converting T4 to T3, but it needs selenium to do that.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 And then mushrooms are a good source of selenium. Do you have any others?

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 Yeah.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000
 Yeah. Okay, so that was the answer. Thank you, Cora. We have another caller on the line, so let's get this next caller in.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Caller, where are you from and what's your question?

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 Hi, I'm from the local area. Dr. Peat, I was curious, I asked you about a year ago to look into the monk fruit sugar and I'll take my answer off the air.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 So what was the question? You're still asking about monk fruit sugar? Okay. So Dr. Peat, have you heard anything about monk fruit sugar?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 Yes, I read about it. I don't remember exactly what it is though.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 Okay. All right, well, no problem. If anybody else would like to call in between now and 5 to 8, you're welcome. The number here is 707-923-3911.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
 Otherwise, we'll carry on where we started in the beginning of the show.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:38.000
 As a Dr. Peat, I was going to say, again, you've explained the things like donor interests and how the wars on various lucrative diseases have failed us and now the whole personalized tumor specific chemotherapy is such a failure.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 I was going to ask you here that the whole, how it all happens, you know, how does science come to the mainstream?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 We know it's all about advertising. We know it's all about generating revenue and we know all about powerful interests that are certainly not going to do themselves a disservice by producing or printing damning trials that show no benefit or potential harm.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 And the entire Hippocratic Oath, which most doctors or every doctor should take and most doctors we should thoroughly believe in first do no harm should certainly be first and foremost in their minds.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 But obviously, most doctors that are practicing want to help people but don't have the time to look into the science behind the things that they're prescribing.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 And as the medical schools are indoctrinated by drug reps and the money that comes from supporting these drugs in terms of private sponsorships or gifts, quote unquote, to various professors in medical schools, for example, all of this becomes very easily corrupted.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 And I wanted to mention the open access movement as being a alternative to this donor funded publication machine, which I think produces so much negative, negative press really in terms of when it's uncovered from drugs that were supposedly designed to help people.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 Let me just ask first, I think I saw the lights flashing a couple of times. I don't know if there are anybody else waiting for us. Engineer, do we have any callers? Does the engineer hear me?

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:35.000
 Okay, the engineer is looking down into space as though he can't hear anything. Anyway, Dr. Peat, the open access movement, do you do you know much about that? And do you think it's a valid institution?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:51.000
 Because I did find an article by Jeffrey Beal writing in the American Association of University Professors stating that the advocates of open access tell only one side of the story and ignoring the exploitative practices and poor quality of many open access journals.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 What do you have much feedback or much to say about open access? He, Jeffrey Beal made some good points about the possible corruption of the open access by simply turning it into sort of a personal advertising thing for researchers who aren't doing anything of special value,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 but want to go on record as having publications for the university, for example.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 So they pay a publisher to publish something even though it's junk. So open access, as it's false, can be just an expansion of the advertising industry.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 But even advertising, it isn't required that advertisers lie about their product. Sometimes they might tell the truth. And so open access is susceptible to being used as personal advertising.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:25.000
 But if you read critically, you can often find very good stuff in it. The Public Library of Science so far has had a really good record of getting novel information out to the public that would have been censored by the regular old fashioned journals that are owned or controlled by the industry.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:39.000
 All right. The Public Library of Science, folks, worth taking a look at if you've never heard of it. We do have two more callers here who want to ask questions. So let's get them in fairly quickly here. Next caller. You're on the air. What's your name and what's your question?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:51:00.000
 Where you from? We'll see. Go ahead. You're on the air. Where you from? What's your question? Caller, this is why I ask you to listen on your phone. Three, two, one. Okay. Let's drop that call and make a call back. So next caller, you're on the air. Where you from? What's your question?

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 Whoops. Last caller. That was probably my fault. Next caller, you're on. Yeah. Hi. I had a question about living up in a high rise and what are the health effects of that? Well, I'm not too sure about any negative health effects other than...

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 Actually, it's been reported that the number of heart attacks and strokes are higher and it's suspected that it's due to the fact that you're farther away from the Earth's magnetic field. I would imagine the stress of living in high rise could be a cause. Dr. Peate, what do you...

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:56.000
 There are some good studies just within the state of New Mexico and going from, I think it was 2,000 to 5,000 in steps of 1,000 feet. They saw that heart attacks and mortality from heart disease decreased with each step up in altitude.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 And for over 100 years, the insurance companies have known about the benefits of living in a very high altitude. Statistics show that the cancer, for example, mortality is much lower as you go higher in altitude.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 And there are several changes. For example, there's more ultraviolet light increasing your vitamin D. Your thyroid hormone tends to shift to the T3 active form and the lower oxygen pressure, once you're adapted, makes you retain carbon dioxide in your body because the exchange in your lungs

00:52:47.000 --> 00:53:04.000
 oxygen pushes carbon dioxide out of your body as it enters. But high altitude, the oxygen tension is lower so you retain more CO2, which keeps your cells in the stable oxidizing condition.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:18.000
 The higher CO2 facilitates brain oxidation. So dementia is in surveys in recent years, dementia is much lower at high altitude.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000
 Dr. Peate, do you know of any benefits of living in a high rise, living on the top floor of some multi-story high rise?

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:53.000
 One advantage is that the stuff over your head reacts with cosmic rays. The researchers used half an inch of lead as a roof, put it over rabbit cages, and those rabbits very quickly miscarried, were infertile, and developed degenerative diseases.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 And they found that it was the tertiary cosmic rays caused by the high probability of a cosmic ray causing a nuclear reaction in the layer of lead.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
 Because they were slowed down enough to stop within them or not pass right through them?

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 One cosmic ray would produce a shower of intense secondary and tertiary radiation, which increased the toxicity the lower you are.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:49.000
 The nuclear industry talks about the danger of radiation flying across the country in an airplane, but actually the higher you are the less toxic the radiation is because the dense atmosphere at low altitude produces more secondary and tertiary cosmic rays similar to having the half inch of lead over your head.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 So when you are on the bottom floor of a big building you are going to have a lot more of the tertiary toxic cosmic rays and less of the high altitude, high energy cosmic rays that go right through you without doing any harm.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:21.000
 Thanks for that explanation. There is one other caller. I don't know if this caller is really quick about his question, Dr. Peat, and if you've got a paragraph answer, I don't mean to cut you short of course because we love hearing what you've got to say, but it's three minutes too.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
 So caller, you're on the airwave from, what's your question?

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:37.000
 From New York. I had a skin rash. I talked to Dr. Peat about it I think last call and he said sodium chloride bath, which I've done with kosher salt and also the dry CO2.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 It's gone away, but it actually keeps coming back and I was just wondering if there's anything else because it sounds like it might be digestion or endotoxin related and I was just wondering other things that might be useful.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:03.000
 I did take acidophilus, casci and remnosis in a 100ml bottle with 50 billion units in the bottle, but I'm just wondering, am I on the right track?

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 What is it incrementally that I could do if I sort of comply with your regular diet recommendations?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:17.000
 Vitamin D and thyroid are the most important things I know of for skin problems.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
 Okay, and would you have to say A and D together, right?

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:39.000
 Not necessarily. You don't want to overdo the vitamin A, but the vitamin D works both on the intestine to control the endotoxin and the skin reaction.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 There's no serious interaction between vitamin D and vitamin A, but they're both important for the skin.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 I'm afraid we're going to have to cut you short, Dr. Peat. Thanks so much for your time.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:57:00.000
 And for those people who've heard Dr. Peat this evening, maybe for the first time, go visit his website. It's www.raypeat.com.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 He's got lots of articles written about many different diseases, conditions, etc.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:16.000
 All fully referenced, and he's got his unique perspective on it, which comes from objectively looking at research and not just buying in to the mainstream.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 And he's been that way for the last 50 years, folks.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:29.000
 So a lot of what he said is being borne out now and will continue to be borne out as the web-based archives of this show and all the others that we've done over the last 10 years are there.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
 So thanks for your time. People calling in, appreciate you.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 Dr. Peat, as always, thank you. And until the third Friday of next month, my name is Andrew Murray.
