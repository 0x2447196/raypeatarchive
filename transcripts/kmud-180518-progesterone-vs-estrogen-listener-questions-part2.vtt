00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
 Well welcome to this month's Ask Your Ob Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. From 7 till 8pm

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.280
 this is a live show. We have callers calling in from 7.30 to 8pm to ask questions about

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.860
 the topic that we are going to go through. This month's topic is going to be a round

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.280
 up of the point that we left off in March discussing progesterone and estrogen. And

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.840
 this month I want to dissect that a little more with some of the facts and some of the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.240
 arguments against and in fact plain refuting of those "facts" about how positive estrogen

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.920
 was and how negative progesterone was in a paper that was written by Inger Sundström

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.120
 Promona at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, apparently one of the leading experts on brain

00:00:52.120 --> 00:01:00.560
 metabolism and sex hormones. I mentioned in March that the PROTECT and SYNAPSE which are

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.720
 acronyms, PROTECT and SYNAPSE trials of progesterone's anti-inflammatory effects used in the treatment

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.000
 of traumatic brain injury were published and reviewed and apparently were relatively unsuccessful.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.520
 Now Dr. Stein, a 30 year PhD brain injury expert at Emory University was part of the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.480
 team which published the paper in the Journal of Neurotrauma and he outlined some very obvious

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.420
 mistakes in the studies and basically said that the criteria with which the study was

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.400
 done did not produce valid results and he was strongly opposed to the findings which

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.440
 showed there was no positive benefit for progesterone citing some very good facts and evidence to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:02:00.620
 the contrary. So in terms of the ongoing lies if you like about how positive estrogen is

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.520
 for you and/or how dangerous progesterone is for you, we have had for many years now

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.320
 Dr. Raymond Peat joining us to discuss his findings and cover a lot of evidence that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.240
 he has unearthed himself and I am very pleased to have him on the show. So I wanted just

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.840
 to quickly welcome Dr. Peat and then give people a little more information about how

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.720
 to contact the studio for call-ins from 7.30 on. So Dr. Peat are you with us? Yes I am

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.120
 here. Ok thanks so much for joining us. For people that are in the area there is a 707

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.720
 number which is 707 923 3911 and I wanted to quickly ask, I just noticed as I came into

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.960
 the studio that the 800 numbers have been scratched out. I was just about to correct

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.320
 you in case you started saying that. Yeah apparently there is a problem with the 800

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.480
 numbers so anybody can call from anywhere. The country code is 01 I believe. Yeah because

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.360
 we have people from Finland, we have people from Australia and other places in the world.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:15.520
 So ok yeah 707 923 3911. So I also wanted just to point out that after business hours

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.440
 or during business hours rather 9 to 5 Monday through Friday people can either call in and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:30.960
 either or write to me at my address Andrew@westernbotanicalmedicine.com or call if they have any questions or if

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.120
 they want to follow up any consultations, nutritional consultations or related subjects

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.760
 around health and the things that we are purporting to be things that are very beneficial for

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.200
 you which you won't normally hear in the mainstream. Dr. Peat has been a big advocate of things

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.720
 like thyroid and sugar and progesterone and the mainstream medicine and science would

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.760
 argue that sugar is not good for you or that pregnenolone or progesterone for example are

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.920
 not good for you when there is plenty of evidence to show that there is. I think this is probably

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.880
 never so clear as in the trials of HRT and some of the withdrawing of those HRT programs

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.920
 and hormone replacement therapy up quote unquote that women with estrogen dominance is probably

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.040
 the last thing that they want is estrogen replacement but yet the industry and doctors

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:31.680
 still continue to say that the bone health benefits of estrogen are to be advised and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.480
 that women with hot flashes and other mood disorders that estrogen is a lacking substance

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.240
 that they actually need and will help them. So during the course of the next hour and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.720
 30 minutes or so I am going to be discussing some of the arguments for progesterone and

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.880
 the arguments against estrogen and Dr. Peat with his background is probably never so qualified

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.600
 to speak on the subject given that his PhD was in reproductive hormones. So Dr. Peat

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.640
 would you just give an outline of your professional and academic background so people that are

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:12.880
 listening can hear where you have come from? Before I studied biology I was a literature,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:25.720
 linguistics and art major and teacher and I decided to study biology initially to get

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.400
 more understanding of how language and intelligence and consciousness work and what I found was

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:42.200
 that brain biology, cognitive science so called was pure dogmatism, very little science in

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:50.040
 it so I shifted over to reproductive physiology to basically study how the organism works

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:59.120
 all the way from the germ cell to the brain and the brain science really is not distinct

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:11.520
 from reproductive physiology. The brain is really the motor for the whole life process

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:26.640
 and I did my dissertation in 1972 on the oxidative changes in the uterus in particular as it

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.280
 changes with aging. Okay good so I guess let's just jump straight

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:40.120
 into some of the questions that I had that we got left off from March and these are basic

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:47.000
 inquiries into the mechanism by which estrogen has its negative effects and then we'll get

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.400
 into an article that was written by Inger Sundström who is a professor at the University

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.600
 of Uppsala and an apparent leading expert on brain metabolism and sex hormones who said

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:07.160
 some very strange things that I'd like you just to hear and give your take on it.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.120
 Susceptible epilepsy and the estrogens like estrone, estriol and estradiol how do you

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.800
 understand the triggering of the epilepsy in these certain susceptible females? It's

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.240
 estrogen related isn't it? Yeah in my research I looked through everything

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.960
 that had been done on physiology especially as it relates to the brain and uterus up until

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:43.080
 1970 and I couldn't find any evidence that would clearly distinguish the physiology of

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:53.400
 estrogen stimulation from x-ray stimulation or oxygen deprivation or vitamin E deficiency

00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:02.080
 which interferes with oxygen use. All of those things deplete the energy production of the

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:15.160
 cell which is based on oxidation and when the brain is oversupplied with estrogen or

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:23.080
 lacks its antagonist especially progesterone the whole system but everything in the brain

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:32.800
 included wastes oxygen and is unable to keep the energy level up to the point that the

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:43.400
 cells are stable and one of the strange things that has been overlooked or seen upside down

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:52.240
 in both biology and medicine for most of the century is that high energy state of a cell

00:08:52.240 --> 00:09:00.680
 is the state in which it's ready to work and function but it is not acting all the time

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:08.920
 it's sitting there ready to work and when it is forced to work more than it is ready

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:19.520
 for the energy level falls and it gets into a state trying to restore the energy but it

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:30.960
 is in a constantly active state. If you cause hypoglycemia by interfering with the liver

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:40.120
 for example it works the same as a lack of oxygen and estrogen happens to interfere with

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:47.640
 the supply of glucose to cells. It activates insulin but it also activates the release

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:56.480
 of fatty acids from the tissues and the fatty acids block the ability to oxidize glucose

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:07.480
 so estrogen does. It activates the cells by increasing the function of glutamic acid,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:20.600
 a brain excitant and in increasing glutamate it decreases GABA the inhibiting signal. GABA

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:31.240
 should be produced by the breakdown of glutamic acid so estrogen is exciting the brain cells

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:38.240
 and at the same time interfering with their use of oxygen and glucose.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:45.120
 Estrogen and the estrogens, estro and estrolysis, etc. these really mimic a kind of stress response

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.120
 then?

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:56.560
 Yes, I consider estrogen's function to be the controlled stress. The whole organism

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:08.280
 is moving through a developmental process and it requires a constant supply of energy

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:18.040
 and if that energy supply becomes fatally impaired then the function of estrogen in

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:29.040
 the reproductive system is to erase the whole scheme that was producing the organism's

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:37.280
 development through its life process. Suddenly the excess of estrogen as a stress signal

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:52.080
 erases the whole program and reverts to the single multiplying cell. So without anything

00:11:52.080 --> 00:12:01.680
 interfering estrogen tends to produce the cancer cell but it also activates the production

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:09.920
 of the egg and the readiness of the egg to start a new organism. So its proper function

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:20.560
 should be once a month for a few hours to activate the potential new life and that only

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:34.520
 starts at puberty. Up until puberty the brain is metabolizing at a very high rate and the

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:43.120
 catamenial epilepsy tends to begin around the age of nine when estrogen is rising and

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:54.120
 progesterone hasn't risen yet. The brain metabolism slows down at puberty so the body

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:01.440
 takes it as a threat to survival and so it turns on the reproductive process.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:06.320
 I just wanted to kind of recount that you said that and I think I've understood this

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:12.200
 in the correct way that estrogen, the only real benefit for estrogen then is the inflammation

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:18.120
 it provides or promotes to stimulate implantation of a new site in the endometrium in terms

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.120
 of successful pregnancies. Is that correct? And then outside of that it doesn't really

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.960
 have too much benefit. Yeah, throughout the organism whenever the

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:36.600
 tissue is stressed it tends to turn on locally the production of estrogen. That's how it

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:44.040
 so easily leads to cancer because every tissue has the apparatus for making estrogen.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.400
 Right, you said every cell in the body can secrete it essentially.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:54.440
 Yeah, and after menopause when the production of progesterone becomes very limited there

00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:00.840
 is a tendency for all of the body's tissues to begin making estrogen. So it's just the

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:09.600
 opposite of what the menopause doctors have been teaching. When progesterone disappears

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:16.760
 the breast, the uterus, the brain, the liver, the skin, the fat, muscles even begin producing

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:24.320
 estrogen, but it can't escape from the cell because it also increases the estrogen binding

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:34.480
 protein, the estrogen so-called receptor. And in the absence of progesterone the intracellular

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.560
 estrogen increases but it doesn't get into the blood so you measure the blood and it

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.440
 looks like you're estrogen deficient. Interesting, it doesn't get into the blood,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.040
 huh? Yeah, exactly when you're being systemically

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.560
 poisoned with intracellular estrogen. And as you've mentioned before on previous

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:58.200
 shows estrogen is very responsible for edema, cell swelling and that inefficiency that comes

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.400
 with that water logging from an energy point of view.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:08.920
 The individual cell swells up when it's being excited and de-energized. When you can get

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:16.480
 the energy back up that squeezes the water out and that same swollen state occurs in

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:24.000
 capillaries and blood vessels and even though they get thicker they become leaky. Water

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.480
 goes through them into the tissues and out of your bloodstream and that's involved in

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:38.000
 the circulatory problems of pregnancy. The blood volume can't be maintained while the

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.160
 legs and feet tend to swell up and the kidneys sense the lack of circulation because the

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:50.000
 blood volume has shrunk and so the kidneys send out signals to raise the blood pressure

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:58.200
 to try to get more circulation. Interesting, and then lastly just wanted to

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.560
 recap what you said about that depolarized and repolarized state of the cell. So you

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:12.480
 mentioned that when a cell is in a ready state to perform work that relaxed state is what

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.320
 is so important for that proper contraction, that proper action potential to occur to do

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:25.840
 work and that in hypothyroidism the cell remains in a constantly stressed state where it's

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:31.280
 not able to relax and it's that very lack of relaxation that causes the energy problems.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:37.200
 You can see exactly the same process in the heart muscle as in the brain and other cells

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.760
 but it's very easy to study in the brain and in the muscle because the muscle is such a

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:55.760
 concentrated muscle system and estrogen weakens but makes more frequent the contraction and

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:05.040
 it's a great excess of estrogen causes a shock like state of the heart, rapid but very, very

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:13.920
 weak pulsation where progesterone strengthens, it lets the cells build up energy so that

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.400
 when it does contract it's a very powerful contraction and pumps very efficiently.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.480
 Okay, good. Well I never like to turn people away and I know you do this because you like

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.840
 the interaction with people asking questions that you've no preparation for if you like,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.160
 you've not been prepared so there's a caller on the line who I think wants to ask a question

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:38.760
 so let's take this caller, a call away from and what's your question?

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:44.440
 Yes, hi my name is Shana from Hesperia. Hey Hannah, welcome to the show. What's your

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.360
 question? Yes, my question is regarding chronic fatigue

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:58.840
 syndrome. Can Dr. Ray Peat elaborate on what this is and what is the underlying condition

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:06.960
 is it hypometabolism or what and then my second question is low dose naltrexone, is it effective

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.280
 for CFS? Okay, I think there's a lot of break up on

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.040
 the line but I think that first question was related to chronic fatigue syndrome, what

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:19.360
 do you see, your ideas on chronic fatigue syndrome, how do you see it and then also

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.040
 naltrexone I think was... Low dose.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:28.400
 Low dose naltrexone, LDN. Okay, Dr. Peat, what do you think of chronic fatigue syndrome

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.200
 as a... One way of thinking of it is that it's very

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:40.640
 similar to in the brain the seizure state or in the heart the failure state under the

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:50.840
 influence of a lack of progesterone and excess of estrogen or simply such a deficiency of

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:59.640
 energy that the cell goes into that swollen over excitable state. When a cell is in very

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:10.040
 bad condition, as far as I know every cell in the body can also produce histamine as

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:17.200
 it's getting very desperate, not only in a chronic sort of desperation cells produce

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:25.120
 estrogen but in a most acute situation they produce histamine and in the hypothyroid,

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:33.680
 low progesterone chronic state the body tends to locally produce a lot of histamine and

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.760
 other inflammatory things. Okay, and what do you think about naltrexone,

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:47.160
 low dose naltrexone, does that have any merit? In my experience using naloxone more than

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:54.280
 naltrexone but they're essentially identical, one is a little more oil soluble, I found

00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:06.520
 that from one to four milligrams per day of naloxone would break a depressed condition

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:17.120
 by suppressing the endorphins which are induced by lactic acid and fatigue. The endorphins

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:27.680
 are another emergency measure to turn off the excitation but with a very small dose

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:36.360
 some people use even a hundredth of a milligram and find a very therapeutic effect so I consider

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:44.920
 four milligrams a day a fairly big, larger than necessary dose.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.880
 Okay good, so let me just quickly ask, I think we have another caller on the line, okay well

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.080
 let's take this next caller and see where we're going, caller you're on the end, what's

00:20:52.080 --> 00:21:00.160
 your question? Hi, I have a question about the B complex vitamins, I've been listening

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:07.240
 for a while so I understand B1, B2 and B3 and why they're beneficial, I wanted to go

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:14.360
 backwards so B9 is I guess folic acid and B7 is biotin and I think in some of the stuff

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:21.280
 I read about what people seem to be interpreting regarding your research or point of view is

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:34.880
 that 1, 2 and 3 are important and 6 in a smaller amount but B5, anaphenic acid, B4, adenosine

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:42.360
 and folic acid and B12 are probably not to be taken and so I'm probably not giving the

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.600
 full story so I just wanted to say that's sort of the question, are these the bad guys

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.040
 and if so why? Because when someone gets a B complex vitamin they actually have specific

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:59.280
 ratios of all these in many cases and I'm just wondering are they properly named B vitamins

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.720
 and or should they be taken and thought of separately as opposed to particular ratios

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.920
 between each one of them to have the proper effect systemically? Dr. Peat I know you're an

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:18.320
 advocate of liver for that reason but how would you define the B vitamins in terms of

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:28.720
 necessity and the sources of? Their main metabolic similarity is that they are regulators and

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:40.160
 facilitators of cell oxidative energy processes. Panthenic acid is somewhat off the main group

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:54.640
 but it's very essential. It's anti-stress, helps with regulating blood sugar and allergies.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:04.440
 Sometimes 400 to 500 mg dose of panthenic acid can relieve stress symptoms and it's

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:12.240
 unusual in that it doesn't affect the interactions of the others. It's sort of on a side line

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:20.360
 where it can be taken in monkeys, they fed them a cup a day of pure panthenic acid with

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:26.560
 no side effects. If you did that with any of the other B vitamins you would quickly

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:36.360
 reach a toxic effect. Panthenic acid can be taken daily because all these are water soluble

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:42.280
 but this can be taken daily up to 400 mg and you will see some benefit of cellular oxidative

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.000
 energy. I'm thinking more about digestion too because some of these, like I've taken

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.320
 B1 and B2 recently and I really believe it's helped my ability to digest things. I'm a

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:03.280
 young man of around 60 so I'm just wondering how to take these, how much to take and how

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:10.080
 often as opposed to what's being out there in the research because it seems to not be

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:17.280
 accurate relative to what you're saying. The orthomolecular movement 40 years ago I think

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:25.400
 encouraged a lot of overdose excess use of them. You can get extremely therapeutic results

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:36.520
 sometimes with 5 or 10 times the minimum daily requirement like 10 or 20 mg of B1, 10 mg

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:51.040
 of B2, 10 mg of B6 and so on. Sometimes larger doses are effective but I think it's good

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.480
 to try the smallest dose, maybe 5 times the minimum daily requirement.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:01.280
 Okay, so it's okay to take that daily. So for the ones you mentioned, about 10 to 20

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:08.040
 mg in a day is okay and I guess B3 is a little different in the sense you could take 400

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:15.120
 to 500 of that one too, right? It's not just B5 but B3 also, am I right?

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120
 Niacin.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.120
 Niacinamide.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:28.160
 Yeah, it's important to get the amide form. The other releases, inflammatory mediators

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:36.440
 and the niacinamide is safe up to at least a couple hundred milligrams but I think I've

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:43.840
 seen people with brain, terminal brain diseases cure themselves taking just 150 or 200 of

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.920
 niacinamide per day.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:56.640
 Okay, so and B7 is biotin. I hear people say that that will reduce your blood, your glucose

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.120
 levels but then I read and I say, "Well gee, maybe that's not true. Maybe it actually regulates

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:12.760
 them dynamically." So what about biotin? Is there any negatives to taking biotin in

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.760
 like 5 to 10,000? I think it's micrograms, not milligrams.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:23.760
 I've seen the good results from very, very big doses of biotin but 50 years ago, some

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:31.320
 animal studies showed that a moderate overdose could cause liver cancer. So I've always been

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.320
 leery about it but I've never seen people repeating those experiments.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.480
 What's a dose? I mean what, so is 5,000 an excessive dose, micrograms or are you talking

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.480
 about something like...

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.240
 I would stick to around one milligram of biotin.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:54.240
 Okay, one milligram. Okay, gotcha. Okay, and then folic acid, you're kind of, I mean I've

00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.600
 read that you somehow think that's like somehow dangerous to take at all. I could be wrong

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.000
 too but that's what I've read.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.200
 I think it's safe for the dose of around one milligram, maybe as high as five milligrams

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:18.040
 per day but you have to be cautious with especially vitamin B2 and folic acid because something

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:25.480
 in the synthetic process makes a lot of people get migraine headaches and hemorrhoids and

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:33.720
 other very intense symptoms from those which happen to be yellow molecules and I think

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:42.440
 it's something about their sensitivity to light and oxidation that makes the pure chemical

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.600
 pretty allergenic for a lot of people.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.720
 So could it give you a rash too or something like that or just a headache?

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.440
 I didn't hear that.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.800
 Could it give you a rash or just a headache?

00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:03.600
 The worst symptoms I've heard about are migraine-like headaches and bowel problems but that could

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.120
 be the bowel inflammation can lead to rashes.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:14.560
 Okay that makes sense and then B12, I really almost see almost no writing on that or just

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.480
 curious because a lot of people say you've got to have your B12 up and I know that gets

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.200
 to methylation but is there an amount or is it the amount that you consume in your basic

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.800
 diet should be more than enough?

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:34.520
 Yeah, if you eat animal products in particular and the intestine bacteria can make a lot

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.520
 of it.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:44.120
 I hear from a lot of people with small intestine inflammation who have about 50% higher than

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:50.760
 the upper normal range for B12 apparently because their bacteria are thriving where

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.160
 they shouldn't be.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.920
 Alright, I appreciate your questions, Cora and I've got to get on with the questions

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:03.040
 that I've got for Dr. Peat surrounding last month's March's radio show so we can get into

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.280
 some fresh topic.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:11.920
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to go over the article just briefly that was written by this professor

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.000
 at the University of Uppsala in Sweden who is an expert on brain metabolism and sex hormones

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.280
 just to illustrate to people how wrong things can get from the quote unquote academic professionals

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:29.760
 and just to see how this was twisted in terms of what I'm about to speak verbatim from the

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:35.720
 article and I just want to stop you at different points during this just to hear your side

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.560
 of it so that you can point people in the right direction because people are going to

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.520
 read these things on ResearchGate or PubMed or other places and just take it as the truth

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:49.840
 because it's written by a university professor who specializes in this kind of thing but

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.200
 just want to bring the truth home again wherever possible.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:30:02.160
 So an article was written about pregnenolone and progesterone and saying that basically

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.920
 the negative associations with it were fairly rife and so just going through what she had

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:15.160
 written, she talked about PMS and saying that for some people it was unpredictable and for

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.760
 many it was hard to explain but feelings of worry associated with the menstrual cycle

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.200
 had very specific cause and that this was the same hormone used in much birth control

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.360
 and that 85% of women experience premenstrual stress or PMS in the days leading up to the

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:36.600
 period and according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as well

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.520
 this condition comes with physical symptoms like painful joints or breasts, headaches,

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.800
 sleeplessness etc and I'm sure most women can identify with these symptoms and she says

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.080
 it's pretty much down to one hormone progesterone and she's the leading expert on brain metabolism

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.000
 and sex hormone so she goes on to mention that progesterone appears after ovulation

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.400
 one of the two main female hormones the other being estrogen and it's present in the first

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:07.600
 two weeks of the cycle and has a broadly positive effect on news so this is estrogen. Estrogen

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.520
 increases the brain's serotonin the hormone most associated with happiness progesterone

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.040
 on the other hand can have a depressing effect so Dr. Peat what do you think about maintaining

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:26.520
 this sentence even just regarding serotonin's positive effects? To be polite I think it's

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:42.680
 very very silly everything there is confused and backwards for example the serotonin thing

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:57.640
 is a happiness signal serotonin is very essential for the inflammation, osteoporosis, cancer,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:06.720
 blood clotting, spasms all sorts of bad effects inflammatory processes right from an excess

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:16.360
 inflammatory processes dictated by serotonin. Yeah it's right there with histamine as the

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:23.480
 most intense acute local inflammatory signal and in the brain that inflammatory process

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:34.960
 of serotonin turns on the whole stress system that activates ACTH and cortisol. Estrogen

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:42.480
 not only activates that serotonin dependent pathway but it directly activates the adrenal

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:52.280
 glands to produce cortisol so estrogen is a basic stress hormone serotonin is kind of

00:32:52.280 --> 00:33:02.320
 a terminal mediator of that stress process turning on the defensive anti-stress cortisol

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:10.640
 production but in itself serotonin is a very powerful bone destroyer by its inflammatory

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:17.040
 process. It's basically an alarm signal no? Yeah. Okay well she without I guess laboring

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:23.160
 that point she mentions as well as creating anxiety another side effect of progesterone

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:28.840
 could be to cause a blues according to research by Torbjorn Backstrom from the University

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:33.560
 of Umeå in Sweden it seems to have the same effect on the brain as depressive drugs like

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.080
 alcohol and sleeping pills so where does she get that from that progesterone has this depressant

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:48.960
 effect? That's a very interesting confusion of the meaning of depression in the heart

00:33:48.960 --> 00:34:01.600
 for example progesterone depresses the spastic activity that leads to cardiac arrest and

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:10.560
 it depresses the premature contractions and facilitates a good rhythm. Estrogen has the

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:18.080
 opposite effect tends to produce arrhythmia by delaying the ability to regain its energy

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:26.640
 charge and get ready for the next beat. Okay alright so she also goes on to say most substances

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:31.240
 in the body including hormones get broken down into other substances known as metabolites

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.420
 before eventually being removed by the kidney or the liver when progesterone is broken down

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.880
 its metabolites become active in the brain and it appears they and one in particular

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:45.960
 allopregnanolone that we mentioned last month sorry in March allopregnanolone and pregnanolone

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:55.120
 which both incidentally can be produced in the CNS both in the oligodendrocytes and astrocytes

00:34:55.120 --> 00:35:00.160
 so it's not you know you don't have to consume this product it's actually de novo synthesis

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.520
 from cholesterol and she says these in particular allopregnanolone binds to a system called

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:11.640
 the GABA-A receptor now we've mentioned and I've talked about the GABA-A receptor in relation

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:18.040
 to things that bind to the GABA-A receptor to produce relaxation like valerian because

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:26.840
 it is the opposite to the excitotoxic system but she says that the GABA-A receptor is a

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.920
 little like the brain's police force it regulates making sure there isn't too much excitement

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.400
 going on which seems seems okay on the face of it and drugs that bind to it may cause

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.040
 it to step up policing and Backstrom's research suggests that metabolites of progesterone

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:48.080
 may be doing the same thing so if female hormones have such distinct effects the next step is

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.560
 to wonder why the female body is designed in this way and she suggests that it's more

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.000
 a result of evolutionary design meeting modern living progesterone's effects she goes on

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 to say may be particularly pronounced now because women are having far more periods

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.600
 and far fewer children than in the thousands of malnourished years before birth control

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:12.920
 like birth control as a popular popularly appreciated product anyway 300 years ago women

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.840
 started menstruating around 17 or 18 because they were less healthy than today so I'm not

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.000
 too sure what you got to say about being less healthy and having a later menarche which

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.320
 you've actually said and is well and shown that it's actually a positive thing to actually

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.920
 have your period start early is actually related to high estrogen it's actually a very detrimental

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:40.600
 to your long-term health isn't it yeah the age at menarche is getting lower and lower

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:50.120
 all the time over the last several decades and that is now known to correspond to all

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:58.440
 of the the estrogen problems later in life one of the recent groups of studies related

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:10.280
 to the early puberty and the tendency to have autistic babies the uterus during gestation

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:18.680
 it has a higher estrogen level in the women who started at a very young age okay she goes

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.600
 on to say that most women got pregnant almost immediately you know several hundred years

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:28.520
 ago without birth control and remain pregnant or breastfeeding for most of their reproductive

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:36.840
 lives which ended around 40 now this this would have subjected them to a fairly sustained

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:47.520
 level of progesterone correct through being pregnant yeah she seems to get it just exactly

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:57.160
 wrong with pregnancy as a time of the low progesterone but the normal cycling woman

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:05.640
 produces maybe 30 milligrams a day during the luteal phase before menstruation and the

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:15.880
 ovaries weighing six or seven grams maybe are working pretty efficiently when they can

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:24.640
 produce 30 milligrams a day but the placenta in the term pregnancy weighs about a pound

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:35.240
 and a half roughly a hundred times bigger than the ovaries and it can produce at least

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:43.000
 30 times as much progesterone per day and there's a an interesting discussion of the

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:54.120
 effect of pregnancy on aging and general health in the book by a a a v everett and others

00:38:54.120 --> 00:39:05.000
 called hypothalamus pituitary and aging in which he describes experiments mating rabbits

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.400
 constantly as soon as they have a live litter mate them again so that they live their whole

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:22.800
 lives producing a maximum number of litters and others that were not mated the the multi

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:31.000
 litter rabbits were had much more flexible young connective tissue their tissues were

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 less aged at the end of their lives than the non-mated and they mentioned studies done

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.880
 in Hungary looking at the lifespan of women in relation to the number of babies they had

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:56.720
 produced and graphing it from zero babies to eight babies the maximum that they calculated

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:07.440
 they showed a straight line of life expectancy increasing with each baby that was born and

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:13.200
 in the rabbits they showed that it was this very high constant almost constant exposure

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:22.480
 to progesterone that was protecting reversing the estrogen induced age changes in the connective

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:28.760
 tissue that made them live longer and be healthier.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:33.000
 Okay good well let's see put the word out there for people that may have questions I

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 know several people have called in and haven't got on so far so the area code is 707 923

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 3911 and the lights are flashing so in a few moments here we'll take this next call to

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.440
 find out where they're from and what the question is.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.680
 Hi caller you're on the air what's your question and where you from?

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.120
 Ask him again he was that was quick.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.360
 Okay you're on the air caller so where are you from what's your question?

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.000
 Mike from Connecticut.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Okay Mike what's your question?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.720
 Yes I have a quick question for Dr. Ray Petit just wondering if you had a chance to review

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:12.160
 the recent study that came out of Northwestern University about the correlation with taking

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:19.360
 aspirin daily and the risk of melanoma looks like there's a double the risk in men.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.960
 Dr. Petit.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:32.640
 I saw that and I don't know what happened with all of the other cancers that have been

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:38.440
 studied aspirin prevents them.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.740
 Yeah I find it strange as well it looks like it was a surprising result versus all the

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.740
 other cancers.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:49.720
 You'll probably find the same thing with the synapse studies and the protect studies on

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.560
 progesterone that didn't turn up with positive information you'll probably find the same

00:41:53.560 --> 00:42:01.600
 thing either methodology or yeah some of the methodology is probably going to be in question.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:08.320
 Sure okay and just one more question is what are his thoughts about hydrogen molecular

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.440
 hydrogen water and the benefits it looks like there's a few studies coming from Japan looks

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.480
 like there's some positive benefits.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:27.760
 Yeah everything I've seen looks like it's maybe simply reducing the free radical oxidative

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:34.920
 damage substances like lipid peroxides it lowers inflammation in all the experiments

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:39.120
 I've seen.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:45.040
 Okay that's a question we've got two or three more people on the line waiting so let's take

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.520
 this next caller.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.840
 Caller what's your question where you from?

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:56.080
 Yeah from Long Island my question relates to CO2 carbon dioxide therapy you'd mentioned

00:42:56.080 --> 00:43:08.000
 bag breathing and I've also heard about dry CO2 baths and I was just wondering if CO2

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 is heavier than air can you just put it in a bathtub and how would you measure it because

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.480
 if you move around it seems like there'd be quite a bit of disturbance.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:29.040
 If you get in slowly and get out slowly it's so heavy that you don't flush much of it out

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:36.960
 but you can check with a match or a lighter to find the level the match goes out as soon

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.680
 as you sink it into the pure CO2.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.880
 Oh I see and you don't even have to take your clothes off to have a bath.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.400
 How long do you have to stay in there for benefit and how could you do this like once

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:55.560
 a week or something you know like your recommendation on liver for example?

00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:08.880
 A 1908 article described it weekly bath in CO2 as being equivalent to a vacation at the

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.680
 ocean.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.280
 For how long like at one time if to have effect?

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:24.080
 It gets boring after an hour but you can get a big bag or tub and a plastic tub works fine

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:30.200
 it doesn't have any leaks in it like a bathtub does and you can just sit in it and read or

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.000
 watch TV or whatever.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:37.920
 Okay does that lower your temperature?

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:45.040
 It has a warm sensation when it touches your skin but that's because it's opening up blood

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:51.720
 vessels getting more blood to your skin so you could chill yourself I think if you did

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.960
 it in a cold place because it would make you lose heat faster through your skin.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.720
 Does it matter whether it's like food grade or?

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.720
 I use it from a welding shop.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:09.760
 I appreciate your call caller we do have three more people so I just want to make sure they

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.320
 all get a chance so let's line up the next caller.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.280
 Caller where are you from and what's your question?

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.040
 Hello caller where are you from and what's your question?

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.680
 Can you tell me about MitoQ?

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:34.680
 I think that's a new variant of CoQ10 and I don't know whether it's any better I've

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.280
 never used it or studied it much.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.280
 Okay thank you.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:43.880
 Dr. Peate very quickly on CoQ10 and mitochondrial activity do you think there is relative merit

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.800
 there for using CoQ10?

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:53.520
 Yeah I think so in many cases a person is not producing enough of it and it happens

00:45:53.520 --> 00:46:05.400
 that vitamin K works with CoQ10 and makes it more effective and stable.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:13.640
 Incidentally in terms of dosage for K2 I noted that one of the kind of more leading producers

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:22.920
 of K2 Thorne Research they produce a liquid vitamin K2 that I know has been recommended

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.360
 to people especially if they're using aspirin as a therapy and they use a one milligram

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.720
 per drop product.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:34.640
 Now I've just noticed that Thorne have rebranded their packaging and actually on their supplement

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:40.600
 fact label it says one serving size is now 10 drops and so therefore 10 milligrams is

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600
 a serving size.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.280
 What do you think about K2's use with or without aspirin in that instance if you're mentioning

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.680
 its affinity with CoQ10?

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:55.200
 The Japanese have experimented with it at higher levels up to 40 or 45 milligrams per

00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:03.200
 day and I've known several people who had extremely high persistently high blood pressure

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:12.000
 like 240 over 140 I think was one person's regular pressure for a year because his blood

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.040
 vessels were very calcified and he took 40 or 50 milligrams per day of Thorne vitamin

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:29.280
 K and after a week the pressure was much lower and after two weeks it was essentially normal

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.080
 140 over 70.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.080
 Okay we've got two more questions at least, sorry two more callers at least.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:41.920
 One was what's the dosage for progesterone for a person who's thinking about trying it?

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.900
 Yeah that's probably a very variable question, a very variable answer in terms of the use

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:52.400
 it's being used for but what do you think Dr. Peat as a general for a female now presumably

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.120
 what a progesterone dose would be?

00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:02.920
 And if you're taking it orally in an oil dissolved form 20 or 30 milligrams is a very effective

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:10.920
 dose I've used as much as 100 milligrams myself for a headache it took about two minutes to

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.920
 knock out a migraine.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:17.040
 There you go now you've mentioned again I won't go back to the article because we've

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:23.740
 got callers but the quote-unquote depressing effect of progesterone is it's mildly sedative

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:29.360
 and that's not a depressing effect but I guess in an energy term it is but it has a sedative

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.360
 effect doesn't it?

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:37.640
 Yeah it's a powerful sedative if you take enough, 100 milligrams after it knocked out

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.800
 the migraine it put me to sleep for a couple hours.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.640
 Okay let's take these next callers, okay so caller you're on the air where are you from

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.640
 and what's your question?

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.640
 Hi my name is Peter I'm from San Francisco.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.640
 Hey Peter what's your question?

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:58.080
 I had a question regarding the concept of earthing there's a lot of people that promote

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.680
 going to the beach going to nature and taking off your shoes and walking around and I felt

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:06.560
 benefit from going to the beach and taking my shoes off and walking around like that

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.200
 and coming in contact with the actual earth.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.520
 What does Dr. Peat think is the mechanism behind that if there is any?

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:26.160
 Negative ionized air is more abundant near the ocean or waterfalls I think that's part

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:33.840
 of the good feeling you get at the beach another thing is the skin stimulation of freeing your

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:43.920
 shoes from being imprisoned in shoes and socks that's a very powerful stimulant but supposedly

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:54.080
 the body does the immune system for example reacts to the electrically charged things

00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:03.280
 in the environment for example they put nylon on some animals that supposedly was interfering

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:13.200
 with the normal skin ionization and found that their immune systems were suppressed

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:24.000
 and the earth is always a source of electrons actually relative to the higher atmosphere

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:33.320
 you get a gradient with the positive at high altitude and the negative pole at the earth.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.400
 Thanks for your question Cora there's actually a couple more I'm going to hold for one second

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:40.200
 we've still got two more quarters on the line so I hope to get to three now the lights going

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:48.280
 again I just wanted to let you know that the article that was also written that Inger quoted

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:54.760
 in that paper on supposedly progesterone's negative effects the American Congress of

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.760
 obstetricians and gynecologists quoted this during some part of her paper that she's written

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:08.040
 in diet and vitamin supplements may help ease PMS the ACOG the American Congress on Obstetrics

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:14.000
 and Gynecologists suggests keeping blood sugar levels up with smaller more frequent meals

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.480
 now there's good advice for you okay next caller I wanted to comment one very bad thing

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:26.080
 about her paper was that she was talking about the amygdala activation I know there's so

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:32.000
 many other questions I wanted to ask about it but carry on she was presenting it as a

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:39.520
 negative fear thing but the amygdala regulates affection love anxiety and fear it isn't just

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:45.040
 one sided yeah okay good let me quickly mention to people so they can get online themselves

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:49.600
 and look at this paper then if they want to rewind this radio show or download it from

00:51:49.600 --> 00:52:03.320
 the archives her name is Inger sunstorm POROMAA University of Uppsala in Sweden and you know

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.920
 what when you type in her name you do that search you'll get directed to research gate

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.960
 and you got to scroll through the papers that she's written but you won't find this one

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:15.960
 there what you got to do in the search when you look for it you'll find that it's related

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:24.920
 to PMS and basically you know a treatment for PMS and and those situations where estrogen

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:30.160
 typically is the cause of it and progesterone is the alleviator but when you click on that

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.320
 link you'll find her paper and then you'll find what I've mentioned here word for word

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.400
 of what she's quoted and then dr. Peat here's refuted it all right so two more callers on

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.240
 the line let's take this first this next one hello yeah where you from and what's your

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:49.880
 question I'm I'm Naomi from Willits and I've you've talked about migraine and things that

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:55.480
 can make them can give you a migraine and things that can take it away but I missed

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.420
 the first one I think you said biotin and folic acid was a tricky combination that could

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:07.160
 cause migraine and then you said something that I just missed what you said actually

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:15.320
 alleviated it so okay riboflavin and folic acid are the ones that are most irritating

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:26.080
 and getting the intestine free of any of those irritants is very important of a fibrous food

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:33.120
 such as raw carrot or cooked mushrooms helps to clean out the inflammatory substances from

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:42.160
 the intestine but sugar sugar helps to stop the production of histamine and serotonin

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:51.800
 okay and you said some I mean I have a b50 complex with C and it's got all those things

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:59.680
 and I do suffer migraines I don't know if I should be taking riboflavin and folic acid

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:06.400
 if I took one I would have a migraine for about three days I think but I don't that's

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:14.840
 good they're probably protected again what you felt what alleviated migraine progesterone

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:22.240
 sugar and things that stimulate your intestine such as raw carrots and cooked mushrooms to

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:28.760
 remove bowel waste like estrogen and endotoxin progesterone and sugar yeah sugar helps to

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:38.480
 stop the production of histamine and serotonin okay okay thank you very much thank you well

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:44.820
 maybe fascinating show yeah good I don't want to prejudge it but maybe that last call didn't

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:48.840
 really listen to any of the other previous shows where she would recognize that sugar

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.280
 is actually very beneficial for you as well just like progesterone and pregnenolone are

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.600
 beneficial and that's the cause and the reason that we do these shows is just to help people

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:01.440
 understand that what they hear on the radio or read in the papers is not always the way

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:07.520
 it is and it's driven by fairly powerful interests and lobbies okay we have one more caller so

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.960
 let's make this real quick just two minutes caller and then I've got to have to terminate

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.840
 you real quick one question you mentioned coq10 what about pqq is that also helpful

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:24.440
 to manufacture and replace damaged mitochondria in conjunction with coq10 what was the name

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:32.840
 of it pqq I can't that's the acronym p qq pure quinolone I've heard about that but never

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:39.120
 studied it okay so that then the other question is before adenine was mentioned that you didn't

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:43.960
 we didn't that's something that's not really mentioned as a b vitamin and I was just wondering

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:51.080
 is that really just an omission for and it should is something that could be taken beneficially

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:56.360
 externally like the other ones that someone went through earlier did you say adenosine

00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:05.360
 or I think it's adenine vitamin b4 is what I've heard it referred to as how did you pronounce

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:13.480
 it I guess I thought it was adenine but maybe it's adenosine yeah I think so oh yeah adenosine

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:22.200
 is sort of risky it's the opposite of caffeine in some way and it can bring on symptoms that

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:30.000
 caffeine can alleviate so I wouldn't risk using adenosine that can cause an asthma attack

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:35.120
 for example okay thank you okay thanks for your calls caller thanks so much for joining

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:40.000
 us dr. Peat I really appreciate your time giving it as always okay thank you okay so

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.520
 for those people who've listened to this evening show and or who may be called in I think there
