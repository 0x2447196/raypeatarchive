00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.120
 - Welcome to this evening's Ask Your Ob-Doctor.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.440
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.400
 - My name's Sarah Johanna Sun Murray.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.120
 - For those of you who perhaps have never listened

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.960
 to the shows, they run every third Friday of the month

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.520
 from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.120
 We have call-in from 7.30 until 8 o'clock.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.640
 And once again, we have our very special guest speaker

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 who's full of information about current events

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 as well as historically accurate, important past events.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.360
 So that brings it into context for all of us.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.120
 You're listening to KMUD Garville 91.1 FM

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.360
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.560
 like I said, we're asking callers,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.200
 call in with any questions either related or related

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.720
 to this month's loose topic on stress, GABA systems,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.840
 different herbs that combat stress in different ways,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 mitochondrial support, and Dr. Peat will be bringing

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.400
 his wisdom and his expertise in terms of mitochondrial

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.720
 activity and how that all plays in with the hormones

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.280
 and other substances like thyroid, progesterone,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.760
 pregnenolone, et cetera, that all support

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.040
 the anti-inflammatory cascade, as it were,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.160
 that battles the inflammation that most people

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.400
 just constantly under attack with.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.680
 We are going through a pledge drive this evening,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.840
 so sorry for those people who perhaps waited,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.080
 thinking it was starting at seven.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960
 It's just started just now.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.800
 So it's all good.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.000
 So without this radio show, this kind of program

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.160
 would not be on the air.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.320
 So those people that are listening,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.960
 there is a pledge drive going on.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.760
 It's basically a supported network of people,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.840
 volunteers, and donors that keep this radio station

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.400
 independent and make just this kind of show possible

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.000
 because you're not gonna hear too much of what we say

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.200
 and too much of what other people have to say

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.320
 in their various programmings from regular broadcast.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.200
 It's not controlled mainstream media, folks.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.280
 It's the alternative.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.480
 So please support it wherever and however you can.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.880
 So like I said, this evening, Dr. Raymond Peat's joining us

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.000
 and hopefully he's with us on the VIP line.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.920
 Are you there, Dr. Peat?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.760
 - Yes, hi.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.560
 - Thanks so much for joining us again

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.240
 and sharing your wisdom and giving your time

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.080
 as freely as you do.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.920
 I really appreciate it.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.760
 Thank you.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.480
 As usual, I think it's always very good

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.200
 to just outline your professional and academic background.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.300
 So people who perhaps have never listened to the show,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.080
 or heard you even before, can hear your background.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.040
 And I know when they hear you speak,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.320
 they know you know what you're talking about.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.680
 But if you can just say a little bit about your background

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.600
 and your past, that'd be great to illuminate.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.600
 - Okay, after 10 or 15 years of working in language

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.320
 and literature, I have shifted over to biology

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.320
 and especially aging and metabolism reproduction.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.980
 Studying at the University of Oregon 1968 to '72

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.660
 for a biology PhD.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.180
 - Okay, so I know we've heard a lot about you in the past

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.180
 in terms of thyroid, your specialty with thyroid hormone,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.020
 physiology, explaining the mechanisms by which

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.860
 you have come to see thyroid activity within the body,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.420
 as well as, like you mentioned, progesterone and pregnenolone

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.620
 and the aging that is one of your specialties.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.600
 In terms of what we're gonna get into this evening

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.600
 with a loose connection to the topic of mitochondria

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.500
 and their job in the body, what they do, how they operate,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.220
 what things decrease their activity,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.900
 and how they are slowly deactivated and the substances

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.180
 that deactivate them over time with aging.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.380
 I think, can I just start with GABA.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.180
 There's a compound called GABA,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.540
 it's an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.500
 And I know there's some herbs that I'd like to link that to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.020
 as we get on with this discussion about things

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.940
 that stimulate the nervous system,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.860
 things that help it to relax, and what that relaxation is

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.860
 as opposed to the excitotoxic effect of stress.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.940
 So in terms of GABA, what do you wanna say, Sarah?

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.500
 - Well, I just wanted to ask Dr. Peat

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.240
 if you can explain simply what the mitochondria is

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.100
 in the cell and the power.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.180
 I've been told it's the powerhouse of the cell.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.740
 And can you please explain that to our listeners

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.300
 in case people might not know what mitochondria is?

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.020
 - That's a good enough definition, I think,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 but there's a very stereotyped textbook-y definition of it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.460
 that it consists of a certain kind of membrane

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.940
 and special enzymes and some DNA separate from the nucleus.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.860
 And it handles various functions

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.420
 other than energy production,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.420
 but steroid synthesis is one of its very important functions.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.340
 It converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, progesterone,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.020
 and those turn into all of the steroid hormones.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.900
 - So is that why people, when they age,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.340
 their cholesterol goes up because their mitochondria

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.380
 isn't as efficient in converting

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.300
 the cholesterol into those hormones?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.340
 - Yeah, and thyroid is the main hormone

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.140
 that activates the oxidative metabolism

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.300
 of the mitochondrion.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.540
 And so if your thyroid is low,

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.340
 the mitochondria don't pull in the cholesterol

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.940
 and turn it to pregnenolone.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.940
 And the other cofactor working with thyroid

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.660
 happens to be vitamin A.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.580
 And that protein in the blood carries thyroid

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.860
 and vitamin A on a single protein

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.900
 and delivers it to the mitochondria over there

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.180
 like a factory with a conveyor belt

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.740
 bringing in the raw materials and the catalysts.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.220
 - And that's how they make the hormones

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.900
 because the cholesterol plus the vitamin A

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.980
 makes progesterone and-

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.980
 - Yeah, the vitamin A is involved in steroid formation

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.900
 in not only the gonads and the adrenals,

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.460
 but also in the brain and the skin.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.900
 The skin and the brain are major steroid endocrine glands.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.300
 - So every cell in our body has a mitochondria

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.860
 and does its job in that particular part of the body.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.500
 But if you don't have adequate thyroid,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.340
 then you won't be getting adequate oxygen

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.780
 into that mitochondria and basic energy production

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.620
 of that cell and cellular function will be decreased.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.660
 - Yeah, red blood cells don't have mitochondria.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.820
 They depend on sugar for their energy, glucose.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.580
 - Okay, just quickly getting onto,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.020
 I just caught on what you said.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.180
 I know in the past you've always mentioned it

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.700
 and I think people who perhaps have heard you speak

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.220
 and have listened to you would begin to understand

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.220
 that the physiological explanations of membranes

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.140
 is pretty flawed.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.860
 When I was studying-

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.180
 - That includes the textbook definition

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.540
 of what a mitochondrion is and how it works.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.220
 They use a membrane

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.820
 and what they call the chemiosmotic hypothesis.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.660
 - Okay.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.340
 - And the membrane has to have certain

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.620
 kind of metaphysical, physical properties.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.540
 And if you look at a real cell oxidizing,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.500
 it turns out that the outer surface of the cell

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.300
 has mitochondrial-like properties.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.540
 The same enzyme reactions using oxygen

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.540
 and consuming electrons happens right at the surface

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.100
 of the cell as well as in the mitochondrion.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.660
 - So the whole supposition

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.620
 that the membrane is a cohesive barrier

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.980
 and it's not fluid, it's not dynamic,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.740
 it's very much a skin,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.260
 which is the way I always understood,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.140
 was told to understand membranes.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.980
 - And with channels.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.060
 - And with channels and pumps and all the rest of it.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.180
 - And what about all the organelles?

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.060
 Is that completely bogus as well?

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.900
 - They are suspected to be artifacts of fixation largely,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.140
 but things are differentiated.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.100
 But when you kill them and take out the water

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.220
 and harden them and slice them,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:50.900
 things don't look the way they did when they were alive.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.780
 - So is there no way they can look at the cell

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.820
 while it's alive?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.580
 - Yeah.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:02.860
 People have done an atlas of the brain, for example,

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.860
 slicing the brain and freezing it and making pictures

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.860
 and then doing the standard fixation

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.980
 where you get a nice sharp image.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.340
 Their size is tremendously different.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.060
 The internal structure, of course, is different too.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.420
 - Well, don't the fixatives change the structure

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.780
 as well though?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.340
 - Yeah.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.300
 Harold Hillman is probably the person most famous

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.220
 for challenging conventional biology,

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.860
 saying that everything is an artifact of fixation.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.740
 - What about the live microscopy?

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:46.580
 - Yeah, where you use a fluorescent stain, for example.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.380
 You can see very amazing things,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.260
 things swirling around and doing things

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:59.260
 that are fairly parallel to the theoretical descriptions,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.940
 but sometimes the structures seem to be

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.420
 more like a whirlwind than an organelle.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:18.460
 In the 1940s, when radioactive isotopes became available,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.100
 the whole idea of the barrier membrane was eliminated.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.300
 Gilbert Ling reviews the history of that,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.340
 but there is no barrier to sodium, for example.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.940
 It just slips in and out of the cell.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.860
 - 'Cause I was always taught about the sodium potassium ATP

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.300
 eggs which needed a molecule of ATP to pump in

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.980
 and pump out a molecule of sodium and potassium in return.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.620
 - Yeah, but if you take a hair which is perfectly dead

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.620
 and wash out the minerals and then dip it in blood serum

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.780
 or plasma, you get the same unequal distribution

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.820
 of the minerals, potassium inside and sodium outside.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:10.820
 And it's exactly the same principle as a water softener

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.260
 where you charge it with sodium

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.500
 and then it removes calcium from the hard water.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:25.820
 A man named Meiselt wrote a book on things including

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.660
 the physics of water softeners and he recognized

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:38.380
 Gilbert Ling's work in biology as the best explanation

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.180
 for how a water softener works.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.020
 The physics was so good in describing cells

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.820
 that even physicists recognized that it worked

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.420
 for something as common as a water softener.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.420
 But biologists just don't like that way of looking at cells.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:05.300
 It tends to leave out a lot of their favorite beliefs

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.240
 about genes and so on.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.860
 - Is that where the word Meiselt was coined from?

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.700
 - No.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.540
 - No, okay.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.620
 - Just a funny coincidence.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.860
 - All right, you're listening to Ask Your Obdoctor,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.580
 K. E. Meadie Galbraith, 91.1 FM.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.340
 From 7.30 to the end of the show, eight o'clock,

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.780
 you're invited to call in with questions related

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.420
 or unrelated to this month's topic

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.100
 of mitochondria, energy production,

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.540
 and we're gonna cover things like valerian and rhodiola,

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.860
 schizandra and ginseng as typical herbs

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.460
 that have plenty of scientific data

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.700
 and pharmacological data to support their effects

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.500
 in supporting mitochondria and in energy production

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.820
 and mediating the negative effects of stress.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.940
 A number if you live in the area is 923-3911.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.860
 If you're outside of the area,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.780
 there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.620
 Those people listening to us on the web,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.300
 that toll-free number's a good number to call.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.180
 If you have any questions, either related or unrelated,

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.900
 and Dr. Peat is joining us again this month.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.860
 We are going through a pledge drive, folks.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.320
 Those people who perhaps have just tuned in,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.620
 K. E. Meadie Galbraith, 91.1,

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.700
 conducting one of our several pledge drives

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.620
 that go on through the year to raise finances

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.700
 to keep this great show on the air

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.460
 and to keep other shows on the air, not just this one.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.300
 I didn't mean this great show, but great shows on the air.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.140
 - This great station.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.700
 - Yeah, this great station that actually brings out

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.500
 a lot of very alternative information to people

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:34.220
 that's not mainstream.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.180
 You probably won't find this kind of stuff

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.580
 too many other places, so keep it alive

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.380
 because it's rapidly disappearing in this country.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.140
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, you mentioned

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.980
 that there was a single protein

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.340
 which carries vitamin A and cholesterol.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.220
 If you know the name of the protein, great,

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.060
 but otherwise, do you know if there's anything

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.700
 that would be supportive to that protein?

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.060
 That seems like a fairly key intermediary in that process.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.940
 - It's the low-density lipoprotein

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.940
 that delivers cholesterol and then prealbumin

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.900
 or transthyretin, which transports the thyroid

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.140
 and vitamin A.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.780
 - Which is why it'd be so dangerous to have a low LDL,

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.300
 which is what most doctors call the bad cholesterol.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.220
 - It's a good one because it brings us stuff

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.060
 to make progesterone out of.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.420
 - Okay, good, so people, did you get that?

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.900
 Once again, it's just another call to arms, as it were,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.340
 that cholesterol is not the enemy.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.580
 So the LDL cholesterol, which is always coined

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.660
 as the bad cholesterol, is actually the cholesterol

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.580
 that chaperones these very important molecules

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.980
 to enable things like steroid synthesis to occur.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.980
 So without cholesterol, you'd be in bad shape.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.540
 Another fact, I think, I just, I coined,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.740
 I heard this coined not too long ago,

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.180
 was that the brain's white matter is 95% cholesterol.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.380
 So if cholesterol's not important,

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.420
 then why is the brain 95% cholesterol?

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.540
 - Well, that's why they did that study in older people

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.580
 who had low cholesterol were much more prone to dementia.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.260
 - And Dr. Peat, just to let people know, again,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.940
 you always advocate a cholesterol should be

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.340
 between 180 and 200, that's quite healthy,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.180
 and also after 50 years of age,

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.780
 you should be slightly over 200.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.740
 - Yeah, according to the Framingham study,

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.740
 people over 50 who weren't above 200 in their cholesterol

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.380
 were more likely to have dementia.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.380
 - Yeah, okay.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:35.140
 All right, so let's move on to some of those things

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.460
 that have been written about and recorded,

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.980
 and pharmacology's been provided,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.260
 and scientific background's been explained

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.260
 for the action of, but I know that you probably have

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.060
 some other ways of tying in what perhaps we were taught

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.900
 when we were studying how these things worked.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.460
 So perhaps filarium root is one of those herbs

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.420
 that a lot of people would have used,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.820
 would have heard about, and have tried,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.860
 and certainly would have gotten benefits

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.420
 for either insomnia or anxiety as a mild sedative.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.660
 And I was always told that its main attribute

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.180
 was that it provided GABA and prevented the breakdown,

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.540
 so the valeranic acid was actually responsible

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.220
 for inhibiting the breakdown of GABA as well.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.340
 What do you know about GABA as a neurotransmitter,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.020
 and how do you feel about valerian's use

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.860
 being warranted, given what I've said?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.860
 - I think valerian also increases the activity

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.700
 of the enzyme that converts the excitatory glutamic acid

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.700
 into the inhibitory GABA, so it does just about everything

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.740
 needed to protect the brain, increasing GABA,

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.100
 and the effect of GABA.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:57.940
 And GABA is, the system called the GABA receptor

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:05.780
 is probably the most complex bunch of proteins

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.860
 that has the name receptor.

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:15.860
 Many different things affect it in different ways.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:20.860
 Valerian, or valium, the specific molecule,

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:25.900
 apparently binds to it in a way similar to GABA,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:32.540
 and in a slightly different way than progesterone,

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.620
 pregnenolone, and probably the androgens of some types.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:45.260
 And even carbon dioxide probably is involved

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.620
 in binding in some way near this so-called receptor,

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:56.020
 stabilizing a whole system of proteins

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.820
 to turn off the excitatory process in the cell.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.540
 - Yeah, it's a very excitation.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.140
 I think when people hear the word,

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.140
 we need to support its definition.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.820
 Excitatory is a very wasteful situation

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.580
 or state to be in, isn't it?

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.020
 When in terms of the cell being excited,

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.940
 I think for very short-term activity, that's not a problem,

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.980
 but the excitation in general when it's longer term

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.780
 is actually very detrimental to the cell.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.900
 - Yeah, that's what causes brain fatigue

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.980
 if you stay awake too long.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.540
 And if you don't have a good supply of glucose

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.140
 producing carbon dioxide, for example,

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:43.260
 you more quickly get into the fatigued state.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:49.700
 Glucose, one of its functions is actually

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.700
 to substantially contribute to the formation of GABA,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.580
 the part of glucose molecule is involved in the synthesis,

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.180
 but also the carbon dioxide stabilizes it.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:10.780
 And when the glutamic acid is converted into GABA,

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.100
 it also releases carbon dioxide

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.060
 that helps with the inhibitory process.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.740
 So oxidative metabolism in the brain

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.380
 is doing many things, producing GABA

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.380
 and progesterone, pregnenolone, carbon dioxide,

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.820
 and keeping down the excitatory things,

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.500
 lactic acid, nitric oxide,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.420
 glucamic acid, pneumonia, for example.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.060
 - Well, it's estimated that 10% of people

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:48.540
 respond to valerian in the opposite way

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.740
 that you would want them to,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.700
 and they actually get excited from taking valerian,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.420
 almost like cats do when they get around it.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.980
 Can you possibly explain why that might be happening?

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.540
 - No, not at all.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.900
 - Yeah, 'cause there are some people

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.180
 that definitely give feedback of,

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.820
 oh, it woke me up, it didn't help me sleep and relax,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.100
 actually it had the opposite effect.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.220
 - Yeah, it stimulated me, it made me feel jittery.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.620
 - Anyway, it's not a big deal.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.660
 Okay, so I wanted also to bring out

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.100
 that St. John's wort is another herb

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.860
 that's posited to be a reuptake inhibitor of GABA,

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.420
 and that compound was shown to be hyperforin,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:36.420
 which was one of the actives that are sometimes standardized

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.100
 in terms of making a standardized extract of St. John's.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.740
 And then I also found some evidence here

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.820
 to show that lemon balm was shown to be

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.460
 a GABA transaminase inhibitor,

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.460
 so that is it blocks the enzyme GABA transaminase,

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.660
 which converts GABA to a compound

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.800
 called succinic semialdehyde and glutamate.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.540
 So all of these reactions are reversible

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.180
 for very obvious reasons,

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.380
 and the body obviously has a very fine tune

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.300
 in order to keep this whole homeostasis running properly

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.300
 and preventing over-excitation and over-restfulness,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.300
 somnambulance almost in some ways.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.300
 I did read the article on mitochondrial disease.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.100
 There's a known syndrome of it,

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.620
 and one of its main downsides,

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.780
 obviously it's a complete downside having a syndrome,

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.260
 but one of the main downsides

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.980
 is the kind of somnambulance that you get with it

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.580
 where people just either getting seizures

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.420
 and just being completely unable to perform.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.740
 - In terms of keeping that balance

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.660
 between the GABA-ergic side of keeping things stable

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.660
 and calm, are we even to think of that

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.860
 as being the optimum state

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.540
 and that actually it's like thyroid

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.500
 where thyroid itself is not at all a stimulant,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.300
 it actually helps you relax,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.340
 helps the cell repolarize and re-energize

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.260
 its resting potential?

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.220
 - I call that the high-energy resting state

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.140
 in which the cells all through the body,

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.660
 especially in the brain,

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.180
 have so much energy that they're ready to do anything.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.540
 But when you get very fatigued,

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.620
 they lack the energy needed

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.340
 to replenish that work-ready condition,

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:42.340
 and so they are in sort of a hypersensitive state.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.180
 A agitated condition.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.180
 Their voltage, so-called resting voltage,

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.100
 goes very low and they stay in a more or less

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.100
 constantly excited but unable to work condition.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:05.300
 And magnesium is one of the things

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.900
 that helps to restore the relaxed state.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:13.460
 Thyroid helps you to retain magnesium.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.460
 Magnesium stabilizes the high-energy ATP molecule,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:24.180
 and without thyroid you can't make that very quickly.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.900
 And so if you have adequate thyroid-producing

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.460
 oxidative energy and producing ATP,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.180
 that causes the cell to retain magnesium,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:39.780
 and that complex of things holds the cell

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:44.780
 in a ready-to-work state with lots of reserve energy.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.460
 Simply a magnesium deficiency will cause seizures,

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.900
 insomnia, inflammation,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.900
 everything that a lack of energy leads to.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:03.540
 - So do you think then it's very important to,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.060
 and I'm saying this because I understand

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.700
 that this is the way, but just for our listeners,

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.060
 to have small amounts of sugars, foods regularly

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:17.060
 so that your body's energy supply is constantly stocked

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:22.060
 rather than going four, six hours or more without food

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.780
 and then having a loaded meal

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:30.540
 in terms of keeping mitochondria as happy as possible

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.300
 rather than allowing them to get depleted

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.420
 to a point where they're no longer really able

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.700
 to bounce back or for you to be able

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.060
 to pick up again relatively quickly?

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.060
 - And the B vitamins are essential

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.460
 for using oxygen efficiently in the mitochondria.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.020
 - Okay. - Vitamin B1, biotin B2.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.060
 - Okay, all right.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.300
 So what about melatonin?

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.740
 Let's move on to melatonin as a substance

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.020
 that I've read quite a few articles,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.860
 some of which have been very disturbing,

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.780
 I must admit, and we'll get into that in a little bit,

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.820
 but I know most of the advertising for melatonin

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.660
 is very pro-sleeping, pro-relaxing.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.900
 They don't say anything dangerous about it.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.300
 It's naturally produced.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:21.300
 It is found in different products from foods,

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.180
 liquids and foodstuffs.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.580
 So it's a fairly ubiquitous chemical.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.840
 It obviously has a very specific function.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.420
 It really does work physiologically and it's very important,

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.140
 but what's your impression of melatonin

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.460
 in terms of its use and whether or not

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.140
 you feel comfortable around it?

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.700
 - Well, I think the good side of it

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.260
 is that in the fatigued state of the brain,

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.100
 the excitatory de-energized condition,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.780
 nitric oxide rises and starts a vicious circle

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.220
 in which it activates acetylcholine,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.820
 which activates nitric oxide synthesis

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.140
 and it rises and can keep you awake.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.140
 And melatonin is effective at turning off that cycle.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.700
 So when your brain is in a bad, fatigued state,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.780
 melatonin can protect it by getting down

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.820
 the nitric oxide and excitation.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.660
 - But wouldn't that be like in a small dose

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.740
 or is it different for every patient?

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.740
 - Yeah, one publication refers to the physiological dose,

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.900
 which would be equivalent in an average sized adult

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.860
 to five micrograms per body.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:53.780
 An ultra small amount would replenish your whole body.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.060
 Others have measured it as up to maybe two or three

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.700
 milligrams in the whole body

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.580
 as a physiological concentration.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.740
 So when a person takes 10 milligrams for sure,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.940
 it will put them to sleep,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.780
 but it probably is doing lots of other things.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.340
 And in the antioxidant experiments

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.940
 or the radiation protection experiments,

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.460
 they've used something like a thousand

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.060
 or maybe a million times the concentration

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.780
 that exists physiologically.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.500
 So it can do amazing things

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.300
 like protect you against gamma rays.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:39.660
 But if you do that more than during

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.380
 or shortly after the exposure,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:47.140
 the outcome might have unexpected consequences.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.620
 It was only in the later 1990s

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:55.620
 when the material became very cheap and widely sold

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:01.060
 that all of this amazing stuff about being

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:06.060
 a little anti-cancer, anti-stress, anti-inflammatory,

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.780
 issue protecting against everything,

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.500
 all of these studies came out by the thousands.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.100
 But when I was in graduate school,

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.660
 it wasn't even certain that melatonin

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.140
 was the main pineal hormone.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.140
 And what was known was that the pineal extract

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.580
 had very specific effects

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.740
 that imitated nighttime and winter.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:43.660
 And in the winter, all animals from fish,

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:48.660
 turtles, lizards, rats, sheep, and so on,

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:54.060
 everyone's reproductive system

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.780
 shrinks away during the winter.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:01.780
 Some species can manage to reproduce in the winter,

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.260
 but in general, it's a principle

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.060
 that not only the gonads regress,

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.500
 but the thymus gland regresses

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.780
 in all of these different types of animals.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:18.780
 And the thymus atroviar involution during the winter

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:24.020
 strongly affects the way the immune system works.

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.980
 And that's part of why people are more susceptible

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.860
 to infections during the winter.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:35.860
 And this involution of both the reproductive glands

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.620
 and the immune thymus gland,

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:46.540
 this has lots of behavioral consequences.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:51.540
 Everyone knows about the seasonal affective disorder

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.900
 or winter sickness in which depression

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.740
 and weight gain become so common

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.380
 during the winter, long nights.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:05.740
 And melatonin is the main thing

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.740
 that causes involution of the thymus gland and gonads.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.780
 The original studies were done

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.820
 with extracts of the pineal gland,

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:21.780
 but you get effectively the same thing just with melatonin.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.020
 - So what about different parts of the world?

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.700
 You know, like if someone was in Hawaii.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.700
 - Yep, the seasonal changes don't exist near the equator.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:34.300
 - So their thymus and...

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.740
 - Yeah, you don't have the winter sickness

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.340
 or winter immune disturbance.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.940
 - Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Obloxer,

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.540
 KMUD Galbraith 91.1 FM.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:46.820
 From now to later clock,

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.620
 callers are invited to call in questions

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.260
 either related to what we've been talking about so far

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.020
 from GABA to melatonin,

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.260
 to the various mitochondrial issues.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.900
 Number here is 391, sorry, 923-3911,

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.780
 or 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:07.540
 That's 1-800-568-3723.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.700
 Okay, Dr. Peat, I had some articles

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.180
 that I was reading this afternoon

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.380
 whilst putting this together

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.340
 to see if this was gonna be something

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.420
 that we were gonna be supporting

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.660
 or helping people discourage the use of,

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.460
 'cause I know melatonin's use along with serotonin

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.660
 is very popular, but not always a good thing.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.980
 I did read the papers,

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.940
 and again, there was conflicting information on PubMed.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.020
 Some of the information was saying, for example,

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.820
 that melatonin suppresses tumor aerobic metabolism,

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.180
 which is the kind of Warburg effect

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.940
 that Otto Warburg described.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.300
 And some of them said that melatonin

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.580
 was actually pro-cancerous.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.020
 How do you see that?

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.220
 - Some of that varies with the variety of mouse

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.900
 that they're using, for example.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:02.220
 In some studies, they've implanted an extra pineal gland

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.820
 or used melatonin.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.820
 Sometimes it decreases tumors.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.540
 Sometimes it increases them.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:17.260
 The effect on the immune system partly depends on the dose.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:24.180
 And when you're using a thousand-fold variation in doses,

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.820
 that's the first thing you have to think of.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.140
 What's actually happening physiologically

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.860
 in the normal range?

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:39.620
 A lot of studies are getting anti-inflammatory

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.300
 and antioxidant effects,

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.980
 but at least two groups,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.460
 one in China and one in Denver,

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:53.460
 are seeing very clear pro-inflammatory effects

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.940
 from physiological amounts of melatonin.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.780
 - There you go.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.620
 Okay, so--

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.620
 - It doesn't seem like you'd want to be taking

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:05.580
 something that triggers the wintertime response.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:09.740
 - That's what I've always thought.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.500
 In our hamster lab,

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:17.140
 we noticed that even though the lab was supposedly

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.460
 well-insulated and temperature-controlled

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:23.380
 and had a 12-hour light and dark cycle,

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.580
 the hamsters during the winter

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.460
 had essentially no thymus gland.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.860
 That was one of the things that started me thinking

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:35.740
 about the potential risk of

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:42.660
 changing your whole endocrine system

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.100
 by supplementing something like that.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.900
 - Okay, we have a caller on the air,

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:49.900
 so let's take this first caller here.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:50.940
 See, caller, where are you from?

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.820
 You're on the air?

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.180
 You're on the air?

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.300
 I think your engine is waving around.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.820
 I'm not too sure what's going on.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.900
 We have a caller on the air, though, but go ahead.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.940
 Yeah, I think--

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.220
 - Caller, you're on.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.340
 You can speak up.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:18.180
 - Okay, so someone needs to find out how to get that going

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.060
 'cause we do have a caller,

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.500
 but they're not coming through at the moment, so.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:27.620
 Okay, well, until we get this caller back,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.980
 let's just ask you about the,

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.900
 I think you did mention this early on,

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.980
 but just to reiterate,

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:37.060
 again, I had read some information about melatonin

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.100
 potentially helping in radiation oncology treatments

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.820
 where people get radiotherapy.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.860
 What do you think about that in terms of

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.300
 its negative effects that we've heard about?

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.500
 Actually, let's hold it there before we go any further.

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.220
 Let's take this caller whilst they're on the air.

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:56.180
 Let's take 'em, where are you from, caller?

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.100
 Okay, we're getting messed around here.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.660
 Might be something to do with the pledge drive

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.060
 and all the calls coming in to pour money

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.540
 into the studio to keep us going.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.380
 Okay, so Dr. Peat, what do you think about

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.740
 the use of melatonin in radiotherapy, perhaps?

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:19.820
 - If you're bound to have the radiation,

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:24.820
 I think that the very large doses of melatonin

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:30.180
 are probably very protective against that damaging effect.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:35.460
 The trouble with using it for treating tumors

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.460
 is that you can kill off all of the actual bulk cells

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.140
 of the tumor, which are really defective

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:49.140
 and weak cancer cells that are in the normal tumor.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:53.060
 They're being replaced very quickly.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.060
 And when you kill them off,

00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:00.060
 you irritate the region where the tumor was

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.700
 and stimulate that region's ability

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:07.180
 to recruit new repair cells.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:12.180
 And those cells zoom into the irradiated area

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.260
 and recreate the tumor,

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.820
 because you haven't cured the organism's problem.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.540
 - Because it is a very,

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.380
 and I'll just say the last word on melatonin.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.820
 The only reason I was asking for its use in radiotherapy

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.620
 was that it's potently antioxidant.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.940
 And like you said, potentially for what it is

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.260
 and what it's capable of structurally,

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.780
 it's very good at mopping up free radical damage

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.660
 causing compounds.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.580
 So I think that was some of the reason

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.380
 for the research that was done on it.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.580
 Okay, well, let's move on to,

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.420
 I've got a few other things I wanted to ask you about.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:52.020
 And I know you know, as usual, you know plenty about it.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.580
 I didn't even know that you had looked at it,

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.500
 but I know I'd spoken to you a while back here

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.540
 and you'd mentioned what you had known.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.900
 So Rhodiola rosea is a crassula,

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.500
 so that kind of a fleshy,

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:12.100
 thick, fleshy-leaved succulent type of plant.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.980
 I didn't realize that it's actually been used

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.020
 for about 3,500 years.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.660
 It was first mentioned 13th century BC

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.820
 and in the Greek Bronze Age.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.820
 And then there was documentation,

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.220
 plenty of documentation about the Vikings

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.660
 using it to enhance physical strength and endurance.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.900
 And then obviously lots of Chinese data

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.820
 about the emperor sending expeditions to Siberia

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.780
 to bring back this golden root,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:42.780
 which is its common name for medical preparations.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.220
 And then I know we talked about adaptogens in the past,

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:50.060
 but this is another one of those kind of golden adaptogens

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.460
 that was discovered in '47,

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.100
 the term adaptogen by the Russian scientist Nikolai Lazarev,

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:58.540
 who coined that fact.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:03.540
 And then Dr. Lazarev was also a mentor of Dr. Breckman,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:08.100
 who conducted extensive research on adaptogenic herbs.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.940
 So Rhodiola rosea, in terms of it being an adaptogen,

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:17.500
 being a physical enhancement,

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.220
 a cognitive enhancer, anti-cancer.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.220
 Do you know much about Rhodiola

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.220
 and perhaps how you'd see that being supportive

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.220
 in terms of mitochondrial protection or anti-stress?

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.900
 - Yeah, I happen to be studying

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.740
 the progesterone family of steroids

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.980
 around the same time I was running into ginseng

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.180
 and Rhodiola research.

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:51.180
 And Hans Selye had the concept of catotoxic steroids,

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.780
 he called them.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.620
 - Catotoxic?

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.620
 - Catotoxic, they destroyed the toxin effect.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:05.740
 And it isn't exactly the same as detoxifying,

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.980
 but they protect the organism

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.300
 by blocking the effect of a toxin.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:17.300
 And I think that's one of the effects of the adaptogens.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.900
 They have some steroids that are analogous

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.740
 to progesterone and testosterone

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:30.740
 in that catotoxic or stress-blocking effect.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:36.860
 And a Russian heart researcher, Felix Mayerson,

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.700
 was continuing Hans Selye's concept of stress

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.820
 and adapting to stress

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.540
 and applying it on the mitochondrial level,

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:55.540
 which Hans Selye never really focused very much on.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:40:00.660
 But Mayerson's idea was that we have many layers

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:07.520
 of stress-limiting signals and hormones and processes

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.520
 and it happens that the steroids

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:19.880
 are one major stress-limiting system

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:26.520
 where cortisol and serotonin and nitric oxide and estrogen

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.680
 activate the short-term stress reactions

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.680
 that can stimulate brief defense.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.180
 If those continue, they destroy the organism.

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.240
 So you need a stress-ending process.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:46.040
 And that's where the progesterone,

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.840
 testosterone, pregnenolone come in

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.120
 and things that turn off the nitric oxide

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.960
 and serotonin and estrogen.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.160
 And it happens that these plants

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:04.160
 not only have the steroid level of stress-limiting factors,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.360
 but many other types of substances,

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.360
 the polyphenols and flavonoids, for example,

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.840
 specifically turn off nitric oxide production

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.840
 and limit the excitatory serotonin pathway, for example,

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:26.380
 which turns on cortisol.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:28.680
 - I want to ask you about that

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.740
 in relation to red compounds too,

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:32.920
 but we do have a caller on the air.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.760
 - Let's try again.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.680
 Caller, you're on the airwave, on third time lucky.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.960
 - San Francisco, California.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.160
 - San Francisco, California.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.000
 Welcome to the show.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.600
 What's your question for Dr. Peat?

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.440
 - Hi, Dr. Peat.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.600
 I wanted to know what causes tooth decay

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.040
 and how do you reverse it?

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.520
 - What causes what?

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.360
 - Tooth decay.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.200
 - Tooth decay.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.360
 - Oh, I think it's stress-related.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.360
 There is one type of cavity

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:03.400
 that starts with a dark area,

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.400
 or just, I think the stress one starts with a white area

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.080
 rather than the usual dark area,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.600
 and it comes on very fast

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.600
 with the mobilization of calcium

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:24.280
 from the dentine under the influence of stress.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.160
 Another kind is related to stress

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.760
 starting from the outside

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.680
 with the mobilization of calcium

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.960
 because of imbalances

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.240
 and pro-inflammatory factors in the saliva.

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:47.320
 So the basic thing is to keep your energy up

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.840
 and stress low so that you don't

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.400
 have either harmful saliva

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.400
 or an internal anti-calcium system.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.480
 And vitamin D and vitamin K

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.800
 are very important for putting calcium into the,

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.600
 keeping it in the heart tissue.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.680
 Serotonin, in the last three or four years,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:21.680
 has been found to be a major calcium disruptor

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.120
 in the bones and teeth as well.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:30.120
 So it's really a matter of your total systemic health

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.040
 more than just what happens in your mouth.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:39.440
 - Wow, thank you very much.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.080
 - Thank you for your caller, caller.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.040
 Okay, well, I guess we have time.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.080
 If it's eight minutes to eight, let's just see.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.160
 We'll let people know anyway.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.360
 Otherwise, we'll carry on here for the next eight minutes.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.880
 But if you're in the area, the number's 923-3911.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.880
 Or if you're outside the area,

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:57.560
 there's a toll-free number, 1-800-KMUDRAD,

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.400
 or 1-800-568-3723.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.880
 So we've got about five minutes or so

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.920
 before we need to wrap up.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.080
 - So Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask you about hypericin,

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.600
 you know, the red oil from St. John's Wort that you can make.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.000
 I remember you saying something to me

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.920
 about red compounds are very antioxidant

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.480
 and protective.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:23.880
 - Yeah, that is a big polycyclic molecule

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.240
 that the reason it's red is that it is,

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.240
 the electrons resonate and absorb a lot of light.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:39.120
 And that makes it analogous to the molecules

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.760
 such as in cascara, imodin, or in aloe,

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.960
 and in the tetracycline antibiotics,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:51.640
 and the tricyclic antidepressant,

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.920
 antiserotonin, antihistamine agent.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:55.760
 - How about Pau d'Arco?

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.120
 There's a dark root and Catawaba bark is a--

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:04.120
 - Yeah, exactly that same type of polycyclic molecule.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:08.680
 I think it's analogous to the stabilizing

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.840
 multi-ring steroid molecules.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.840
 They have a kind of geometric stabilizing action

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.600
 on the microstructure of the cell,

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.200
 as well as the electronic withdrawing effect.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:29.200
 When a cell is stressed and its voltage goes down,

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:34.800
 the local electrons, in effect, are concentrated.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:42.080
 They become very active and reduce or attack molecules

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:47.280
 that they shouldn't be acting on.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.120
 When you don't have enough oxygen,

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.400
 you get loose electrons that cause mischief

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.440
 all through the cell.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.840
 - That's what we term free radical reaction?

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.200
 - Yeah.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.880
 - Okay, now, Eubiquinone is another one

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.240
 of those structural molecules,

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.960
 similar to the structures that are formed by the compounds

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.120
 that give those dark red pigments.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:15.800
 Eubiquinone, and then I was gonna ask you about Bio-PQ-Q,

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.160
 which seems to be the latest kid on the block

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:23.000
 in terms of the most potent antioxidant

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.120
 and mitochondrial stimulator going.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.360
 It's kind of another form of Eubiquinone.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.320
 - Yeah, I'm not sure how important it is

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:38.280
 to have the most potent antioxidant.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.280
 - Well, in marketing, it's very important, but that's--

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:47.520
 - The vitamin K happens to stabilize Eubiquinone.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.560
 And all of these things work in a system.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.840
 So when you're using vitamin C,

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.680
 it is in an oxidized form that keeps vitamin E

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.600
 in the right condition, and these and progesterone

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.840
 keep Eubiquinone and vitamin K in the right system.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:12.840
 It's a much more organized system

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.800
 on the small molecule level than the big molecule

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.680
 people usually recognize.

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:23.200
 - Okay, all right, so B vitamins, very quickly here.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.560
 In terms of mitochondria, I know we've mentioned here

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:30.960
 CoQ10, Eubiquinone, and BioPQQ,

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.040
 if people want to take a look at that and whatever research.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.040
 - Doesn't CoQ10 stabilize the vitamin K?

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.960
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.120
 - They work together with the mitochondria.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.200
 - So the B vitamins are also very important

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.040
 in terms of electronic stability.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.040
 - Yeah, keeping the cell pretty free of lactate,

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.240
 because lactate represents the shift

00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.880
 towards loose electrons that get in trouble.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.080
 - Right, okay, and then--

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.480
 - Buffalo liver pate.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.080
 (laughing)

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.960
 For your B vitamins.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.880
 - We do like buffalo liver pate, by the way.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.760
 And then the antioxidants, obviously,

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.560
 things like vitamin C and vitamin E.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.360
 We've already mentioned those in plenty

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.480
 of different instances where they're important.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.840
 Well, Dr. Peat, thank you so much for joining us.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.000
 I know we didn't get, we got one caller.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.440
 I think it probably, I'm not too sure why.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.160
 Sometimes it's lots, sometimes it's not many,

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.120
 but anyway, I know the show's gonna get listened to

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.480
 on the web and on the audio archives,

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.720
 and I know lots of people call me later.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.080
 I get several weeks or months, even,

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.880
 people telling me how they listen to this and that show.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.840
 So it's recorded there for future history,

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.880
 as long as our species exists, put it that way.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.400
 So thanks so much for your time, Dr. Peat.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.440
 - Okay, thank you.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.400
 - Thank you, good night.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.480
 - Okay, so for those people who've found the show

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.720
 this evening for the first time,

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:50.880
 Dr. Raymond Peat has got a wealth of information

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.880
 on his website, that is www.raypeat.com.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.080
 Plenty of scholarly articles, fully referenced.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.520
 He's always writing articles,

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.040
 so usually every month he produces a newsletter.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.160
 I'm not too sure how subscription to that's going.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.400
 I think at one point he stopped it

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.040
 'cause it was getting out of control,

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.120
 but I'm not too, people should definitely ask him

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.600
 if it's still available, though don't take my word for it.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.760
 I think things may have improved a little,

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.560
 but I know he's a very busy person, so.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.200
 - Just check his website.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.560
 - Yeah, just check his website.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.680
 Okay, and we can also be reached toll free,

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:27.360
 1-888-WBMER, Monday through Friday, nine to five.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.320
 And my name's Andrew Murray,

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.520
 until the third of, the third Friday of next month.

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.720
 Have a good night.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.960
 - My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray, and good night.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:40.240
 And before, I wanna make sure that we gave Ray Peat's email,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.440
 I mean, website, www.raypeat.com.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.440
 And our website is www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.720
 Thank you for listening.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:51.720
 Thank you.
