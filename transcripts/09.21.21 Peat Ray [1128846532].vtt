00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Broadcasting from the beautiful Hill Country in Texas, this is OneRadioNetwork.com

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Well, a very pleasant good afternoon to you. We are back here. It is about a little bit after noon, a couple minutes after noon, Central Time, OneRadioNetwork.com, and this is Patrick Timpone.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 The gentleman you see, the picture you see to my immediate left is Dr. Ray Peat. He is a PhD. He has been at this game of nutrition and such for a very, very long time.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 He taught at medical universities and lived down in Mexico for a while. He has been working with people and now he just writes. He does his own newsletter, Ray Peat Newsletter.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 We will let you know how to get that one. He has got me drinking a lot of orange juice. Well, he did not really get me drinking orange juice, but after talking to you for a long time, Dr. Peat, I am drinking a lot of orange juice.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 I can't believe, you know, I went my whole life, Dr. Peat, thinking, well, orange juice, it can't be good. I mean, it is just too much sugar, right? I just didn't do it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Yeah, a lot of people are still saying that, but if you look at the total picture, it even contains some protein, but one of the most important things is the anti-inflammatory flavonoids. It is like a medical shop in terms of the complexity of the anti-inflammatory mixture in it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 But so all the sugar obviously doesn't, I mean, it doesn't have any negative effects for me anyway.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 The high content of potassium in the juice, potassium has a function similar to insulin that lets you absorb and use the sugar without resorting to increased insulin.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 So, it doesn't at all have the fattening influence that starches or plain sugar would have.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 So, you could almost get more of an insulin thing or sugar with a big plate of pasta than you can orange juice, right?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Yeah, the sugar in orange juice is mostly sucrose, which in itself is much less glycemic or insulin stimulating than the glucose that drives from starch.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Okay, so we eat pasta, bread, and things like that. That's more of a glucose and that plays more, has an effect on the insulin.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Yeah, there are charts of the glycemic index foods and the starch and glucose are at the top and juices are actually down the list.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Okay, so generally when folks want to lose weight, we get plenty of those questions.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 What are some things that you recommend that they do to take out and to put in, to lose weight?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 One of the things you want to do is stop eating the things that slow your metabolism, that inhibit your thyroid and damage your mitochondria and block oxygen use and heat production.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 The worst of those foods are the polyunsaturated fats and the very high starchy foods like pasta are the next in line.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 But the PUFA accumulate in your body and turn off your thyroid in different ways and damage your mitochondria so that your ability to burn calories decreases as the polyunsaturated fat in the food is stored in your body.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Canola, corn oil, safflower, all of those are highly polyunsaturated and butter is a very relatively highly saturated food.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 So it can be fattening if you eat enough of it, but against a background of history of having eaten a lot of soy oil and so on, just adding a little coconut oil, which is quickly absorbed and oxidized, can increase your heat production.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 But the ability to produce heat from your food is the thing to pay attention to and sugar.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 In a lot of experiments, just adding sugar to your diet can increase your metabolic rate by 20%.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 So you can actually lose weight increasing your metabolism with sugar?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 Yes, if you're shifting from a standard diet to polyunsaturated fat, shifting to include things like a lot of fruit or orange juice in particular, keeping your calories at the same level, your metabolic rate is going to increase so that you'll be hotter, your temperature

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 will not drop so low during the night and will tend to stay around a normal 98.6 during the daytime.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 So the poofers, Dr. Peat, are mostly, I don't know if people even use corn oil, I guess they do, but mostly in more processed foods, right?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Like salad dressings and all kinds of stuff where they put coconut oil and soybean oil, that's probably where people get most of them?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Yeah, and mayonnaise and salad dressings.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Yeah, all that stuff. They put those poofers everywhere. They put them everywhere, right?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 When they started doing that is when Americans started getting obese.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 And during this time, there have been people claiming that too much sugar is why Americans are getting obese, but if you look at the grain products consumption during the last several decades, that's what has increased and refined sugar has actually not increased during this obesity epidemic.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 The background of it is that in the 1950s, they were selling the idea that polyunsaturated fats are essential oils and they blurred that concept of essentiality to mean good for you regardless of the quantity.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And so they said the more you eat, the lower your cholesterol will be. And they were basing the whole thing on the idea of cholesterol as a poisonous material rather than a defensive substance.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Protective substance for the arteries.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Protective for the brain, the heart, everything depends on cholesterol as a source of, for example, progesterone.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 If you are studying the amount of progesterone that an ovary can produce and you add cholesterol to the blood going into the ovary, the amount of progesterone increases coming out the other side of the ovary.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 So it's massively constantly being used for protective substances.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 Really? Wow. Very interesting.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 This is a great question I want to ask you about.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 So, it's been said, do you think that men and women actually smell the immune system?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Do you think that's possible of the other person and that's why they are attracted to them?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Some people argue that while you're attracted to a person because they got a good immune system and they could maybe have children.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 Do you think that's possible?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 Oh, sure.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Oh, sure, he said. Oh, really? I thought it was kind of a crazy thing. Really, tell me.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 Not just the immune system, but the pheromones. In the case of the attractiveness of men to women, there's a definite derivative of testosterone which is very volatile, tends to come out through the skin constantly.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 The amount of that, people have experimented with it, taking, just extracting it right from the surface of the skin or synthesizing the same chemical and putting a tiny amount, just a milligram or so, like a mask.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Putting on the women as they're evaluating, just pictures of a man, for example.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 And they'll say the man is beautiful and intelligent and kind and so on, if they have that pheromone present.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Isn't that fascinating. So, if they smell a little testosterone, it's almost like an instinctual, spiritual, whatever, deep thing that maybe they can have a baby, which is what a lot of girls want to do, right?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Yeah, I got interested in that when I was about 11 months old.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Come on, really?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 I had a 15 year old babysitter and I remember standing on her thigh and my nose had just reached her cheek and I remember the intoxicating smell of this young, healthy woman as better than any flower perfume.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 Isn't that, and you remember this when you were 11 months old, Dr. Peter?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 That was such an outstanding experience.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 How can you forget that, right?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Yeah.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Isn't that, and so it was like a normal kind of thing, you were a guy and you kind of smelt this because this young, vibrant, fertile woman.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 Wow. So, I wonder what that would do then to ladies who go on the pill. You think that would stop this instinct and the guys would not be able to smell them?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 To a great extent it does. The progesterone level following ovulation, it's the source of much of that aroma.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 Oh, so when you're ovulating, then you get the progesterone and that might attract the guys.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 Yeah.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
 Right? But if she's on the pill...

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Yeah, there's no cycle.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 There's no cycle, of course. Could that affect her ability to smell the guys if she's on the pill?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 I think it does.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 There's been stories, and I don't know how true this is, that some women, you know, they marry guys because they're on the pill, right, the whole time?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 And so they marry them because of whatever reason, and then they get off the pill to get a baby, and then they don't like the smell of the guy because they picked the wrong guy.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 I...

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 That could be true. I mean, that's a crazy story, but you know.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 I think it's very logical, biologically.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 Wow. They don't teach you this stuff in PhD school, do they?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 No. I started reading about it because of my awareness of the difference in the skin perfume of different young women, a tremendous difference in attractiveness.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And so I looked up a lot of the studies with animal pheromones, and animals communicate very powerfully.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 They can detect something like one molecule per several cubic centimeters, a dilution that you can't detect with any sort of instrument.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 A moth can detect a potential mate a mile away.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Yeah. And so that would really put a damper on this whole idea of perfumes, right?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Wouldn't you just be blocking all that stuff, even shaving lotion, anything?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Unless they put pheromones in it.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Oh, do they do that?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 Yeah.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Oh, good. That's smart. Where do they get these pheromones, from girls?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 No, they just use synthetic chemicals.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 Oh, they use synthetic chemicals. Wow.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Well, you're talking about looking for love in all the wrong places. Boy, that could get you confused.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 You know, I wondered about that, about dogs like I have a golden doodle.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 And so I'll throw the ball, and maybe she'll not see it or miss it and go into the woods or something, or the weeds.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And she'll just go around for five minutes before smelling it.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Now, how can she smell my hands on that ball, and it's 30 feet away?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 I mean, that's amazing, isn't it, when you think about it? Amazing.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Yeah, people studying moth perception, it's easier to take a moth apart and figure out how it's reacting than with a mammal.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 But dogs are just almost as sensitive as moths in detecting just an occasional molecule.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And people studying the moths have argued that it isn't possible that you could detect a gradient of a mate a mile away,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 and the number of molecules diffusing over such a huge space is just beyond a possible random chance.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 And so they have studied, usually in the infrared radiation frequency, and the vibration of a molecule,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 every time that the atoms oscillate farther away and closer to each other, sort of a bouncing effect within the molecule,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 each movement emits in the infrared frequency.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And they show that the moths are detecting infrared radiation emitted by these distant molecules,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 so that the molecule doesn't really have to contact the animal.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 It's emitting a field that the animal detects.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 My goodness. So no wonder they can smell rabbits.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 In the old days, they used to chase hounds, right? Or even criminals, right?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 They'd get these bloodhounds after criminals?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Yeah. And people actually are much more sensitive.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 The special nerve apparatus that connects the emotional meaning of pheromone to the brain,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 that's actually much more sensitive than a person's conscious sense of smell.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 So that these influences happen far beyond our conscious awareness of smelling a person.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 So we're sitting there with someone and we're just kind of falling madly, right?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 There's no telling what's going on. There could be a lot of stuff going on, on all different levels,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 not that you're just physically attracted to it.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Yeah, the physical attraction really is.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Not much, right?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 Most of it is happening subliminally through your nose.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Wow. Wow.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Ray Peat is with us. Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 He's here on the third Monday, but we had a technical...

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 Mercury in retrograde was having a bad hair day, but he agreed to come back.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 So thanks so much for coming back the following day, Dr. Peat.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 We have lots of good questions for you.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 I'm really going to just throw this out there, because I've been wanting to ask you.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 How do you... This is kind of a big one, but go ahead.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 How do you think we evolved, our species, the human species?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 I'm sure you've got a lot of theories and all the deep work and research that you've done over all these years.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Do you have some, your own theory about how this all happened, how we got here?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Yeah, the origin of life is the first big question.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 I think, for example, there's a youngish professor at MIT who shows that just shining light on molecules,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 they tend to become organized.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Just the energy of the light is enough to create organization.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 So energy flowing through substance is always an organizing principle and process.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 So the primitive origin of living material is much simpler than the people with the mechanistic assumption of randomness in the universe.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 You can't explain anything happening once you commit to that mechanical faith in randomness.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 It just never happens.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 But with the flow of energy leading to organization, things happen spontaneously.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 A professor of chemistry, Sidney Fox, demonstrated that he believed that volcanic energy was the source of this flow of energy,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 and that it was most relevant, although the solar energy is another guiding factor.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 He showed that if you take a mixture of a random assortment of amino acids, and amino acids can occur spontaneously.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 He showed that if you take a mixture of a random assortment of amino acids, and amino acids can occur spontaneously.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 He then sprinkled water on it, just the two simplest operations, and then looked at the result under a microscope,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 and he saw what looked like a multitude of small, round bacteria.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Spontaneously formed proteins from the heat and water combination.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 He showed that those little bacteria-like spheres could assimilate amino acids and make new proteins.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 So they had the enzyme-like function spontaneously.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 It didn't take a chance a billion years to create anything that was popping right out of the nature of existence.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 So it's like life is built, it's a property of matter that simply takes the right conditions to be expressed.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 So then from this idea, then life just sprung out of whatever God is, and then we evolved?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Do you think the species evolved through the oceans and stuff like that?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Yeah, if it went off in the ocean, it might develop jellyfish or something appropriate for the situation.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 But I think the tendency is not just to produce life, but to produce more and more life.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 More and more intelligence, more awareness.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 That's just as much a part of the nature of the universe as to spontaneously form life.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 It's to lead to more and more life and more and more intelligence.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Yeah, that would be the God force just to express more intelligence, right?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Yeah, it implies a sort of pantheism.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 But what about the whole monkey-ape thing? That didn't happen, right?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Which thing?

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 The monkeys and the apes and all that.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 That whole missing link thing, that never... I mean, we are separate from the apes, right? Humans?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Yeah, the chimpanzees went off on a strange vegetarian diet.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 I think humans needed, for one thing, a high concentration of energy in the environment,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 and living in an area with good fruit where energy grows on trees.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I think that's the most likely thing that we could satisfy our need for more and more energy

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 if we had an abundance of sugar-rich, somewhat protein-providing food available.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Right. So this idea would not be... there would be no elimination or separation from

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 a divine creation or God, whatever you want to call it, because it's all part of this, right?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 This is all... we're all immersed in the whole process, God is, whatever God is.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Yeah, there's no random chance involved in the creative process.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 So if we're... I think we're spiritual beings, souls. I wonder when they pop in, maybe they pop in...

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 maybe we're all... maybe souls exist in the sand and stuff, amoebas, right?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 Yeah, the question of where soul appears in the universe.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 People have been more and more generous.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 They used to say babies were unconscious, didn't experience pain.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Even when I was in graduate school, my professors said,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 "No, you don't need to anesthetize a baby to do surgery,"

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 because even though they might be screaming and turning red,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 their brains aren't developed enough to experience pain.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 They told you that in school?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 Right, right, in 1957.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 My goodness, what are these guys smoking?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 That was the standard psychologist opinion.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Wow. Man.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 At the time, I understood that they were insane, but...

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 You knew they were crackers, right?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 You knew they were... wow.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 And so I guess when they then... what do they call it when they take the skin off, the foreskin and all that?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 What do they do that?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Yeah, there are still people who argue you don't need an anesthetic.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 Really? To do that? To get a... what do they call that?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Circumcision.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Yeah, circumcision.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 So people that argue you don't need to do that because the babies don't feel pain?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 That's still argued.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 My goodness.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 I wonder where that whole circumcision came from. Is that a religious thing?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Yeah, there have been a few people trace back the history of it.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 And it's pretty obvious that it was intended as an anti-sexual thing.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Anti-sexual?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 Yeah, to make mating more controllable.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Why would that be?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 For authoritarian purposes, I think.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 You don't want people running around mating just whenever they feel like it.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 So to have a stable society, it's easier if they dull their sexual responses.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 So actually circumcision dulls the sexual...

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 I thought it was the opposite, where it makes the penis more... without the skin it makes it more...

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 No, the foreskin protects the surface membrane so that they're extremely oversensitive.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Without the foreskin, the surface of the end of the penis becomes thickened and loses its sensibility.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 Really? Wow. That's no fun.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 So, Dr. Ray Peat is with us. I can't believe we just went there.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 But that's okay. Stay right there. We're going to do a little commercial and then we'll take some emails. Ready?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 We've got some good ones for you.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Okay.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Stay right there.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 This is Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone, OneRadioNetwork.com.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 He's so much fun to talk to.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 I'm going to tell you all about his website in just a second and where you can get his newsletter.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 I'll tell you right now, it's RayPeat'sNewsletter@gmail.com.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 RayPeat'sNewsletter@gmail.com.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 You can just go on there and you send him an email.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 That's an email address, sorry.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 And then you send him an email and you just sign up.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 And it's very affordable.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 I don't know. I don't even remember what it was.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 But it's just not much money at all.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 And it comes out every couple of months.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 Some really cool stuff and pretty geeky things about your health that you just won't hear anywhere else.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 So, that's a nice way to support him.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 Just RayPeat'sNewsletter@gmail.com.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 There you go.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 This is a conversation with Phil who sells and is the distributor of our sauna a few years ago.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 I mean, this is a while ago, but he's a cool guy.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Listen.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Previously with a long-time friend, Phil Wilson, the exclusive distributor of the Relax Far Infrared Sauna.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 I've been sweating and promoting the benefits of saunas and sweating for 16 years now.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Can you believe it?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 Wow, 16 years.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Regularly that long?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 20 minutes a day for about 15 years now.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Six months ago.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Man, I started doing it every day and I don't think I've missed a day.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 How this has improved my life, I mean, I can't tell you.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 It's pretty amazing.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 I'll tell you what.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 I feel better and better.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 What's going on?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 Well, the proof is definitely in the pudding.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 And if a person would go to YouTube and search for Relax Sauna testimonials,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 they'll get 650 testimonies on what the Relax Sauna has done for different individuals.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 From feeling better to getting rid of extreme pain to getting rid of neuropathy

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 to just helping a person feel more calm, alert, relaxed, tuned in, and everything else.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 And everything else.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 These are really nice units.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 Right now, our current price, because they went up a little bit over in the beginning,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 you know, a few months ago, it was all about the shipping coming in.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 These are made at a medical university in Taiwan.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 Really nice units.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 You can see a picture on audio.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 You can just go on our website and check out the picture.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 And it's a personal unit.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 They come with a very nice chair.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Put a towel over that puppy and then you just sweat.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 You've got to make sure you're drinking plenty of water and get your little electrolyte things that I do.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 I use a calcium, I think it's calcium bicarbonate, a couple other things.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 I use a liquid one. That's the one I like.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 But, you know, you can find some different electrolytes.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 And, well, let's not repeat about some electrolytes in foods.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 I guess food. I bet you my orange juice has got electrolytes.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Just email me if you'd like to get one.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 1,295 delivered in the lower 48.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 1,295 delivered in the lower 48.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And just email me, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 We ship them all over the world, too.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 Here's a little basic information on our hydrogen that we breathe and drink the water from George Wiseman.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 And if I put the lever up, it would work.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 This was previously with George Wiseman about his AquaCure machine making hydrogen, gas and water out of the same hose.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Listen.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 The body accepts that gas and uses it to heal everything.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 It's like the fountain of youth.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 It's astonishing the amount of ailments.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 In fact, in scientific studies, and they have over a thousand scientific studies now,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 they are showing that it either helps the body heal directly or indirectly from virtually every ailment that ails any water-based life form.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 But it works just as well on animals and plants and lizards and birds and everybody.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 And you're saying this because this machine called the AquaCure split into five different parts.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 Six.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 I got hydrogen, oxygen, electro, enhanced water, water vapors, monatomic hydrogen. What else?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 And monatomic oxygen.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 Oh, the monoxygen.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 And that's what your machine does?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 It splits it?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Yes, it makes that mixture inside the machine and all that comes out of a single hose.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 The same hose.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Gas?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 Has a gas in gaseous form, yes.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 And you breathe it or you put it in water?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 So if you bubble the browns gas into this water, into let's say distilled water, it will go to a negative ORP.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 And when you drink that, it actually gives your body an electrical energy.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 These electrons. Instead of sucking energy from you, it gives it.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 So you can have water that is healthful and not healthful just by the energy that's in the water.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 You want to get one? Me too. Ours is on the way.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 Well, that was two years ago and we got it and we've been breathing and we love it.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
 I think you'll enjoy it too. Try it. It's fun stuff.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 You can go to molecularhydrogeninstitute.org or com, I think it's a com, and check it out.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 And you'll see just hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed studies on the molecular hydrogen.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 It's used mostly in Japan and China, but they're beginning to do it now.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 And they're having some great results with cancer cells.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 We don't make any claims like it's going to cure your cancer.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Don't trust me. We don't do that.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 But also with people recovering more easily from the dreaded strokes and all that.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 When people lose mobility.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 So it's pretty interesting.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Molecularhydrogeninstitute.org or com, I believe.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 And then just come on my website, patrick@oneradionetwork.com.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 There's an email if you'd like to get more questions.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 Then go to the website and you'll see the hydrogen there.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 Click on it, promo code "oneradio" and you get yourself one.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 And it's a lifetime warranty.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 So I think it's a pretty good thing to kind of do.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 You know what I mean?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 From the hill country in Texas, this is oneradionetwork.com.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Dr. Ray Peat is here. His website is rayPeat.com.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 He has a Ph.D. in biology from the University of Oregon.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Specialization in physiology.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And he's taught at different medical schools in Montana State University.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 Spent some time in Mexico.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 And now is up in Oregon and is here once a month.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 So this is two or three questions on this one.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 So I'm going to do this one first, Dr. Peat.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 People are concerned with loved ones that even though they didn't do this injection,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 they want to know about wives and husbands and daughters that have.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 Anything that they can do to mitigate the potential dangers of this thing, whatever it is.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 The spike protein is the toxic part of the virus when it infects you.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 And it's exactly the spike protein that is produced inside your body as a result of the vaccination.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 So exactly the same things that protect you from the virus itself will help to protect against the symptoms of spike protein injection.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 And those are basically anti-inflammatory things of all sorts as long as they're non-toxic.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 And anti-coagulant and usually anti-inflammatory things tend to be also anti-coagulants because inflammation leads to clotting of the blood.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 But some doctors like Peter McCullough use well-known drugs that are a combination of anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 But common substances are orange juice, vitamin D, aspirin, progesterone, lidocaine even, coffee.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 Coffee has been found to be very protective against the COVID infection and undoubtedly will help to protect against the vaccine.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Wow, good stuff. Coffee, orange juice, what's not to like, right?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 And I guess ivermectin, Dr. Peat, is anti-inflammatory. That's one of the big things that that does?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 Yep. Also hydroxychloroquine, very anti-inflammatory.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Bitter things in general tend to be helpful, anti-coagulants and anti-inflammatory.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Quinine is one of our oldest broad spectrum drugs.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 And the chloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine are derivatives of quinine.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Did they use quinine water years ago to help people get rid of some kind of disease?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Cramps. They help with sleep disorders and cramps by being anti-inflammatory.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Can you even get real quinine water these days? Do they sell it?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 Yeah, tonic water they call it.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 Just tonic, quinine tonic water. And it helps with sleep because it's anti-inflammatory.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Yeah.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Wow, that's pretty cool.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 Here's an email for you from Charita.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 My daughter went to the gynecologist yesterday and the doctor saw right off that she had a lump on her thyroid.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 My daughter is very thin, exercises every day, is cold most of the time, and her neck and ears have been bothering her.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 What is, Dr. Peat, do you think that this could be the cause, the lumps, and what could she do to shrink it?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Did she get blood tests?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 She doesn't say, Doc.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 When your TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone, is chronically elevated because you have eaten thyroid-blocking foods,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 which could be polyunsaturated fats or too much cabbage or related vegetables containing thyroid suppressors,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 the TSH keeps driving your thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone to compensate for the toxins in your diet.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 And that constant stimulation, for example, if you spend 40 years consuming iodized salt, the incidence of thyroid cancer is much higher.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 But the nodules are the first sign of something interfering with the function of your thyroid hormone,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 tending to keep your thyroid stimulating hormone elevated unnecessarily.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
 Above one, and you like it below one, right?

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 Actually below 0.4, as people in that range are basically immune to thyroid cancer.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 Immune. And so, do we know, Dr. Peat, why the little lumps form in a case like this, what they're doing?

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 Is it just toxins?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 It's just evidence of the thyroid being driven beyond its capacity.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000
 For example, estrogen inhibits the release of active hormone,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 but it doesn't inhibit the creation of the protein called thyroglobulin, which leads to the active hormone.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:55.000
 So a high estrogen person, late teens or around menopause, are the times that the estrogen can get out of balance.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Those are the times when the thyroid very often enlarges in women.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:21.000
 But sometimes instead of enlarging evenly, it's being interfered with in ways that favor just a nodule formation.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 I see. So that would coincide with, oftentimes, for low thyroid, some of the symptoms are often difficulty swallowing.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 So because the thyroid is enlarging?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 Yeah, hoarseness, vocal problems, sometimes loss even of vocal ability to make speech sounds,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 and scrappy, sore throat, difficulty swallowing and so on.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 You can pretty much see whether your own thyroid is enlarged.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 If you look in the mirror and swing your chin from side to side, the motion of the muscles,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 you'll see a sort of a thick pad to each side of your voice box.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 If the thyroid is very enlarged, you can see.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 Oh, you can see it pop out.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Yeah, a soft bulge that stays put.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 If the thyroid is shrunken by supplementing too much thyroid,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:58.000
 you'll tend to see dents between the big muscle at the side of your neck and your voice box.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 The thyroid gland normally makes that smooth, inconspicuous, more or less continuous shape.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 But if it's shrunken too much, then you'll see an indentation in the absence of the thyroid.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 But the thyroid adjusts very quickly.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 So if you have shrunken it by taking too much, you stop taking the overdose,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
 and just overnight you can see the gland return to its normal size.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 Interesting.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 And if you take a large dose of thyroid supplement,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 the gland will quickly begin shrinking to a normal size.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 Does the TSH level adjust that quickly as well?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 Like if you would go in and two weeks later after changing something, or would you have to wait longer?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 Oh, no. It changes in a matter of hours.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 How interesting. In a matter of hours.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 Yeah, the T4 thyroxin has a long half-life in the body of two weeks.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 So it takes about a month for that to change enough that you see a big change in your TSH.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 But if you're using a T3 supplement and you stop, the half-life of that is only about 12 hours to a day.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 And so in two or three days, if you've been on T3 only,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 then you'll see a tremendous increase in your TSH level because the thyroid level has dropped so fast.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 Now the basic thyroid meds that are out there, what are the ones that are even available right now?

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 Is it Nature Throid? Is that still popular?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 The last thing I heard was that they were having some problem,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 and so a lot of the people were changing to Armour or Cenoplus.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 One of the other combinations.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 Novo, Tural, and Cenoplus are two synthetic equivalents of the natural glandular.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 But they work the same well, if I understand correctly.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 They have both active components, T3 and T4.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:46.000
 So the ones that are going around now, they're T3 and T4?

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 Yeah.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
 They're a mixture?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 That's the most practical physiological mixture. It imitates the natural glandular balance.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 And the natural glandular balance, what does that have in it? Are they all of them as well?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Yeah, it also has a little bit of precursors, T1 and T2.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 T2 works just the same as T3, practically.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 But there's only a very tiny amount of that.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Dr. Ray Peat, Patrick Timpone.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Tomorrow we're going to talk with Charlie Sewell.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 Charlie's got a very concise, we think, well thought out,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 he has a whole team of one page religious exemption for this jab.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 We're going to talk about it tomorrow. We'll go through it line by line.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 It's just one page. Not guaranteeing it's going to work,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 but if someone is forcing you to do something, you might want to get this.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 We'll send it to you. And you make two copies, send one, and we'll tell you how to do it.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 That'll be tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 Charlie's a very smart guy. He's got some Supreme Court things in there.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 And pretty interesting.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 And then Dr. Thomas Cowan and Andrew Kaufman are going to be here tomorrow at 1 o'clock.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 And we'll talk more about their work.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
 Dr. Peat, while I've got you here, I know that you've liked their work, Kaufman and Cowan,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 but you've disagreed with a few things.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 What's the number one thing you kind of disagree with their "show me the virus" theory?

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:32.000
 You can demonstrate the existence of something without being able to isolate it.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:54.000
 They want isolation in the sense of being able to make pictures of it and then show that the substance you've photographed will produce the disease.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:14.000
 That has been done roughly, but the indirect evidence of the presence of toxic material is the general practice.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:28.000
 You can demonstrate the presence of certain antigens on the virus, and you can take it apart chemically,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:43.000
 and use different physical demonstrations that confirm the structure and presence of the material,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 even though the preparation of the material for an electron microscope picture, you don't necessarily have to have a completely pure sample.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:09.000
 You can distinguish by the shape of the substance what you have under the microscope,

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:27.000
 and show that there are virus bodies present that sometimes look the same as exosomes or extracellular vesicles.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:47.000
 Then you can show that they have the particular chemistry of the spike protein,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:02.000
 and that either the DNA or the RNA has been assimilated.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:17.000
 The spike protein is likely to contain some of the spike protein exactly the way the virus would have,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:29.000
 but we wouldn't have assimilated the spike protein without exposure to either the virus or the vaccine.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
 On the isolation idea, I think, and I don't want to speak for them because it's above my pay grade,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:42.000
 but don't they argue that if you don't have it totally completely isolated, which no one has done in my understanding,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
 then you don't know what people are potentially getting.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
 Like, you know, they do monkey kidneys, and they starve to sell, and they put toxins in there.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
 Doesn't that argument hold water for you?

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:15.000
 No, because there is such a long history of being able to modify the nucleic acids of animals, bacteria, viruses, everything.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 The technology exists for changing the DNA sequence.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:31.000
 For example, in the 1990s, the Defense Department was collecting smallpox viruses

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:44.000
 and were experimenting with re-engineering them, the smallpox virus, to make it get around the vaccination

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:58.000
 so that it would be a bioweapon that would kill people and be just as effective in vaccinated individuals.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
 You can do that with any of the existing diseases.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 You can modify them in the lab, and the germ warfare industry has been doing that,

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:22.000
 not publicizing it very much, but Ralph Berrick in his lab in North Carolina

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:32.000
 and working with Fort Detrick and the military has expressed in his publications

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:42.000
 exactly some of the modifications that they are making in the coronavirus and other viruses

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
 to make them more infective, more toxic.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:54:01.000
 So the technology is relatively open, even though we don't know the extent of how much is being done secretly still.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
 But could these things be this gain-of-function thing, or when they juice it up in the lab,

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.000
 could they even be released in the air and you breathe it in and get them?

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 Yep. They've designed them so that they test them on animals.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 They put an air channel between cages and blow the air from one cage into another,

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 and they can demonstrate that the disease is transmitted by air in some cases.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
 And then mammals could then share them with others?

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
 Yeah, once they're infected, then it goes from one individual to another,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000
 if it's a highly infectious air transmission.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:00.000
 But many viruses only are transmitted by body fluids.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.000
 But essentially, the viruses aren't living, right? In the body, they're dead, aren't they?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:17.000
 Well, they are analogs of our own nucleic acid systems.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:26.000
 And so we are constantly producing virus-like particles, the exosomes or extracellular vesicles

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:31.000
 that carry genetic information around within our bodies.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:39.000
 And those particles, our own natural exosomes, can be transmitted by body fluids

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.000
 and probably through exhalations.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 You can condense lots of proteins and nucleic acids just by holding a cold object under your nose when you exhale.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 So they're in a volatile form that condenses on the cold object.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:14.000
 And our natural exosomes are included in that, sometimes free DNA, free RNA.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 Other times it's packaged in a little capsule like an exosome.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.000
 So these are the guys that were sharing potentially beneficial information with other people, right?

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:37.000
 Yeah. And the toxic part, like the spike protein, are what causes diseases.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 And some viruses are probably exosomes from some organism that simply is out of place.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 Like people were transmitting plant diseases by rubbing plant viruses with pumice powder

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000
 into the leaves of the plants to produce some plant disease.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:18.000
 And two of these people working with a particular plant virus, which they rubbed in with their fingers in a pumice powder mixture,

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:27.000
 two of these researchers at the same university came down within a period of just a few months

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 with a degenerative brain disease that killed them in a short time.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 So it's very likely that the plant viruses being rubbed into the skin with pumice is what caused the brain disease.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
 Wow. Fascinating.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
 Here's an email from Mandy. Thanks for that, Doc.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:58:02.000
 For someone with parasites and high toxin burden, how do you start slowly opening drainage pathways pre-tox without homeopathics?

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000
 Oh, without homeopathics. So they're wanting to kind of get warmed up to detoxify, I guess it sounds like.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
 Did you say with parasites?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
 Yes, someone with parasites.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:20.000
 The first thing is to get rid of the parasites and sometimes a change of diet.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:32.000
 If they're in the intestine, just a radical change of diet, like a very high fiber diet sometimes is all it takes,

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:46.000
 or having more digestible foods, sometimes flowers of sulfur is enough to get rid of certain parasites.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 Amoebas, for example, sometimes are eliminated by just a small amount of flowers of sulfur.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 Other times, things like ivermectin, they work against a great variety of parasites.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:15.000
 Here's an email from Harish. Adrenal glands are required for making cortisol and aldosterone from progesterone, right?

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:31.000
 How did progesterone substitute for the absence of adrenal glands in the Hans Selye experiment?

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 He was experimenting with the adrenal stress syndrome.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:58.000
 He would remove the adrenal glands and study the effects of how the absence of the adrenals led to the stress sensitivity of the animal,

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
 so that a mild stress would kill them.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
 But some of his animals happened to be pregnant when their adrenal glands were removed.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:20.000
 He found that they were perfectly stress tolerant as long as they were pregnant.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:35.000
 As soon as they delivered their litter, the usual absence of the adrenals led to stress sensitivity and easy death from a mild shock.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:43.000
 So he experimented removing the adrenals and supplementing progesterone,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:52.000
 and found that the animals would live a normal lifespan as long as they were supplemented just with progesterone.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:17.000
 Intrinsically, progesterone has anti-inflammatory functions that overlap with cortisol and also intrinsic salt-regulating functions that overlap with aldosterone.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:33.000
 Those middle-of-the-range functions of progesterone mean that if your adrenals are having a tumor,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:55.000
 for example, making too much aldosterone or too much cortisol, dosing with progesterone mediates or moderates those effects so that it acts as an antitoxin to the overdose of adrenal steroids.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
 So it's a moderator of basically everything.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:15.000
 Complementary to that progesterone anti-stress effect, he supplemented estrogen and found that large doses of estrogen created shock,

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:28.000
 as if analogous to removing the adrenals, that the estrogen was an amplifier of stress and shock.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000
 Wow, well, very interesting.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
 Here's an email from Chelsea for you, Doc.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:48.000
 Hi, I recently, this month, started progesterone, about 30 mg at night, during the second two weeks of my cycle to deal with PCOS and fibroids.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:56.000
 While I'm on it, it helps, and when I stop for the second two weeks, I feel bloated and discomfort in the ovaries.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000
 Any advice on dosage? Also, just started tiny amounts of CYLAMEL.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:22.000
 Yeah, usually behind the deficiency of progesterone or the excess of estrogen in the luteal phase, usually the reason for that is low thyroid function.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:37.000
 Supplementing thyroid will tend to lower the amount of estrogen in the body while raising the amount of progesterone, improving the ratio.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:53.000
 So, most often, normalizing your thyroid hormone function takes care of your estrogen, progesterone, premenstrual problems, such as PCOS.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
 Here's an email from Mandy.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
 How would you deal with a heavy metal detox injury?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:09.000
 Wow, I used a large dose of cilantro one day without realizing I had blocked detox pathways after a long time, a decade or so of Lyme-like diseases.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:23.000
 I seem to have triggered mass cell overactivation and I'm unable to tolerate any drainage or detox, and I become extremely histamine, EMF, and sulfate intolerant.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:40.000
 Cilantro just happens to be a fairly strong allergen, and the seeds of the plant are even worse.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:53.000
 The whole family of plants, the caraway seeds, for example, are similar.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000
 That whole family of plants can be extremely allergenic.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:11.000
 I don't think it has anything to do with metal detoxification. It's just that, for some reason, cilantro has that reputation.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:20.000
 Really, it's a good-tasting herb with the risk of being extremely allergenic for some people.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
 So, she may be assuming or maybe misdiagnosing this thing.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
 Yeah, in the sense of the detoxing.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:51.000
 If you normalize your metabolism, get oxidative metabolism going, normal thyroid and hormone balances, then the metals will take care of themselves gradually, leaving in your urine.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:00.000
 What's Dr. Peat's view on mass cell activation and why mass cells become overactive?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:10.000
 Estrogen is a very powerful activator and attractant to mass cells.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.000
 Progesterone, by balancing the estrogen effect, will neutralize that.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:30.000
 The overactive bladder syndrome is a common effect of chronically high estrogen production.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
 Here's one from Ben. I'm 72.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:51.000
 May all want to gain more muscle. Have followed your idea of not taking in too much iron. So, what can I safely eat to build up testosterone and subsequent muscle?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:11.000
 The right kind of muscle activity in itself will increase your testosterone resistance activity of the muscles up to a limit.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:21.000
 You don't want to overstress your muscles or reach the point of getting out of breath.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:41.000
 If you gradually use resistance exercise to build your muscles, that in itself is lowering the catabolic cortisone category of steroids while increasing the testosterone and androgen category.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.000
 And then it matters not too much about what you're eating. They'll grow if you do that.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
 Just keep your protein intake in the normal range.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:08:04.000
 Would you please ask Dr. Peat about what medicine to take if I catch the coronavirus? I get very sick from histamine intolerance and that makes me worried about the virus.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:30.000
 The Chinese at the very beginning of late 2019, they were finding that antihistamines and antiserotonin drugs that they were familiar with were specifically acting protectively against that virus.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:45.000
 So, something like ciproheptadine, a common antihistamine, antiserotonin drug, is known to be helpful.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:54.000
 But right from the very beginning, that was one of the important observations in China.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
 Ray Peat is here, generally on the third Monday, but we had technical difficulties yesterday.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
 This is from somebody in Florida.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:12.000
 Whenever I eat well-boiled mushrooms, caps without the stems, cooked for three hours, I don't sleep well.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
 Does Dr. Peat have any idea why this would be?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:36.000
 Could be an allergy, I suppose. It's good to avoid things, especially late in the day, to avoid things that might not fit your digestive system.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:45.000
 Having easily digestible carbohydrates late in the day is usually best for good sleep.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
 And what are those, easily digestible ones?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
 I like orange juice and ice cream.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
 Sure, of course.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000
 Sometimes tortillas.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
 Corn tortillas?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
 Yeah, mixed them all in. Lime processed.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
 Do you make your own?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
 Rarely. It's quite a process.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
 But you can actually buy the nixtamalized ones?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:27.000
 Yeah, if you look carefully at the labels, they should contain nothing but corn, lime processed corn.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
 Pretty fun.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
 Could you ask Dr. Peat about microfiber sheets for sleeping?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
 Also, often cotton shirts and underwear are combined with some polyester in the fabric.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.000
 Are these clothing articles made with polyester possibly hazardous to our health?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
 They aren't ideal.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:00.000
 The polyester tends to allow bacterial growth.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:12.000
 The cotton, by being absorbent on a very deep level, effectively is somewhat antiseptic.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000
 So I think natural, organic cotton is always the best fiber.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:30.000
 Wool, next best. Flax or linen, very safe if it's organic.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.000
 Could you please ask Dr. Peat if being on a low calorie diet lowers the thyroid,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:45.000
 and how can a person go back to eating a normal amount of calories without weight gain?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:54.000
 That involves getting the right balance of electrolytes and carbohydrates in particular,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:06.000
 and then generally avoiding fats because of the anti-metabolic polyunsaturated.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:17.000
 But getting enough sodium and potassium, calcium and magnesium is the essential thing

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:26.000
 because they will minimize stress and stop some of the catabolic processes.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.000
 And then the carbohydrate and protein will work more efficiently.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
 I see. With Dr. Ray Peat, it is the 21st, we are live here.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
 Oh, you know, you mentioned electrolytes, Doc, I wanted to ask.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
 I like to do saunas and I do plenty of water with some electrolytes.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:50.000
 Any foods that would help me to make sure that I'm not over-saunoing, sweating?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:00.000
 I think when you artificially increase your body temperature, you burn sugar very fast.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:09.000
 So orange juice is a good thing to have during and right after a sauna.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:18.000
 But the endurance athletes have discovered that having some baking soda in water

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
 before the stressful exercise greatly increases their endurance.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000
 What it's doing is guaranteeing that you will oxidize your glucose most efficiently.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:40.000
 And the carbon dioxide released from the baking soda is part of it.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:54.000
 The sodium contributes. The specific requirement of each of the alkaline minerals,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:03.000
 magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium, it isn't as important as the total alkaline load.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:11.000
 One to a great extent will supplement a deficiency of the other.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:19.000
 For example, when the parathyroid glands were removed, leading to the cramps,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:29.000
 because the theory was that it was simply an absolute calcium deficiency causing the cramping.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:36.000
 But experimenters found that sodium bicarbonate would relax the cramps,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
 even with the deficiency of parathyroid and calcium.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:50.000
 So there's an overlap, which is essentially an alkalizing effect.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.000
 Interesting. I could also do some milk with some sugar in it, too. Would that help?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.000
 Yes. The calcium in the milk is extremely important for keeping your parathyroid under control.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:11.000
 So calcium and sodium are the ones that we have to pay most attention to.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:23.000
 Vegetables and fruits are loaded in general with magnesium and potassium.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.000
 So the calcium and sodium are more likely to be deficient in those.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:37.000
 Dr. Peat Mark wants to know if you can explain to him how to be properly hydrated in general.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
 Keeping the minerals up is a big part of it.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:54.000
 If your thyroid is working, you will retain minerals appropriately and keep your minerals in balance.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000
 That will keep you on an anabolic balance.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:15.000
 The production of carbon dioxide helps to regulate both the fluids and the minerals such as sodium.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
 Here's a good question, Dr. Peat Foy from Samantha. I'm sure a lot of people will benefit.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:29.000
 What's the best way to purify water at home if I'm not able to do an RO system, reverse osmosis, in my apartment?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000
 She wants to purify water, in particular, removing fluoride.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.000
 She's asking about maybe distiller, ceramic filters like Berkey, or charcoal filters.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
 For fluoride, I think the only way to do it is distillation.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
 Distillation. That gets rid of it, right? I think, doesn't it?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
 What was that?

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000
 Distillation gets rid of fluoride, doesn't it, Dr. Peat?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:08.000
 Oh, sure. All of the minerals, lead, mercury, aluminum, everything in the dirty water supply.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.000
 So maybe that would be the easiest way, the most inexpensive way, right? Just get a little distiller machine.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.000
 Yeah.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.000
 Wow. This is interesting. From Leanne. I'm moving towards 50.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000
 I'm still having my periods, and I'd like to extend my fertility life,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000
 because I'd like to wait another year or two before I have another baby, before I can't any longer.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
 Any advice from Dr. Peat? Thanks for the show. That's a good question.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
 So, she's still menstruating, close to 50, and she wants to move it forward.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
 Any ideas on what you can do?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
 Watching the general nutrition is the first thing.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:05.000
 But women of any age who are approaching menopause, sometimes it happens in the 40s even,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:21.000
 and going to fertility clinics, I've known women who failed repeatedly at the fertility various procedures,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000
 who, if they just took thyroid hormone, immediately got pregnant.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000
 And sometimes in my nutrition classes, just by changing their diet,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:45.000
 people who are thought to be infertile for 10 years, would suddenly get pregnant just during a two or three months class.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
 Just more variety of good nutrients, all the vitamins and minerals.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.000
 Yeah, and thyroid is the essential fertility hormone, because it keeps down excessive estrogen,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
 and keeps up your pregnenolone and progesterone production.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.000
 I guess there's probably no clock on women's menstruation. I guess it just depends.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
 No real-time clock on it?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:28.000
 No. At one of my talks, an old gynecologist said at the end of the talk, "Yeah, progesterone is good stuff."

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:36.000
 He pointed to his wife, who was a very young-looking woman.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:45.000
 He said, "I've been giving her progesterone for 20 years, and she's 63 and still menstruating."

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
 Is that right? Progesterone?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
 Yeah, and her overall appearance was maybe 40 years old.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
 And she was 63-some. Wow.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
 So this is kind of complicated, but this lady really wants some help, and so I'm going to do it here, so bear with me.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:12.000
 She says, "I had preeclampsia in both of my pregnancies, more severe the second time, and was put on a magnesium drip.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:21.000
 My doctor and midwife said it was very dangerous for me to consider having another baby because of my history of preeclampsia.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:31.000
 I have a better understanding now, but there are things I can do to prepare before pregnancy again."

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:39.000
 I want to hear from Dr. Peat. What causes preeclampsia, and what can be done to prevent it from happening again?

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:52.000
 If you can find any of the writings of Tom Brewer from the 1950s, especially through the 1960s,

01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:07.000
 Tom Brewer, okay. Yeah, he showed that a protein deficiency and to some extent other deficiencies, especially sodium,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:17.000
 he ran about the dangers of salt restriction during pregnancy leading to preeclampsia.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:33.000
 He basically had the cure for it in the 1960s. When he died, his wife, Gail, I think, rewrote some of his material

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:45.000
 and I think got the essential ideas wrong. So don't look for the Tom Brewer diet, but look for the actual writings of Tom Brewer.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:22:04.000
 A book that he referred to, written by Shanklin and Hoden, H-O-D-I-N, on maternal and child nutrition, I think was the title,

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:17.000
 emphasized the importance of sodium during pregnancy. But Brewer advocated drinking at least a quart,

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:24.000
 I think maybe two quarts of milk per day during pregnancy was his advice.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:37.000
 Wow. And he essentially prevented all of the expected cases of preeclampsia.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:53.000
 And thyroid is another factor. If magnesium drips help, it's because the body is deficient in oxidative metabolism

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:01.000
 as a result of being low in thyroid, and therefore the cells don't retain magnesium.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:14.000
 An allergist had the interesting experience of giving magnesium intravenously every week to his allergic patients,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:26.000
 but he found that almost all the magnesium that he put in came right out in their urine a few hours later.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:37.000
 And if he gave them some thyroid hormone, especially T3, along with the magnesium intravenous dose,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.000
 that the magnesium stayed in their body and didn't show up in the urine.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:53.000
 And the side effect was that they had their allergies cured and didn't come back for more treatment.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:00.000
 Wow. Fascinating. So what's with this thyroid? I mean, this seems like it's just everywhere, right?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:08.000
 Thyroid issues. Do you have any theories on the spiritual or components of what's going on on planet Earth with a thyroid?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
 I mean, why so much? Why so much stuff?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:24.000
 It's the basic process of forming energy using oxygen and making carbon dioxide.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:33.000
 Carbon dioxide is essential for every organism, bacteria, protozoa, whatever.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000
 They need carbon dioxide to go through the life processes, cell division and so on.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:55.000
 And to make carbon dioxide, thyroid hormone is the trigger for making endless amounts of carbon dioxide.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:03.000
 Carbon dioxide is what stabilizes the electronic balance in cells.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
 So it's right at the heart of everything living.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.000
 So that's the idea of not over-breathing and retaining more carbon dioxide, even when exercising, right?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
 Right. Wow.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
 And so do you think then stress of modern day life and over-breathing, mouth-breathing,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:29.000
 that could be causing dispensing so much carbon dioxide which could be affecting thyroid in our culture?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:38.000
 And the other way. The bad foods that interfere with thyroid hormone create,

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:47.000
 at the very beginning, they are creating hyperventilations.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:56.000
 No matter how much you breathe, if your thyroid is underactive, your body is experiencing hyperventilation.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
 And there's actually, go ahead, sorry.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
 The harder you breathe, the more carbon dioxide you blow out.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
 Right.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.000
 And so if you pant intensively, in a minute or so you tend to faint.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:23.000
 That's because the carbon dioxide level in your brain has thrown the whole electronic system out of balance

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
 and shut off oxygen use.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
 So then, kind of standard American diet with Hennepoof, as I suspect,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
 then they cause this hyperventilation as well?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000
 Yeah, and you can see in the blood, as the CO2 goes down,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:48.000
 the lactic acid and a lot of other things increase in inflammatory.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
 As the CO2 goes down.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
 Yeah.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
 And how do we retain more CO2? Is there any things we can do?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
 Sugar and salt.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:05.000
 Good old sugar. To the rescue, man. Sugar and salt. Good salt, right?

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
 Yeah. And that's because they support the thyroid function.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:19.000
 And you still like, your favorite is the Morton's pickling and canning salt, pure sodium chloride, right?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
 Yeah, so you don't get an excessive iodine.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:29.000
 You know, I got some the other day, Dr. Beat. I think it was a buck and a quarter for a huge box of this stuff.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
 I mean, it's like, okay, man.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
 Oh, here's a PS on Catherine.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:42.000
 She said, "Is supplementing, you know, the Eclampsia Lady, Doc, with whole food, vitamin C, okay, Eclampsia?"

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
 Vitamin C?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
 Whole food, vitamin C. Is that okay?

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
 What does that mean?

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000
 She wants to know if taking a whole food, vitamin C supplement is okay.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
 It depends on what they mean.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
 What it is, huh?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:15.000
 If you leave out pasta and bread and nuts from your diet, the remaining foods all contain ascorbic acid.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:30.000
 And so the reason a goat, for example, is known to produce three or four thousand milligrams of vitamin C per day,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:44.000
 and Linus Pauling said, "We have to supplement that much because that's how much the animals produce if they have the system for producing their own vitamin C."

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:55.000
 But I looked at my vitamin C production or emission, analyzing the amount in my urine,

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:09.000
 and I found that taking no supplement at all, just eating regular foods, milk and meat, eggs, vegetables, and so on,

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
 I was putting out around three thousand milligrams per day, every day in my urine.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
 Three thousand, okay.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:40.000
 So it's that apes, for example, eating lots of vegetables and occasional bugs and slugs and things are getting as much vitamin C as a goat, which can make its own vitamin C.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:54.000
 So there's no need to supplement if you don't eat the vitamin C-free foods such as grains and nuts and beans.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:59.000
 Because they'll dispense vitamin C out of the body? They'll get rid of it?

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
 No, they just don't have any.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
 They simply don't have any.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000
 Don't have any.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:28.000
 But milk, for example, and meat is a major source of vitamin C that the explorers found that they didn't have to take lemons or canned fruit with them when they were spending months in the Arctic.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:37.000
 If they ate meat, because meat, they proved that meat was a very good source of vitamin C.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:49.000
 It turns out that all animal tissues contain lots of vitamin C, but they were simply not measuring the right material.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:01.000
 Vitamin C, the reductant, is not the biologically effective intracellular vitamin C.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:20.000
 The dehydroascorbate functions as an oxidant, not an antioxidant, in our cells.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
 You have to use a different procedure for measuring the oxidant form of vitamin C, which is intracellular.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:33.000
 If you use the wrong technique, you're simply blind to the amount of actual vitamin C effect in our foods.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:48.000
 All the official agencies are still deliberately staying blind to the amount of vitamin C in their diet.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
 All these health food stores selling cod liver oil or fish oil and vitamin C, probably not the best choice.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
 We have to know what we're doing here.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
 That's why we have guys like you on, gentlemen like you on to help us.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:07.000
 It's a landmines out there with all the things we've been taught over the years, even in the natural food business.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
 All the health food stores selling all these things.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000
 The propaganda is so powerful.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000
 It's big.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
 Here's one, John. He's in Los Angeles.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
 50-year-old man.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
 What can I eat or take to improve my teeth health?

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
 They're not in good shape.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
 Well, teeth.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
 The teeth?

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
 Yeah, teeth.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:38.000
 When I was in Mexico City, I went several months.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:44.000
 I didn't wake up early enough to get to the supermarket to get some good tasting milk.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.000
 I went on a low milk, almost milk-free diet for several months.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:01.000
 All of my teeth became very sensitive to the cold or any stimulation.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
 Then one of them started crumbling.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
 Not decay, but just weakness and pieces of it breaking off.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:28.000
 After I started reading about calcium metabolism, I found a huge Sandbox calcium supplement.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000
 I took just one or two of those, about a thousand milligrams of calcium each.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:42.000
 Within hours, the sensitivity of my teeth had gone back to normal.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000
 Just an amazing turning off of the total dental pain.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:54.000
 That woke me up to the importance of regular calcium.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
 Calcium.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
 A generous intake of calcium and vitamin D.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
 That's why you like milk rather than...

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000
 You did this with just some store-bought calcium that we don't really recommend, that kind of stuff?

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
 It worked?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
 Yeah.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.000
 The milk comes with an adequate amount of magnesium to balance it, some of the other minerals,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:28.000
 as well as the sugars and fats that help us assimilate the calcium properly.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:36.000
 So the effect of milk is many times better than a calcium supplement.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:46.000
 Has there been many cultures in your research, Dr. Peate, that have drunk milk and children and ongoing through adulthood?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
 A lot of cultures in the last thousand years or so?

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
 Lots?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
 Oh, yeah.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:59.000
 For thousands of years throughout Asia, there have been cow-based cultures.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000
 Wow.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
 And they did well on it, obviously.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
 They wouldn't keep drinking it, right?

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
 Yeah.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
 It's just so interesting.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
 You know, all the so-called natural docs out there, they just think milk is the devil.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
 Yeah.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
 But it tastes good.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
 I've been drinking it since talking to you.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000
 I like it.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
 I didn't drink milk my whole life.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000
 But, you know, when we were kids, we drank lots of milk with cereal and sugar, and we did okay, you know.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.000
 Yeah, there has been so much propaganda against milk, too.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
 Yeah.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
 Talking about cholesterol, for example.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
 Right.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:52.000
 And it's a big propaganda industry rather than a science industry throughout the world of nutrition.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
 Sure, sure.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
 Well, Dr. Peate, what are you going to do today?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000
 Anything fun?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000
 You'll probably always have fun, right?

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
 What are you doing?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
 Oh, right now I'm reading about immunology.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000
 I'm going to do a newsletter related to the immune system.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:25.000
 The propagandists are still working to deny the basic nature of our immune system.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000
 Oh, that would be fun.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
 And that will come out in a month or two?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
 A few weeks.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000
 A few weeks.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
 And so if you'd like to get this, I'm looking forward to it.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:42.000
 It's just RayPeate's newsletter at gmail.com, and you can sign up and he'll take care of it for you.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
 Well, thanks so much for coming on the show.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
 I really, really appreciate it.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
 You're just a wonderful guy, and thank you.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.000
 Just thanks a lot.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.000
 Okay, thank you.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
 You take care of yourself, okay?

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
 We'll see you next week, next month.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
 Okay, bye.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
 Thanks, Doc.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
 Dr. RayPeate, RayPeate.com.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
 Wow, what a nice guy.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
 He's the bomb, right?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000
 That's his website.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
 Get his newsletter.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.000
 Support him.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
 It's really fun.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
 I think it's -- if I can make my mouse work, make sure it's right.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
 Yeah, it's RayPeate.com.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:27.000
 But his newsletter is RayPeate's -- it's plural -- newsletter at gmail.com.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
 Immunology.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
 That's coming up.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
 Well, that was fun.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000
 Great email.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
 Thanks for all your questions.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
 Well, I will see you tomorrow.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.000
 We're going to have a good time.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
 We'll be talking to you at 10 o'clock tomorrow.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
 Charlie Miseul is going to be here.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.000
 Charlie's been working on -- with his little team of constitutional geeks.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:04.000
 It's going to be a one-page -- we've got it -- a one-page religious exemption thing that he thinks is going to work.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000
 I mean, we can't -- I'm not making any promises.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
 But if you're up against that little thing, we'll talk to Charlie about it.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
 And we're going to go through it line by line so you understand what it says.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
 And you can, you know, share it with people, and we'll share it with you.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
 That will be tomorrow at 10.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000
 And then Dr. Cowan, Cowan, Cowan, and Coffman are going to be here tomorrow at 1 o'clock.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
 Get your questions in for those two pumpkins.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
 They're fun.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.000
 Dr. Andrew Coffman, Thomas Cowan, 1 o'clock, on Radionetwork.com.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:48.000
 Send in your questions now for the Wednesday at 1 o'clock show.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
 So thank you so much for your ongoing support.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:01.000
 Again, I'm still getting people that want to look at the 20 hours of the Lost History videos.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:11.000
 They get into the whole non-movable earth, non-spinning thing.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:20.000
 So just email me, Patrick@1radionetwork.com.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:23.000
 If you would like to get some good things for your health,

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:32.000
 like sulfur, or aloe, or a sona, or hydrogen, or pine pollen, or Shen Blossom.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.000
 I didn't mention them today.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
 Shen Blossom, great website.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:48.000
 Oh, the Blue Shield, where it protects you, helps you with your EMFs, electromagnetic, whatever those things are.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:56.000
 Dr. Cowan, speaking of him, he has some great powders.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
 Some of my faves are Burdock, Dandelion, Turmeric.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
 He's got these powders, Dr. Cowan, on our website.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:07.000
 You can sprinkle these on your food.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
 I'm going to have some scallops tonight.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
 You can sprinkle them on there.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
 See, Dr. Peat's got me on scallops.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:19.000
 He doesn't have me on, but he said they got a better...

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
 I don't even know why they're better.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
 He has so much information, sometimes I just...

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
 He said they're the best choice for seafood.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.000
 Scallops is a very good choice.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
 I think it's low... is it iron? Iron?

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
 Than regular fish.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
 I do what I can, you know.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
 I like scallops, they're good.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
 Okay, kids, we'll see you in the morning.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
 Thanks for everything. I love you.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
 I really... you can be crying already.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
 I really appreciate your emails.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
 Lately it's been amazing.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
 They're coming out of the woodwork.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
 People just appreciate what we do.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:06.000
 That's worth all the commissions in the world, because we're good as long as we make our house payment.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
 I don't care.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
 You know what I mean?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
 I'm good. I don't need anything.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:21.000
 Prius gets about 40 miles a gallon, so not much on gas expenses.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000
 A little bit of food and house payment, and we're good.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
 It's amazing.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
 Okay, I love you guys. Thank you. Take care.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
 We'll see you tomorrow, 10 o'clock.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.000
