WEBVTT

0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:03.400
 And we're live. Okay. Ray Peat, Georgi Dinkov, we were just

0:00:03.400 --> 0:00:05.880
 talking about, we're talking about Mexico, what I really

0:00:05.880 --> 0:00:07.800
 wanted to talk about just everything that's happened, you

0:00:07.800 --> 0:00:10.400
 know, I think last time we were talking, the Russia, Ukraine

0:00:10.400 --> 0:00:14.760
 stuff was just kind of coming to a head. And I don't I unpack it

0:00:14.760 --> 0:00:17.920
 for us, Ray, what do you think's going on? And give us your

0:00:17.920 --> 0:00:18.760
 unique perspective.

0:00:19.680 --> 0:00:23.000
 Everyone should really understand what the Adsoff

0:00:23.000 --> 0:00:27.500
 battalion is, that they were an extremist group.

0:00:27.500 --> 0:00:35.500
 They were, for example, involved in setting a union hall on fire while there were dozens

0:00:35.500 --> 0:00:37.060
 of people inside.

0:00:37.060 --> 0:00:49.880
 And if they came out, they killed some, and most of them burned to death, and they march under a swastika flag, and their hero is Bondera,

0:00:49.880 --> 0:00:54.240
 who was a major genocidist under Hitler.

0:00:54.240 --> 0:00:58.720
 So they're just about the nastiest people that you can imagine.

0:00:58.720 --> 0:01:07.400
 They were integrated into Ukraine's National Guard because the breakaway republics favored unions and are nominally

0:01:07.400 --> 0:01:09.520
 favoring socialism.

0:01:09.520 --> 0:01:18.160
 And since the Nazis, they aren't the same as the Adolf Battalion, but the oligarch-related

0:01:18.160 --> 0:01:23.200
 Nazis control the government in Kiev.

0:01:23.200 --> 0:01:29.680
 They get along nicely together. And the government in the Donetsk

0:01:30.640 --> 0:01:38.800
 breakaway area, the Azov battalion, is leading an attempt to genocide the Russian-speaking

0:01:38.800 --> 0:01:51.760
 population. Kiev assigned them that job after they outlawed speaking Russian and all rights for the Russian

0:01:51.760 --> 0:01:57.180
 national citizens, as well as Russian-speaking people, ethnic Russians.

0:01:57.180 --> 0:02:03.360
 The Kiev government has been shelling them constantly now for, I guess, it's seven years.

0:02:03.360 --> 0:02:07.360
 Didn't they send the Azov battalion and they crucified some people in the in the

0:02:07.360 --> 0:02:08.360
 Eastern Republics?

0:02:08.640 --> 0:02:11.600
 That's what I've heard. I didn't want to look at the videos.

0:02:11.640 --> 0:02:14.400
 And how does this play into the larger empire game?

0:02:14.400 --> 0:02:18.640
 Like, do you think this whole thing kicked off as like kind of a cover for the

0:02:18.640 --> 0:02:20.160
 biggest crime of the century?

0:02:20.160 --> 0:02:21.760
 Like maybe that maybe that's part of it.

0:02:21.760 --> 0:02:30.200
 You know, the Victoria and Newland thing that they were openly talking about installing

0:02:30.200 --> 0:02:38.000
 a puppet government in 2014 and explaining that they had invested a lot of money and

0:02:38.000 --> 0:02:48.240
 crucial to the coup was having several nipers killing the Ukraine policemen, as well as demonstrators, to get

0:02:48.240 --> 0:02:54.600
 the people believing that the government was killing demonstrators, but they were killing

0:02:54.600 --> 0:02:58.920
 police and trying to get them against the mob.

0:02:58.920 --> 0:03:01.360
 That was when the elected president left.

0:03:01.360 --> 0:03:08.880
 So it was a very U.S.-promoted coup right from the start. And the nominal

0:03:09.600 --> 0:03:18.800
 purpose publicly is that the U.S., under Clinton, decided that they should expand NATO right up to

0:03:18.800 --> 0:03:29.240
 all of Russia's borders. After having Bush promising Gorbachev NATO would not expand another inch.

0:03:29.240 --> 0:03:35.640
 But that was just to relax the Russians so they could move nuclear weapons right up through

0:03:35.640 --> 0:03:37.440
 all of their borders.

0:03:37.440 --> 0:03:49.280
 And when Putin became active in saying that he couldn't tolerate any more of the advances after several

0:03:49.280 --> 0:03:56.720
 of the little former Russian republics had been assimilated by NATO.

0:03:56.720 --> 0:04:08.840
 Russia fought back in Georgia and what was the other area that they militarily quashed the move to integrate with NATO?

0:04:08.840 --> 0:04:16.920
 And that, the nominal desire to have NATO right up against all of Russia's borders,

0:04:16.920 --> 0:04:26.480
 making it the next step, would be to use those weapons to threaten Russia up to the point that they could change the government

0:04:26.480 --> 0:04:33.480
 and break up the Russian state so that the vast amount of resources could be divided

0:04:33.480 --> 0:04:36.640
 up, just like Hitler had in mind.

0:04:36.640 --> 0:04:46.360
 And this attitude of the US and Britain has continued now since the First World War, their purpose has been to keep

0:04:46.360 --> 0:04:54.120
 Russia from cooperating closely with Germany, because Germany has always had the leading

0:04:54.120 --> 0:05:02.200
 technology and Russia has had the unlimited resources in potential grain production, timber,

0:05:02.200 --> 0:05:09.960
 and all sorts of essential and voluminous minerals. And so if Hitler's

0:05:09.960 --> 0:05:16.800
 plan, for example, to conquer Russia and take their resources, everyone realized that would

0:05:16.800 --> 0:05:29.760
 give Germany absolute control of the world. So that was in their minds at World War Two, and it continues. Anything that would

0:05:29.760 --> 0:05:39.400
 favor Germany doing business with Russia has been inactivated in various ways, and now

0:05:39.400 --> 0:05:48.840
 getting world opinion such that Germany is practically forced to cut off their main energy supplies, the

0:05:48.840 --> 0:05:56.400
 cheap natural gas and oil from Russia, is very essential to the German economy.

0:05:56.400 --> 0:06:08.960
 But by creating the embarrassing situation in world opinion, they have forced their puppet government of Germany to turn off their energy

0:06:08.960 --> 0:06:12.840
 supply and eventually bankrupt themselves.

0:06:12.840 --> 0:06:18.400
 And meanwhile, the US keeps buying vast amounts of Russian gas and oil.

0:06:18.400 --> 0:06:22.160
 It's the Germans, they don't want to have cheap gas and oil.

0:06:22.160 --> 0:06:27.560
 How does lowlife like Newland get on the record plotting to kill foreign officials and people

0:06:27.560 --> 0:06:32.700
 and still not fall under that US law that basically prohibited US officials from doing

0:06:32.700 --> 0:06:33.700
 that abroad?

0:06:33.700 --> 0:06:40.200
 Yeah, the international law is a concept that came in with the United Nations.

0:06:40.200 --> 0:06:45.000
 And when the US talks about the rules,

0:06:45.440 --> 0:06:48.560
 what they mean is they're absolutely throwing out

0:06:48.560 --> 0:06:51.840
 the tradition of 70 years of international law.

0:06:51.840 --> 0:06:55.040
 But I think there's an actual US law which prohibited,

0:06:55.040 --> 0:06:57.980
 I think it was, I forget when it was passed,

0:06:57.980 --> 0:07:01.760
 but basically it said that no US government employee

0:07:01.760 --> 0:07:06.060
 is allowed to actively plot the assassination of a foreign

0:07:06.060 --> 0:07:07.880
 government official.

0:07:07.880 --> 0:07:12.520
 And this is a law that's on the U.S. books.

0:07:12.520 --> 0:07:19.800
 But all of the treaties are technically the law in the U.S.

0:07:19.800 --> 0:07:24.160
 When Congress ratifies a treaty, that makes it a national law.

0:07:24.160 --> 0:07:26.680
 And if you look at the history of U.S.

0:07:26.680 --> 0:07:29.040
 treaties, no one obeys the law.

0:07:29.080 --> 0:07:32.480
 Right. Yeah. So basically, it's they follow whatever law suits them.

0:07:32.480 --> 0:07:36.400
 But when it comes down to restricting, you know, special the secret operations

0:07:36.400 --> 0:07:38.320
 or things like that abroad, the law doesn't apply.

0:07:38.360 --> 0:07:43.040
 So how does this navigate kind of the oligarchs into a one world government

0:07:43.040 --> 0:07:45.640
 situation? Is this like something that was standing in their way,

0:07:45.640 --> 0:07:47.120
 or how does a person understand that?

0:07:47.120 --> 0:07:51.240
 Their one-world government has to be ruled by the US.

0:07:54.120 --> 0:07:56.960
 There are these actual extremists in the government.

0:07:56.960 --> 0:08:00.960
 Since Kennedy's time, it's been very obvious

0:08:00.960 --> 0:08:07.680
 that they seriously believed better dead than red. And the chairman of the Joint

0:08:07.680 --> 0:08:14.320
 Chiefs of Staff was constantly maneuvering to get a world war using atomic weapons.

0:08:14.960 --> 0:08:20.400
 Well, one of the big narratives, like the so-called liberal Democrats are like pro-Ukraine,

0:08:20.400 --> 0:08:25.760
 the so-called right-leaning Republicans are pro-Russia, and then the super, like,

0:08:25.760 --> 0:08:29.560
 kind of fringe conspiracy people are saying, oh, it's a big show, the whole thing is theater.

0:08:29.560 --> 0:08:34.680
 And so why would you reject that whole thing that Putin is, like, playing a villain so

0:08:34.680 --> 0:08:37.760
 they can do a cyber attack and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?

0:08:37.760 --> 0:08:50.960
 Why would you, like, vehemently reject that? The Trump was a big interference with their plan, the American plan to establish, to keep

0:08:50.960 --> 0:08:57.960
 Germany as a puppet state and to do everything to end up dissolving the Russian state.

0:08:57.960 --> 0:09:07.760
 And when Trump said he could do business with Russia, he didn't think wars were a good idea. Immediately, they said he was conspiring

0:09:08.400 --> 0:09:16.800
 with Putin. And that whole thing was a conspiratorial fabrication coming out of the

0:09:16.800 --> 0:09:24.880
 Democrats party organization, with Hillary leading the way, referring to Putin as Hitler.

0:09:24.880 --> 0:09:25.000
 And then where do you see this all leading? You know, like, the last time we talked, with Hillary leading the way, referring to Putin as Hitler.

0:09:25.000 --> 0:09:27.800
 And then where do you see this all leading?

0:09:27.800 --> 0:09:29.400
 You know, like the last time we talked,

0:09:29.400 --> 0:09:31.120
 it felt like it was just getting off the ground

0:09:31.120 --> 0:09:34.000
 and it's like gotten so intense so quickly

0:09:34.000 --> 0:09:36.200
 and it's hard to imagine that it's gonna go,

0:09:36.200 --> 0:09:38.120
 it's not gonna get a lot worse.

0:09:38.120 --> 0:09:43.120
 Where Russia is losing ground is in their public relations

0:09:43.120 --> 0:09:46.960
 because the story of satanic Putin has

0:09:46.960 --> 0:09:52.560
 been so efficiently propagated, even sane people can't hear what they hear and

0:09:52.560 --> 0:09:59.040
 can't see what they read. Like someone emailed me that Putin, on the day he

0:09:59.040 --> 0:10:07.000
 recognized the Republic, said his purpose was to decommunize the Ukraine, that he is actually a fascist.

0:10:07.000 --> 0:10:13.640
 And what I heard him say in that speech was his purpose was to denazify the Ukraine, nothing

0:10:13.640 --> 0:10:15.840
 about decommunizing them.

0:10:15.840 --> 0:10:28.560
 And so his purpose, since the breakaway republics favored socialism and unions, they had to say that his purpose in stopping the Azov battalion

0:10:28.560 --> 0:10:35.360
 from shelling civilians, his purpose really was to go in and commit genocide against the

0:10:35.360 --> 0:10:36.360
 socialists.

0:10:36.360 --> 0:10:51.080
 Have you seen the other claims that Putin is basically trying to re-establish the USSR? I've heard suggestions of that, but under him, one of the critics' lines is to say that

0:10:51.080 --> 0:11:11.120
 because Putin frequently uses the word God and spiritual values and traditional morality, a not very secret fascist, but the communists got to the point where Stalin had stopped

0:11:11.120 --> 0:11:19.040
 the active persecution of religion in the early 1940s because he saw that nearly everyone

0:11:19.040 --> 0:11:27.300
 in Russia was an orthodox true believer, and so he said, what's the Socialist Party doing

0:11:27.300 --> 0:11:33.940
 persecuting their main supporters? And Putin is following Stalin to that degree.

0:11:33.940 --> 0:11:51.440
 He's using the common concepts, natural in his country, of spiritual values, honoring traditional morality, and speaking in terms involving

0:11:51.440 --> 0:11:57.180
 references to God, and that really offends, like a lot of these so-called

0:11:57.180 --> 0:12:06.360
 Marxists and Communists in Russia, hate him for that. They want to go back to the old-fashioned persecution of

0:12:06.360 --> 0:12:14.160
 believers. And so when he talks in a national, ethnic manner, they say that

0:12:14.160 --> 0:12:21.500
 means he's a fascist and wants to, among other things, restore the kind of

0:12:21.500 --> 0:12:26.560
 communism that existed under Stalin and others.

0:12:26.560 --> 0:12:30.720
 Have you seen some of the polls in the former Soviet republics? I think with the notable,

0:12:31.280 --> 0:12:37.600
 the actual people on the ground in numbers of two-thirds or more favor the return of the Soviet

0:12:37.600 --> 0:12:43.680
 Union simply because they say their lives were more stable or at least more human under the

0:12:43.680 --> 0:12:46.720
 old system. And right now you have 1% owning everything

0:12:46.720 --> 0:12:50.320
 and 99% living in basically abject poverty and fear.

0:12:50.320 --> 0:12:53.480
 Yeah, the average citizen lost everything,

0:12:53.480 --> 0:12:55.520
 low pensions, jobs and so on,

0:12:55.520 --> 0:13:00.280
 transferring state property to the oligarchs

0:13:00.280 --> 0:13:03.520
 with the leadership of economists from Harvard.

0:13:03.520 --> 0:13:08.800
 Yeah, do you think there's a, how would you estimate the risk of a, I don't know, third world war?

0:13:08.800 --> 0:13:14.640
 Because the way things are going now, if Russia wins the war in Ukraine, basically it throws

0:13:14.640 --> 0:13:21.000
 a major wrench into the will of the plans that the West had for this part of the world.

0:13:21.000 --> 0:13:31.400
 Yeah. of the world. Yeah, I think Biden is already showing that that would totally make Western rulers insane.

0:13:31.400 --> 0:13:34.920
 The way he talks is pretty insane.

0:13:34.920 --> 0:13:36.920
 And also the West kind of loses credibility.

0:13:36.920 --> 0:13:41.560
 If Russia achieves its goal in Ukraine, then basically it shows the West and the entire

0:13:41.560 --> 0:13:46.120
 world that it's still a great power and it can pose a credible

0:13:46.120 --> 0:13:47.520
 challenge to the Empire.

0:13:47.520 --> 0:13:50.760
 Yeah, that's a great problem for the West.

0:13:50.760 --> 0:13:57.680
 They see it as potentially a terminal condition for them, so they will resort to anything

0:13:57.680 --> 0:14:00.880
 to resist that.

0:14:00.880 --> 0:14:09.840
 I think they're going to start saying that even though the Ukraine was easy to defeat,

0:14:09.840 --> 0:14:18.600
 Russians had to use massive genocidal methods, and they'll be claiming that Russia has committed

0:14:18.600 --> 0:14:23.280
 atrocities all across the country.

0:14:23.280 --> 0:14:28.920
 The shelling of the breakaway republics has killed at least 10,000 people over these last

0:14:28.920 --> 0:14:29.920
 seven years.

0:14:29.920 --> 0:14:36.000
 And even if we put aside the actual winning the war in Ukraine, now Russia being isolated

0:14:36.000 --> 0:14:41.800
 financially and politically under the, of course, the guidance of the empire, Russia

0:14:41.800 --> 0:14:45.600
 and China are being pushed together by basically no desire of their own,

0:14:45.600 --> 0:14:48.440
 but now they have to cooperate in order to survive this.

0:14:48.440 --> 0:14:52.040
 And if they come up with an alternative payment system and start trading all these commodities

0:14:52.040 --> 0:14:56.360
 in something other than the US dollar, then that's pretty much game over for the dollar,

0:14:56.360 --> 0:14:57.360
 wouldn't it be?

0:14:57.360 --> 0:15:10.760
 Yeah, that's what the West has seen coming now for years. And when the US froze Russian assets and stopped the financial transactions, the

0:15:10.760 --> 0:15:18.000
 Russians had almost equivalent power. They could have frozen the Western assets in Russia

0:15:18.000 --> 0:15:26.840
 with great damage to people in the US and could turn off their cheap gas and several other things that they could

0:15:26.840 --> 0:15:29.800
 have retaliated with it against the sanctions.

0:15:29.800 --> 0:15:37.600
 But what they're doing is not trying to punish the West, but trying to just shift their business

0:15:37.600 --> 0:15:38.600
 in China.

0:15:38.600 --> 0:15:42.360
 Right, but economically united Russia and China are essentially, that's a checkmate

0:15:42.360 --> 0:15:43.360
 for the West.

0:15:43.360 --> 0:15:49.360
 Other than a major war to subjugate that union, the West doesn't really have any other cards.

0:15:49.360 --> 0:15:55.320
 I think it's almost unavoidable that China and Russia are going to come out in a functional

0:15:55.320 --> 0:15:56.640
 control position.

0:15:56.640 --> 0:15:57.640
 Okay.

0:15:57.640 --> 0:16:01.960
 So if the elite wanted eventually the US dollar to go away anyway so that they can replace

0:16:01.960 --> 0:16:05.760
 it with their digital currency, do you think that may actually help their plans?

0:16:05.760 --> 0:16:10.320
 The fact that the Russian-China alliance may accelerate the demise of the dollar, or do

0:16:10.320 --> 0:16:12.280
 you think it's happening too fast for their taste?

0:16:12.280 --> 0:16:20.600
 I'm not sure, but I think the dollar is already experiencing that movement away from the petroleum-supported

0:16:20.600 --> 0:16:21.600
 dollar.

0:16:21.600 --> 0:16:28.560
 And that was going away from the petroleum dollar was what got Iraq and Libya

0:16:28.560 --> 0:16:37.360
 murdered. They were introducing a gold back finance system. So they had to be killed to save

0:16:37.360 --> 0:16:48.080
 the value of the dollar. But now they can't do that to China and Russia who are moving basically in the same direction Libya and Iraq did regarding

0:16:48.080 --> 0:16:52.720
 oil prices. With the way things are going right now and with the war and further supply chain

0:16:52.720 --> 0:16:57.840
 disruptions, which is what the elite calls them, do you see the potential for inflation

0:16:57.840 --> 0:17:02.400
 condensing rapidly in the United States and maybe even civil unrest breaking out over these

0:17:02.400 --> 0:17:10.960
 ridiculous prices? Yeah, the inflation is already happening because of the actions they've taken for the pandemic.

0:17:10.960 --> 0:17:18.080
 But I think it's blending right into the world, moving away with China and Russia getting

0:17:18.080 --> 0:17:19.080
 together.

0:17:19.080 --> 0:17:25.000
 So I think there's nowhere to go for the dollar except losing value faster and faster.

0:17:25.000 --> 0:17:26.520
 And what do you think will be a move,

0:17:26.520 --> 0:17:28.560
 a financial move on the elites part?

0:17:28.560 --> 0:17:31.120
 Introduce quickly the CBDCs or?

0:17:32.600 --> 0:17:37.600
 Basically controlling, they can cancel the bank access

0:17:39.680 --> 0:17:41.920
 simply the way Canada did,

0:17:41.920 --> 0:17:49.520
 confiscate the money of people, independent actions of all sorts,

0:17:49.520 --> 0:17:55.600
 and force people quickly into the digital credit card economy.

0:17:55.600 --> 0:18:00.000
 But in order for that to happen, Trudeau, by the way, declared martial law, or he invoked that law

0:18:00.000 --> 0:18:07.120
 that's essentially equivalent to the martial law. What would it take to do that in the United States, unless there is some kind of a civil

0:18:07.120 --> 0:18:08.120
 unrest?

0:18:08.120 --> 0:18:13.280
 It didn't take any law at all to do all of the illegal mandates.

0:18:13.280 --> 0:18:16.880
 They knew that a state of emergency existed.

0:18:16.880 --> 0:18:18.400
 They didn't talk about it.

0:18:18.400 --> 0:18:27.800
 But I think we've had a continuing state of emergency now for many years. And so they can get away with martial law behavior

0:18:27.800 --> 0:18:30.340
 without having to declare anything.

0:18:30.340 --> 0:18:32.280
 So you think they will just be able to freeze

0:18:32.280 --> 0:18:33.960
 people's deposits and get away with it?

0:18:33.960 --> 0:18:34.800
 Yeah.

0:18:34.800 --> 0:18:36.640
 Somebody listening to this might say,

0:18:36.640 --> 0:18:38.980
 oh, I don't care about the Ukraine or Russia stuff,

0:18:38.980 --> 0:18:41.520
 but the effect on the food chain,

0:18:41.520 --> 0:18:44.160
 that's like a, that's one of the consequences of this.

0:18:44.160 --> 0:18:51.360
 Have you been following that at all? Not in detail, but yeah, they're expressed policy now for

0:18:52.400 --> 0:18:59.840
 several years, starting well before the pandemic, is to phase out what they call the legacy economy,

0:19:01.120 --> 0:19:07.000
 small businesses all across the country to destroy them one way or another, and the

0:19:07.000 --> 0:19:15.080
 mandates simply telling people they couldn't continue running their restaurant or gym or

0:19:15.080 --> 0:19:18.360
 whatever business they said wasn't essential.

0:19:18.360 --> 0:19:27.880
 And so they just by fiat confiscated or destroyed businesses, forcing people to deal with places like Amazon.

0:19:27.880 --> 0:19:33.200
 And so Jeff Bezos practically has doubled his wealth because of the pandemic.

0:19:33.200 --> 0:19:36.880
 And I was specifically referring to, like, it doesn't Russia export like all of the wheat

0:19:36.880 --> 0:19:39.680
 or something. And so that would hurt farmers even more.

0:19:39.680 --> 0:19:40.680
 Ukraine.

0:19:40.680 --> 0:19:41.680
 Ukraine.

0:19:41.680 --> 0:19:46.880
 Yeah. And they could do all kinds of boycotts.

0:19:46.880 --> 0:19:53.920
 They could find many other markets in the US and Europe for all of their excess production

0:19:53.920 --> 0:19:56.800
 of grain and petroleum in particular.

0:19:56.800 --> 0:20:02.880
 But rare minerals that are essential to the Western economy, they can turn those off,

0:20:02.880 --> 0:20:06.400
 simply turn off Western technology industry.

0:20:06.400 --> 0:20:12.240
 And Russia and Belarus together are responsible for two-thirds of the fertilizer used around

0:20:12.240 --> 0:20:13.240
 the world to grow food.

0:20:13.240 --> 0:20:17.720
 And if they stop the exports of that, then nobody grows food no matter where they are.

0:20:17.720 --> 0:20:20.560
 At least at an industrial level, right?

0:20:20.560 --> 0:20:22.520
 I mean, people can do it in their yards.

0:20:22.520 --> 0:20:26.120
 They're in a position of tremendous leverage over Europe

0:20:26.120 --> 0:20:30.960
 and the US, but they see such actions as leading to

0:20:30.960 --> 0:20:36.320
 retaliation militarily, and they're very not retaliating

0:20:36.600 --> 0:20:37.160
 for these.

0:20:37.200 --> 0:20:39.960
 And then again, people hate when I ask you to speculate, but

0:20:39.960 --> 0:20:43.080
 could you see maybe a cyber attack performed by CIA and

0:20:43.080 --> 0:20:48.040
 associated? Could that be like a sink into some kind of war situation?

0:20:48.560 --> 0:20:53.840
 Yeah. And it could happen anywhere as long as it is convincingly

0:20:54.000 --> 0:20:55.800
 blameable on the Russians.

0:20:56.040 --> 0:20:57.600
 That's their basic thing.

0:20:57.640 --> 0:21:00.360
 And that I mean, it doesn't have to be convincingly blameable.

0:21:00.360 --> 0:21:02.120
 They it's like the virus.

0:21:02.240 --> 0:21:04.200
 It's whatever they say. It's unconfirmable.

0:21:04.440 --> 0:21:12.080
 Well, especially if they're right at the point of being able to declare a pandemic of Marburg

0:21:12.080 --> 0:21:14.520
 hemorrhagic fever virus.

0:21:14.520 --> 0:21:19.760
 That's one of the things that could hold things in a crisis state.

0:21:19.760 --> 0:21:24.720
 But a huge false flag operation is very likely.

0:21:24.720 --> 0:21:26.840
 I mean, the trauma of staying home and not seeing

0:21:26.900 --> 0:21:29.340
 your loved ones might pale in comparison to not having

0:21:29.400 --> 0:21:32.540
 water or food or turning on the power.

0:21:32.600 --> 0:21:34.440
 That might be really bad.

0:21:34.500 --> 0:21:36.540
 Okay, is there...

0:21:36.600 --> 0:21:38.680
 Do you have any more news on the Marburg stuff?

0:21:38.740 --> 0:21:40.340
 I know you said they were redding a vaccine.

0:21:40.420 --> 0:21:41.220
 Have you been following that?

0:21:41.280 --> 0:21:42.820
 Have you seen more things?

0:21:42.880 --> 0:21:44.620
 Because it seems like the public can only hold

0:21:44.680 --> 0:21:45.680
 attention on one narrative.

0:21:45.680 --> 0:21:49.040
 So it's going to be either Russia, Ukraine, or a new virus.

0:21:49.040 --> 0:21:50.880
 Like, it would be difficult for...

0:21:50.880 --> 0:21:56.160
 I think they are so in control of the media that they can let out little bits.

0:21:56.880 --> 0:22:02.560
 When one thing slacks in the news, they can cap things up by letting out a new danger.

0:22:02.560 --> 0:22:05.520
 So they're alternating between a new virus,

0:22:05.520 --> 0:22:09.120
 cyber attacks, all kinds of possible threats.

0:22:09.120 --> 0:22:12.880
 And Georgie, interrupt me if you have any more on the Ukraine, Russia stuff. But people did want

0:22:12.880 --> 0:22:17.680
 me to ask you about the new information about the reverse transcription. I mean, you've been saying

0:22:17.680 --> 0:22:23.440
 this from day one. So have you seen anything that was interesting or unknown? Recently, I think Peter

0:22:23.440 --> 0:22:25.160
 McCullough and some other people

0:22:25.160 --> 0:22:26.920
 have been talking about a proof of,

0:22:26.920 --> 0:22:29.240
 maybe it was in the liver of the reverse transcription

0:22:29.240 --> 0:22:30.760
 for the spike protein.

0:22:30.760 --> 0:22:32.920
 Yeah, showing it exists in the liver.

0:22:32.920 --> 0:22:37.920
 A group at MIT and Harvard more than a year ago

0:22:37.920 --> 0:22:42.920
 demonstrated that the process really does happen in cells,

0:22:43.960 --> 0:22:47.200
 but showing that it happens in human liver cells is

0:22:47.200 --> 0:22:55.640
 very important. And just by having a feeling for how cells operate right from

0:22:55.640 --> 0:23:02.560
 the start, the claim of people like Faucig that introducing RNA is going to

0:23:02.560 --> 0:23:07.560
 almost instantly lead to the degradation of that RNA and it

0:23:07.560 --> 0:23:15.000
 couldn't possibly be reverse transcribed and a product of reverse transcription naturally

0:23:15.000 --> 0:23:18.760
 couldn't get into the nucleus.

0:23:18.760 --> 0:23:27.840
 So that was all like topomorphic molecular biology that Fauci had never studied, but anyone

0:23:27.840 --> 0:23:34.600
 familiar with the actual workings of nucleic acids in the organism knows that

0:23:34.600 --> 0:23:39.960
 those rules are made for the drug companies, like the idea that you have to

0:23:39.960 --> 0:23:47.000
 encapsulate RNA into some kind of a lipid membrane to get it in the cells.

0:23:47.000 --> 0:23:53.560
 The lipid substance is actually designed to act as an adjuvant to stir up the

0:23:53.560 --> 0:24:00.120
 immune system but it's been known for a long time that naked RNA and naked DNA

0:24:00.120 --> 0:24:07.420
 are circulating in our blood system all the time and if you add a particular type

0:24:07.420 --> 0:24:14.300
 of RNA or DNA strand, it shows up very powerfully inside the cells. You don't

0:24:14.300 --> 0:24:21.180
 need anything to target the nucleic acid to make it go into cells. It can go

0:24:21.180 --> 0:24:28.040
 right through the surface of the cell and begin to be incorporated into

0:24:28.040 --> 0:24:34.560
 the nucleus. So the so-called principles that make such a thing impossible are

0:24:34.560 --> 0:24:39.120
 nothing but the ignorant fantasy of the pharmaceutical people and how

0:24:39.120 --> 0:24:48.120
 pharmaceutical people actually uncovered nucleic acid is going in and out of cells constantly and it

0:24:48.120 --> 0:24:57.000
 goes in and out of the organism through body fluids, sweat, saliva, tears, urine.

0:24:57.000 --> 0:25:06.960
 These nucleic acids originating in the body are coming out all over our surfaces. So if you put a cold

0:25:06.960 --> 0:25:13.320
 object under your nose so that the warm breast condenses on it and analyze it, then you find

0:25:13.320 --> 0:25:29.560
 big molecules like nucleic acids and proteins in that condensed vapor. And that was incorporated into a manual when Pfizer was experimenting to develop the vaccine.

0:25:30.320 --> 0:25:35.160
 They warned their people giving the vaccine

0:25:35.160 --> 0:25:39.720
 not to let pregnant or nursing women

0:25:39.720 --> 0:25:42.440
 be exposed to someone who is vaccinated.

0:25:42.440 --> 0:25:45.440
 They were fully aware of this shedding process

0:25:45.440 --> 0:25:47.720
 that is going on all the time.

0:25:47.720 --> 0:25:49.600
 And I couldn't be the only one that was fooled

0:25:49.600 --> 0:25:52.360
 by the 5G nanotech graphene oxide.

0:25:52.360 --> 0:25:54.400
 Can you, I'm sure you get that question all the time.

0:25:54.400 --> 0:25:56.920
 Do you just want to extrapolate on that a little bit,

0:25:56.920 --> 0:25:57.760
 your thoughts?

0:25:58.760 --> 0:26:03.080
 Yeah, I listened to some of the early reports

0:26:03.080 --> 0:26:05.920
 of the so-called discovery of graphene oxide.

0:26:05.920 --> 0:26:12.600
 And these guys said they would be presenting full detailed evidence of how

0:26:12.600 --> 0:26:18.960
 they identified it as graphene oxide, but that has never been presented. It's just

0:26:18.960 --> 0:26:29.200
 there's junk in the vaccines, physical particles, graphene oxide is compatible with what

0:26:29.200 --> 0:26:34.640
 they see. And there were some publications proposing that for mind

0:26:34.640 --> 0:26:50.320
 control and modification of cells that graphene oxide being able to pick up electromagnetic fields could be designed to translate electromagnetic

0:26:50.320 --> 0:26:57.200
 fields into particular nervous and chemical effects in the cell. But that there are just

0:26:57.200 --> 0:27:02.280
 a few articles proposing that, but what they did was blow it up and said it has already

0:27:02.280 --> 0:27:03.280
 been done.

0:27:03.280 --> 0:27:06.580
 And then Georgie interrupt me anytime I time so I was gonna shift the topic.

0:27:06.580 --> 0:27:08.600
 Something that I've been interested in

0:27:08.600 --> 0:27:10.640
 these past few months talking to different people

0:27:10.640 --> 0:27:13.040
 is that it seems like there's kind of themes

0:27:13.040 --> 0:27:14.320
 and maybe the people I talk to

0:27:14.320 --> 0:27:16.640
 and the theme currently is that people are doing

0:27:16.640 --> 0:27:18.480
 and this is not gonna blow your mind in any way

0:27:18.480 --> 0:27:19.640
 because you've been talking about this for a long time,

0:27:19.640 --> 0:27:20.880
 but people are doing significantly better

0:27:20.880 --> 0:27:23.560
 on like a one to two ratio of T3 to T4

0:27:23.560 --> 0:27:26.240
 or a one to one than even a one to three or one to four.

0:27:26.300 --> 0:27:29.640
 And so since that's just fresh in my mind right now, I just thought maybe we'd

0:27:29.640 --> 0:27:31.920
 concretize it here with just your thoughts on that.

0:27:31.920 --> 0:27:34.960
 And like, why would somebody do better on a one to one or one to two?

0:27:35.040 --> 0:27:35.200
 Right.

0:27:35.760 --> 0:27:40.640
 If you're, for example, under the influence of something like estrogen that is

0:27:40.680 --> 0:27:46.160
 interfering with liver function and cell function in general, especially interfering

0:27:46.160 --> 0:27:54.440
 with oxygen as the energy basis, causing a shift to oxidation of fatty acids, then this

0:27:54.440 --> 0:28:06.240
 wasting of oxygen as an energy source prevents the conversion of T4 to T3, the conversion requires a certain level of

0:28:06.240 --> 0:28:14.720
 glucose as the energy source. So high estrogen women in particular are

0:28:14.720 --> 0:28:22.320
 very, very frequently have a block between T4 and T3. That's been known for

0:28:22.320 --> 0:28:27.960
 decades that T4 in a healthy young man works almost exactly like T3, that's been known for decades that T4 in a healthy young man works almost exactly

0:28:27.960 --> 0:28:29.520
 like T3.

0:28:29.520 --> 0:28:37.480
 In women, it's about 10 times less likely to be an adequate thyroid supplement for thyroxine

0:28:37.480 --> 0:28:48.840
 alone or T4 because estrogen is such a deterrent to the conversion and men under stress who have done too much

0:28:48.840 --> 0:28:56.800
 aerobic exercise for example can't get their T3 to come back after the stress because factors

0:28:56.800 --> 0:29:06.160
 such as aromatase have been activated by the stress and continue to interfere with the glucose function.

0:29:06.160 --> 0:29:14.440
 And so stressed men and the average woman has a very low ability to convert thyroxine

0:29:14.440 --> 0:29:16.020
 to the active hormone.

0:29:16.020 --> 0:29:27.440
 And so if you give a ratio that has enough T3 to keep the oxidative system running and then just enough T4 to fill in

0:29:27.440 --> 0:29:35.540
 when there's a dip in energy availability. Everyone has their optimal ratio. Some people

0:29:35.540 --> 0:29:42.640
 do fine on just thyroxine, but they weren't really the bulk of the hypothyroid population.

0:29:42.640 --> 0:29:47.000
 It's a failure to convert that causes most hypothyroidism.

0:29:47.000 --> 0:29:49.080
 For yourself, can you detect a difference

0:29:50.200 --> 0:29:51.960
 between a one to one and a one to two?

0:29:51.960 --> 0:29:55.240
 No, I've never tried resolving it that fine.

0:29:55.240 --> 0:29:57.600
 And then, Georgie, interrupt me at any point.

0:29:57.600 --> 0:29:59.920
 I'd like something closer to three to one.

0:29:59.920 --> 0:30:01.520
 Well, so you mix it yourself?

0:30:01.520 --> 0:30:03.800
 I'll go along for days at a time

0:30:03.800 --> 0:30:05.160
 with nothing but CINO+,

0:30:05.160 --> 0:30:08.360
 but then I definitely feel a boost

0:30:08.360 --> 0:30:11.320
 if I bring it up to a three to one ratio.

0:30:11.320 --> 0:30:13.120
 Oh, so you supplement additional T3

0:30:13.120 --> 0:30:15.480
 to basically change the ratio, okay.

0:30:15.480 --> 0:30:17.960
 And is that a climate or seasonal thing?

0:30:17.960 --> 0:30:18.800
 Is it what?

0:30:18.800 --> 0:30:20.600
 Like a seasonal or climate thing,

0:30:20.600 --> 0:30:22.720
 like changing in the summer or winter?

0:30:22.720 --> 0:30:28.960
 Yeah, the need for thyroid is usually about four times as high in a northern winter as

0:30:28.960 --> 0:30:29.960
 during the summer.

0:30:29.960 --> 0:30:35.560
 And for many years, I found that two grains of armor was just right for me in the winter,

0:30:35.560 --> 0:30:39.560
 and only half a grain was enough to warm me up in the summer.

0:30:39.560 --> 0:30:41.080
 And then, Georgie, interrupt me at any point.

0:30:41.080 --> 0:30:47.880
 Okay, so I wanted to talk about, because we only have 15 minutes here, heavy metals, right? That was something that kind of got talked about on the internet

0:30:47.880 --> 0:30:51.560
 a little bit. And I know that you have an interesting, specific perspective, including

0:30:51.560 --> 0:30:55.800
 the redox balance into that equation, rather than just like the heavy metals are, I mean,

0:30:55.800 --> 0:31:00.960
 they're harmful, but they're harmful in context with like the overly reduced redox state,

0:31:00.960 --> 0:31:09.800
 right? Yeah, for example, if you're stressed for oxygen, that will bring up heme oxygenase,

0:31:09.800 --> 0:31:18.720
 which turns heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron.

0:31:18.720 --> 0:31:28.920
 And free iron, in the presence of a deficiency of oxygen is reduced, producing hydroxyl radicals

0:31:29.080 --> 0:31:31.720
 that cause oxidative damage.

0:31:31.720 --> 0:31:36.560
 So the oxygen deficiency leads to sort of explosive,

0:31:37.600 --> 0:31:40.840
 random type of oxidation, damaging proteins

0:31:40.840 --> 0:31:42.600
 and nucleic acids and everything.

0:31:42.600 --> 0:31:48.840
 So iron serves as like an emergency oxidizing agent? What was the oxygen agent? Iron, the free iron released, serves as an

0:31:48.840 --> 0:31:55.840
 emergency oxidizing agent? Yeah, in the presence of excess electrons, when oxygen

0:31:55.840 --> 0:32:08.480
 is deficient, the oxygen should be disposing of the excess electrons, lowering the reductive pressure of the cell and that

0:32:08.480 --> 0:32:14.120
 should detoxify any free iron that's sitting there. It should stay in a

0:32:14.120 --> 0:32:21.800
 harmless oxidized state, but the stress activates by having electrons escape and

0:32:21.800 --> 0:32:27.080
 reduce the iron so that the iron then reduces, converts

0:32:27.080 --> 0:32:28.580
 things to free radicals.

0:32:28.580 --> 0:32:31.460
 So what supplementing with quinones will essentially

0:32:31.460 --> 0:32:34.580
 protect partially from iron toxicity?

0:32:34.580 --> 0:32:38.260
 Yeah, I think that's how a lot of these so-called

0:32:38.260 --> 0:32:47.400
 antioxidants work. Like inside the cell, ascorbic acid is an oxidant, not an anti or reducing agent. If

0:32:47.400 --> 0:32:55.240
 you take so much that you experience a reducing atmosphere, that creates extreme

0:32:55.240 --> 0:33:00.320
 damage from free radicals. So the ascorbic acid is functioning as a

0:33:00.320 --> 0:33:05.000
 protective factor in the oxidized state of the cell.

0:33:05.580 --> 0:33:10.300
 And the so-called plant-derived,

0:33:10.300 --> 0:33:14.820
 so-called antioxidants, like flavonoids,

0:33:14.820 --> 0:33:17.420
 are actually inside the cell.

0:33:17.420 --> 0:33:21.780
 They're working like ascorbic acid as pro-oxidants,

0:33:21.780 --> 0:33:28.800
 helping to deliver randomly, reducing an electron pressure, converting

0:33:28.800 --> 0:33:36.200
 it into a more oxidizing state that protects against the free radicals.

0:33:36.200 --> 0:33:40.120
 I'm sure you've seen the studies that show that aside from the carcinogenicity of some

0:33:40.120 --> 0:33:48.860
 of the more heavy metals, like lead or aluminum, basically the majority of their chronic damage comes from increasing oxidative stress. Would the

0:33:48.860 --> 0:33:53.540
 same protective effect would be seen by supplementing with quinones or other

0:33:53.540 --> 0:33:56.980
 oxidizing agents against other heavy metal toxicity except iron?

0:33:56.980 --> 0:34:07.540
 I haven't seen that demonstrated but I'm sure it's happening, I think could be demonstrated if you had the right quinones

0:34:07.540 --> 0:34:10.140
 of right oxidative potential.

0:34:10.140 --> 0:34:15.540
 If someone has heavy metal toxicity, what would be your generic approach to mitigating

0:34:15.540 --> 0:34:19.740
 the damage and potentially, if it's even possible, getting those heavy metals out?

0:34:19.740 --> 0:34:27.320
 Things like coffee to accelerate a passage through the kidneys, heavy coffee drinkers were found

0:34:27.320 --> 0:34:31.840
 to have less heavy metal load, especially in their kidneys.

0:34:31.840 --> 0:34:37.680
 And then the things rich in flavonoid type substances such as orange juice and grape

0:34:37.680 --> 0:34:41.400
 juice have a huge protective effect.

0:34:41.400 --> 0:34:44.920
 But the direct chelation is potentially dangerous, right?

0:34:44.920 --> 0:34:49.000
 Because it can spread all over the body. Yeah. Okay, so how would these

0:34:49.000 --> 0:34:52.240
 flavonoids, what would be their mechanism of action if they're not

0:34:52.240 --> 0:35:01.240
 chelators? And same for the coffee. Oh, by essentially inactivating the free radical

0:35:01.240 --> 0:35:07.920
 conduction and regeneration. Okay, so if somebody has a buildup of some heavy metal, as long as they're protecting from

0:35:07.920 --> 0:35:12.200
 the free radical damage, over time you're saying the body should be able to excrete

0:35:12.200 --> 0:35:15.720
 that excess by its own mechanisms, there's no need for chelation.

0:35:15.720 --> 0:35:25.480
 Yeah, Hans Selye did experiments with mercury that suggests that's how it works with just the right amount of vitamin C, for example.

0:35:25.480 --> 0:35:33.320
 You can put the mercury into a harmless valence that passes out of the body with various chelators.

0:35:33.320 --> 0:35:34.320
 Okay.

0:35:34.320 --> 0:35:35.320
 What was I going to say?

0:35:35.320 --> 0:35:36.320
 Oh, the ... I forgot.

0:35:36.320 --> 0:35:37.320
 Anyways, let's go on.

0:35:37.320 --> 0:35:39.920
 All right, we'll go on to an advertisement here.

0:35:39.920 --> 0:35:41.880
 Okay, the newsletter is available by email now.

0:35:41.880 --> 0:35:46.200
 It's $30 for 12 issues over ... I can't believe I'm screwing this three years, right?

0:35:46.200 --> 0:35:48.780
 What was the new the new schedule for the newsletter?

0:35:56.120 --> 0:36:00.880
 Okay, 12 issues which can be paid through PayPal at Ray Pete's with an s newsletter at gmail.com

0:36:01.040 --> 0:36:06.440
 Raise books are available by the emailing the same address from PMS to menopause of progesterone

0:36:06.440 --> 0:36:09.040
 and ortho you nutrition for women. And then progesterone

0:36:09.040 --> 0:36:12.680
 from ketogen. You can email Catherine to purchase progesterone

0:36:12.700 --> 0:36:15.300
 ketogen at gmail.com. Each bottle of progesterone contains

0:36:15.300 --> 0:36:18.640
 3400 milligrams of progesterone. And you know, right in my

0:36:18.640 --> 0:36:22.560
 limited research on hair loss, it kept coming to my attention

0:36:22.560 --> 0:36:25.580
 that I thought progesterone was like the hair protective

0:36:25.580 --> 0:36:30.780
 hormone of course reading your work as well and seeing it in spironolactone be used in

0:36:30.780 --> 0:36:37.240
 kind of pre-finasteride or pre-propecia papers being used for hair loss, but why wouldn't

0:36:37.240 --> 0:36:38.240
 just

0:36:38.240 --> 0:36:45.400
 Those things are more profitable to promote even though they have huge side effect and the estrogen

0:36:45.400 --> 0:36:52.040
 industry has propagandized for decades against progesterone because if it was

0:36:52.040 --> 0:36:58.160
 realized that everything good about female hormones, protection against heart

0:36:58.160 --> 0:37:07.480
 disease for example, derives from progesterone, not from estrogen. If understanding progesterone goes too far,

0:37:07.480 --> 0:37:15.120
 the estrogen industry suffers. After 2002 when they saw that synthetic progestins with

0:37:15.120 --> 0:37:21.960
 estrogen caused increased mortality from heart disease and breast cancer and strokes, there

0:37:21.960 --> 0:37:25.440
 was a tremendous shift towards the use of progesterone.

0:37:25.440 --> 0:37:32.000
 And along with that came the estrogen industry financing all kinds of against progesterone.

0:37:32.000 --> 0:37:35.360
 And maybe for a young man or something losing hair listening to this,

0:37:35.360 --> 0:37:40.240
 why wouldn't just taking progesterone be, why would that be kind of an impotent approach?

0:37:40.240 --> 0:37:53.000
 Like why would that not be all that would be needed to correct that problem? It has to go with general and especially elimination of in the most factors block hair follicle.

0:37:53.000 --> 0:38:01.000
 That includes good thyroid function, good vitamin D function and adequate calcium among other things.

0:38:01.000 --> 0:38:07.640
 But progesterone with vitamin D and calcium and thyroid can not

0:38:07.640 --> 0:38:14.520
 only for restoring hair growth, but for everything and health and natural resistance will be

0:38:14.520 --> 0:38:15.520
 optimized.

0:38:15.520 --> 0:38:16.520
 Two comments here.

0:38:16.520 --> 0:38:20.920
 First, the studies on cyproterone acetate and the other synthetic progestins, if you

0:38:20.920 --> 0:38:26.240
 look at the dosages used for hair regrowth, there were 600 to 800 milligrams

0:38:26.240 --> 0:38:30.440
 daily. I don't know of that many people who tried using natural progesterone in those

0:38:30.440 --> 0:38:36.440
 doses. So the reports are usually coming from people saying, why is my hair not coming back?

0:38:36.440 --> 0:38:41.820
 Also a second comment, case report, a college buddy of mine, originally from Italy, mountain

0:38:41.820 --> 0:38:47.840
 climber, basically lost all of his hair, classic androgenic alopecia, by the age of 22.

0:38:47.840 --> 0:38:49.080
 We were roommates in college.

0:38:49.080 --> 0:38:51.920
 And then he basically kind of gave up on civilization

0:38:51.920 --> 0:38:55.720
 and went to live in a commune in the Tian Shan Mountains

0:38:55.720 --> 0:38:57.940
 in Central Asia, in Kyrgyzstan.

0:38:57.940 --> 0:39:00.760
 And he fully regrew his hair,

0:39:00.760 --> 0:39:02.160
 has a full head of hair now,

0:39:02.160 --> 0:39:04.800
 and refuses to come back to civilization,

0:39:04.800 --> 0:39:06.120
 saying that

0:39:06.120 --> 0:39:09.960
 it's essentially killing us, which I'm sure you'll fully agree with.

0:39:09.960 --> 0:39:15.280
 And he lives at about 14,000 feet and says that life there is perfect and he does not

0:39:15.280 --> 0:39:19.580
 want to jeopardize it by coming back to and living at lower altitude.

0:39:19.580 --> 0:39:23.160
 He only goes to Italy maybe once a year to see his parents, but other than that, he's

0:39:23.160 --> 0:39:25.440
 given up on modern life.

0:39:25.440 --> 0:39:32.000
 Yeah, the high altitudes, the only thing wrong with 14,000 feet is it's always cold but there's

0:39:32.000 --> 0:39:38.240
 very lower incidence of all of the degenerative diseases.

0:39:38.240 --> 0:39:40.680
 I hadn't heard about hair growth.

0:39:40.680 --> 0:39:46.920
 Dental health is very different at high altitude than at sea level.

0:39:46.920 --> 0:39:49.960
 Heart disease is much lower at high altitude.

0:39:49.960 --> 0:39:59.200
 Dementia, cancer and I guess you could include premature hair loss as a degenerative disease

0:39:59.200 --> 0:40:01.880
 but that's interesting to hear that he had four.

0:40:01.880 --> 0:40:05.960
 Now I mean I see him maybe once every couple of years, if he even comes to the States,

0:40:05.960 --> 0:40:06.960
 he doesn't do it anymore.

0:40:06.960 --> 0:40:11.040
 We sometimes exchange emails when he goes down to, forget what's the Kyrgyz city, he

0:40:11.040 --> 0:40:13.440
 goes down once a month to check his email there.

0:40:13.440 --> 0:40:18.200
 But he basically says it's not just the hair, he says that once you get out of the big city

0:40:18.200 --> 0:40:23.320
 and go out in nature, he says that he cannot explain, but life is so much more real and

0:40:23.320 --> 0:40:24.820
 full there.

0:40:24.820 --> 0:40:26.560
 And he doesn't miss any of the amenities

0:40:26.560 --> 0:40:27.400
 of civilization.

0:40:27.400 --> 0:40:29.720
 He has water and electricity, and that's just about

0:40:29.720 --> 0:40:32.920
 everything he needs to live a fulfilled life.

0:40:32.920 --> 0:40:36.360
 Yeah, the people, just mountain climbers,

0:40:36.360 --> 0:40:39.880
 for many years, have remarked on the euphoria,

0:40:39.880 --> 0:40:41.800
 a sense of well-being they feel

0:40:41.800 --> 0:40:44.240
 when they get up to a high altitude.

0:40:44.240 --> 0:40:48.000
 First time I went up, I fatigued on the long walk

0:40:48.000 --> 0:40:52.000
 through the mountain, but after getting to about 7,000 or 8,000 feet,

0:40:52.000 --> 0:40:56.000
 I felt like jumping and skipping and running

0:40:56.000 --> 0:40:58.000
 the rest of the way.

0:40:58.000 --> 0:41:02.000
 So what do you think modern life offers as a benefit, if anything?

0:41:02.000 --> 0:41:06.740
 What's the indispensable thing that modern life offers that we cannot do without

0:41:06.740 --> 0:41:08.500
 if we move to live in a...

0:41:08.500 --> 0:41:12.640
 I've never understood that billions of people

0:41:12.640 --> 0:41:14.440
 don't move to the mountains.

0:41:14.440 --> 0:41:17.180
 They will quickly turn them into, I don't know,

0:41:17.180 --> 0:41:18.740
 Disneyland or something.

0:41:18.740 --> 0:41:21.700
 Absolutely, last thing on this, then I'll let you go, Ray.

0:41:21.700 --> 0:41:24.420
 Maybe you said it a long time ago that for hair loss,

0:41:24.420 --> 0:41:25.400
 the intervention had

0:41:25.400 --> 0:41:29.080
 to be proportionate. People are always saying like, oh, you know, I know my friend who eats

0:41:29.080 --> 0:41:33.620
 bad and he keeps his hair and I'm losing my hair. Like what? What? That person losing

0:41:33.620 --> 0:41:38.240
 hair and is in more advanced state of aging or stress. But that to a lot of people, that's

0:41:38.240 --> 0:41:41.080
 not apparent that that's what's happening. Would you agree with that?

0:41:41.080 --> 0:41:50.580
 You've probably heard of the priest aging, the circulatory system, but bald people have that at a very high

0:41:50.580 --> 0:41:55.480
 frequency and it's an indication of the likelihood of a heart disease

0:41:55.480 --> 0:42:01.880
 developing. And so it does show up in other aspects of the health. And just

0:42:01.880 --> 0:42:04.800
 before you leave, what why does that happen? Like the the circulatory

0:42:04.800 --> 0:42:10.640
 system causes that defect in the ear? The hair follicle has to produce energy vigorously

0:42:10.640 --> 0:42:18.240
 and if your systemic energy is being blocked in some way, the skin is one of the first

0:42:18.240 --> 0:42:28.000
 places that can experience, you can live with quite a bit of atrophy of your hair and skin and nails and

0:42:28.000 --> 0:42:32.500
 still keep your lungs and brain working.

0:42:32.500 --> 0:42:44.280
 The skin and the simus and a lot of the muscular systems, the blood vessels are protected a

0:42:44.280 --> 0:42:45.260
 lot more than the

0:42:45.260 --> 0:42:48.180
 skeletal muscles against stress and aging.

0:42:48.220 --> 0:42:52.000
 Really appreciate it. Good. Did I cut you off? Right? I thought

0:42:52.000 --> 0:42:56.220
 I'd cut you off, but I was gonna let you go. I don't want to keep

0:42:56.220 --> 0:42:59.180
 you longer than an hour. Okay, Ray, I sincerely appreciate it.

0:42:59.180 --> 0:43:01.260
 Thank you so much for joining us. Georgie Dinkov. Thank you so

0:43:01.260 --> 0:43:03.900
 much, guys. Thank you. We only had an hour today. But again,

0:43:03.900 --> 0:43:06.800
 Ray, thank you so much. We went over so much in an hour, so I really appreciate

0:43:06.800 --> 0:43:10.600
 it. Okay, everybody, have a safe weekend. We'll talk to you guys soon. Peace out. Take

0:43:10.600 --> 0:43:11.440
 care. Okay, bye.
