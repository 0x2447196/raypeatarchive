00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 My name's Andrew Murray.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 And for those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 from 7 to 8pm, I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 I run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 And from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 oh, very many varied questions, cholesterol, further questions from people asking about various different conditions.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 It's going to be a kind of open-ended show asking, like I said, many different questions

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 that I'm getting on a fairly consistent basis because it goes contrary to popular belief.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 So the number if you live in the area is 923 3911.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 If you live outside the area, this whole free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 It can also be reached at the end of the show on 1-888-WBM and generally Monday through Friday business hours.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 Okay, so once again, for those people who perhaps have never tuned into the show,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Dr. Raymond Peat has become a fairly firm fixture to our monthly shows.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And we're very pleased and very happy to have his wisdom on the show.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 So it's very nice of you to join us again, Dr. Peat.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Hi.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Thank you for joining.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Like I said, every month pretty much there might have been people who have not heard of you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 And it would be a very good idea for you to just give us a resume of your professional and academic background before we get started.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Okay.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 I taught in several areas.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 My first teaching job happened to be biology oriented towards physics majors.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 But I also taught literature and painting.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 And then I decided to concentrate on biology, physiology,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 intending to concentrate on the brain because of my interest in language.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 But because of the doctrinaire nature of the nerve biology people,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 I went into the reproductive physiology and aging.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 I happened to be a specialty of the sodar wall in particular,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 but several of the physiology people were interested in age-related changes.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 So that's what I did my dissertation on 1972.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Very good.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Okay.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 Now, I understand that you have been advising a wide range of people about a wide range of conditions with your personalized research-based approach to sickness,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 disease, ill health, and you have some pretty, yeah, pretty groundbreaking ideas that are not at all common.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 I wanted to kind of open up the show, the beginning of the show, and just remind people that they're welcome to call in.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 We generally have people calling in from 730 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 But if people want to call in at any time, I think they should leave that open to people because it's always always get the phones ringing,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 perhaps, and people end up having to hang up before they get their turn to get their question in.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 So let's just open up the lines from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 But Dr. Peat, I have several questions that I wanted to pose you before we get on with the kind of broader subject of tonight.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 And I get quite a few people have been asking this question.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 And so I just wanted to put it to you and for you to answer yourself.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 One person in particular has a young friend who's in hospital with preeclampsia, and the doctors actually want her to abort the baby.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 And this lady in particular won't won't abort. She's trying to keep her blood pressure under control.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 But don't actually the doctors don't have it under control and it spikes up and down.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 She's very health conscious and they're letting her eat her own food while in the hospital.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 And she's at 24 weeks. And they say that she has to remain in the hospital until the birth.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 What's what's your general impression of preeclampsia and the best approach to its treatment?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 Because I know there's lots of differing solutions for it.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 And the doctors certainly have their own approach to it.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 But physiologically, how do you view preeclampsia and its treatment?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 When I first was interested in biology, I saw that preeclampsia was one of the most dogmatic areas of medicine.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 And until fairly recently, about 30 years ago, almost all doctors were taught that it is a genetic related disease sort of intended to kill off poor people

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 because poor people had a very high incidence of preeclampsia and other pregnancy related problems.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 And the idea was that the mother's nutrition had nothing to do with the development of the baby.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Bad genes in the baby were possibly poisoning the mother was a theory.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 But Tom Brewer, a medical doctor who happened to actually study nutrition,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 was instrumental in gradually over a period of 30 years changing that medical dogma.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 It still isn't very clearly understood.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Two people influenced by him were Douglas Shanklin and Jay Hoden,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 who wrote a book about, I guess, 40 years ago now called Maternal Nutrition and Child Health.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 And Tom Brewer had found that just having the women salt their food to taste and drink at least a quart, maybe two quarts of milk a day,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 but to definitely get 80 grams or more of protein per day.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 And he said that what was currently popular at that time for controlling the blood pressure of preeclampsia

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 related to the idea that blood pressure in anyone with hypertension could be controlled by restricting salt.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 And that idea was promoted by the drug industry when they came out with diuretics

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 that were supposed to lower pure blood pressure by causing you to lose salt in the urine.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
 So that was applied unscientifically to the high blood pressure of preeclampsia.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 And it was killing and causing defects in the babies by starving their brains, by reducing the blood volume.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 And Tom Brewer observed that a farmer who restricted the sodium for his pregnant pigs would soon go out of business.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 But it took a long time to stop that sort of barbaric pharmaceutical instigated practice.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 The book by Shanklin and Hoden cited some studies in which the only intervention was to supplement sodium several grams extra a day.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 And those studies showed that in some cases just increasing the amount of salt in the diet was enough to correct the blood pressure

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 by increasing the volume of fluid and blood so that there was enough blood in circulation to properly oxygenate the fetus.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And with proper oxygenation, then the kidney could regulate things so that the production of aldosterone decreased.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Salt intake is directly related to the suppression of aldosterone, which increases blood pressure.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 So when you restrict salt, you increase aldosterone, which increases blood pressure.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 So in Tom Brewer's approach, since he recommended milk, a couple of quarts of milk a day and fruit, vegetables,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 was also increasing on average their calcium and vitamin D intake.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 And those happen to be very protective for blood pressure in general, and especially in preeclampsia.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 So the almost exact opposite of what the current recommendations are,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 normally salt restriction and the dietary advice is definitely not in keeping with what you just mentioned.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 OK, so the basic idea is to increase the protein content of the mother's diet and increase the salt intake.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 And the calcium.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 And calcium and vitamin D. So yeah, you mentioned those two things.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Now what do you think is the best source of protein?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 I know you're a big advocate of gelatin as a balanced kind of amino acid based protein.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 Milk, cheese, eggs, and among the vegetables, potatoes are the best protein.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 OK, very good.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 OK, good. So that's the first question I had.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 So that person hopefully will receive this either on the online archive or I can directly post it to them.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 OK, well, I had another question from another person very recently,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 and they wanted to know a little bit more about the subject of aortic valve stenosis.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 They have a male friend who's about 30 years old and apparently has had this condition for some time already.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 And their doctor is thinking he'll have to have surgery pretty soon.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 So aortic valve stenosis where the valve is narrowing and causing a murmur and or other volumetric flow problems.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 The fibrous tissue replaces the normal elastic tissue with aging in general,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 but inflammation can accelerate it. Stress and inflammation in a particular area will stimulate the production of too much collagen,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 overgrowth of fibrous tissue. And that happens in the heart when it's being overworked or undernourished.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 And the valve happens to just be an area which is constantly being stretched and stressed by the amount of work it does.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 And one of the mediators of inflammation that can be triggered just by stretching is serotonin.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 And people who have an intestinal disease that overproduces serotonin very often have that particular problem.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Valve fibrosis and narrowing of the blood vessels.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 And so looking at the general diet, avoiding intestinal irritation will in many cases lower the exposure to serotonin in all of the tissues.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 And will especially protect the heart.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Some of the drugs that increase both serotonin and dopamine, both of those happen to intensify the production of fibrous tissue.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 So the SSRIs you're talking about here?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Yeah, in particular. This is the worst.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Currently very common medications.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 Things that cause inflammation generally.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 So aspirin is very protective against almost any kind of degenerative and fibrotic disease, even radiation exposure.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Okay, so can I interrupt you for a second? You said that the valvular tissue that is subject to this fibrosis and causing eventual stenosis, as they call it, of the valve.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Is this serotonin actually produced within the cells of the valve or is this something that is more of a systemic circulating component?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Nearly all the bodies' serotonin is produced in the intestine.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
 It just happens to be rich in the type of cell that can produce it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And with a bad diet, those cells multiply and can even form tumors.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 But in the average person, about 95% of our serotonin comes from the intestine.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 And then it's carried in the platelets in the bloodstream.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 And the lung is where it's detoxified.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 The platelets should not give up their serotonin until they reach the lungs.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 But with overwork or various things that produce inflammation, the whole lining of the circulatory system can be overexposed to serotonin.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And the valve happens to get both the stretching and the chemical exposure.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 And hormonal situations that, for example, cause you to hyperventilate and not retain enough carbon dioxide will cause the platelets to dump out their serotonin and cause increased inflammation.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 So any systemic stress that causes a loss of carbon dioxide will increase that.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 And diabetes happens to be a failure to oxidize sugar properly and instead turns sugar to lactic acid.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 And the lactic acid displaces the carbon dioxide and the loss of carbon dioxide causes serotonin exposure.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Do you think that you could measure the serotonin on the breath as a marker of how stressed somebody is?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 I wonder if there's any easy... Do you know of any...

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Yeah, you can measure almost anything in the breath with the right apparatus.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 But since serotonin acts partly through the stimulation of nitric oxide in any cell that it's irritating,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 the process of forming inflammation and fibrosis under the influence of serotonin involves the local increase of nitric oxide.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 And being a gas, nitric oxide is easy to see in the breath.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And so they're analyzing a person's health just by measuring the amount of nitric oxide in the breath.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Yeah, sounds like a pretty good way to get a measurement on it.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Well, okay, they're very interesting. I think it's always good to refresh people's understanding,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 or at least their concepts to get changed by some new news about things.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 And I know in the news they're always coming up with various studies and articles.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 It just takes a long time for it to get to the mainstream medical community.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 So again, go ahead. I've been seeing lots of advertisements for arginine supplements and related amino acids

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 with the deliberate intention of increasing nitric oxide.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 That has derived from the pharmaceutical promotion of the idea that increased nitric oxide lowers blood pressure,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 restores youth and virility and so on. Viagra, for example, is supposed to increase your nitric oxide.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 But since nitric oxide is the mediator of inflammation and degeneration,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 it's very good to avoid any of those supplements intended to increase it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Now, am I right in thinking I'm just misguided when I think about nitric oxide as a vasodilator

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 and that's maybe why they are looking at it as a blood pressure?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 Yeah.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 But they're missing the point that the whole inflammatory cascade caused by nitric oxide is far worse than any perceived benefit of vasodilation.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Yeah. There are other ways to dilate the blood vessels safely.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 Keeping your carbon dioxide up, for example, suppresses free radical damage and relaxes the blood vessels in a safe way

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 in proportion to the amount of circulation needed.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 So when your tissue is burning a lot of oxygen and sugar, it produces a lot of carbon dioxide,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 relaxes the blood vessels and opens them up.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 But nitric oxide is produced under irritation and things that produce inflammation.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 So when you get that kind of vasodilation, for example, scratching your skin,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 some people are very sensitive to getting a flare that turns red when you scratch the skin.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 That's largely nitric oxide release.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Okay. So they call that dermography, I don't know, where you can write on the skin as it were with your finger.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 So that's nitric oxide release from the mast cells or from dermal cells?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 Oh, I think it's largely the mast cells which also produce serotonin and histamine, which in turn activates nitric oxide.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 But the same thing happens invisibly when your intestine is irritated or when your heart valves are overstretched.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Yeah, that's interesting.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 You talk about that whole stretching as being an irritation, inflammation, stroke, serotonin releasing or inducing type situation.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 And the intestines, their prime function is to squeeze and move the food contents along from start to finish

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 and so that area, you would imagine, comes under a lot of stretching activity.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So that again, I wonder whether or not that is in part responsible for the serotonin production that you said happens principally in the gut.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Yeah. When an experimenter is just looking at a piece of exposed intestine,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 they find that just gentle rubbing a finger across it causes serotonin release.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Okay. Well, let's just remind people what's going on.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMED Gallivoo 91.1 FM.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 And from 7.30 or indeed from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's wide-ranging subject of questions

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 which we'll be working our way into some of the cholesterol myth and answering questions again from various interested people.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 So the number if you live in the area is, gosh, 93 3911.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 Or if you live outside the area, the 800 number is K1800, K-M-U-D-R-A-D.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 Okay. So people are very welcome to call in any time now.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 So, Dr. Peat, cholesterol again. I don't mean to bore you.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 I know we've done several shows on cholesterol, but keep getting questions about cholesterol

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 because there's such an entrenched dogma surrounding it.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 And my main question is I wonder why the doctors don't know any more about it

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 because they all seem to be totally convinced that LDL versus HDL is the main problem

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 and that actually atheroma and coronary artery in particular narrowing

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 that whole coronary artery disease is caused by cholesterol.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 And I know you have very different opinions about that and scientifically based opinions that I'm no validated.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 But what do you what do you what do you see with atherosclerosis, for example,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 and why is lowering cholesterol artificially a bad idea?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 In the 1950s, the seed oil industry knew that there was an inverse relation between eating a lot of unsaturated oil

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 and cholesterol level and they on the basis of that to sell their oil,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 even though they were arguing that it was a natural food because of the idea that it contains essential fatty acids,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 which at that time the essential fatty acid was linoleic acid and its animal extension arachidonic acid.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 But even though no one claimed that even if they were essential, that anyone would need more than a few hundred milligrams per day,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 they started selling the idea that since it lowers cholesterol,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 that it must be good for you if you eat an ounce or so a day and that much does lower cholesterol.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 But it is probably something like a toxic effect on the liver.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 The liver, when it when the body senses a need for defense, a sense of stress,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 the liver and the intestine will increase their production of cholesterol because cholesterol as the precursor for the protective hormones,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 DHEA, pregnenolone and progesterone, as you increase the circulating cholesterol,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 you increase the production of these defensive hormones.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 So if you are poisoned, your body produces more cholesterol and thus more pregnenolone, progesterone and DHEA.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 And if for 70 or 80 years now, it's been demonstrated over and over that any poison you can think of,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 if you inject intravenously cholesterol, it's an antidote for everything from arsenic to cobra venom.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 It protects red cells against breaking down and so on, but it protects every cell in the body

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 and practically at every imaginable level from the stability of chromosomes and DNA

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 to the stability of the mitotic cell division apparatus to the so-called membrane or cytarchitecture

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 that holds the cell together.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 It's a stabilizing factor at every imaginable level of the cell.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Okay, I don't mean to cut you short and I will pick up this after these next callers posted their questions to you,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 but we have a caller on the line.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 So let's just start by taking this first caller.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Caller, you're on the air and where are you calling from?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Hi, I'm calling from New Jersey.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Okay, hi, welcome to the show.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 Hi.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 I'm really floored by what you just said.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 My question was totally off topic and a very different one,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 but I guess I'd also like to know just responding to what Dr. Peat just said,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 where would one get injectable cholesterol?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 I mean, and I'm not being flippant.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 That's just for experiments, but you can increase your cholesterol by optimizing your nutrition.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 Orange juice is a very practical way to increase your cholesterol, which many people are surprised at.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 There were experiments in which people, medical students, ate as many as 20 eggs a day or egg yolks

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 and couldn't raise their cholesterol.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 But if you have low cholesterol, some sugars such as orange juice will usually bring it up to normal.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Wow.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 So what was your initial question?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 That was a very direct answer to my question.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Now, the question I called about was very, very different.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Can magnets be used for bioregeneration?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 And if your answer is yes, how could we use them effectively?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 And I'm going to say thank you and I'm going to sign off and listen to you all.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 Thank you.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Thanks for your question.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 To use what?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 Magnets for bioremediation.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 I think she said regeneration.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 Regeneration, beg your pardon.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Bioregeneration.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 So do you know anything about magnets and their application for bioregeneration?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Yeah, in the 1960s, I was reading on the subject and I was so interested in a Russian researcher's work.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Yuri Holodov had demonstrated that the gonads and the brain are extremely sensitive to magnetic fields.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 And since those were the tissues that I was most interested in investigating, I went to Russia to talk to him.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Wow.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 He said the politicians were very encouraging for giving foreigners their latest information.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 But he gave me just an amazingly complete bibliography, which when I got back to the U.S., I found a lot of those sources.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 And so I learned that there was a really good foundation for being able to sense magnetic fields and for them to have effects on the brain and the gonads in particular.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 And a scientific reason.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 Absolutely.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Madeline Barnacy and her husband, that was one of the books he referred me to.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 What was the name of the authors? Sorry.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Barnacy, B-A-R-N-O-T-H-Y.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 My American professors had never heard of the field at all.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 And Salko Tromp, a Dutchman, T-R-O-M-P, who invented the whole field of medical biometeorology practically in the 1930s and '40s.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 He was aware of the biological sensitivity of organisms to magnetic fields and his work on the nervous system probably gave the computer people the idea of how to use liquid crystals in display systems and such.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 So he was like 30, 40 years ahead of most technologists.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 Wow. I don't know how you come up with this stuff, Dr. Peake.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 This is completely unrehearsed, folks.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 I promise you I never had this question prepared.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 And you've blown me away with what you mentioned about going to Russia.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 That's far out.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 Anyway, I hope that I'm not quite sure if you fully answered your caller's question there or if you had anything else to add.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 If you didn't, it doesn't matter.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 OK, so, yeah, totally, totally can be used.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Interesting field of science that you've looked into yourself.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 I'm really grateful for that.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 I think, do we have any other callers on the air?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Let me just get the attention.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 Yeah, we do. One more caller.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 So let's take this caller. And you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Hello. Am I on the air?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Yeah, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 I'm from Arcata.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 OK. Very good.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 Hi. Hi, Dr. Peake.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 I've been listening to you for a few years.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 Randomly, I hear the show and I'm usually only listening halfway.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 I apologize.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 And it seems like I need to listen fully to comprehend what you're talking about.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 I just, I don't think you can fully explain all of it to me right now because it seems a lot of it is contradictory to the mainstream health propaganda or whatever it is.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
 But could you just explain the part about the serotonin not being a beneficial thing?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Because it seems like we get a lot of how beneficial serotonin is for just, you know, thinking happy thoughts and stuff.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 And now I'm hearing from you that it's not really good to have serotonin.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 So I'm a little confused about that.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 If you could just simplify something for me in that way.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 My website has two or three articles that touch on points of the history of serotonin.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 And I think a lot of it came when they, in the 1960s, realized that it was an antagonist to LSD in many ways.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 And the government demonized LSD, took it out of use as a drug or medication and turned it into a danger that was driving people crazy.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 And so the drug industry, knowing that serotonin antagonized LSD, I think they took advantage of that and said that if LSD makes you crazy, then serotonin is the good guy.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 And before that, people who studied the intestinal tumor that overproduces serotonin, psychosis and aggression and anxiety were outstanding features of their psychotic state from being flooded with huge amounts of serotonin.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 So I think it had to be the reverse psychology of being an LSD antagonist that led to the idea that it's a happy drug.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 So why do so many people that take Prozac, for example, think that they're not depressed anymore when they...

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Those drugs, besides in many cases increasing the exposure to serotonin, their beneficial effects seem to be from many other things that they do.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 For example, typically they will increase several of the so-called transmitter substances, but their beneficial effect corresponds to the increasing brain progesterone and other steroids.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 So the irritation in the brain increases the production of these steroids and the mood lift comes when your brain progesterone and pregnenolone are increasing.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Okay, well, thanks. I'll look on your website.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 Okay, thank you for your call. So yeah, Dr. Peat, you've mentioned many times that serotonin itself is an inflammatory mediator, an anti-life, an antioxidant type molecule in terms of its inflammation.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 Yeah, each of these things has its local effect. We seem to have inherited them from very simple life stages.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Everyone, even plants and single-celled organisms, use or respond to most of these things. But for example, in the intestine, if you eat something really dangerous, the inflammation causes a surge of serotonin, which causes spasms and secretion and creates diarrhea.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 And vomiting.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Get rid of it. So it's very functional in the acute sense. Over a matter of hours, it will save you from absorbing too much of a poisonous food.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 But if it becomes chronic, things like irritable bowel syndrome involve a chronic overproduction of serotonin.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Interesting.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 It stimulates cell division. So when the blood vessels are constantly being -- if you spill it out of your platelets and expose the blood vessels to it, it stimulates growth.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 So it thickens the walls of the blood vessels as well as makes them leaky so that anything like circulating proteins in the blood can leak into the tissues.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 The barrier between the blood and the brain, for example, is broken down by serotonin and nitric oxide.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Okay. Well, let's just refresh listeners' minds about the calling number if they'd like to do so.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
 You're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KMUD Gallivood Road, 91.1 FM.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 If you live in the area, the number is 707-923-3911.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 Or if you're outside the area, there's a toll-free number, which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 We're very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat this evening.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 So, Dr. Peat, I've got some more questions from other people that want to pose this question.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 But I'll tell you what, the engineers just said that the phones are ringing.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 So let's take this next caller on the air. You're on the air. Where are you from?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 Locally here from Garville area. Been here 42 years.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 I listen to the show as often as I can, and I just want to thank you, gentlemen, for putting out the straight skinny on what's going down medically in this country.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 And, Dr. Peat, you're just a goldmine of information, sir.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 Isn't he?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 And the question I have is, I've called in before on my Crohn's disease, and I've had five major military surgeries and moving all but about six, seven feet of my intestines.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
 I have a double ostomy where small intestine and large intestine come to the outside of my body.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 And slowing my bowel down enough to be able to assimilate food and liquid has been a major problem of mine.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 And presently, I've tried a lot of different things. I even tried an antihistamine that you recommended once.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 And presently, the only thing that seems to work quite well is opiates.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 And, of course, being on maximum opiates with the military for years, I mean, six, 700 milligrams of morphine a day in time release,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 which, you know, half the pills go through your body without even being dissolved.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 I've gone to much lower levels, 4 milligram tablets of the lot of them, about 200 a month.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 I was wondering, as long as this seems to be working, do you think I should stick with this?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 I might mention, too, that I have no other symptoms of Crohn's anymore.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 And you aren't having any side effects from the opiates?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 No, I don't seem to have any side effects at all. I don't even get high from them.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 I don't get warm and fuzzy or anything like that. It just seems to slow the bowel down enough.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 Instead of my short, small intestine cycling at maybe 45 minutes, it'll slow it down to maybe 3 1/2, 4 hours.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 You know, the whole process of my food going through.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Hmm, interesting. What do you think of that, Dr. Peat?

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 It sounds like he's adapted very well to the opiates. But have you had thorough hormone tests, blood tests, for things that might be related?

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 I've had numerous blood tests done. In fact, for years now, because of missed medical management with the VA, which I left,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:19.000
 and I'm now with local Red River Rural Health Center, they were always taking 6-8 bottles of blood out of me every 2 months or so.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 And I went through cycles of having to go in for saline solution to bring up my hydration level 4-5 times during the summer.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 Now, for the last year and a half since this FPN, physician-assisted, has been listening to me, because I've had Crohn's disease for almost 30 years now.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 And consequently, I know more about Crohn's and the side effects of this disease and what drugs do to my body than most medical people do,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 even gastrointestinologists that I've talked with.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 And so this FPN has been to me, as far as absorbing information from me, feedback from a patient.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 And we've tried this, and so far this seems to be working quite well.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 So I've been wanting to stick with it. When I see a regular MD, he maybe wants to take me off it and put me on some cyclamine.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 And of course, that does nothing for my osteoporosis or arthritis pain, and it does nothing for a night cough that I have from emphysema from laying down.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:41.000
 So I'm actually attacking 3 different symptoms of old body disease with just one drug, so to speak.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 And all of my blood levels seem to be fairly in balance.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 I try to take any amendments I can, as much in liquid forms.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 I take a liquid B-complex, and then I take a couple thousand units of D a day, and I take some E.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 And I use blackstrap molasses as a source of minerals.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 About two tablespoons of that a day seems to really mineralize my body fairly well.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 And how much calcium and magnesium are you getting?

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 I eat at least two pints, half pints rather, of yogurt every day.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 So I do take a little bit of milk and coffee, but that's not really a good source of calcium.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 But I think the yogurt helps with my gut and plurin fauna, and it gives me a source of calcium too.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 I can't seem to find liquid calcium, so I don't take hard pills if I can help it, because they just pretty much don't do that much good.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 What about cheese?

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 About what, sir?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 Cheese as a source of calcium.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
 I'm a coffee drinker pretty much.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 I use that for a diuretic to keep my kidneys functioning.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 I find that by drinking coffee, it has a tendency to pull water out of my gut into my bloodstream.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:15.000
 And of course, I have only half of a bladder now because of intestinal alterations to the bladder in former years, and of course I had to remove part of that.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
 But Dr. Peat is suggesting cheese as for calcium.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 Yeah, I didn't know that cheese really contained that much calcium, and I'm pretty astute that way.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 I'm sure you can give it a try. I'm going to look into it. I know that.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:40.000
 I think vitamin K and vitamin D would help you retain calcium, but you probably aren't getting enough calcium.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 Coffee is a good source of magnesium.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 Right.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 Yeah, well, I'm going to definitely take your advice, Dr. Peat, because you sure you didn't blow off the turnip truck yesterday.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 And I want to thank you so much for that suggestion.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 Okay, thank you for your call, Guy.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
 And we do have another one on the air, so let's give this person their go.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 Caller, you're on the air, and where are you from?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 I'm from here, Southern Humboldt.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 Okay.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 And I wanted to see what kind of tea for calcium was recommended, and also if there was anything for blood pressure that goes up and down.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 It goes high, and then it goes low, and is there something to regulate that?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 Yeah, just to clarify the last caller, it was cheese.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 So this is as in the fermented dairy cheese for calcium, because it's rich in milk.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 So anyway, your next question about --

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 Okay, cheese, not tea.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 Yeah, cheese.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 Okay.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 Okay, so as far as your blood pressure question is concerned, Dr. Peat, for cyclic kind of variations and fluctuations of blood pressure,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 that's also in keeping with some of this -- tonight's topic with vasoconstriction and dilation and the regulation of that.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 What advice do you have for that?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 Well, all the minerals we've been talking about, fruit juice, very well-cooked green leaves, cheese and milk, orange juice is a good source of things besides the minerals.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 But vitamin D and vitamin K help to regulate all of the minerals, really, but especially calcium and magnesium.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 And a big dose of vitamin K, it's now available in oily form without any harmful excipients so that you can get a milligram per drop.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:48:03.000
 And big doses have been able to correct osteoporosis, not just slow its progress, but reverse it.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 And at the same time, it takes calcium out of the blood vessels and tends to correct hypertension.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 And by regulating your energy metabolism, it might even help to prevent episodes of low blood pressure.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:39.000
 It works with coenzyme Q10 to maintain oxidative metabolism in mitochondria.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:46.000
 So it's not the simple clotting vitamin that it's medically known as.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:56.000
 It's a brain repair, blood vessel repair, bone repair, and actually can prevent excess clotting.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 You know, that was one of my other questions, and I was going to ask you why doctors are so against vitamin K.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:10.000
 I've had several people that we've worked with have been using it, and their doctors have been completely against it.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:20.000
 They were taught in medical school that K stands for clot, and that if you take vitamin K, you will increase blood clotting.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
 That's what they all say. They all say it's going to increase your clotting, and they get very concerned,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
 especially if they're patients using warfarin or other blood-thinning drugs.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:44.000
 Yeah, but the blood clot system is incredibly complicated, and two of the essential factors are called protein C and protein S,

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000
 and they happen to prevent abnormal coagulation, and you can't make them without vitamin K.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:01.000
 They're involved not just in preventing clots but in many other cell functions.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 So you said that a big dose of vitamin K, what would that be for daily use?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:24.000
 Well, I know several people who used around 50 milligrams per day for one person who had a chronic steady blood pressure of 220 over 70,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:36.000
 a tremendous gap between the top and bottom numbers, in two or three weeks was down to 140 over 70.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:44.000
 One person who was taking a drug to prevent hypertension started on similar doses,

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:51.000
 and within a couple of weeks, his blood pressure was getting too low, so he had to stop his drug.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000
 Okay.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
 Okay, thank you.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
 We do have -- thank you for your call, caller. Thank you for your question, Ralph the caller.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
 We've got two other people on the line, so I just want to wait and see if we can get these people.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
 Hi, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
 Hello.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 Hi.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 I'm from Phil here in Southern Humboldt.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
 Hi.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 I've got two questions, one about the vitamin -- hello?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
 Yeah, you're on the air.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 Okay, one about the vitamin K.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:23.000
 I'm taking Prodaxa right now as a blood thinner because I have a situation with atrial fibrillation,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:33.000
 and I was taking a calcium that had vitamin K in it and other things that helped you absorb the calcium,

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000
 but the lady at the health food store said that vitamin K thins the blood,

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000
 so if you're taking a blood thinner already, it might be too much.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
 You know, it might be too much of a blood thinner to take the vitamin K.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
 What do you think about that?

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
 No, I've never heard of that.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:58.000
 So you think that it's okay to take the vitamin K as well as the blood thinner?

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:05.000
 I think so. It's good to have your blood clotting system checked periodically,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
 though, if you're taking a warfarin-type --

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
 I'm taking Prodaxa.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
 I didn't notice that there was a problem.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.000
 Like, you know, a couple times I've cut myself, and, you know, my blood seemed to coagulate just fine,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
 I think, even while I was taking the calcium with the vitamin K,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
 but I ran out of it and I was going to get some new, and the lady was warning me about it.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
 But you think it's all right?

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
 Because it does help you absorb calcium, doesn't it?

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.000
 Well, it helps regulate calcium in all the systems.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
 I'm not sure about the absorption in your intestine,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.000
 but it puts it into your bones and keeps it from going into your arteries.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
 Oh, well, that's good.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
 Now, the other thing I wanted to ask is I heard on --

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
 oh, it was probably Dr. Oz or something on TV about --

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.000
 that we all know that inflammation is bad, causes a lot of problems,

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
 and he was saying that sugar causes inflammation,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:09.000
 that it's best to not eat sugar or simple carbohydrates because that exacerbates inflammation.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000
 What do you say to that?

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.000
 No, there are a couple articles on my website about sugar,

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:29.000
 and since sugar involves insulin to handle it, it's hard to tell which is responsible,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:36.000
 but the combination of sugar and insulin is definitely anti-inflammatory.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
 Anti-inflammatory?

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 It's traditionally -- in Africa, for example, when antibiotics weren't available

00:53:48.000 --> 00:54:00.000
 and in some war situations they found that packing just plain white sugar into an injury facilitates healing

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
 and not only prevents infection, but it prevents scar formation,

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 and that's a very basic illustration that --

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
 Well, that's topical, but what about in your body?

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
 Does it affect a lot of sugar?

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
 It doesn't cause inflammation, which would aggravate things like arthritis and other things?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:35.000
 No, the combination of insulin and sugar suppresses some of the inflammatory things, such as nitric oxide.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:50.000
 A diabetic is unable to oxidize sugar, and so diabetes and hypoglycemia have in common the promotion of inflammatory mediators,

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:57.000
 cytokines of various sorts, including nitric oxide.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:07.000
 So you can either do something to lower your blood sugar too much or block its use, as in diabetes.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:15.000
 Both of those situations turn on inflammation, and the normal use of sugar is definitely anti-inflammatory.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000
 Well, how much would you say is a normal use?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
 There's so much controversy around sugar.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000
 I happen to like to drink fruit juice without added sugar, but there's a lot of natural sugar in fruit juice,

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
 and people are always telling me I drink too much juice and it's got too much sugar in it and that that's not good.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000
 Well, in the form of juice, since the juices will always have minerals, especially potassium,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
 there were experiments in which sugar disposition was followed,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:56:00.000
 and they looked at the factors that were causing cells to be able to use the glucose effectively,

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:09.000
 and it turned out that potassium was more involved in handling glucose than insulin was.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:18.000
 And since fruit juice always has a lot of potassium, you don't need nearly as much insulin secretion to handle the sugar.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:26.000
 So the story that it's going to disturb your blood sugar is very inaccurate.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000
 Eating a piece of bread is much more disturbing to your insulin and blood sugar system

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 than drinking a similar number of calories as fruit juice.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:46.000
 So if I wanted to limit my calories, it would be better to limit carbohydrates and keep up with the juice

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
 and not eliminate the juice?

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
 Yeah, the juices are basically more nutritious than the starches.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:01.000
 Even if they're cooked? You know, most juices aren't raw.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
 Yeah, that's okay.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
 Does that make a difference?

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000
 Not much.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
 Do you mean pasteurized?

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:17.000
 I drink the good juices like Newtson and Santa Cruz Organic, which don't have any added sugar,

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
 but I think they are pasteurized.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:30.000
 Something like Ardwalla is fresh, frozen, so it has a little bit more, closer to a raw juice.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000
 I don't juice my own juices.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:36.000
 I'm going to actually have to call both of you in.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000
 I'm afraid it's getting to be almost two minutes to the top of the hour.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
 Oh, okay. Sorry about that.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
 No, no, you're very welcome.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
 Well, thank you for calling.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
 Okay, bye.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 For the other person that's waiting on the line, I'm afraid we won't be able to take your call.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
 But Dr. Raymond Peat, thank you so much for your time again.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
 I really appreciate all of your contribution to the show,

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000
 and I know all the people that got a response from you have certainly got information.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
 And for those people who never had a chance to answer a call, then next, the third Friday of every month.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
 So, Dr. Peat, thanks so much for your time. I'll give out your information.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
 Okay, thanks.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000
 Okay, so for those people who've listened to Dr. Raymond Peat for the first time,

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
 or those people who perhaps heard of him anyway,

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 his website is a very good source of material, fully referenced scientific material,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000
 which will give you the facts and not the, I don't know what you want to call it,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
 but just hear us say it's factual scientific information.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:42.000
 His website is www.raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T, full of articles, well worth listening and reading.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
 He's been doing this for nearly 40 years.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
 Okay, so for people that have called in tonight, thanks so much for participating in the show.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
 It's completely unstaged.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
 I don't know who's going to call, what they're going to ask questions about,

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
 but this evening's show was very interesting with Dr. Peat going to Russia.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
 That was a corker.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000
 Okay, so for those people who would like to get in touch with us Monday through Friday,

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000
 we have a toll-free number, 1-888-WBM-ERB.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
 Okay, so thanks so much for listening and being part of the show.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
 We hope you got some good information from it and you've got something to think about.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000
 So until the third Friday of next month, good night.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
 Thank you, Doc.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:33.000

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000
 Another highly informative episode of Ask Your Herb Doctor.

 [Music]

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
 My favorite talk show on the mud.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000
 I can't deny it.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
