00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodell podcast, I'm as usual Jodell and I'm eager to welcome

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.240
 back on the show Dr. Raymond Pete, a regular here and for good reason, as you will find

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.400
 out from his vast knowledge for those of you who are new to the podcast.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.640
 And I think I speak for all of you who aren't new to the podcast when I say he's very much

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.880
 appreciated by many of you listeners.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.440
 And I know that because I typically reach out and let you guys know that I'm getting

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.740
 ready to podcast with him and ask for questions and the emails overwhelm my inbox.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.100
 So it's kind of cool.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.560
 So we will get to as many of your questions today as possible and what we don't get to

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.440
 will go into the queue for the next one.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.860
 So thank you so much for your questions and Dr. Pete, thank you so much for coming back

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.720
 on the show and answering them.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.440
 Okay, you're welcome.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.120
 As always, you guys out there make sure that you take a moment and purchase Dr. Pete's

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.760
 newsletter, which is one of my most favorite things I look forward to reading each time

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.120
 they come out, you can purchase a hard copy or an email copy of his newsletter by emailing

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.280
 Ray Pete's newsletter at gmail.com.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.760
 So I'll have that link in the show notes for you.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 Okay, so Dr. Pete, I'm going to share something with you.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.540
 Finally, I had a client who got it.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.800
 What I mean is after finally cracking down on her EMF exposure, her radiation exposure

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.880
 to 5G and Wi Fi and Bluetooth, all her irritating symptoms of numbness, tingling, back pain

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.760
 and other inflammation completely disappeared.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.840
 I had been trying to get her to understand this for a while.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.480
 So Dr. Pete, I'm going to start off this podcast asking you about your environment and your

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.320
 EMF exposure because what I know of you is that you don't come on camera.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.960
 You're always on a phone when you dial in for a call.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.300
 And so it seems to me that you really keep your device usage to a minimum and you kind

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.500
 of mitigate your exposure to radiation.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.240
 And so I wanted to know that about you.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.920
 I wanted to know like, do you do that on purpose, like to not have that, you know, camera and

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.360
 computer always on?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.520
 And how do you feel about that?

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.520
 What do you think?

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:29.320
 Definitely it's all deliberate that my telephone is a landline and they're hinting that they

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:39.960
 might discontinue that service and all of my computer parts are connected by wires and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.520
 it's getting hard to like subscribing to the internet.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:57.040
 They automatically want to set up a little broadcast station in your house, but you can

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:08.960
 still manage to get, I forget what they call it, an ethernet table or single disk and then

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:21.200
 each part speakers, monitor, computer, everything is separately connected to a wire.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.160
 I agree with you on that and I wish, I live in a camper, so unfortunately I can't have

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.040
 a landline, but I do mitigate my phone where when I'm not using my cell phone, it's off,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.280
 it's away from me.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.720
 I don't carry it on me unless it's in airplane mode because I'm concerned, like I've seen

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.600
 people really come back from poor health issues after mitigating their exposure and getting

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.960
 more nature outside, more sunshine instead of always being around this chronic wifi and

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.680
 Bluetooth that we're exposed to.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.320
 So I'm glad to hear you say, and it speaks volumes about you because look how healthy

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.120
 you are at what 80, are you 87 or 88?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120
 No, 85.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.520
 Oh, 85, okay, I put you too high, but regardless, that's I think one of the reasons, one of

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.000
 the many reasons why you are as healthy as you are at 85, so I appreciate that about

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 you.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:26.360
 I hear from lots of people who are just in terrible condition, they actually say they

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:39.720
 look at the screen on their wireless telephone, almost all their waking hours and it's no

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:49.280
 wonder they're having eye problems and appetite problems, everything goes wrong when you simply

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.160
 don't live the way an animal is designed to live.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160
 Absolutely.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.880
 I'm so glad you mentioned the weight problems or the appetite problems because it's so true,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.120
 there's published data on the fact that these devices and the exposure to them actually

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.040
 elevate our insulin and our blood glucose and blue light after dark being on a device

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.640
 after dark can stimulate cravings.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.040
 So I mean, people don't think that this is affecting them until they get away from it

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.360
 and then you'll see how different your body feels, that anxiety you feel, the inflammation

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.920
 you feel, the appetites and cravings you feel, they might all go away just by limiting your

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.080
 device usage.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.080
 Would you agree?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 Right.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:39.040
 I see it happening every few days when I can convince someone to just try it for a while.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.160
 No, I agree 100%.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.680
 So I'm glad I got your thoughts on that.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.480
 So we'll jump into questions now.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.760
 We've got a wide variety of questions.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.720
 So the first one is from Spencer Steele and he asks, when do you think it's worthwhile

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.520
 to try antibiotics and how would you go about it when suffering things like food intolerances,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.040
 violent reactions and gut issues?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.640
 So do you think there's a place for antibiotics, Dr. Pete?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:22.360
 Oh, yeah, but the natural antibiotics, food, easily digested food will normalize the flora

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:33.560
 in most cases, lots of unirritating fiber, the so-called soluble fibers, sometimes sort

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:50.200
 of the most irritating of pectin, for example, can make an animal of both aggressive and depressed

00:06:50.200 --> 00:07:05.080
 or a simple fiber, cellulose or oat man can have an anti-depress, anti-depression, anti-aggression

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.080
 effect.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:21.800
 But then if that isn't enough, if you use one of the old antibiotics discovered 50 years

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:38.360
 or more ago, then you avoid some of the worst risks, recent antibiotics are able to do things

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:48.440
 like cause your tendons to break, very damaging to your connective tissues.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:08:00.120
 So the old ones, erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracycline, they're still very effective.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:15.280
 They have modernized variants that are still pretty safe, erythromycin, anthocillin, and

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:27.480
 adoxycycline or minocycline are still very close to the original old antibiotics.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:37.160
 They can produce a beneficial effect in just a few hours, like taking a half a penicillin

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:46.600
 tablet four or five hours apart, sometimes within eight or 10 hours, your symptoms will

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.160
 be gone.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.200
 Wow.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.520
 And so you're not opposed to more maybe the old school antibiotics as opposed to some

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.840
 of the newer ones out, yeah.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:04.200
 Yeah, it's very important to check the side effects of an antibiotic, who's name you don't

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 recognize.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200
 Okay.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.160
 And what about, you mentioned natural antibiotics, are you a fan of things like olive leaf extract

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:19.360
 or garlic or like colloidal silver or anything like that?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:26.160
 Some of those have at least as serious side effects.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:37.240
 I happen to know a woman who took colloidal silver, I think it was around 1950, and she

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:46.520
 never appeared in public without gloves and a dark veil, because her skin color had turned

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.520
 purple.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.520
 Wow.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520
 So interesting.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.520
 Okay.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:59.200
 So next question, this is a follow up to our last podcast on the advice about asthma.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.400
 This individual wants to understand the LOX enzyme and leukotrienes that are heavily involved

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:11.720
 with the asthma response, drugs like Singular, which antagonize leukotrienes are effective

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.880
 at preventing asthma attacks.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:19.200
 Could the reason be that a low blood sugar state will increase adrenaline, which would

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.880
 then increase the activity of LOX?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880
 Yeah.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880
 Okay.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.880
 Go ahead.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880
 Exactly.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:33.640
 I think that's what brings on nocturnal asthma attacks, for example, a lot of people die

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:42.760
 during the night, because of the horrible attack of asthma, but normally, the blood

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:52.280
 sugar falls during the night, just so you can not waste your energy while you sleep.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:11:03.000
 But the falling of blood glucose causes your histamine and adrenaline to increase.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:14.320
 And that combination causes inflammation and constriction of your respiratory tubes.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320
 Cool.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320
 All right.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.760
 So they kind of knew that inherently, they just needed your validation of that, so that's

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.760
 good.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:29.200
 Dylan Knight asks, does Ray think that creatine monohydrate supplementation could be beneficial

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.800
 for muscle recovery, brain function, et cetera?

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:45.880
 I would be very, very cautious with it, for sure, not in large quantities.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:56.760
 Like getting too much protein, too much of that can increase your ammonia production,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:11.840
 and the excess ammonia that you have to dispose of consumes your carbon dioxide to form urea

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:25.280
 and detoxify the ammonia, but the consumption of your CO2 combining with ammonia is exactly

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:36.440
 what can bring on an asthma attack, because CO2 is sedative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-asma.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:44.600
 Yeah, no, I'm glad you mentioned really higher protein diets, too.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.320
 In your opinion, what is an adequate protein intake, because there's all schools of thought

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.320
 out there about that, too.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.240
 Is it one gram per pound of body weight?

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.200
 Is it half your weight in grams?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.040
 What do you say?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.680
 It depends on your age, very largely.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:11.360
 I rode a barn when he was beyond middle age, somewhat, decided to experiment with the high-protein

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:21.640
 diet, and he had been just eating a traditional farm-type diet, and when he increased the

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:32.000
 protein, he found he had to steadily double his daily thyroid intake.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:45.400
 That's been 40-50 years ago that he mentioned that, but there's been very little follow-up

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:57.600
 on quite what that happens, but if you look at the requirement of a high-quality protein

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:09.060
 to have optimal growth during youth, that drops off sharply as soon as you stop growing,

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:28.400
 because amino acids like mesionine, arginine, tryptophan, cysteine, and a few other amino

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:38.320
 acids are used primarily for growth and replacement.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:45.960
 So when you aren't growing, you note only the very small amounts to replace your skin

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:52.040
 and hair and cells that are being renewed.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:15:05.920
 So there's a great drop-off around the age of 30 in how much protein you really need,

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:19.240
 because when you're getting excess, these more recent studies are showing that just restricting

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:29.760
 mesionine, for example, to the very small amount you need to renew your tissues in animal

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:41.840
 studies at that borderline mesionine deficiency extends their lifespan 40%, and you get smaller

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:57.120
 increases if you restrict just one of the other turnover-supporting proteins like cysteine

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:09.440
 in particular, and it happens that individually in excess of cysteine or tryptophan has a

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:21.280
 direct inflammatory action, which can damage brain cells, increase the risk of asthma attacks,

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.280
 and so on.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:36.960
 So a real requirement for these essential amino acids after the age of 30 probably fairly

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:49.160
 continuously decreases right into old age, and people have noticed for a long time that

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:59.120
 very old people sometimes go along for years eating absolutely none of the essential amino

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:10.440
 acids, living just on a jello, basically, which lacks all of the essential growth-promoting

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:24.840
 amino acids, and in the last several years an anti-aging, anti-biotic called rapamycin

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.920
 is one of its names.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:37.680
 What it does is to inhibit an enzyme that promotes growth.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:50.440
 This growth-promoting enzyme is called an alien target of rapamycin or mTOR, and if

00:17:50.440 --> 00:18:06.180
 you inhibit that by not eating these essential amino acids in excess, you turn off the excess

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:13.680
 growth stimulus and greatly reduce both aging and cancer.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:26.620
 And it's established as optimal amino acids intake, for example, in an old MIT study that

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:41.680
 an active younger person probably eats about 80 grams per day, but that goes with the assumption

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.440
 that you're eating a regular amount of energy foods.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:58.200
 And so if you're eating 80 grams of good protein per day, that situation is also one in which

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:09.440
 you're probably eating 4,000 calories per day just to maintain your good activity level.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:19.840
 If you, in middle age, find that you put on weight when you eat a normal 4,000 calories,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:26.240
 people tend to cut back on the ratio of carbohydrate to protein.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:42.680
 And instead of having, say, 400, 4,000 calories and 50 grams of protein, they will get a much

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:53.520
 higher proportion of their protein, calories from protein rather than carbohydrates.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:04.680
 So if you look at a healthy person's ratio, they're burning lots of carbohydrate calories

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:19.800
 in combination with that 80 grams, for example, but if you cut your calories by half to avoid

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:29.960
 any excess weight, then you have to proportionally cut your protein basically in half.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:39.960
 I've suggested that to people who were having all kinds of anti-cyroid symptoms, couldn't

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:49.600
 get their temperature up, their heart rate was always slow, and all of the signs of hypo-cyroid

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.480
 were there.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:21:04.120
 If they just increased either decreased the protein number of grams or increased the carbohydrate

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:14.680
 number of grams, the latter, they might put on extra fat, but if they keep the ratio of

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:26.000
 maybe seven grams of carbohydrate to each gram of protein, so your diet would be something

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:38.960
 like 50 grams of protein and maybe 400 grams of carbohydrate.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:45.720
 That raises your temperature, increases your heart rate, and gets your thyroid going again.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.720
 Cool.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.480
 Okay, so out of curiosity, how much protein do you think someone like you at 85 eats or

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.920
 how much do you eat?

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:04.240
 I've been experimenting cutting back my protein, and I find that I don't need as much thyroid

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.880
 supplement to keep everything working.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:21.800
 It's hard to not exceed 50 grams a day of protein, but by cutting fat calories drastically,

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:32.360
 then you can do it, you can eat pretty much all the calories you can hold if it's in the

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.560
 form of carbohydrates.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:41.680
 Okay, so the next question I stuck in here because my seven-year-old loves you, and she

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.240
 has another question for you.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:49.480
 She likes to ask questions whenever I do these podcasts, and she told me to tell you hello.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.320
 She asked, "Why is gluten not great for our bodies?"

00:22:53.320 --> 00:23:00.120
 She told me that I might have an answer, but she wanted to know what your answer is.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.680
 It's one of the storage proteins.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:20.120
 It's particular for certain grasses like wheat, and it stores the energy and amino acids that

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:27.800
 the plant needs when you moisten the seed to activate the enzymes.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:39.320
 It provides both energy and amino acids to sustain the growth of the plant proteins.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:51.320
 It's a very low-quality protein, nutritionally, such that if you soak your seeds and trick

00:23:51.320 --> 00:24:06.100
 them into thinking they're going to grow, the nutritional protein value increases as

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:17.920
 the toxic effects of the gluten are decreased.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:32.760
 The nature of this particular protein happens to overlap with some of the molecules in the

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:48.800
 covering of insects, and some microorganisms, and agenically or immunologically, have these

00:24:48.800 --> 00:25:02.040
 similarities between gluten and harmful insects covering.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:12.240
 There's a further overlap that, under the influence of estrogen, our intestinal tissues

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:25.080
 also become activated in that, so that women in particular are especially sensitive to

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:33.280
 gluten, including the irritating effects of gluten.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:42.600
 Basically, it's a storage protein rather than a functional growth-related protein.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.600
 That's so fascinating.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.480
 I didn't even know that women were more sensitive.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.540
 I mean, it makes sense, because the clients I see, it's always the women that seem to

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:54.200
 have the biggest gut issues going on, or the symptoms related to gluten intolerance such

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:59.000
 as anxiety or heart palpitations and things like that, so that's really interesting that

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.680
 you've even seen women in general be more sensitive to the effects of gluten.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:13.880
 Next question is, AKS111 asks, "Does vitamin D supplementation lead to magnesium depletion?"

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:31.960
 No, I think it helps to regulate both magnesium and calcium, and theoretically there might

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:41.360
 be a point at which you could have antagonism between magnesium and calcium, but generally

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:52.120
 they are both quieting, steadying, protective minerals with very similar effects to each

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.120
 other.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:07.440
 You can inject them intravenously with a sedating action.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:20.380
 Sulfate, for example, has been used as a general anesthesia, and you get a definite calming

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:30.520
 or quieting effect from the intravenous calcium administration, and both of those are supported

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:42.120
 and normalized by vitamin D. There's a close interaction with thyroid hormone, too.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:54.520
 In the deficiency of thyroid hormone, your cell can't bind and retain magnesium, and

00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:08.320
 the calcium steadying effect is fairly useless if you don't have the ability to retain magnesium

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:14.480
 as one of the stabilizers.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.240
 But you would agree that magnesium is necessary for the assimilation of vitamin D, right?

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.080
 We need magnesium to help our bodies make vitamin D?

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:30.540
 Yeah, and both of them are closely connected to thyroid level.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:39.160
 The magnesium is very, very quickly lost if your thyroid is deficient.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:46.120
 Yeah, I had that issue when I went through the toxic mold, and my thyroid got pretty

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:51.200
 much blasted in the wrong direction, and I couldn't keep magnesium in enough.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.760
 It was like I couldn't get enough magnesium.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:03.600
 I would still get leg cramps even after 1,200, 1,500 milligrams of magnesium.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:13.640
 There are some books specifically on that, the important role of thyroid in maintaining

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:20.760
 cell magnesium and holding down excitability and allergies and so on.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.640
 Yeah, do you happen to know the names of those books we could look up?

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:33.360
 Cherry Aikawa, I think, is the name of the best author on that subject.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.920
 Okay, I'll see if I can find that and put it in the show notes for people, too.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:46.000
 Next question, Sylvia254 asks, "What about melanoma and hyperpigmentation on the face?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.960
 What causes it, and how can one reduce it?"

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.440
 Not melanoma, melasma, I think, is what she means with the hyperpigmentation.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:04.960
 Yeah, melasma is pretty much under the influence of estrogen, such as in pregnancy, in general,

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:16.120
 as such as big blots of brown pigment around the lips and the house and forehead, cheeks.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:31.080
 And it's because of the excitatory effects of estrogen, very similar other kinds of excitation

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:46.680
 will cause increased pigment formation, lack of energy induced by anything toxic will defensively

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:54.280
 turn on melanin synthesis.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:04.080
 And it's sort of the model of basic irritation and toxic condition of the skin, but you can

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:16.480
 inject various things like chopped up sections of DNA and create a region of melasma-like

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:30.640
 pigmentation and a deficiency of niacin amide, you can reverse much of the melanoma effect

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:41.200
 by applying a high concentration of niacin amide in water, fire every day to the area

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:52.400
 of melanoma, and what we're doing is reducing metabolic, similar energy deficiency pigment

00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:03.560
 formation happens with exposure to ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:15.280
 It's everywhere you look, these harmful excitatory processes, radiation, energy depletion, estrogen

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:24.320
 excess, all of these promote defensive pigment formation.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:30.280
 And so would progesterone, could you actually apply progesterone topically to the melasma

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:36.120
 or the hyperpigmentation to see a difference in that too?

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:49.080
 Often by improving the vitality of the condition of the cells, it can temporarily darken the

00:32:49.080 --> 00:33:01.840
 pigment, so I wouldn't use it alone, hoping to block the estrogen effect, better to work

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:13.760
 from the thyroid side to get your energy up and lower the estrogen before you try to progesterone.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:22.720
 Okay, next question, Gina P. asks, "What are Dr. Pete's thoughts on ivermectin and does

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:29.320
 he feel that humans should deworm themselves regularly like we do horses and dogs?"

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:42.640
 No, people are not so often exposed to worms and parasites, dogs and pastured animals are

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:56.360
 just almost daily exposed to parasites, but people with normal washing habits, household

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:09.120
 hygiene, and so on, are very, very seldom exposed and the effect of, the beneficial

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:23.480
 effects of ivermectin are mostly from anti-inflammatory actions, so in small amounts it's safe, but

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:35.880
 it's the larger doses, possibly continued for a long time, as prevention that could

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:47.960
 be harmful, because in the millions of doses that have been administered, it was almost

00:34:47.960 --> 00:35:01.440
 always in just one or two or three doses to eliminate the parasites, and so it was never

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:08.920
 a prophylactic daily prevention syndrome system.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:16.520
 Yeah, and so, like looking into ivermectin, you're right, there are so many anti-inflammatory

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:23.720
 properties to it, as well as, like you can see research on like anti-tumor and anti-epileptic

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:29.040
 seizure, I mean there's all kinds of things that it affects, but like you're saying it

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.440
 really needs to be done cautiously, because long term, I mean are we killing off, when

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:39.600
 you kill off parasites, like within medication like that, are you also killing off good bacteria,

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.560
 like would we be harming our gut flora?

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:51.960
 No, I've never heard of that problem with ivermectin, it's so mainly anti-inflammatory

00:35:51.960 --> 00:36:05.280
 that's where the problems come in with epilepsy, cancer, and parasites, inflammation is the

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:15.040
 whole problem, and so anything that will correct the inflammation takes care of the problem.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:22.000
 Okay, all right, next is Adam Catches Fish, he asks what is a good protocol for a woman

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.560
 of menstruating age to supplement with Progest E, how much per day and should that change

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.880
 when the time of the month changes in order to help with PMS issues?

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:45.960
 Oh yeah, the first thing is to consider your body temperature in relation to the symptoms,

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:56.560
 and often thyroid deficiency or nutritional deficiency might be the real cause of your

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:08.240
 PMS. Even though you can take a big dose to totally knock out the PS symptoms, such as

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:20.080
 migraines, if you don't fix the thyroid problem, it's going to bounce right back and need another

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:31.440
 big dose of progesterone. So the more progesterone it takes to alleviate a symptom, the more

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:42.640
 likely you are to be hypothyroid. Ordinarily, the cycling woman should only use it from

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:52.640
 about two days after ovulation and can continue it up until the day menstruation begins.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:38:07.040
 That natural pattern is promoting thyroid function while inhibiting estrogen effects,

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:22.000
 and that is protected against a long-range risk of cancer from the estrogen exposure.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:40.160
 So if you can give estrogen as long as you're interrupting estrogen with surges of progesterone

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:50.080
 or a good background of thyroid hormone, but you generally don't want to continue taking

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.560
 those progesterone every day of the month because it's the surging effect that specifically knocks

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:13.760
 out the estrogen keeping a lot of toxicity. So that just day 16, like for a 28-day cycle,

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:19.280
 you're thinking day 16 to day 28, doing that surge will help get estrogen levels down,

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:24.240
 even harking back to that question about hyperpigmentation. That's maybe something

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.840
 they could try to do to knock down some of that estrogen that's causing the melasma.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:38.480
 Yeah, but being sure to pay attention to your temperature. The progesterone should

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:48.560
 increase your basal temperature about a degree or more during that part of the month.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:54.640
 If it isn't doing that, then you probably need a thyroid supplement.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:00.800
 And so someone that was taking progesterone every day and they're cycling, that may put them at

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.920
 risk for promoting estrogen. You're not getting that surge. Is that what you're saying? So their

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:16.640
 estrogen might stay high? Yeah, it doesn't increase the estrogen, but it fails to knock it out.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.560
 Makes sense. You got to have the different variations that nature intended us to have.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:33.040
 Okay, Eugenie Breda asks, "Dr. Pete, will you talk about your top 15 good carbs list?" Or maybe if

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:41.520
 you don't have 15, just your good carbs list. Okay, orange juice, all of the citrus juices,

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:54.800
 conquered grape juice, well-cooked root vegetables, turnips, carrots,

00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:07.120
 well-cooked cabbage family, broccoli, and Brussels pouts, for example.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:25.120
 The non-gluten grains are very safe, especially polished white rice,

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:44.720
 nixtamalized corn or lime process, corn, oat bran. I forgot how many that was, but you didn't get.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.680
 Yeah, I kind of wrote them down, so I'll be sure to put it in the show notes. But yeah,

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.200
 that was a good amount. I mean, you're making me hungry too. Just talk about it.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:02.640
 Okay, next one, we've got NCgirl9ify asks, "Dr. Pete, does vitamin D increase

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:10.640
 DHEA levels?" Thank you so much. Vitamin C? Vitamin D is a dog.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:23.440
 Yeah, I think it does. It's anti-inflammatory, and I think that's favorable

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:36.320
 as to improving your DHEA to cortisol ratio. Okay, perfect. Another listener, they didn't

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:41.920
 give their name, but they said, "You mentioned in response to an explanation on the dangers of EFA

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:47.840
 that although it was counterintuitive, it makes much sense to you. I'm struggling to understand

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.200
 how it makes sense. Could you please expound on your understanding? As a person is struggling

00:42:53.200 --> 00:43:01.840
 with Hashimoto's and having recently recovered from colon cancer, I'm wondering how your form

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.080
 of eating compares with the Mediterranean diet, which is supposed to be one of the best. Could

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.840
 you please elaborate on EFA?" Oh, it's Gracie's gift. That's who asked that.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.880
 What does that stand for? Essential fatty acids. The dangers of maybe,

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:24.160
 I guess she's maybe thinking of fish oil, like a highly-unsaturated fish oil. No, there are

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:37.200
 some very good books that go into a matter of more than a thousand references

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:47.600
 on the question of essential fatty acids and fish oils. The name of one that occurs to me is

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:53.440
 fishy business. Okay, I'll put that in the net. And my website has,

00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:01.280
 I think, three or four very basic explanations for

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:14.000
 why the doctrine of such a thing as an essential fatty acid was resurrected. It had been

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:24.880
 knocked out, demonstrated to be a fallacy in the 1940s. It just absolutely knocked out. Nothing

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:38.720
 scientific left. But the seed oil industry was losing their customers. They produced a huge

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:52.720
 amount of soy oil and related polyunsaturated oils to make paints and plastics from petroleum

00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:04.640
 displaced that around 1950. And they found that the essential fatty acids created economical

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:18.880
 faptein in pigs and other farm animals. So this was promoted, the essential fatty acids, or PUFA,

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:31.600
 came to be advertised as edible because they would make pigs get fat cheaply. That led to

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:41.520
 promoting them as human health foods. A very ridiculous set of reasoning incorporated the

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:55.200
 idea that PUFA lowers cholesterol causes heart disease. Therefore, PUFA as an essential nutrient

00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:04.960
 should be included in the diet. The more, the better. Every step of the reasoning was

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:15.040
 simply an advertisement to get people to fatten themselves on PUFA the way pigs were being fattened.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:28.480
 So it's a gigantic industrial food fraud all through the 1950s. Absolutely no science remaining

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:41.760
 but penetrating just about everything in industrial society. Not only sold it to prevent

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:51.840
 heart attacks, but one particular set of experiments in veterans founded

00:46:53.120 --> 00:47:02.080
 on the heart-protective diet, more people were dying of heart attacks caused by the essential

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:10.320
 fatty acids. And not only that, but besides heart disease, they were dying from a higher rate of

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:24.000
 cancer exactly what the 1940s animal experiments had demonstrated. All of it lowers cholesterol

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:33.280
 at the essential fatty acids are the basis for damaging the circulatory system

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:42.240
 and for activating cancer production. Okay, so check out, I'm going to put that fishy business

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.480
 link in the show notes so they can check that out. That sounds really interesting. I might have to

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:56.080
 read that myself. Yeah, there are several articles on the website about essential fatty acids.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:06.480
 I think one contains about 80 references that nothing is huge since more recent books have done.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.880
 Awesome. Okay, I like the next question and I'm going to have a follow-up question after it too,

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:20.320
 because this is a good question. Eli asks, when estrogen falls within the accepted normal range

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.400
 in a common blood test, does this mean estrogen levels are indeed normal for optimal health? Now,

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:33.120
 I'll add to that. I want to hear your thoughts on what somebody would actually get tested because

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:40.400
 there's estradiol, there's total estrogen serum. What is a proper blood test to see actually the

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:46.720
 tissue levels of estrogen? And then to ask his question, are they indeed normal with this range

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:57.120
 that they give you? My website has the article called "Tissue Bound Estrogen" and that cites

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:06.560
 a few articles in which they actually measured the amount of estrogen in the various tissues

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:17.600
 versus the amount in the bloodstream. And what's in the bloodstream, most of it is circulating

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:28.000
 as a water-soluble form, either the sulfuric acid-bound form or the glucuronic acid-bound form.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:41.120
 These are inert estrogenically and are leading the body, but if an irritation locally

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:54.880
 intervenes before these water-soluble forms have left in the urine, the inflamed tissue

00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:04.480
 will bind to the circulating inactive estrogens and reactivate them.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:15.920
 Protesterone is a tissue anti-estrogen factor that inactivates,

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:23.680
 prevents the inflammation that captures estrogen out of the circulation

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:41.200
 and promotes re-attaching these solubilizing factors in a very systematic way. It lowers

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:52.720
 tissue estrogen content in lowering the tissue estrogen, it's re-establishing the water-soluble

00:50:52.720 --> 00:51:02.320
 forms, letting it get the rest of the way out of the body through the kidneys. And so if you have

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:13.200
 adequate progesterone, you're going to have the inactivated forms of estrogen in circulation

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:26.320
 before it leaves in urine. But if you don't have adequate progesterone, all of these processes

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:38.640
 are going to be in favor of reactivating estrogen in the tissues so that it manifests when your

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:50.000
 blood estrogen is very low. The crucial tissues such as the breast, the uterus, and several other

00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:01.280
 tissues that are subject to developing cancer under the influence of estrogen, these tissues

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:09.680
 increase their estrogen content during menopause when your blood estrogen is lowest.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:22.480
 That's why tissue bound estrogen concept neutralizes all of the medical reasoning

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:29.120
 regarding the nature of menopause and what estrogen and progesterone are doing.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:34.720
 Yeah, which makes sense why blood work is a snapshot in a week and a month and a day and

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:39.280
 it's really not always definitive, but symptoms don't lie. That's why I always have my clients

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:44.160
 fill out a symptom burden analysis. So really, if somebody's looking at a lot of high estrogen

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:51.760
 symptoms, that's where their answer is, yeah. Yeah, and the low body temperature is what the

00:52:51.760 --> 00:53:02.080
 significance is very consistent. Estrogen lowers your body temperature and lower body temperature

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:11.760
 favors the production of estrogen. Okay, next question is from JD. He asks about your current

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:18.800
 thoughts on utilizing urea and if you think it would be safe to use ongoing or just during an

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:31.040
 acute period of noticeable edema. Oh, yeah, it has a well-established history for heart failure,

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:43.120
 for example, or for brain injury. There's one story on the internet of a kid who was

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:55.120
 brain injured losing progress, going backwards to losing reflexes. And they decided to,

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:05.280
 I think it was 90 grams of intravenous urea that they gave him. And that allowed the brain

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:17.200
 to give up its edematous fluid collection. And he was very quickly back at school

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:24.320
 with normal brain function where he had been approaching brain death.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:35.360
 Okay, next one is Ruth asks, I have a few moles on my face when I apply Progest E. Is it okay to

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:42.560
 sweep over the moles or should I avoid them? I'm trying to reduce wrinkles. I've always avoided

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:54.640
 contact with vitamin E or other oily materials and moles just because vitamin E's viscosity

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:10.240
 can sort of seal up the pores and be irritating. And so, if I have a noticeable mole, I'll put

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:21.520
 either a progesterone or a DHEA or a mixture that may be as close as an inch to the mole,

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:34.000
 but a tissue surrounding. And that generally causes the pigment cells to leave the mole.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:45.360
 Several times I've seen waves of pigment cells with the shape of the mole

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:55.280
 migrating away from the place where I put the progesterone. For example, on my temple,

00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:08.480
 I put some DHEA and progesterone closer to my eyebrow. And behind the mole, the next day,

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:22.080
 I had a ring of pigment, sort of like a bullseye, and three days of applying new vitamin E and

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:32.880
 pore bone on the other side of the mole. I had three concentric rings of pigment leading the

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:41.600
 mole. Meanwhile, the mole was fading and shrinking. I'm showing that the cells were absolutely

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:53.120
 fleeing from the abnormal mole, heading back into my scalp where the function was to

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:56.240
 produce pigmented terror.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:02.720
 I love all your personal experiences. You've had so many different experiences

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:09.200
 with your health, so I love when you share those. Okay, Paula has a nice easy question.

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:14.400
 Is milk high in tryptophan? I'm trying to consume foods lower in tryptophan, but it's hard to get

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:20.080
 the adequate amount of protein needed. A huge thank you to you and Dr. Pete. He literally saved my life.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:33.120
 Yeah, milk is high in tryptophan, so you just have to keep that in mind. But its effects,

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:42.240
 the excitatory effects of tryptophan are moderated by the effects of calcium,

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:53.120
 the quality effects, and the same amount of tryptophan in meat is accompanied by a very high ratio

00:57:53.120 --> 00:58:04.640
 of phosphate, which is excitatory. And so from meat and fish, for example, the phosphate

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:19.200
 adds to the toxic inflammatory effects of tryptophan and the good high content of calcium makes the

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:26.000
 milk much safer. Okay, very good. Do you have time for a couple more? Are you doing okay on time?

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:34.400
 Okay, great. Tash Lawson asks, I get terrible hay fever despite taking antihistamines,

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:39.280
 working on gut health and lowering estrogen. Any thoughts from Dr. Pete would be hugely

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:48.320
 appreciated. Thank you. Always consider your thyroid status, which controls your blood sugar

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:59.040
 and adrenaline and histamine. And as far as like that DAO enzyme that breaks down histamine in the

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:04.240
 gut, is there a certain way you like to promote that? Let's say somebody might be low on DAO.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:15.280
 No, it's really more important to not make the histamine in the first place.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:24.640
 Yeah, maybe avoiding those histamine reactive foods too. So okay, Vel plays 2.0. Now, this is

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:32.400
 kind of a controversial question, but I wanted to make sure and ask it. So there's a website that's

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:38.960
 called NoFap and they're helping people get away from porn addiction. So he was asking, how about

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:44.240
 help with getting off of porn addiction as well as semen retention?

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:54.880
 How to get rid of semen retention? I think it's how to, I'm not sure, he just put semen retention

00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:05.200
 in quotations. So I'm assuming it's maybe he wants to hold on to semen? Oh, that's an old

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:18.960
 Asian medical idea that the yogis who would retain it as long as possible,

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:30.320
 calling it the elixir of life. It was very similar to mandal energy.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:45.280
 Their actual thinking wasn't too clear, but it definitely isn't good for the health to retain it.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:00.720
 If a couple has been married a long time and hasn't expelled semen frequently,

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:08.080
 there's greater risk of having chromosomal defective

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:13.920
 sperm cells because of the age of the retained semen.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.040
 And how about help with like porn addiction? Are there any recommendations you would have for that?

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:28.320
 I have no, I think mostly they need a girlfriend.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:36.640
 Okay, I love your humor. All right, we'll do one more question here. Actually,

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.600
 two more because the second one is kind of fun. We'll do these last two and then I didn't get to

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.480
 everybody's, but it'll show up in the next time we do this. So if your question wasn't answered,

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.040
 just know that it will be. All right, ASK 111 asks, what do you do for low temperature and hair loss

01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:03.680
 for someone with thalassemia minor genetic mutation? I think thyroid usually helps, you know,

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:12.720
 just by warming up your long bones, wearing long underwear, for example, or increasing your thyroid

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:22.800
 activity, your bones are warm and they make red blood cells a lot faster.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:30.560
 Okay, cool. Last one here. And this is, I remember you mentioning these cookies,

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.280
 the recipe for the B1 cookies. And so this individual minor is asking,

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.880
 can you ask for the recipe for the B1 cookies from Ray?

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:58.160
 Oh, I was using a free term and eggs and sugar as the recipe. But I learned that the

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:07.520
 wheat germ has far too much phosphate. And so the effect for alertness, and

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.600
 someone who isn't well nourished, the effect can be tremendous to have a

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:28.320
 vitamin cookie along with a cup of coffee, plenty of sugar in the coffee and cookie. But there are

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:35.760
 much better things than wheat germ is the source of the vitamins. I wonder if you could use,

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.680
 like you mentioned, the oat bran because you're a fan of oat bran. Yeah, it makes really good cookies.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.720
 Okay, good. I'll put a little idea for that in the show notes too. Okay,

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:52.320
 we will wrap up with that. And I'll let you get on with your day. But I know I speak for everybody

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:57.680
 when I say we so appreciate you answering these questions. And I hope they're fun for you too.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.720
 Yeah, yes, definitely new ones.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.960
 Yeah, yeah, awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time, Dr. Pete, and we'll do this again.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.400
 And you're much appreciated. You guys don't forget to check out his newsletter. I'll have

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.040
 that link in the show notes for you to reach out and get your copy. So thank you so much.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.560
 Okay, thank you. All right, bye for now.

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:27.600
 Light bulb moment. I have an idea for you. How about getting an anti blue light light bulb? That's

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.720
 right. You could put these in your house at night, and they would not allow any blue light after the

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.680
 sun goes down. I have these in my lamps, and I really love them because it's like this amber

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:45.840
 glow at night. That's not offensive to my melatonin at all. Now you may know that I'm kind of a blue

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:54.160
 light blocking glass junkie. In fact, when I'm not wearing this pair, I'm wearing this pair. Yes. And

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:02.880
 when I'm not wearing this pair, I might put on this pair. And in case I don't want to wear my

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:08.000
 contacts, I actually have my prescription pair. Check that out. You can kind of see that it's

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.240
 different than the other lenses. This one's actually going to have my big thick Coke bottle

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:19.200
 glass prescription in there so that I can wear these and not have to have my contacts in at night.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.400
 So yeah, I'm kind of a blue light blocking junkie, but what I'll say is that my sleep has never been

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.760
 better. And it's as simple as putting on a pair of glasses or using a light bulb that blocks out the

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.880
 blue light at night. Or perhaps you want a little nightlight for your kids because here's the thing,

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:41.120
 blue light nightlights actually cause myopia in children. That's right. They can become near

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:46.320
 sighted if they're exposed to blue light after dark. So getting one of these anti blue light

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.760
 nightlights for the kids or for yourselves, to get in the bathroom, to get in the kitchen

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.480
 for those late night munchies, which you shouldn't have if you're blocking blue light. That's right.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.080
 Blue light actually stimulates your cravings after dark. So by wearing these glasses,

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:04.880
 not only will you sleep better, but you may not get those late night munchies that are so prevalent.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:14.000
 So fit for 10. That'll save you 10% off either your favorite pair of glasses or the really cool

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:27.360
 light bulbs and nightlights. Every cell needs energy to perform. And one way that I like to

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:33.440
 provide the fuel for those cells and those little mitochondria in there is with methylene blue.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.480
 Methylene blue is literally food for your mitochondria. It delivers oxygen into the cell

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.040
 on so many different levels. And if you haven't tried it yet, I want to tell you about the product

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:50.160
 that I love from Lifeblood. So their methylene blue, lifeblood.co's, methylene blue is my favorite

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:56.160
 for purity reasons, for quality assurance, knowing I'm getting a really great product. I did a

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:03.840
 podcast with the founder Adam Marafiodi. So please check that out. But also check out lifeblood.co

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:12.320
 and use my code JODEL to save on your purchase of their methylene blue product. I also love their

 magnesium. I love their magnesium powder that you make your own magnesium out of. So check out all

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:22.640
 of their wonderful products and use my code to help you save. Methylene blue is also very

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:30.320
 anti-parasitic, anti-viral, anti-microbial. So methylene blue to the rescue. Get yours today.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:42.000
 Well, if you've listened to me at all, you'll know that I preach protein. And protein is the

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.120
 building blocks of every healthy cell in our body. And you need protein throughout the day

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:53.200
 to sustain really good healthy cell turnover. And I get asked a lot, what about if I don't have time

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.800
 for protein? I can't really get in a meat source. It's okay. I love a good whey protein. And my

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.400
 favorite recently has been this grass-fed whey from Iconic Protein. I love their ingredients.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:09.120
 I love that they use a monk fruit. It's simple ingredients. There's literally four ingredients

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.120
 in this protein powder. And it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg. There's a lot of

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.920
 grass-fed protein powders out there that are like boutiquey and they're all about, you know,

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:24.160
 50, 60, $70. No, this guy's going to run you less than $30. And with my discount code, you're going

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:30.800
 to get 15% off. So check out Iconic Protein. They also have, for those of you really on the go and

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.400
 you don't have time for anything, even blending up a protein drink, you can get their immunity

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:43.120
 coffee. Now, you know I love my coffee. And this iconic drink is made with MCT oil and all natural

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:47.680
 ingredients. And it actually has a few vitamins and minerals that help with immunity. So this is

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.240
 something I'm going to grab. I'm going to add it to my coffee. Maybe I'm going to drink it on its

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.160
 own. It's a really nice way to grab and go. So for those of you that say, I don't have time for

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:04.080
 protein, now you do. Check out Iconic Protein and their immunity coffee, as well as their different

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:12.240
