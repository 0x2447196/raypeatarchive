 Hi and welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows, which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 We run a clinic in Garboville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 and we manufacture all our own certified organic herb extracts,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 which are either grown on our CCRF certified herb farm,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 or which are sourced from other USA certified organic suppliers.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garboville 91.1 FM,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions, either related or unrelated to this month's topic,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000

 So once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 endocrinologist, researcher,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 many, many years of experience under his belt to illuminate some of the misinformation

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 that's so prevalent in the medical literature.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 So Dr. Peat, thank you for joining us again.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 As always, people may have tuned in who perhaps have never listened to the show,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 so it's always a very good idea to just give an overview of your background,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 your education and what you're bringing to the show this evening.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 I've studied a lot of different things, but my biological study was at the University of Oregon.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 I spent four years there working on a Ph.D.,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 starting out thinking I was going to do nerve biology and brain biology.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 And the people in that section were so dogmatic,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 I looked around and found that the reproductive physiology and aging people

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 were actually scientifically oriented.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 So I shifted over and did my dissertation on the hormones and physiology

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 and energy metabolism of aging and reproductive system.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000
 Okay. Now I know that you're very interested in maintaining good thyroid function.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 I think that's one of the main things that we both have found is a key cornerstone

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 to maintaining biological energy production.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 And that's so important in fighting the negative effects of the environmental material

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 that we've come into contact with that would lower our metabolic energy.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:42.000
 So I think probably the first reference to metabolic energy

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 and the prevalence in the food chain of the material that is counterproductive to good health

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 is the saturated fats versus the polyunsaturated.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 So in your understanding, is that one of the main stumbling blocks

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 for the misinformation of diabetes and triglycerides and general lipid health?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
 Yeah, I think so.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 The people who created the idea of the essential fatty acids actually a few years later

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 did an experiment with one of their lab people that I think really showed

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 all of the important features of why people should not eat the essential so-called fatty acids.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 In 1929, when the Burrs published their claim that the polyunsaturated fats,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 linoleic acid and linoleic acid, they said those are essential for life.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Other biologists had shown that animals were healthier when they had no fat in their diet,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 had almost no cancer, spontaneously developing.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 But the Burrs simply ignored the evidence that the fats were harmful.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 And other biologists ignored them pretty much for about 20 years

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 because the evidence was so overwhelmingly against their claims.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 But in their faith that those fats were essential,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.000
 one of their lab people agreed to go on a fat-free diet for six months.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 And his health remarkably improved.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 His blood lipids changed somewhat.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 The cholesterol went down a little and the triglycerides went up a little,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 but the total lipids quantity stayed about the same.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 But he didn't get tired after a day's work, as he always had,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 and his lifelong weekly migraine headaches disappeared forever.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 So nothing really was assuring the support of their position

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 until the seed oil industry wanted to market their liquid seed oils,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 cotton seed oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, and so on.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
 And they brought the Burrs out of obscurity

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 and said since they have proven that the fatty acids, linoleic acid and linoleic,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 are essential for life,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 we'll get the public to eat them in huge quantities

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 and treat them as drugs rather than as simply a trace nutrient.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 According to their somewhat unconvincing research as trace nutrients,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 they were supposedly doing something to make the skin healthier.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 But the counter evidence had included such things as many animal diseases,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 degenerative brain disease, atrophy of the gonads, infertility and so on,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 were connected with eating too much of the unsaturated fats.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Vitamin E was found to protect against that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 So it was all a marketing campaign to sell the idea that not only are those fats essential,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 but they're good for you and like a drug they'll prevent heart disease.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 But very soon people started producing evidence showing that, in fact,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 linoleic acid not only causes heart disease, but promotes cancer, immune problems,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 all kinds of things similar to what they had seen in the animals.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Okay. Now, all of these poofers then are the fish oils, the hemp seed oil, canola, et cetera.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 So these are all the liquid oils that you're referring to that are so common in the food chain now.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Yeah. And in the 1950s, they were feeding a lot of fish to mink in the mink farms.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 And they were producing what was called the yellow fat disease,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 which apparently was related to the age pigment lipofusco,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 which is a brown pigment that develops from the breakdown of polyunsaturated fats.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 So the fish oils were, right along with the seed oils, were seen to be toxic in the '50s and '60s.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 But by the 1970s, linoleic acid was being recognized as a major cause of heart disease and cancer.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 So they had sold the public on the idea of essential fatty acids.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 So they just changed the story and said, well, fish oils or linseed oil are a different kind of fat.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 They aren't the omega minus six oils like the deadly linoleic acid.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Okay. They're the omega minus three.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Right.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 But those had already themselves been incriminated with the yellow fat and lipofuscon disease.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 Okay. So they just switched tactics to the N3s and tried to sell those, huh?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 Yeah. And that's where we are now with the fish oil craze.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Yeah.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 Well, what I find is quite interesting is with our clients' blood work, when we say, oh, you know,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 have you had some blood work done, why don't you bring it in and let's look at it?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 So a lot of clients have elevated liver enzymes.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 And when they start eating coconut oil, those enzymes come down.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 Yeah.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 A researcher on hepatitis and cirrhosis, A.A. Nandji, for years has been showing that the polyunsaturated fats injure the liver.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 I think it started with an Indian researcher noticing that in the butter regions of India,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 alcoholics didn't develop hepatitis or cirrhosis in the liver.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And so he tested his observation on rats and found that if he fed them unsaturated oils,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 alcohol caused cirrhosis and hepatitis. If he fed them saturated fats, it didn't.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 And so Nandji tried that on his patients and found that their liver condition improved if he gave them a lot of saturated fats

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 and got worse if he fed them fish oils or seed oils.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 So why do you think it is so prevalent in the literature that we're bombarded from every seeming angle,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 from the newspapers, the television, to the radios, and all the media outlets that are purporting the liquid oils to be the beneficial things?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Because it doesn't matter where you look, you find cardiovascular research for this or for that,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 associating the fish oils with lower incidence of cholesterol, improved heart health.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 And actually the picture from research is actually showing a very different story.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 I wonder why it is.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 There aren't many palm trees producing coconut oil in the United States.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 Well, didn't you say, Dr. Peat, that when people take fish oils and they have high cholesterol,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 that the cholesterol moves out of the blood and into the tissues as a stress response?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 So if someone had a blood test to look at their cholesterol before and after using fish oils,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 it looks better after using fish oils, but it's not actually gotten out of the body.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 It's just gotten stored in the tissues?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Yeah, and cholesterol is one of our most important protective antioxidants, generally protective antitoxins.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 And for the unsaturated fats to lower that in the total production of it and the level in the blood is part of why there's something to avoid.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 The liver knows to increase, retain any cholesterol it can because it's needed for cell division to go on,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 for cell function to go on.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 All of the internal cellular processes rely on both cholesterol and saturated fatty acids.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 And if you overdose on the polyunsaturated, all of these intracellular mechanisms are deranged by interfering with the cholesterol

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 and saturated fat functions.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 The chromosomes, the spindle that helps the cell divide, separates the chromosomes and so on,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 all of these are stabilized and require cholesterol and saturated fats to function.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 And so you get deranged expression of genes and deranged cell division if you have too much polyunsaturated fats.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 And just to -- excuse me, I had to pop out for a moment.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 So I'm not sure if you covered all the different types of oils that fall into the category of the unsaturated versus the saturated.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 Yeah, go ahead again.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 But humans have been eating saturated fats forever, for thousands and thousands of years.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 And they didn't make seed oils.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 They didn't make oil out of corn.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 Apart from olive, maybe.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 I mean, well, but that's mostly -- that's very little polyunsaturated.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 It's mostly monounsaturated.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 Yeah.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 The safe oils are butter, chocolate fat, which is mostly stearic acid, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, beef fat, lamb fat, and olive oil.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 And also, too, I mean, people think of like pork fat and chicken fat as being like bad fats.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 And they actually are bad fats because of what they feed the pigs and the chickens.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 So unlike beef fat or butter or cream and milk and lamb fat and any other ruminant animal that has multiple stomachs,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 the chicken fat and the pork fat are just as bad as the corn oil because basically the pigs and the chickens are eating corn.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Yeah. And they're now farming fish and feeding them some of the same foods that they feed chickens and pigs.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 And interestingly, the things we think of as fish oil, the fish that live in the cold oceans get their fats from plankton.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 They eat small fish. The small fish eat the plankton. And the plankton fat is made by algae.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 And the algae is where the N minus 3 fats come from. And the fish modify them a little.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 But basically what we call fish fat is algae fat.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 And in experiments, they have given either warm-blooded animals extra fish oil or they give the fish a diet containing less unsaturated fat,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 like grains or cereal fat and so on, or chicken fat, I think, was one they used, or anchovy oil,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 highly unsaturated oil of a small fish that a salmon would maybe eat.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 And they tested their endurance. The rats getting the fish oil had less endurance.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Even the salmon on a pure fish oil diet had less endurance than when they were getting chicken fat or some other less polyunsaturated fat.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 So fish oil isn't even so great for fish.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 That's hilarious. I've never heard that before.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 So what about like the farmed shrimp? Because there's so many shrimp.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Do you think farmed shrimp even have the minerals in them why it's good to eat shellfish?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 No. The good thing about anything growing in the ocean is that it has access to selenium, iodine, and other trace minerals

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 where things grown inland depend on whatever is in the soil.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 So they're often deficient in selenium and copper.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 So farmed salmon, any kind of farmed fish or farmed shellfish, apart from oysters, they have to farm those in the ocean, I think.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 But they'll all be deficient then and there's actually no point eating them.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Yeah, unless people know exactly what to feed them.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Then they're giving them vitamins and then you're eating vitamins, recycled vitamins.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Now Dr. Peat, what you explain is the problems in the food chain with those things that either poison the cells directly or interfere with thyroid function

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 all hinge on the fact that as organisms we need an excess of metabolic energy to cope with the insults of the foods that we're exposed to,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 the drugs that we might take, or environmental toxins, etc.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
 Yeah, and diabetes is a good model of the energy deprived state.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 Several years ago someone suggested that Alzheimer's disease was diabetes of the brain.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 People are seeing the effects of inflammation in all of the degenerative diseases.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Inflammation involves a failure of energy and a shift to basically the diabetic metabolism in which all you can do with glucose is make lactic acid.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 Which poisons you again, right?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 Yeah, the lactic acid is pro-inflammatory and doesn't produce enough energy for normal function.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 The essence of diabetes was pointed out by Randle in 1963 or 64 when he observed that if you increase the free fatty acids in the blood,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 you very quickly make the cells unable to use glucose.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Right, does it shift their metabolism from glucose directly?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 Yeah, it's now been worked out that there are two very clear points where the free fatty acids inhibit the use of glucose.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 The pyruvic dehydrogenase, that's the one you need to burn glucose, and then they stimulate glucagon which happens to turn on the synthesis of glucose at the expense of protein.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Okay, they stimulate glucagon.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Yeah, and glucagon then in turn stimulates the release of more fatty acids.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Oh wow, okay.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 There are several points like that where the free fatty acids activate, for example, adrenaline, ACTH, cortisone, thyrotropic hormone, and glucagon.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 All of which increase the release of free fatty acids from your fat cell storage.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 And that seems very illogical of the body to create those vicious circles in which once you start having an energy failure, you turn on exactly what caused it.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 But it turns out that it's only the polyunsaturated fatty acids that have those terrible anti-energy effects.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 If you look at a comparison of stearic acid and linoleic acid, for example.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Which is like butter versus corn oil.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 Yeah.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 The butter turns off adrenaline and ACTH and cortisone.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Which are the bad guys.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Yeah, and the corn oil turns them on.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 And the excitotoxic system in the brain that wears out and can kill brain cells.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Those are activated by the polyunsaturated fats pretty much in proportion to the number of double bonds they have.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 Right, so these can be the...

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 More than linoleic.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 So these promote Alzheimer's then or other neurological or degenerative...

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Yeah, and they're calmed by stearic acid.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Right, which is beef fat, isn't it?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 Stearic from steers or stearate?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 I mean, it's in butter.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 Basically, it's a Greek word meaning fat.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 Okay.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 But yeah, that's what we were taught.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 That it meant from steers because of stearic acid.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 Okay, so you're saying that these bad oils can cause diabetes, block your use of sugar so that the blood sugar remains high.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And also Alzheimer's.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 Right, they block your energy production.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 Yeah, and if you look up the saturation index, I googled it and saw that all except one of the studies found that people with cancer had much more polyunsaturated fat in the tumor and in their bodies than healthy people.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 So, for example, twice as much in one study was polyunsaturated where healthy people had equal amounts.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 Okay.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 And putting rodents on a diet of high saturated fat delayed their development of breast cancer, fitting in with the saturation index being a matter of protection against cancer.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 Similar for heart disease, there was a study in which having the polyunsaturated fats shortened the lives of the animals with a tendency to heart disease.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 The saturated fat, very high saturated fat diet greatly extended their lives.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Mr. Mazzola, didn't he die of a heart attack after he had been saying, "Oh, corn oil is great." Like he was trying to sell everybody on corn oil because everybody was used to eating a saturated lard or butter or coconut oil.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 And he wanted people to buy his corn oil, so he said, "You can drink this stuff. It's great for you. It's great for your heart." And then didn't he die at a young age of a heart attack? Isn't that true, Dr. Peat?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 I don't know about him, but I know about it.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 I've read that.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 People famous for selling unsaturated fats dying of cancers that are known to be associated with an excess of PUFA.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 PUFA is our abbreviated version for polyunsaturated fatty acid, and that is every other fat apart from what we've listed like palm oil, coconut oil, butter, beef fat, olive oil.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Have I missed any others? We mentioned coconut butter. Any other solid fat?

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 In recent years, people are seeing that the level of free fatty acids, which in our population means mostly unsaturated fats because those are the ones which are most easily liberated from the fat storage.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 There's an extremely close connection between free fatty acids in the blood and your likelihood of dying from just about anything. Shock, aging, cancer, heart disease, and infection.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 All associated with high levels of free fatty acids.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Isn't this something that is good for a diabetic to test because it could be showing that they're not using their sugar because their free fatty acids are so high?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Yeah.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 In a blood test?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 It's recognized for years that niacin is effective for not only heart disease but diabetes simply because it lowers the free fatty acids.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 But that isn't catching on because it's so cheap.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 So food sources. I know coffee has a lot of niacinamide. What about chocolate? Doesn't chocolate have niacin?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 I don't know about chocolate.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 But also beef, I guess, rumen, animal livers, beef liver.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 Yeah.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 What other food sources are high in niacinamide?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 All of the animal foods have a reasonable amount.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Ok.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Liver, milk, eggs.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Ok. You're tuned in to KMUD Galberville 91.1 FM.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 And from any time now until the end of the show you're invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's show of energy production, diabetes, and saturated fats just to explore the myths that are surrounding us and pervading our culture and media.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 And the number here if you live in the area is 923-3911 or if you live outside the number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Look out, there's one caller or question.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 We have a caller but first I'll tell you it's 730 and 42 degrees outside and here's our caller.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Hi, yes, I'm calling from Port Bragg where it's supposed to get down to 32 later tonight.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So make sure you stay warm and get your animals in. Just a suggestion there.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 And Dr. Peat, last show, I'm a little older. I just had a birthday this weekend so again older.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 And I have a little bit of difficulty hearing you sometimes and during the last show you did something where I could hear you very well and I wanted to ask if whatever that was you could do that again because I really don't like to miss anything.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 I appreciate your wisdom and you have great information.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 And before I ask my question of you Dr. Peat, I wanted to ask is that Sarah tonight?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 Yes, it is Sarah. I'm Sarah and Andrew are here.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 I'm Sarah.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 I'm Sarah, yeah. I just wanted to ask if I could borrow your brilliant play on words about how fish that are farmed are deficient when describing the difference between the nutrients in farmed fish being deficient compared to those that are out in the ocean.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 I thought that was really clever and my compliments to you on that.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 Thank you.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 And thank you for the wonderful concept.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 My question for Dr. Peat is based on a conversation I had with a friend who said that he has difficulty digesting fats because of hereditary gallbladder difficulties.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 So I hope this is in line with the topic and the question that I have for you is are there any available enzymes, supplements, herbs that would help in the digestion of fats where somebody has apparently a difficulty in properly digesting those?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 Something that would aid in that digestion and better metabolize the fats basically have difficulty in eating meat, red meat, pork, et cetera.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 Not so much with fish or poultry but still a bit of a difficulty in anything in that realm.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 There is a great tendency of hypothyroid people to have gallbladder disease and trouble digesting fats.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And the best thing to do for gallbladder disease is to improve your thyroid function and avoiding unsaturated fats in all forms is very important for the thyroid function.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 The myth tells us that the only difference between the unsaturated and saturated fatty acids is their shape.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 And they claim that that has to do with the mobility of the fat in membranes and so on.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 But really the absolute difference between saturated and unsaturated is the way they bind to proteins and since the basic framework of the cell is protein,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 the saturated fats bind properly to the proteins and the unsaturated fats don't bind the same and bind to other proteins that they shouldn't bind to.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 And the protein that transports the thyroid hormone happens to -- it has sites that associate with the double bonds in the thyroid hormone molecule.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 And the unsaturated fats bind to those same sites on the transport protein so that the protein can't carry thyroid.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 It carries unsaturated fats instead.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 And so the --

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 Well, that's interesting to know.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And maybe what I could suggest to him is that he'd look into what might be a cascading difficulty that originates in the thyroid and maybe prevents the --

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 am I understanding correctly that it prevents the gallbladder from maybe properly producing enzymes necessary in that metabolism of fat?

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Right.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 Okay, well, hey, and I can hear you a lot better.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 So whatever you did, keep doing it, man.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 And you all stay warm and appreciate all the information that you bring to the air, all of you.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 And I wanted to say as well, until he can get that sorted out or while he's working on getting that sorted out,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 there are lots of liver herbs that can help improve bile flow and help improve his digestion of fats.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Ginseng, tinctures of ginseng, burdock root, dandelion root, those are very bitter herbs that can really help stimulate that flow of bile

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 and help in the meantime until he can get his system working on its own.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Cool.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 And ginseng, is that sometimes pronounced ginseng?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 No, ginseng.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Ginseng.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Swedish bitters.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 I don't know if you've ever heard of Swedish bitters.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 It's a traditional European tonic.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 That has all those types of bitter herbs in there.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 Okay, yeah.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 And, you know, sometimes we who aren't experts, a little clarification on that.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Can you spell ginseng for me just for clarification also?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Yes, it's g-for-George-e-n-t-i-a-n.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 So it sounds completely or it's spelled completely different from ginseng.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Okay.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Yes.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
 Very good.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 Thanks for all your information and have a good holiday, Thanksgiving coming up,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
 and I'm sure he'll be happy to hear this for that big turkey dinner next week.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
 Well, turkeys are like chickens.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 They're full of the poofas.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 Don't eat the skin.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 And don't eat the stuffing that is inside the bird.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 I'm sure it will help him enjoy his holiday better, so thanks again.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Okay, thank you for your call.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Thank you for your call.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 So, Dr. Peat, let's get back to the energy balance and the disruptive effects on energy

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 of the polyunsaturated versus the saturated fats as a way of staying healthy by keeping

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 and maintaining a high metabolic energy.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Dr. Peat, are you still there?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 Yeah, it went quiet for a while.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 Yeah, it did, too.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Did you actually hear the question or not?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 No, I didn't hear anything.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 Okay.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 I just wanted to get back to the concept of the energy balance in the organism and the

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 negative effects that poofa, the polyunsaturated liquid oils, seed oils, fish oil, et cetera,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 canola oil, how they impact the organism's ability to be metabolically active enough

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 to have extra energy currency, as it were, to pay off the debt of inflammation and other

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 things that the organism might come into contact with.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 The one enzyme that I mentioned, the pyruvic dehydrogenase, is the one that feeds glucose

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 into the oxidative system.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 But then the mitochondrial oxidative system itself is basically destroyed in proportion

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 to the polyunsaturated fat exposure.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Right.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 This is the system within every cell, the mitochondria, the little factories that work

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 in the cell.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Yeah.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 It produces something like 35 times more energy per molecule of sugar than the diabetic pathway

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 can produce.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 Wow.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 Because the diabetics are forced, for want of a better word, into a fat burning mode

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 rather than glucose burning.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 Yeah.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 If it was purely saturated fat, that would be okay.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 Right.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 But when we're at rest, our cells can burn saturated fat.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 They prefer that.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 Okay.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 The fat cells have been found to burn at rest.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 I mean, they're always at rest where the heart or skeletal muscles, only in a relatively

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 quiet state, will burn saturated fat.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Right.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 But the fat cells, being always at rest, slowly energize themselves by burning saturated

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 fat.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 Okay.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 That's why with age, our tissues become more and more concentrated with polyunsaturated

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 fats because the fat cells themselves are using the good stuff.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 Right.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 And so, with age, it's seen all the way from birth to old age, there's a progressive increase

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 of polyunsaturated fats in all our tissues.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Right, from our diets.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Yeah.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 And so then, when we're under stress and don't get enough sugar, then we have to burn the

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.600
 bad stuff.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:43.880
 And that does many things to the mitochondria, including sometimes sudden death.

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.960
 Yeah.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:53.200
 The chronic effect is known to destroy the genes, the genetic material inside the mitochondria.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.200
 Okay.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.240
 Where saturated fat doesn't.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.880
 Would this give rise to cancers then, as a result of damaged DNA?

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.880
 Yeah.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.880
 Yeah.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.360
 So you're saying that this doesn't really occur only in the presence of polyunsaturated

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:08.880
 destructive changes?

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.880
 Yeah.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.880
 The saturated fats are just quietly oxidized.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.880
 Wow.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.880
 Because they're relatively stable?

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.880
 Yeah.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:17.880
 Yeah.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.880
 They don't break down into the...

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:35.360
 Isoprostanes and neuroprostanes are equivalent to the prostaglandins, but they're made randomly

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.880
 under stress and oxidation.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.880
 Right, and they're very inflammatory.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:39.880
 Yeah.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:48.480
 And then there are several of the fragment molecules that are made from the N-6 or N-3

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:52.720
 molecule, hydroxynoninel and hydroxyhexinel.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.720
 Okay.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:40:03.960
 These attach to hemoglobin, genetic material, enzymes, signaling molecules.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.880
 So is this a glycation?

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880
 Yeah.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.880
 Most of the things that are called glycation are really fat breakdown products.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.880
 Okay.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:23.360
 So basically, if you're a diabetic, then most likely you're going to be breaking down these

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.560
 bad fats in your tissues, and you can get a blood test that shows that you have high

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:33.760
 lactic acid from this inefficient metabolism where you burn this fat that's really a bad

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760
 fat.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760
 It's not a saturated fat?

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760
 Yeah.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.200
 What would happen if a diabetic only ate saturated fats?

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:47.200
 Well, it takes a long time to use up the -- depends on how old and how fat you are.

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:52.800
 A thin person can change very quickly.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:41:03.640
 It isn't just the storage fats that become very highly polyunsaturated with age, but

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:12.880
 every tissue contains phospholipids and other very complex molecules containing the fatty

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.880
 acids.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:19.840
 So what would be like the maximum time if someone who had cancer or diabetes or Alzheimer's,

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.000
 how long would it take if they stopped eating all of these polyunsaturated fatty acids and

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.120
 all these bad oils and just started eating butter and coconut?

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:35.760
 Well, they've looked at people moving from Holland to England, for example, or rats or

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:42.920
 chickens that are put on a different diet, and the complete changeover takes years, about

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.480
 four years.

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:56.080
 But you can -- if you eat frequently and thoroughly avoid the stress-causing foods and don't let

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:06.600
 yourself get hungry enough that you call on the stress hormones to liberate fat, you can

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:17.280
 very quickly shift over to the efficient metabolism, frequent eating, but always with sugar and

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.520
 always with absolutely no PUFA.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:34.760
 Sugar allows the slow disposition of the unsaturated toxic fats, and our liver treats the PUFA

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.360
 like it treats other toxins.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:45.520
 If it has the energy, it attaches them to a sugar and prepares them to be excreted in

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:52.280
 the urine, just like chloroform or dioxin or whatever.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.920
 Any other toxin.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:01.480
 So that's also why when -- like women will go on these weight loss programs and they

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.480
 lose, say, 60 to 70 pounds in a year, that their liver enzymes go up and their liver

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.160
 shows signs of stress, and that's because they burn too many of these polyunsaturated

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.160
 fats at once.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:19.360
 But if your liver stays energized with frequent feedings and good nutrition, it can slowly

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.800
 eliminate those fats without running them through the mitochondria.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:30.320
 But when you're under stress, you not only damage all of your blood vessels and nerve

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:39.040
 cells and so on, but you -- they very specifically knock out the exact enzymes which are needed

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:42.080
 to detoxify things.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:49.600
 So lots of snacks of fruit and cheese or fruit and milk, things like that to keep your energy

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.200
 metabolism going well will help prevent these bad fats from coming into circulation too

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.200
 quickly at once.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.200
 Yeah.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.200
 And I think we have a caller on the line.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.200
 Hi.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.440
 I'm really enjoying your show.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.800
 In fact, you're reinforcing what my mom always told me.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.600
 What was that?

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:13.360
 Oh, you know, eat more veggies, eat more fruit, you know, that kind of stuff.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.440
 She also wanted me to eat milk and drink milk, but that's another story.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.440
 Right.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.440
 Well, I'd recommend the same thing, sir.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.440
 Thank you for that.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.440
 Okay.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.440
 Thank you.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.840
 Well, I'm allergic to milk, so I'm not sure about that one.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.840
 But I've got a question for you.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.840
 I'm sure I could sort that out.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.520
 Given enough time, I could help you out with that too.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.520
 But anyway, so what's your question?

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:40.000
 You know, there was this, I guess you'd call it a diet, a way to eat that was talked about

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 always, you know, how these diet things go.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.320
 They're kind of a sad thing.

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:50.040
 They come into people's awareness and they're the going thing for a while.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.720
 But it was called the "Eat Right for Your Blood Type."

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.720
 Oh, right.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.480
 Yes, I've heard of that.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.520
 And what I, you know, I don't usually subscribe to most of those things, but I did notice

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.480
 with that, you know, I looked it up and said, "Well, what's it say?"

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:09.440
 It said for my blood type, which is O positive, it said, you know, "Beef is really good and

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.200
 pork's not so good," and this and that.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:16.520
 And what I've noticed is that, you know, when I find myself in a stressful position or tired

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:21.480
 position, something like that, I get this yearning for, you know, to go have a hamburger

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.840
 or go have some meat or something.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.760
 And after I eat it, I feel really satisfied.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:31.000
 And I wondered what you all think with your experience in studies about the relationship

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:39.120
 between certain types of foods or maybe specifically meat products and, you know, blood types or

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.640
 any of that kind of information.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.640
 Or even cravings.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.600
 That would be an interesting question for you, Dr. Peat, as far as a person's craving

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.720
 for like when they really want that steak or they really want, like I've been having

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.720
 cravings for watermelon.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.440
 I really want some watermelon.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.240
 So what is the brain trying to tell us that?

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:07.040
 There have been animal studies and some studies in kids showing that we have very specific

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:15.920
 nerve systems that tell us what we're deficient in, except for the quality of protein.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:23.000
 There are only a few of the amino acids that our systems detect as deficiencies.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.720
 And I forget which those are.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:33.960
 We do crave protein when we're deficient in protein if the food is a balanced type of

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.280
 protein.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:41.240
 And we crave sugar and salt very specifically if we need those.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:47.560
 Hypothyroid people generally crave sugar and salty food.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:58.280
 And vitamin C is something that causes a craving for sour, tangy foods, fruits, for example.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.280
 Okay.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.200
 So I guess, Collar, are you still on the air?

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200
 Yes.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.160
 So did that answer your question?

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.360
 Well, I mean, it does to a degree.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.680
 I wonder, you know, the factors that I've noticed again, and I mentioned it, there's

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:19.800
 a certain level of stress that I've noticed that brings out some of that.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.760
 Well, I can notice when I'm tired I get more cravings for sugar things.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:30.000
 But also stress will bring on, you know, if I get really stressed and let's say I'm working,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.400
 I really want that donut, which I don't.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.440
 Donuts are one thing that I just try to avoid.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.200
 You know, but I find that there is some fat or, you know, as I said, the meat thing.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:48.640
 So I'm wondering because I do find I eat a fair amount of beef and I try to buy the lowest

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.000
 fat content beef I can.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.360
 And again, you know, I'm hearing all your cautionary information regarding eating animal

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.360
 fats.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:05.400
 And I'm just trying to find a balance there between what my body seems to be craving and

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.280
 what I'm hearing from you and from your educated point of view.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.280
 Right.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.280
 Well, as far as the beef fat is concerned, that is not a dangerous fat.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:21.880
 Of course, now with industrial beef raising, cow raising, cattle raising, sorry, what they're

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:28.640
 feeding the cows, if they're giving the animals hormones, those will get stored in the fat.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.280
 All the toxins do get stored in the fat.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:36.200
 But if it's a grass fed organic animal, then the fat should be fairly clean.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:42.120
 And that if you're craving, you didn't say you were craving fat, but basically I don't

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.000
 think beef fat is a super dangerous fat.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.600
 It's the chicken fat and the pork fat and the turkey fat and the fish fat.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.960
 Those fats are the ones that have been shown in these studies that we've been talking about

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:59.320
 tonight to be dangerous and blocking your use of sugar and slowing down cells metabolism

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.520
 and altering the genetics and all of that sort of thing.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:11.120
 And your references earlier that I heard were at least with the swine and chickens were

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:15.440
 along the lines of that it's really the feed that's causing that.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.200
 Would that be the same with fish?

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:22.120
 Are you referencing only farmed fish or are you saying all fish?

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:29.040
 Well, they've seen the change of diet affecting even farmed salmon.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:38.040
 And the fish really have just as almost an absolute reflection of their diet in their

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.040
 fat.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:47.760
 Fish in the Amazon contain fat that's as saturated as butter because of the temperature of the

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.760
 water.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:49.760
 Interesting.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:57.800
 So the old story of the Eskimo and why the Eskimos don't get heart disease because they

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:58.800
 eat a lot of fish.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.320
 That's because they eat whale blubber which is very saturated.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.920
 They live off of whale blubber.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.240
 I don't know if I'll go that far in my diet.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.600
 No, I know.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600
 We have butter.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.880
 We have grass fed butter.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:15.880
 And grass fed beef.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:23.760
 Grass fed beef and milk that's from grass fed cows.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.960
 One thing I did want to point out is that when cows eat the bad food just like the chickens

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:35.440
 and the pigs, all the corn and all the soy that's in it, the cows because they have four

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:41.720
 stomachs they can transfer that bad fat from the corn into a saturated fat.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.640
 So it's not dangerous like if you ate the fat of the chicken or the pig or the turkey.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.080
 Yeah, that's really interesting.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.440
 I hadn't known that before.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:58.400
 So the cows bacteria use vitamin E to saturate the fat basically detoxifying the unsaturated

00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:59.400
 fats.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.400
 Okay, we've lost you Dr. Peat.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.400
 Yeah, there was a noise.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.880
 Yeah, just say that again.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.520
 You were talking about the...

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.520
 Vitamin E.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.520
 Right.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:22.080
 So vitamin E even in humans will cause some of that in the intestine if there are bacteria

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.400
 present with the fat.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:29.680
 Vitamin E lets bacteria saturate and detoxify some of the PUFA.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:36.160
 So one of the small effects of vitamin E is to destroy the polyunsaturated fat rather

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.000
 than just protecting against it's after effects.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.960
 So if someone were to eat french fries, God forbid, then they could take up some vitamin

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.800
 E with it to help prevent some of the damage?

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.120
 Yeah, or make the french fries in coconut oil.

00:51:54.120 --> 00:52:00.920
 Okay, now that last caller who mentioned when they get stressed they want to gravitate towards

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.180
 I think he was gravitating towards meat but he did mention that donuts would be something

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.880
 else that he would consume perhaps under stress.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:12.320
 Do you understand that stress perhaps as being the need for blood sugar?

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:22.800
 Yeah, there are the specific needs of protein deficient person or animal will gravitate

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.920
 towards a higher protein in the food.

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:35.240
 But the most intense connection between need and appetite is between sugar and salt.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:40.360
 Okay, so sugar and salt are the good guys as we've heard before many times.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.480
 It's kind of another misinformation folks.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:46.440
 So people that have tuned in this evening have probably heard things that they may not

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.040
 have heard before and some people that have tuned in have heard it and they want to keep

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.920
 hearing more which is all good.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:56.880
 So we'll just reiterate the fact that the misinformation that's out there in the media

00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:04.520
 is portraying the liquid oils as good, as soy as good, sugar as bad and salt as bad

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:10.600
 when actually salt and sugar are both very important for you, anti-stress compounds for

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:16.160
 lowering adrenaline and the saturated fats are actually very good in supporting a healthy

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.880
 metabolism.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.000
 What do you think about the free fatty acids in related...

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.240
 Sorry, I just want to say but you want foods in balance.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.680
 You can't just eat salt on its own.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:29.160
 You can't just eat sugar just on its own.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.360
 You want to balance it with a good protein and a good fat.

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.840
 You want to balance the sugar and the salt with a good protein and a good fat so you

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.640
 keep it all in balance.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:46.800
 Maybe we have time for you just to explain what the Randle hypothesis proposed 30 years

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.880
 ago or thereabouts that science wants to ignore now or I see some people actually digging

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.880
 up that old research and starting to re-examine it.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:02.080
 Some people call it the Randle cycle but there's no cycle involved.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.840
 It's just a competition.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:14.840
 When you raise your free fatty acids, you inhibit the ability to oxidize glucose and

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:23.120
 stress increases the free fatty acids and oxidizing glucose is what you need to overcome

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:26.520
 the stress.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:33.960
 It's sort of a counterproductive reaction but the reason it's counterproductive is

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:39.480
 that our systems are designed not to eat PUFA.

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:47.520
 It's a PUFA which very systematically is just an amazing black and white almost difference.

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:56.440
 The way the PUFA turn on the very stress hormones that interfere with the energy making it the

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:04.480
 body need more stress hormones and blocking the energy so that we need more turning on

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.280
 the very things that cause the problem.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.720
 Why does the body want to do that?

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:19.640
 The body is designed apparently from how completely systematic it is to respond to saturated fat

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:29.200
 because saturated fats block the stress reaction so the properly functioning body would be

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.760
 logical.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:40.760
 The stress reaction would provide energy in the absence of food, would provide the saturated

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:48.680
 fats from the storage and at the same time, it would inhibit the stress hormones and allow

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.800
 the cycle to be broken.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:59.160
 We happen to be living in a time since the 1920s when they make poisonous fats and our

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:05.040
 body is used to eating saturated fat for thousands and thousands of years and it's not responding

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.280
 to the unsaturated fats like it does to the saturated.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.760
 So we're just getting poisoned basically.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.080
 It's not the body's fault.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:19.160
 If science had simply been looking to understand the situation since 1930, things would have

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:23.080
 been very clear in 1950.

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:30.360
 But the very systematic differences between saturated and unsaturated fats would have

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:37.920
 become perfectly apparent in just a few years of open discussion.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:44.800
 And advertising just totally swamped the whole cultural situation so even the scientists

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:55.180
 and doctors dealing with the situation, they don't see the picture of how clearly polarized

00:56:55.180 --> 00:57:00.000
 the types of fat are in their effects on the physiology.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.080
 It's just become a big snowball effect.

00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:09.760
 Okay, well, we've only got four minutes to go so I'm sure there's no more time for callers

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:15.280
 and I think for the people that are listening, thank you for those who've tuned in this evening.

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:21.320
 Dr. Raymond Peat has a wealth of information that I think you should all visit at least

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320
 once.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.480
 If you haven't done it yet, please do go to his website.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:35.160
 It's www.raypeat.com and there's plenty of scholarly referenced articles that will highlight

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.680
 everything that we've talked about tonight and plenty more.

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:45.400
 So do take a look at the website and we can always be contacted Monday through Friday,

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:50.560
 normal business hours if people want to communicate any questions with us.

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.080
 And do you have anything else you want to add, Sarah?

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.080
 No, I'm done for the evening.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.440
 Dr. Peat, I wanted to make sure that there wasn't anything else you wanted to say or

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.880
 is there any parting words you have for our listeners?

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:02.880
 Nope.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.880
 Nope, okay.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.960
 Eat good fats and keep your energy working.

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.520
 Lots of snacks.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:10.480
 Thank you so much for sharing your time with us again.

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.320
 We do really appreciate it.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:13.320
 Thank you.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320
 Thank you.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.000
 Okay, so all those people that have listened out there, there's always an alternative so

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.920
 don't ever think you're stuck and don't especially think that you're stuck having to do something

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:28.280
 that the medical establishment tell you is the only way to go about treating a certain

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:29.280
 situation.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:33.320
 So whilst the misinformation that's out there concerning everything we've talked about is

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:38.560
 so prevalent, don't believe that there's not another alternative because there is.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.880
 It's just you just have to open your eyes and open your ears.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.060
 And for those of you who have ears, let them hear.

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.060
 Thank you and good night.

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.060
 We'll see you in December.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.060
 Talk to you in December.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.060
 Sorry, we will talk to you.

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.060
 That's right.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.060
 We don't see you.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.060
 We don't see you.

00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.060
 Unfortunately.

00:58:54.060 --> 00:59:06.560
 Okay, have a happy Thanksgiving everybody.
