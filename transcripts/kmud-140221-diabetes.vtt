00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 my wife and I are both licensed medical herbalists who train in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 We run a clinic in Gartherville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Gartherville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of diabetes and Dr. Peat's latest research on diabetes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 The number here if you live in the area is 9233911 or if you live outside the area, there's a toll-free number which is 1800 KMUD RAD.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 So that's 1800 KMUD RAD if you live outside the area.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 We can also be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-HERB for consultations or further information Monday through Friday 9 to 5.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Okay, so once again we're very pleased to welcome Dr. Peat on the show.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Dr. Peat, are you there? Engineer, where's Dr. Peat?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 He was there. I'll try calling him back.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Okay. Okay, until we get Dr. Peat back on the line here.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Basically, the continuation of this show is going to be on diabetes and Dr. Peat's research onto neuropathies and the classical diagnosis of diabetes and what we know in the light of current research to kind of make the notion of diabetes disappear in light of new findings.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So Dr. Peat, if you're with us. Hello.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 Hi, Dr. Peat. Can you hear us okay? Yes.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Perfect. Okay. So as always, even though you're a pretty permanent fixture on the show and we're very happy to keep it that way, for those perhaps who've never listened to you or heard you, would you just give an outline of your academic professional background so people know more about you?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Okay. I have been interested in biology for a long time but was doing other things, teaching English linguistics and such.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 But in 1968, I decided to go back to graduate school to get a PhD at the University of Oregon. I graduated there in '72, having specialized in mostly physiology of reproduction biochemistry.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Since then, I've been following up on the same subjects related to oxidative metabolism, progesterone, estrogen and thyroid.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Okay. And I think also just for the people that are listening to the show, Dr. Peat, you've been pretty much altruistic in your attitude towards helping people.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 I know lots of people have consulted with you from all over the world for various metabolic disorders.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 And you have a very, very alternative view. But in terms of the research, it's actually not that alternative. It's just that the research doesn't really surface anywhere near as quickly as we'd like it to, compared to what medicine and doctors are taught in terms of the cause of diseases, specifically metabolic disorders.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 And their treatment is often lagging behind or in fact contraindicated in some ways. So you've got a very extensive treatment background too, haven't you?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 A big part of the problem is that medical journals are totally separate from science journals. Years ago, before the internet, Index Medicus was a list of medical journal articles similar to PubMed now.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And I occasionally compared things that I would find in biological abstracts or chemical abstracts. And when I would look things up later in Index Medicus, I found that there was usually a delay of 20 or 30 years after the discovery of something absolutely essential,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 such as the role of coenzyme Q10 in metabolism.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Okay, well, onto this month's topic. I know you've recently been producing a newsletter. You haven't actually finished it yet.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 But the subject of the newsletter is going to be on diabetes and fats, and it has an interwoven component with all those protective elements of things that you are advocating fairly continuously for many different disorders.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Diabetes being one of those with things like progesterone and thyroid, adequate sugars. Can I just start off perhaps by just saying for our listeners perhaps, before we get into the actual causes of diabetes, would you just then outline the standard definition and cause of diabetes from the perspective of current medical understanding before we get into the research and what it is you understand it as?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 The medical understanding has changed very little in the last 200 years. It was called the sugar disease. And in ancient times, it was named because of the excess urination.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And the urine contained a lot of glucose, and people craved sugar. And then they discovered the blood was loaded with glucose.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And so it began the medical concept that it was the glucose or the sugar disease. And the standard cure was to make them unable to eat sugar, imprison them if necessary.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 And they would just die anyway, but they kept them from satisfying their sugar hunger. And then insulin was discovered, which would for the people who were wasting away with what later was called type 1 diabetes, insulin would allow them to build muscle and put on fat instead of breaking tissues down.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 And excreting it in the urine. But the sugar disease concept stayed with the medical profession, even though insulin deficiency came to be the idea of its cause.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 But then as they looked for more ways to sell insulin, they noticed that lots of people who weren't wasting away and dying at a young age also had very high blood sugar. Some of them had sugar in their urine.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 Yet when they tested their blood, they found it had a normal amount of insulin in it. But anyway, they were good candidates for treatment. So it came to be called type 2 diabetes, even though the original concept was that diabetes was a wasting disease in which you quickly died of tissue wasting.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 But now fat people became something like 95% of the patients for treatment of their high blood glucose. So it definitely isn't a problem of insulin deficiency for the great majority of people who are diagnosed with diabetes.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Okay, so you just mentioned what's currently being called type 1 and type 2. Type 1 is the insulin for want of a better explanation. Type 1 is insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and then type 2 is non-insulin dependent. So it's kind of a diet, what they call diet controlled or can be modulated by the diet.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 So how does the model of diabetes, the current medical model of diabetes differ from the research perspective on the cause of diabetes before we get into articles and specifics?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 In the late 19th century, two doctors doubted the theory that it was from eating too much sugar because they died even faster when they made them not eat any sugar.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 So they began feeding first one patient with each doctor. They let them eat all the sugar they wanted, which was something like three quarters of a pound a day of pure sugar added.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 And they very quickly recovered from the wasting disease and were able to go back to work after a few weeks of this super high sugar diet. And that gradually, their followers eventually saw that fructose was part of the sucrose standard sugar molecule,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 which got in the cells and was metabolized without needing insulin. So for 50 or 60 years, many diabetics were able to eat a normal amount of sweetener in the form of fructose.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 But that never became the dominant treatment for diabetes, even though it is more or less as effective as the simply very high sucrose diet.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 But experiments looking for what was the cause of, in the case of young kids, the type 1 diabetes that was more common in girls than boys, it turned out to be sort of an autoimmune problem, inflammation, killing off the beta cells.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 And it happens that in vitro and in animal experiments, you can stimulate the growth of stem cells in the pancreas with glucose.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 So it isn't glucose that's responsible for killing those cells. It's an inflammation reaction. And the inflammation causes breakdown of fatty acids, which cause pre-radical injury to the tissue.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 And because of that observation of the inflammation involving prostaglandins and unsaturated fatty acids, a few experimenters put lab animals on a totally fat-free diet, giving them only saturated fats or no fat at all,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 just carbohydrates and protein, vitamins and minerals, and then tried to give them diabetes by all of the standard methods of poisoning the beta cells of the pancreas in various ways so they couldn't make insulin.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 And these fat-free animals didn't develop the experimental diabetes the way all other animals do.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So experimentally, it's been pretty well demonstrated that unsaturated fatty acids breaking down produce inflammation, which activates many of the processes seen in diabetes,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 the degenerative processes in the retina and nerves, for example, are where the damage starts very often before the blood sugar increases at all.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 So if you're getting retinal degeneration and have normal blood sugar, or if you're getting numb and tingly hands and feet and have normal blood sugar, it's clearly not the sugar which is responsible for the degenerative changes.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Okay, so again, you're pointing the finger of blame, if you like, at the free fatty acid liberation and the oxidative damage that occurs from that.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 Yeah, and the unsaturated fatty acids happen to create a vicious circle because they create stress and the stress activates the stress hormones which provide, in the normal process of providing fat from the tissues as emergency fuel,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 to liberate more of the unstable polyunsaturated fats, creating more free radical damage, creating more stress, liberating more fats and so on.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Purely saturated fats, when liberated, tend to turn off those stress hormones.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 Okay, so another good reason yet again to avoid the liquid oils and avoid the free fatty acids, the fish oils and all the other oils that basically are very unsaturated because they're unstable, promote oxidation and all the stress response and tissue damage therein.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Yep.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Okay, so perhaps I just wanted to mention that one of these drugs, medications that I know quite a few people have been on and are probably still using, amongst others, but metformin as a diabetes medication.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Yeah, fenformin was the first form of that that was used widely in the 50s and 60s, but it was killing a very high proportion of people.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 They were dying much earlier than they would have with no treatment at all.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 And it was causing lactic acidosis by causing the mitochondria to be unable to oxidize glucose, which was exactly the problem of diabetes.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 So that got a bad reputation and it was replaced by metformin, which was reputed to not cause lactic acidosis.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 And there are articles on the warning about the production of lactic acidosis with this standard, very common treatment.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 It works where it works, partly by poisoning the mitochondria so that the cells are forced to produce lactic acid and so it lowers blood sugar by wasting the glucose, turning it into lactic acid.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Wow.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 But it also has some other effects which account for why everyone doesn't die quickly of lactic acidosis.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 It apparently has some slightly protective anti-inflammatory effects.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Wow.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Okay, you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor on KNUD Gallivoo, 91.1 FM.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 And from 7.30 till the end of the show, 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions with our permanent speaker, Dr. Ray Peat, who's on the show discussing diabetes, the scientific approach and the research approach that's elucidating lots of different treatment strategies than you would otherwise expect to hear from your doctor.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 So the number here for living near is 923 3911 or if you're outside the area, the toll-free number is 1800 KNUD RAD.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 So any time from 7.30 to 8 o'clock.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Okay, so I wanted to also let you get into the benefits of sugar.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 I know we've done several radio shows on how good and how beneficial sugar is for the organism and it's the same with salt and keep getting validated slowly but surely with reports of that same thing in the press whereas before it was pretty well maligned.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 So we understand that there are a lot of protective effects that sugar confers to the organism from a cellular energy standpoint.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
 What are the beneficial effects to sugar have when you look at it from a diabetic perspective?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 I looked up what current journals and doctors are saying are the mechanisms that cause nerve damage in diabetes and they have a standard four or five chemical or functional changes of nerve cells that they say are caused by excess glucose.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 They occur in the presence of excess glucose in the diabetic but they also occur before or without the presence of glucose and the deficiency of glucose is one of the things that can induce these same defensive reactions that are blamed on sugar.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 So you have to look at the evidence regarding the deficiency of glucose and compare it experiment by experiment with the kind of evidence they propose to explain glucose as the cause.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 When you look at all of the events associated with diabetes and the symptoms, you see that hormone changes typically go with it.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 Stress induces aromatase that increases estrogen production and also directly increases some of the pituitary hormones besides ACTH that drives the adrenals.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 Stress increases growth hormone which provides fuel in an emergency by increasing free fatty acids in circulation.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Estrogen also increases the ACTH and prolactin, several of the stress hormones in the pituitary but especially growth hormone is very closely connected with estrogen.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 So females have higher not only estrogen but growth hormone and free fatty acids in circulation and it happens that females have much more often problems with the nerve degenerative symptoms of diabetes as well as being the ones that have the majority of type 1 diabetes during childhood.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 So the effect of the free fatty acids on stress and glucose or any sugars protection against those stress reactions is one of the basic things to look at in avoiding hypoglycemic stress long before the problem reaches the stage of producing hyperglycemia.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 In hyperglycemia, what you have is the body's adjustment to the inability of cells to get enough energy because they can't oxidize glucose because the fats are blocking it.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 That's been known since the 60s called the Randle Cycle in which free fatty acids block the use of glucose.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 So the body tries to overcome that poisonous effect of the free fatty acids by increasing glucose production and so it can kind of get around the block just by stuffing more glucose into the blood.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 So to a great extent, the rising blood sugar shouldn't be fought in itself.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 So the body's adjustment to the inability of cells to get enough energy is one of the basic things to look at in avoiding hypoglycemic stress.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 So the liver becomes unable to activate the pre-thyroid hormone thyroxine turning it into the active T3.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 So supplementing the active T3 thyroid hormone will cure lots of the so-called effects of diabetes.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 I had an old friend whose toes were basically rotting because of what was diagnosed as diabetes, degenerative nerve and circulation problems in the legs and feet.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Two weeks after he started using Armour thyroid, his feet recovered completely.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 His toes had been black with ulcerated sores going right into the bones but they completely healed up on thyroid.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 We went through three cycles in which his doctor said the Armour thyroid was going to increase his blood sugar and make his diabetes worse.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 So you would tell him to stop it, his feet would start rotting again.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 So it wasn't just a coincidence. We did it three times.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 On that note, Dr. Peat, we do have several callers waiting in the queue.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 Let's go ahead and take the first caller.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Hold on, I'm dealing with something. Sir, wait a second. I have a question to ask the caller.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 I know that and we're talking on the air right now. You're next caller. I apologize.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 So what's going on?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 People love Dr. Peat. I know. I know.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 I know the flashing lights. The lights are flashing. Dr. Peat, people are calling.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 I'll take this.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 And also you should ask them if they want to talk off the air, ask them where they're calling from.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 It's always good to get an idea of demographics.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 Yeah, I know that.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 So first I will... we have so many callers, listeners from all over the country who listen on the internet for this show.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 And people need to understand that the KMUD system can only handle 25 people at a time.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 We need to change that.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 I got an email from a person in England who listens to the show, Dr. Peat.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 And I'm going to be talking with them at some point here in the future.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 Yeah, and so it costs us money to have more than 25 at a time and that is something we need to do.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 But this is a plea to Dr. Peat's international listeners to please support KMUD

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 so that you will always be able to listen to them over the internet.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 And so I have a question.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Well, one person wanted you to speak more in layman terms in general.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 You're so eloquent and full of Latin that it's tough for you, I'm sure.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 But so in general, that is a general idea.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 And someone from Legit has a friend with suspected CO2 poisoning and possible brain damage

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 and was interested in nutritional ideas to address that.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 CO2 poisoning?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Oh, I'm sorry, carbon monoxide.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Carbon monoxide.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Yeah, my bad.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Okay.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 CO2 is one of the things that helps to restore the cells that are damaged by carbon monoxide.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Okay, good.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 Good vitamin nutrition is helpful.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Okay.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 All right, there you go.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 So carbon dioxide and obviously nutritional support.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 And thyroid hormone is the main thing we need to produce all the carbon dioxide.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 It is protective.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 The diabetic or hypothyroid person is not producing enough energy from oxygen and glucose.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 And so they very easily or even at rest turn some of the glucose into lactic acid.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 And lactic acid displaces carbon dioxide from the blood.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 And that has a stress producing effect throughout the body.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 And by simply breathing less rapidly or breathing in a bag occasionally to re-breathe and save your carbon dioxide,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 you can increase the CO2 in tissues, which activates the Krebs cycle, stabilizes cells, and shuts down the production of lactic acid.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 So it has a direct connection to the things that go wrong in diabetes as well as hypothyroidism to simply increase your CO2.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 And living at a very high altitude, the body naturally does that because it isn't being overwhelmed with high pressure oxygen like at sea level.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 Okay, let's take the next caller.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 Caller, you're on the air.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 Where are you from?

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 This is David from Missouri.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 Hi, David.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 Hello, Andrew.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Hello, Dr. Peat.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 This is off the subject a little bit, but I've heard Dr. Peat in other podcasts refer to starch molecules as -- I think we call those molecules --

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 maybe they're like a crystal-like structure, but they actually block capillaries if they somehow get into the bloodstream.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 I was just wanting him to elaborate on that a little bit more possibly on maybe what other research.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 He had mentioned one piece of research, and I don't remember who that was specifically,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 but I'm wondering if this is something that's fairly well-known in the scientific community.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 No, it was something discovered 100 years ago, but in the '70s, German immunologist Gerhard Volkheimer wrote some papers on it.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 It's called persorption, and I think there's an article of his on the Internet called Persorption,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 and it has illustrations of some of the junk that can simply get squeezed right through the lining of the intestine.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 It isn't being squeezed between cells necessarily.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 It can go right into the cytoplasm on one side and out the cytoplasm on the other side.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 These cells are much more flexible than people imagine.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Particles as big as 100 microns -- potato starch particles, for example --

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 if you eat a slurry of corn starch or potato starch or whatever on an empty stomach,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 much later you can draw blood and find these particles, which some of them are just the size of a red blood cell,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 but others are as much as 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:17.000
 Red blood cells are very flexible, so they can squeeze through capillaries with an opening that's only maybe 5 microns across,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 and their diameter is 10 microns.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Even a 10-micron particle of starch will plug up an arteriole

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 and shut down circulation to a whole block of capillaries fed by that arteriole.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 The bigger the particle, the bigger the small artery is that gets plugged up.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 So, a Alzheimer's would feed mice a high content of free starch in their diet,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 and he found that they aged prematurely, and when he sliced them up,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 he found that all of their organs contained little nests of dead,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 deteriorating cells downstream from the plug of one of these starch molecules.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Dr. Peat, would these starch materials actually resist?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 I mean, does the body see this as an irritant and try to somehow expel it,

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 or is it just something that just stays there for long periods of time?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 The body can produce the enzymes pretty much anywhere it needs to.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 It can break down starch.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 It isn't just saliva and the intestine that has those enzymes,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 but they can stay in place long enough, as he demonstrated, for the tissue to die.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 The bigger they are, I suppose, the longer they stay put, killing tissue.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 So when we're eating a potato, and as you've mentioned before,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 you know, using like coconut oil or butter or some kind of saturated fat,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 that's allowing that to basically, I guess the word would be like slide through the intestine

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 rather than getting off to the side and going into the bloodstream?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Yeah, if it's very well cooked, it makes the starch particle easier to break down in the intestine,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 and the fat delays the absorption, so it has time to break down more before it's absorbed.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 So when you said the word--I forgot the scientist's name, but he found all sorts of junk.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Junk would be like all those things that they're putting into our food, too,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 or like the silicates that you mentioned that they use to make a viscosity for the machinery

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 to like vitamins and minerals and different things, supplements that they produce.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 So those silicates would be one of those junk elements that probably lodge in different vessels in the body, too, right?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 And I think the chemically modified cellulose molecules that are in practically everything,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 some of those are toxic in themselves, seem to have a catalytic effect,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 and so they might be degrading the supplement right in the tablet.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 That has hardly been studied.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 I've seen a couple of papers on it, and the silica particles not only get into the tissue,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 but they have a toxic and allergenic or immunological effect.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Gerhard Volkheimer, being an immunologist, was especially concerned about their role in degenerative and immune diseases,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 but people specializing in the silica or silicone reactions,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 they found that supposedly amorphous silica glass-like particles,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 that they in themselves have some of the silicone-like effects

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 and even overlap with the crystalline effects that produce cancer in silicosis from asbestos crystals.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 But it seems to be an activation of inflammation reactions.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 The inflammasome particle responds to a certain shape of particle.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 So if it has a given shape, it doesn't matter too much whether it's asbestos or carbon or silicone or wood.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 I think Volkheimer mentioned feathers and wood particles, sawdust, can get through the intestine.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 He showed that not only plugging up the blood vessels,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 about 15 minutes after they can be detected in the blood, they can be found in the liver, in the bile,

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 having crossed another set of cell barriers, and in the cerebrospinal fluid right into the brain.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 And eventually some of them show up in the urine.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 You would think that maybe that would be contributing to psoriasis and different skin disorders too,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 because of its maybe reaching the surface capillaries. Is that possible?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 I mean, you know, it's especially theorized at least to contribute to the various things like scleroderma.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Silicone from breast implants has been connected to the generalized scleroderma,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 but even the silica particles used as food additives are suspected as activating the inflammatory skin hardening diseases.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 Once you see these different things happening in the body, it really informs you on what you eat, I think, don't you?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 Of course you do.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 I mean, it just really kind of guides you about being careful about what you put in your mouth,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 because there's just so many things.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 I'm going to have to stop you there, David. I don't mean to be rude.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. No, thank you. That was great. Thank you very much.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 We really appreciate your calls. We do have three more callers at least.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 Okay. Sorry about that.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 I'd like to get other people to get a chance here.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 Okay. Let's take the next caller.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 It's just me.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 Yes. Where are you from, caller?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 Oh, please. I'm from here in Garboville.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
 Okay. Go ahead.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 Well, one thing real quick.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Way back when we were talking about diabetes and insulin,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 you mentioned a few things that really seem to drive home the point that for pregnant women,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 the best thing you can possibly do for them is keep them unstressed.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 Like for the baby, for the future, I've got a son myself.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 He turned out pretty good, but I'm thinking a lot of that was how much focus and attention

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 there was on keeping the mother happy and unstressed.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000
 Yes. One of the essential things of stress is falling blood sugar.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 So if mama craves whatever, chocolate, peanut butter, ice cream, pickles,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 it's probably a good thing, right?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 Yes.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
 Glucose is essential for the baby's brain development.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 Many older gynecologists and obstetricians knew that diabetic women had the brightest babies.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 Even hugely fat women who had diabetes and were not in good health themselves

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 often produced extremely healthy babies.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
 You mentioned that intelligence was also higher in diabetic women

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
 because specifically because of the increased blood sugar.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 Yes, and not to dwell on that too much because that was actually a secondary point.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
 My main point was into the diabetes thing and hypoglycemia specifically.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 When I was younger, a teenager, I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia along with having really bad acne.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 Through this conversation, I realized a couple of things.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 One, it could all be tied back to the amount of unsaturated fat I may have consumed as a child.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
 If all that was blocking up my ability to even process the glucose,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 I may have had some hypoglycemic symptoms at the same time as my body is trying to

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 syst up and coagulate around every obstacle.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 Does that make sense?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
 Yes.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 A man named Adam Kiewicz about 30 or 40 years ago showed that lowering blood sugar

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 activates the inflammatory process.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 Doubling the blood sugar will stop allergies to almost everything.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 Every episode of hypoglycemia is stressing your immune system as well as activating the stress hormones

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 that compensate by turning protein into sugar.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Do you expect that was at all related to my intense craving during those years for lots of sugar like donuts and cold cola for lunch?

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Yes, that's the natural thing like in pregnancy when a woman needs sugar or premenstrually, same thing happens.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 When your blood sugar falls, you crave sugar.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 If your thyroid is just temporarily depressed by stress, eating a pound of sugar over a period of three days

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 will sometimes replenish the glycogen stores in all of your tissues including the liver

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
 where the liver uses it to activate the thyroid hormone.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 To get back to the original point, the stress then besides being an adolescent, I mean I'm now almost 35 and I've still got the acne.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 The stress then does that come from the unsaturated fat?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 That's probably the most common reason for it but many kinds of stress can bring it on.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
 But I think that's the most common cause currently.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 There's a really great book by Broda Barnes called Hypoglycemia, It's Your Liver Not Your Mind.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 He was one of the first people to point out that the liver provides three quarters of our active thyroid hormone.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 To do that, it needs glucose and without the active thyroid hormone, you tend to get hypoglycemia.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
 I assume alcohol in that factor would be a downer.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
 Yes, it interferes with the provision of glucose.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 Thank you very much, Dr. Peat.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 Thank you for your call, Caller.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 We've still got several more callers on the line.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 Let's take this next caller.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
 Caller, where are you from?

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 Who's this?

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 I'm from Vancouver, Washington.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 Oh, hi. You're on the air. Go ahead.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 I'm from Vancouver, Washington.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 Thank you. I did hear that. Go ahead with your questions.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 I have two cysts growing on each of my hormones.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 Whatever. I'm nervous.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 Go ahead. No, it's okay.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 Anyway, right now they're at 6.9 centimeters.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 I'm 79 years old and my question is, do I have them removed?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 Now, where were these cysts again?

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
 On my...

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
 Ovaries?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
 Yes, thank you.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 Go ahead, Dr. Peat.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 That's the age thing.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 No problem. So, Dr. Peat.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 I think you should have your blood hormones measured.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 The cysts could be producing a lot of estrogen.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 Have you had ultrasounds?

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 Yes, I have an ultrasound every six months.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 And are they enlarging?

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 Yes, slowly.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
 The blood test might show what's needed to break them.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 Sometimes just one dose of progesterone is all that's needed for the cyst to break

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 in the way it should during a normal menstrual cycle.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:11.000
 So, my real question is, do I do this at my age?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 I mean, is there a chance that I may not come out of it?

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 Oh, sure.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 Surgery is, if you're underweight especially and over 70, then any surgery tends, in the six months following the surgery, it increases all kinds of risk of dying.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 Well, gosh, it's a hard thing to decide to do.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:57.000
 Progesterone is a very safe compound and it's certainly far safer than surgery, so that would be a very good start.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
 Yes.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
 And progesterone should be something that would easily be prescribed by your doctor.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
 I have an appointment, so I'll certainly bring this up.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:17.000
 There are, of course, other sources of progesterone that you can purchase also, just so that the doctor, if they refuse to do that, it is always possible to go elsewhere.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
 What would I, can you get it over the counter?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
 In California here, there's several health stores.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 I mean, I think there's very many health stores, but I don't get around the country too much, but I've seen it certainly in health stores.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:45.000
 So, there's a product called Progest-E, which is a natural progesterone, and there are several other types of product that contain progesterone.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
 That would be the thing that Dr. Peat's mentioning would be useful for you.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:50:08.000
 Okay. Like I said, I'm at 6.9 centimeters, and listening to Dr. Ottis one day, he said if you get to 8, you've got to have them taken out. Is that...

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:32.000
 I've known quite a few younger women with big cysts that were causing pain, at least, and they were, with just one or two doses of progesterone, the cyst simply broke and they had no more problem.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000
 So, is that the same as twisting, if it twists itself?

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
 No. I think you're, I think it's probably getting confused with two different things.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:54.000
 Number one is a kind of natural and spontaneous dissolution or breaking down, and the other thing I think you might be confusing with twisted ovaries, but not too sure.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:05.000
 But yeah, pregnenolone is one of those things you should definitely first ask your doctor for, and if you can't get them from your doctor, you can always find them online. So, progesterone is the thing you want to try.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
 Okay. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
 You're very welcome. Thank you for your call. Okay, we still have three more callers, so let's take this next caller. Where are you from, caller?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
 I'm from Kansas City.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
 Kansas City. Hi. Okay.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:39.000
 Hi. I have a question about niacinamide. Dr. Peat, in one of your articles, you said that it can cause tumor cells to either mature or disintegrate, but it prolongs the replicative life of culture cells. Could you explain that a little bit more to me, please?

00:51:39.000 --> 00:52:01.000
 It's needed to produce energy efficiently, and it lowers stress. So, the increased energy and reduced stress simply stops the processes that tend to promote cancer.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:21.000
 But its main effect is protective for nerve cells, for example. Almost anything that injures a nerve cell is protected against by niacinamide.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
 Okay. Thank you very much. That explains it.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
 Excellent.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:47.000
 I do have another question. In one of your interviews, you said that a way of helping with extreme vaginal dryness is to use a suppository with a fairly high dose of vitamin A and a little vitamin E in a cocoa butter.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.000
 How much would be a safe high dose of vitamin A and how much E?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:53:20.000
 To make a suppository, it depends on whether you're using pure cocoa butter. With that, you can get probably a thousand milligrams of vitamin E and maybe 20,000 international units of vitamin A to dissolve in one suppository.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:28.000
 Okay. And how often should one use this?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:35.000
 The people who have told me about it did it every day.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:48.000
 Okay. If I were to take vitamin A internally to help with other issues, how much is a safe dose?

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
 To help with what?

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:10.000
 Well, with other issues. I have liver issues. I have a problem with my thyroid, I mean with my esophagus and several other problems. So vitamin A would be helpful, but how much would be a safe dose taken internally?

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:31.000
 It depends on the status of your thyroid exactly because the thyroid hormone and vitamin A are carried on the same protein in the blood. And if you take too much vitamin A, it can act as an antagonist to thyroid.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:47.000
 It acts like polyunsaturated fat in competing against the thyroid hormone and can also block the production of adrenal and ovarian steroids if you get too much.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:08.000
 But 10,000 units a day, if your thyroid is okay, people with very high thyroid activity sometimes need more like 50,000 international units of vitamin A because the increased thyroid raises your requirement for vitamin A.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000
 So it's important to adjust the dose to the thyroid function.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:25.000
 I see. I have Hashimoto's so I am actually taking thyroid hormones. So would 10,000 be too much for someone like me?

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:33.000
 Yeah, unless you're sure that your metabolic rate is up, it's good to limit it to about 10,000 units a day.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
 Okay, well thank you so much. I appreciate it.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000
 Thank you for your call. Okay, it is actually 5 to 8 now and I know we have one more caller so I'm itching to find out where they come from.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:51.000
 But if you can be really quick caller with your question and Dr. Peat, if you could sum it up in a sentence, if that's possible, that will still leave me time to give people more information about you.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.000
 So next caller, you're on the air, where are you from?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
 Hi there.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
 Yes, where are you from?

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
 Hi, my name is Mike and I'm calling from New York.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
 New York, cool. Okay, we've got four minutes or less, Mike, so be quick with your question.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000
 Okay, well good evening, Andrew and Dr. Peat. I guess my very first question would be with regard to diabetes.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:19.000
 What would you recommend, Dr. Peat, that someone with diabetes who's been, is given all this propaganda about avoiding sugar and such,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:27.000
 that you would recommend to them to get a start and that they could see benefit from and perhaps open up to trying more sugar and things like that?

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:38.000
 Well, fruit is the best way to get your sugar. Orange juice in the United States is the most reliable way to get sugar with every meal.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:50.000
 Milk is very important for several reasons as a source of protein. The high calcium has an anti-stress effect.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:02.000
 So emphasizing everyday milk, cheese, protein and some eggs and other fruits, avoiding the starchy fruits like bananas.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:24.000
 Then if you actually have a problem with high blood sugar, which if it's only like 130 milligrams per cent, that wouldn't be a reason for working on the blood sugar.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:38.000
 But supplementing brewers yeast and aspirin are things that can help to actually lower the blood sugar and a thyroid supplement sometimes will help.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:48.000
 Okay, I think we're going to have to hold it there, I'm afraid. Okay, let me just tell everybody who's listening where you can be contacted, Dr. Peat.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:58:01.000
 Thanks so much for your time and thank you callers. Okay, so Dr. Peat can be found online www.raypeat.com.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:12.000
 Plenty of scholarly articles fully referenced, quite a few different subjects, but his specialty is metabolic disorders, thyroid disorders and hormones and aging.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:22.000
 So thank you so much again, Dr. Peat. We can also be reached toll free at 1-888-WBMERB for further questions Monday through Friday.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:31.000
 And for all of those who have called in, thank you so much for making the show what's becoming a very universal show.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:38.000
 Like I said, I've had callers from England and this month we've had callers from New York, Washington, Kansas and Missouri.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:48.000
 So I think that speaks for itself. Thanks so much for listening and until next March, it's the third Friday of every month from 7 to 8 p.m.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:55.000
 The show is pretty much exclusively given over to Dr. Peat's wisdom at this point in time. Okay, thanks so much.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:01.000
