00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 Well, welcome to Ask Your Ab Doctor. Here we go again, third Friday of the month.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.280
 I was just thinking about it on the drive in and I think it's 13 years.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.040
 That's been, it's flashed by pretty quick. So I think we've been doing this for 13 years now.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.080
 And as always, we've got some interesting information that is probably not frequently

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.120
 talked about. And a lot of the science and information behind it has been buried.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.760
 And there is definitely a conspiracy that we are in the process of uncovering. So once again,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.200
 you're listening to Ask Your Ab Doctor, K. A. M. E. D. Garberville, 91.1 FM. And from 730 till

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.360
 the end of the show at eight o'clock, callers are invited to call in with any questions,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.120
 either related or unrelated to this month's continuing subject of Carla Rothenberg's,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.280
 Dr. Rothenberg's thesis on the estrogen industry and how the benefits of progesterone were suppressed

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.440
 and the cancer causing progestogens and estrogens were hidden in plain sight.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.160
 And there is certainly collusion between the pharmaceutical companies, government lobbyists,

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.800
 big pharma, obviously making a lot of money from estrogen sales and hormone replacement therapies,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.760
 and lots of evidence and research done as well as trials to show that progesterone was extremely

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.280
 safe and was actually anti-cancer. Well, guess what, folks? It's on estrogen and some of the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.240
 estriols and some of those other compounds are on the Prop 65 list now. And this month's talk,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 I wanted also to include the Prop 65 information. A lot of people in California have probably been

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.080
 made aware of it just because the increasing notifications that are on dietary supplements

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.720
 and products, food products, are coming with warnings about Prop 65 components to be found

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.400
 within that food or that dietary supplement. And a lot of it actually is very fear-mongering where

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.920
 supplement companies are doing this just to cover their backs because the legislator and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 the legislature is very much moving in this kind of draconian way, very much like a complete

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.040
 sewn-up industry, if you like, that's basically part of a kind of one-world approach to the way

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.280
 we live. Dr. Peat will be joining us and we're very pleased to have his expert knowledge. He's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.520
 actually quite a professional professor, if you like, of progesterone and estrogen and other

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.120
 hormones, having done his dissertation on reproductive biology or his graduate studies.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.840
 So we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with you. Dr. Peat, are you with us?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.640
 Yes, hi. Well, thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Peat. I know there'll be gaps in and out of

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.560
 the show this hour for the Pej drive, but I just wanted to get you to tell people about your

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.560
 professional and academic background because there are, you know, surprisingly some people

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.960
 who've never heard of you and who may have tuned in for the first time. So it's always good to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.960
 give them up to speed about what you've been doing for the last 50 years. Before I decided to study

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:26.480
 biology full-time, I was a teacher of English lit and several other subjects of painting and such,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:36.560
 but by the time I was approaching 30, I decided to get serious and study

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.040
 biology because I had been interested in it for a long time and postponed studying it because

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:55.760
 I saw that there were ulterior motives and I didn't want to start immediately fighting the

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:04.480
 system until I had figured out more about how graduate schools work and how to find my way

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:15.440
 through a four-year program. I intended to study brain biology at first, 1968, when I enrolled

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.480
 as a graduate student at the University of Oregon, and very quickly, within a few weeks,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:34.320
 I saw that my major brain biology professor was very doctrinaire and used phrases such as

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:46.560
 "we threw out the bad evidence." It seemed like really an ideological indoctrination program,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.400
 so I looked around all the different departments and found that the other end of the organism,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:00.800
 reproductive people, were actually doing observational analytical science.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.440
 So I shifted from the brain concentration to the reproductive system, and very quickly,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:20.240
 I was seeing things that were counter to the textbook doctrines about estrogen being a

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:29.280
 fertility drug, for example. My professor, years and years before, showed that estrogen

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.160
 was an abortifacient, and his professor before had been one of the earliest people showing that

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:46.080
 estrogen created abortions and miscarriages. That was discovered in the 1930s.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:57.600
 But as I started studying the metabolism of the uterus, I saw that estrogen impaired the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:07.200
 metabolic efficiency of the uterus, making it impossible for the embryo to survive if the

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.800
 tissue was dominated by estrogen rather than progesterone. It was a matter of oxygen delivery

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:25.200
 to the tissue. So by finding the right professor and people to oversee my dissertation, I got

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:33.360
 through the program without contradicting all of the medical textbook opinions.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:41.920
 Awesome. Okay. I wanted to outline a few things, and I'll try and get through. If people wanted to

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.800
 contact me at any point in time, I'd be happy to pass them a PDF version of the thesis that Dr.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.960
 Rothenberg wrote when she was refuting the estrogen industry's claims about how beneficial it was,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.080
 and exposing how dangerous it was and the skewed methodology used within the research that,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.200
 as you mentioned, was very much a cherry-picking type of situation where the good evidence,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.760
 or rather the bad evidence, wasn't promoted and only the positive things that they wanted to see

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:21.440
 came out in the papers. You've always promoted progesterone as a progestational compound,

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:27.040
 and that's very much where its name comes from. And estrogen, you've always talked about

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:37.440
 as being carcinogenic, inflammatory, promoting all those kind of weak cell states and decreased

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.720
 cell energy that would be associated with cancers or other inflammatory processes where the cell's

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.680
 structural integrity as well as its energetic level is decreased because the compound itself

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:56.000
 is an inflammatory compound. So within Dr. Rothenberg's papers, she outlined many different

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.520
 instances where data was skewed, that the science was not done properly, it certainly wasn't

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.320
 reproducible in many instances, and that was a tenet of a lot of what was happening and should

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.080
 still be happening in good science, is that it should always be reproducible, you should be able

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.760
 to give the methodology to anybody, and they should be able to reproduce the same results,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:20.800
 and that's the basis of all good science, is that it's open and transparent. So in terms of the

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:29.600
 misnomers, I think, with the gestational hormones, you're certainly an expert in that, having done

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.960
 your graduate studies on these hormones and having looked at progesterone especially as a kind of

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:43.840
 anti-aging compound. Would you say a little bit about progesterone's anti-aging effects in terms

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:50.400
 of its cell stabilizing effects or other effects that you could attribute to an anti-aging situation?

00:08:51.200 --> 00:09:00.880
 Yeah, in studying the effects of estrogen and aging on the uterus, I saw that the same changes

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:09.040
 that occurred in old animals in the uterus could be produced immediately just by overdosing them on

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:18.640
 estrogen, and my professor had previously found that a vitamin E deficiency would create the same

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:28.240
 conditions, and others had found that an excess of polyunsaturated fatty acids created very similar

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:40.800
 conditions. Vitamin E was around 1935 to 1940 was known as the fertility vitamin, and some Italian

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:50.480
 researchers in the 40s called vitamin E the progesterone protective vitamin. They saw that

00:09:50.480 --> 00:10:00.560
 both progesterone and vitamin E were preserving fertility while estrogen or polyunsaturated fats

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:10.960
 were seen to create very quick miscarriage. My professor showed that at any stage of pregnancy,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:18.320
 if you adjusted the dose of estrogen, you could create miscarriage, death of the fetus,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:27.680
 in animals very often resorption rather than expulsion of the embryo just by

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:37.120
 according to the stage of pregnancy, he would give an increased amount of estrogen and it would kill

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:43.520
 the developing embryos. And this may be quite interesting for women out there who are perhaps

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.080
 just realized they're pregnant and or who may have previously had miscarriage. I know Dr. Peat,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.800
 you are, and we've done it countless times with people, and I've seen the evidence myself.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:00.880
 For women who are in danger of miscarrying, progesterone is certainly a savior for saving

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:06.400
 a pregnancy and preventing miscarriage until such a time as the placenta can carry on supplying the

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.240
 natural progesterone that is a thousandfold background levels when you're not pregnant.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.440
 So that again, that's a complete support for progesterone as supporting gestation. And what

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:25.120
 you've mentioned about estrogen actually causing abortion should make women think an awful lot about

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.200
 estrogen replacement therapy. I know hopefully and rightfully so the whole hormone replacement

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:37.360
 therapy bandwagon has been getting a good beating because of the countless women who probably have

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.680
 caused countless women who probably gotten cancer from it, not to mention the bone weakening effects

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.120
 of estrogen. And all of these things are supposedly the exact opposite of what the industry would tell

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.680
 us about estrogen. So what do you, what have you got to say about progesterone supplementation

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.920
 during the early part of pregnancy? For example, if a woman is either high estrogen and low

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.880
 progesterone and is showing some kind of trauma symptoms, like some spotting during the early

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:12.000
 part of pregnancy, which might precipitate an abortion, sorry, miscarriage. In the 1930s and

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.840
 40s, both thyroid hormone and progesterone were recognized as the fertility protective chemicals.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:34.000
 And progesterone was widely prescribed to if a woman was starting to bleed during the early

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.040
 months of pregnancy, just a few doses of progesterone would prevent that and make the

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.800
 pregnancy turn out normal, even if it wasn't continued. Thyroid was for a long time considered

00:12:50.800 --> 00:13:00.480
 to be the main fertility chemical for both men and women. But then in the 1940s, after the

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:09.760
 estrogen industry had created the consortium and conspiracy that Karl Rothenberg wrote about,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:18.480
 the similar things were happening to the thyroid industry and the same companies that made

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:26.240
 estrogen were selling progesterone. And since progesterone countered the effects of estrogen,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:35.200
 they suppressed their own promotion of progesterone and started selling something that

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:48.160
 would be compatible with their sales of estrogen. And to suppress the importance of using progesterone,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:56.880
 I think it was 1946 or 47 that I saw the publication declared that progesterone,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:06.560
 the natural substance, is destroyed by stomach acid. And this one is mentioned in a medical

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:13.200
 journal, had no supporting reference, no explanation. They just said stomach acid is

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.240
 harsh stuff and it'll destroy progesterone. But it turns out that to make progesterone, you purify

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:28.240
 the substance, including stages in which it's boiled in concentrated acid to remove the other

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:36.240
 things. Progesterone is intensely resistant to breakdown by things in the stomach. So it works

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:42.400
 fine to take them orally. But they created the myth among doctors that you can't take it orally.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.320
 They sold a new chemical which they called a progestin.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.400
 That would...

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.520
 Sounds like progesterone but it wasn't.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:02.240
 Yeah. And in fact, it became a component to use with estrogen in the birth control pills because

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.240
 it prevents gestation.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.840
 Right. Anti-progesterone. Anti-progesterogenic.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:18.000
 Yeah. They're anti-progestational but they're categorized with approval of the FDA in the same

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.440
 category as progesterone. So that has tainted the understanding of progesterone because it's

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:36.640
 classified in the anti-progesterone class. And a similar thing happened with thyroid.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:47.520
 The synthetic products displaced the natural thyroid products and the whole thing that

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:55.120
 thyroid creates fertility by lowering estrogen and increasing progesterone.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.560
 That whole principle was suppressed and forgotten for 70 years.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:10.560
 I was going to say it's unbelievable but it's not. I get pretty hardened to these kind of

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.600
 situations where previously I would have just shook my head in disbelief and would have just

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.560
 walked off. But now, so much of it makes so much sense when you look back at the history of where

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.120
 we came from to where we are now. I think that's the thing with a lot of human life and experience.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:37.120
 Where the old tenet came out that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. And so history

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.760
 is so important. And a lot of people really don't know the background history, not just of the

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:50.320
 things like chemical research and where drugs came from, but even our own history, where we

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:57.040
 came from as a people, lays a foundation for so many things that are part of our culture or part

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:04.560
 of our awareness or just part of innate knowledge. And so it's very important for people to do

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.000
 background reading because unfortunately it's a little bit like the Chinese lie. You know,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.640
 when it's whispered to one person, the person at the end of the chain has a very different

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.000
 sentence to repeat than the person who first started the sentence. And so these small amounts

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.800
 of error increasingly compound that you find something is unrecognizable sometimes or some

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.680
 generations down the road. So what we've mentioned here briefly here that progesterone is an extremely

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:38.800
 beneficial gestational hormone has certainly been used to save a lot of women from getting abortion.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.440
 Estrogen, which we've always been brainwashed to believe is a female hormone that females need,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.840
 is actually really not very useful at all. And I've kind of gotten used to quoting what I think

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.760
 for me helps me understand estrogen. But you tell me if this is how you would describe it,

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.720
 and maybe you have other terms for it. But when I tell or consulting with women about

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.560
 whether it's pregnancy or fertility or whatever it is, and whether it's stress and inflammation,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.960
 and I come to the subject of estrogen, I tell them typically that it's only really useful

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:19.680
 for implantation because of the inflammation that's caused. But do you have any other kind

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.600
 of one sentence or one paragraph term for how you would describe estrogen?

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:33.600
 I think that's a good description. It stimulates cell division during a period of about 12 hours,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:41.680
 once a month, it surges and dominates and is concentrated in the pituitary, the breasts,

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:50.240
 and the uterus. And it prepares those for pregnancy by creating a wave of cell division.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:57.040
 But the function of progesterone is to come in at 100 times the concentration or even higher

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:05.680
 to knock out, destroy the progesterone or the estrogen binding chemical to destroy the

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.000
 influence of estrogen so that the cells stop dividing and start maturing.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.560
 Because it is totally progesterone that sustains a pregnancy. And like you said,

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:22.960
 it's 100 times or more background physiological levels that give women that glowing skin and

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:28.480
 the kind of freedom from any acne they might have had before, as well as the hair that's growing

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.720
 beautifully and it's silky and the nails and everything that's flourishing and blossoming.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.720
 And a woman, when you look at a pregnant lady and you go, wow, she looks really healthy. She

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.680
 looks beautiful. You know, that's a glow of progesterone, isn't it? Yeah. Okay. So I never

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:48.880
 even mentioned the 399-923-3911 number or the 800-KMUD-RAD number for people to call in from

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:56.160
 730 on and someone's already called in. So I think it's possibly a loyal fan, maybe. Let's just take

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.040
 this first caller call away from. Well, I'm going to kick in and say, hey, I know there's a lot of

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.160
 loyal fans out there and you want to keep Dr. Peat on the air. Our finances aren't that great. Please

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.440
 join KMUD and keep alternative views on the air because you don't hear Dr. Peat anywhere. That's

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.320
 right. Are we still rebroadcast this show, rebroadcast somewhere else? You know what,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.040
 several other stations pick it up. There's a lot of people posting it on YouTube now,

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.640
 so they'll pull it straight off the KMED website and they'll put it up on YouTube.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.520
 Well, wherever you are, support your local alternative media and support KMUD. Otherwise,

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.280
 it wouldn't be there for you to do it. Yeah. So here we are. Okay, caller you're on the airway

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:42.640
 from? London, Ontario, Canada. Uganda. Canada. Oh, Canada. I was going to say we've never had

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.720
 anyone from Africa. All right. Awesome. But Canada is quite a way away too. So go ahead.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:53.680
 What's your question? Yeah. First of all, I'd like to thank you very much for what you're doing,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.480
 especially Dr. Peat, with his wisdom. You've literally saved my life, I think. And I just

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:05.440
 wanted to ask a few questions, just quick ones here. Go ahead. I was reading his newsletter,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.560
 Heart Hormones, and in there he quotes the simplicity of things such as supplementing

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.120
 thyroid, progesterone, sugar, avoiding excess phosphate in relation to calcium,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:20.560
 and avoiding polysaturated fat makes it possible for people to take action without depending on

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.800
 the medical system. And this is exactly what I had to do when I had this heart issue. And

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.240
 I think it literally pulled me out of the problems I had. But I was trying to get some clarification

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:41.920
 about progesterone, how much to use, a good idea to put it around the heart area, or

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.480
 and I suppose that was a little bit of a tricky thing. I don't know, being a male.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.080
 Right. Yeah. How much you would use there. That's one of the only caveats. But Dr. Peat,

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:58.400
 I'll let you answer that. Did you hear the question clearly? A few words were popped out,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:06.080
 but I think I got the point. I've used progesterone myself on and off for about 40 or 45 years.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:16.560
 And I found that at times only 10 milligrams per day was enough to stop my whiskers growing

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:26.320
 temporarily and act as an antitestosterone. But other times I can take 5 or 10 milligrams and it

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:34.160
 seems to increase my testosterone and my whiskers don't slow down. And people have told me that they

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:43.760
 have a similar effect. Usually it's people over 55 or so who have the pro-androgen effect when

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:51.360
 they take 10 or 20 milligrams of progesterone. But if a person has, for example, heart failure,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:59.200
 I think it's or other fairly intense things for migraine or epilepsy, for example,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:09.760
 I've used as much as 100 or 150 milligrams in one dose for a migraine and it stopped within

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:18.960
 about a minute. And you get a very sudden effect, strengthen your heart, for example,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:25.680
 if you're having heart failure when you take a good strong dose like that. But it depends on

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:33.840
 the situation and your own hormone balance. The same way a woman would, you can take 5 milligrams,

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:42.960
 wait 15 minutes, see if you feel the desired effect, repeat it, just keep taking 5 or 10

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:50.560
 milligrams at a time until, for example, when I'm under stress, sometimes I have

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:58.960
 bulgy veins on the backs of my hands and wrists. And either a big glass of very sweet orange juice

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:08.320
 or sugar and milk or a dollop of progesterone will make the veins tone up. And I don't have

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:17.760
 any varicose veins in my feet and so on, which I was starting to get 45 years ago. But the

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:24.240
 occasional use of progesterone has made all of the visible blood vessels in my feet disappear.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:32.720
 You seem to be taking them orally. Yeah, I'm sure he's using oral form.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:38.800
 The other issue is I have high calcium and high triglycerides. Is that much of a concern?

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:49.200
 Yeah, those are produced under stress. And so keeping the intestine uninflamed, avoiding

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.920
 raw or undercooked vegetables and grains, for example, sometimes is all it takes.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:04.160
 Increasing the movement through the intestine by increasing the fiber content of your food,

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:12.880
 raw carrot or cooked bamboo shoots or cooked mushrooms, for example, can lower the stress

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:19.520
 hormones by cleaning out your intestine, preventing reabsorption of estrogen and cortisol.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:27.920
 Okay. The other question I had was water swelling,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.000
 tension and pain and fatigue. That's the article. In there you mentioned

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.400
 Obon modulates the metabolism of the heart, stimulates the sub... No, sorry, you don't

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.840
 mention that. That was somewhere else I read. But you say darkness and hypothyroidism both

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.800
 reduce the activity of cytochrome oxidase, making cells more susceptible to stress,

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:56.320
 promoter of excitotoxicity. Obon or lack of salt can function as an equivalent of darkness.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:03.360
 So I assume this Obon, which is a Strophotocratis, some kind of a herb,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.920
 which I was thinking of using, but it's not a good thing to use.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:15.120
 What was the herb? It's spelled as O-U-A-B-A-I-N.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:27.040
 U-B-A-I-N. Yeah. Oh, no, I think that's too... It's similar to digitalis, which in the right dose,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:35.840
 it can be protective, but progesterone and DHEA are the body's natural hormone equivalents, and

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:44.640
 they don't have the risk that you run if you're taking an unmonitored

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:53.120
 Wabin or digitalis. And then you said lack of salt. I have an issue with that. I have

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:59.040
 slight swelling in my feet, and I can eat salt to taste, but if I go any more than that,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:06.560
 I get my blood pressure goes up a bit. Besides, salt is just one of the things that will

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:15.520
 lower the aldosterone and that whole system that controls blood pressure. Progesterone

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:24.160
 is the body's natural antagonist to aldosterone. So progesterone and thyroid make you retain your

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:32.160
 sodium so you don't have to eat a lot of it. But vitamin D and calcium are the other

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.120
 very powerful controlling factors for keeping aldosterone down.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:45.280
 Okay, so the swelling in the feet is just basically salt not being used properly.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.360
 I didn't hear that. Yeah, I didn't hear that either.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.760
 Swelling of the feet? Yeah.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:58.640
 The salt not being used properly? Did you say the swelling of the feet is the

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.720
 salt not being used properly? Yeah.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:11.760
 If something is driving your aldosterone abnormally high, such as a deficiency of

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:22.160
 progesterone, then the combination of high aldosterone and high salt intake will increase

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:30.400
 your blood pressure. But when your thyroid and vitamin D and calcium intake are good,

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:40.320
 that will hold down your aldosterone and progesterone antagonizes the effects of aldosterone.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:46.960
 So that combination of vitamin D, calcium, thyroid and progesterone are the basic

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:56.880
 anti-aldosterone system and the blood pressure regulating system apart from sodium.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:11.040
 I have high calcium according to my tests.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:22.320
 The high calcium level in the serum is a pretty good indication in most people that you're not

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:29.920
 eating enough calcium or not having enough vitamin D, not enough sunlight. A vitamin D

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:38.400
 deficiency will very often cause your parathyroid hormone to rise to the point that it takes

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:47.680
 calcium out of your bones and increases the serum calcium. So taking a good supplement,

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:59.520
 getting your serum vitamin D level up to 50 nanograms per milliliter and taking in at least

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:07.520
 a thousand milligrams of calcium per day will generally lower your serum calcium to normal

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:15.040
 by lowering the parathyroid hormone. I was eating some eggshells and I was eating a lot of cheese

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:25.600
 and I still need to add some vitamin D then. I do talk to people in Canada that have low vitamin D.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:32.960
 I think just being that far north, you certainly get less daylight, well, less sun exposure than

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.600
 you do in more temperate regions. So vitamin D supplementation is always good to get your

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.840
 blood tested for vitamin D because you may well find you've got a low level you didn't even know

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:49.600
 about. Yeah, okay, that's pretty good. That's a good idea. Thank you so much. You're very welcome.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.560
 Thanks for tuning in. I'll put the number out there for people that are listening. Anybody

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.920
 wants to call in to ask Dr. Peat any questions about this month's subject of an ongoing situation

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:08.160
 with the promotion of estrogen at the expense of the beneficial hormone progesterone. The number

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:14.720
 here is 923 3911. That's in the 707 area code or if you're outside the area code, there's an 800

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:23.840
 number which is 1-800-568-3723 which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD. Dr. Peat, I don't know how much we're

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.000
 going to get through this, but that's usually the way. There's lots and lots that I wanted to try

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.520
 and get done, but we'll have to do this not next month, but the month after. I wanted to get into

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:40.960
 a little bit about some of the studies that were used to put progesterone on the California Prop

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:50.000
 65 list as a compound or agent known to the state of good old California to cause cancer. A funny

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:59.040
 thing about this whole Prop 65 list, there's 986 chemicals on the list as of January 2017.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:05.920
 I find the strangest part of all of it is that it only applies if the product on that list is

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:12.720
 being put in your mouth. So presumably if you're putting something on your skin that's on the Prop

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.880
 65 list, you don't actually have to worry about it either from the legislation and from the

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:25.440
 litigation. Like I said at the beginning of the show, more and more products I see on

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.880
 supplement shelves have this little sticker, you know, Prop 65 warning known to the state of

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:38.240
 California to cause cancer. It's just become like a little plague. If you look around the store

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.080
 shelves, you see bottles with all these little stickers on them and it's all because of Prop 65.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.240
 I wanted to get into Prop 65, but obviously wanted to make sure we get as many people aware

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:53.440
 of the whole estrogen conspiracy as we can, either because they're listening to the show now or they

00:32:53.440 --> 00:33:00.240
 can download this show from KMUD's website at any point after the show in the audio archive list,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:06.880
 and also people can go to YouTube and find the same shows on YouTube and/or picked up by other

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.320
 radio stations and other people who want to repeat this. So anyway, if we get callers,

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:17.680
 the number is 933-3911. If there's an 800 number you want to use, it's 1-800-KMUD-RAD.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.080
 And don't forget folks, you wouldn't be hearing this if it wasn't a free radio station perhaps.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:27.360
 I think some of the things that are brought out on this radio station, not just my program, but

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.760
 other programs are definitely alternative and we've got to live in an alternative world that

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:38.400
 has alternatives available to people, otherwise it becomes a complete dominated system where there is

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:45.440
 no choice. And I think more so than ever, the medical industry is recognizing both the power

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:54.880
 in the actuality of results as well as a financial control that natural products have.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:02.240
 It's a huge multi-billion dollar market and that's because people are just tired of being given one

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.200
 alternative, which is the chemical, which is the product that gets pulled off the shelf two or

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.280
 three years later after it's killed a lot of people. And there's just more and more and more

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.000
 chemicals being added to the list every day that we have no idea really what they're doing. They've

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.040
 not been tested properly. The fact that they've gone through clinical trials really doesn't mean

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.400
 that much because when you look at the results, and this is what we're talking about with the

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:30.560
 whole mistake of putting progesterone on the CalProp 65 list, is that the research really

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.880
 has not been done. And parts of it have been skewed and buried in favor of promoting something

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:42.480
 that drug industries are very keen to maintain the status quo of. So I wanted just to break

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.640
 out a little bit, Dr. Peat, because this is another specialism of yours, the subject of vegetable

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:57.760
 oils, that the spontaneous cancers they've shown increase in proportion to the quantity of poly

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:04.480
 unsaturated fat, especially linoleic acid in the diet. And by the end of the 60s, the carcinogenicity

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:10.400
 of vegetable oils, or at least their co-carcinogenicity or tumor promoting effects have become

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.560
 widely known. And one of the World Health Organization's own publications observed that

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:21.200
 progesterone carcinogenicity studies using vegetable oil as a carrier couldn't be recognized as valid.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:27.280
 And they were using, and they may well still do, using sesame oil, peanut oil, corn oil,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.000
 and then they turned to cyclodextrin, which had its own problems. And throughout the paper,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.960
 Carla Rothenberg points out the fact that there was this kind of tumorigenesis,

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:44.400
 injection site inflammation that was occurring because of the localized inflammatory and

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:49.680
 pro-carcinogenic effects of the vegetable oils. I know you've spoken for decades about the

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.880
 dangers of liquid oils and how thyroid suppressive they are, but obviously they obviously have

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:03.040
 another directly carcinogenic effect too. Yeah, it was around 1970 when it was finally

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:13.920
 becoming too public that linoleic acid was carcinogenic to keep promoting it as the heart

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:21.200
 protective fat because it caused heart disease as well as cancer. And that was when the fish oil

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:28.640
 industry, the Environmental Protection Agency was pressuring them to stop polluting, throwing

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:36.880
 fish fat and fish heads and fish skins in the coastal waters and nearby landfills. And

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:46.320
 the carcinogenicity of the vegetable oils was an opportunity for them to say, "Well, here's another

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:56.000
 essential fatty acid so-called that isn't linoleic acid." So that whole promotion of the

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:06.080
 fish oils as the alternative, supposedly less carcinogenic essential fatty acid grew up.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:19.920
 But around 1970 was a turning point for the essential fat mythology and for the estrogen

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:32.160
 progesterone industries. Carla Rothenberg points out some of the main phases of conspiracy. For

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:43.040
 example, in the 1940s, it was the George and Olive Smith professors at Harvard who promoted the

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:52.640
 DES use during pregnancy and created the epidemic of cervical cancer in the daughters of the women

00:37:52.640 --> 00:38:00.880
 who had it and even in the granddaughters of those women. Then the birth control industry

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:14.240
 created a new definition of the progesterone and progesterone was identified with the anti-

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:24.080
 progesterone used in contraception. And in the 1960s, the three major estrogen industries,

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:33.920
 in total, they gave $1.3 billion, which in 1960s was a lot of money to Robert Wilson and his

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:47.520
 foundation. He wrote Feminine Forever, a book really just an accumulation of lying claims that

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:55.440
 estrogen keeps you young and that menopause consists of the loss of estrogen. And in fact,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:06.640
 the first signs of menopause involves the failure to produce the surge of progesterone

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:16.080
 around the ovulation, leaving estrogen unopposed. So the onset of menopause really

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:23.520
 is the onset of estrogen dominance. Yeah. Let me hold you there for a second, Dr. Peat,

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.480
 because we do have another caller on the I want to make sure they get their

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.920
 question into you. OK, caller, you're on the end. Where are you from?

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:35.920
 Hi, you're on the way from I'm Stephen. I'm local here. OK.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:45.440
 Yeah, it's just interesting to hear. I like your guy's show. And I think it's really good to tell

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:52.880
 people about the history of how the whole birth control pills and how that became an issue.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:40:00.640
 You're covering it really well. And I hope that at some point you'll go into the what do they call

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.960
 that crypto estrogenic effects of things like fire retardants and stuff like that.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:08.480
 Yeah, we've done definitely done programs on this. You know, I mean, the pathologists.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:15.280
 Well, yeah, I can hear you. I said we've OK, we've definitely I can barely hear you. OK. Yeah,

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.400
 we've definitely covered things like this, you know, a and environmental estrogen mimics that

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:27.920
 certainly estrogen and hormone disrupting effect. OK, well, I probably all right. Well,

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.360
 I'll let you go then, because I got a bad connection. Thank you. Thank you for presenting

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:37.600
 this information. OK, you're welcome. Yeah, that's what it's all about. I'm following following the

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:46.080
 support for Robert Wilson's book. There was a huge increase in sales of progesterone,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:54.080
 such as Premarin and other not not progesterone of estrogen and premarin, especially

00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:05.680
 the number of prescriptions for estrogens between 1970 and 75 quadrupled largely because of that

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:13.440
 promotion of Robert Wilson's phony, phony claims about estrogen preserving youth and

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:26.000
 the the consequence of that tremendous surge between 1970 and 76. In those years, the

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:37.280
 incidence of metastatic breast cancer in very young women between the ages of 25 and 39

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:49.120
 began to increase steadily every year. And by the year 2009, that age group had experienced

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:58.400
 a threefold increase in metastatic breast cancer. Other things, environmental estrogens

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:07.200
 and obesity and other things probably contributed to it. But that great surge of

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:17.440
 the use of estrogen was probably the main cause. And we're still seeing the increased

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:24.240
 drastic increase of metastatic cancer in young women where it never used to occur.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:34.160
 And in the 1930s and 40s, animal experimenters were seeing that estrogen is not only carcinogenic

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:40.240
 to the uterus and breast, but the next most sensitive tissue is the lung,

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:51.840
 that the kidneys and brain and other organs are also a cause to develop tumors and then cancer.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:43:01.360
 But the lungs are the next most sensitive. And if you look at the incidence of lung cancer in men,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:10.160
 it was dropping off by the 1970s when women were starting to use more estrogen. And the

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:19.440
 female incidence of lung cancer took off at the same time breast cancer in young women took off.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:25.440
 And the curve is very similar for lung cancer and young women's metastatic breast cancer.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:35.120
 And it has continued to rise. It's rising more slowly in the last 10 years. But

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.400
 still it shows that tremendous increase in exposure to estrogen.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:47.520
 Well, that's all part of the reason for doing this show and on this subject and other subjects,

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.680
 is just to make people aware that as we've always said, you know, the truth is out there.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:57.680
 If you're just willing to open your eyes, not stare at the TV, go get your head in some research

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.560
 and start looking at it yourself, you'll soon find there's plenty of patterns out there for people to

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.840
 live a better life and avoid those things that they've been told are good for them.

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:12.800
 And to start listening to people like you who are espousing the truth from a point of altruism,

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:18.320
 you know, and just crying out from the top of the hills. Well, Dr. Peat, listen, I've got a few

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.760
 other things I want to make people aware of. And it is eight minutes to eight here. So we probably

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.640
 better wrap this show up for tonight. But I do thank you so much for your time. OK, thank you.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.400
 OK, so for people that have either called in tonight or have just listened to the show,

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:41.440
 Dr. Raymond Peat, he's been he's been working on this kind of thing for 40,

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:48.240
 40 plus years, and he certainly published a lot of reports and he's written several books.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.720
 He's written hundreds and hundreds of newsletters and they're all fully referenced.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:59.760
 And he's not he's not in the process of selling you anything. So he's very much an altruistic

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:05.360
 type researcher who, having gone through the whole process of brainwashing, if you like,

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:11.920
 from the industry that was controlled, realized that there was a lot of a lot of problems within

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:19.760
 the academic institutions to maintain the role and the job by the professor. I had to defend this or

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.120
 that and had to take a positive stance towards, you know, chemical companies, et cetera, if he

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:31.600
 was doing research or microbiology using certain chemicals. And so the whole indoctrination of

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:37.440
 education leads us to where we are now, where we are told what we're told by vested interests.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:43.280
 And so never underestimate the powers that are at work in the world, you know, not necessarily

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:49.360
 looking at your best interests. So it's always good to find out impartial third party advice and

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.880
 definitely to look at research articles yourself that will spell out clearly what's been done.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:02.080
 And you can certainly, without too much science, see the truth out there. It's not difficult. You

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:05.680
 really just have to go look for it. But anyway, that's what this program is all about, is just

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.800
 bringing some of these subjects to light so that in layman's terms, we can turn people on to what

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:17.040
 it is we're saying. And then you can go elsewhere and find more information about it. Well, I think

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:23.200
 we've probably gotten to the end of the estrogen progesterone debate, but I really wanted to bring

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:30.240
 out the whole California Prop 65 subject. It's a fairly big subject. And unfortunately, it's got a

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.440
 lot of twists and curves. And it's a big old rabbit hole with things like I said at the beginning of

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.240
 the show that they're on the Prop 65 list. But if you don't put it in your mouth, it doesn't have to

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:46.160
 be adhered to. You can find these things on the shelves and nothing has to be said about it.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.640
 But what I'm telling you now is that you will find an increasing amount of litigation

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:57.600
 as we move forward in time. And you know, the chips come down. You'll certainly start to see

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:04.560
 more and more of a push towards providing litigation services and lawsuits against companies

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:11.920
 that are putting products, whether they're natural or chemical products into a container that is to

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:19.440
 be used for food, where the compound is a Prop 65 compound. I just wanted to quickly tell you

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:28.080
 some of the Prop 65 compounds that you may or may not know on the list. Aspirin. For those of you

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:34.240
 who want to avoid the liver toxic ibuprofen, aspirin is a known anti-cancer substance,

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:41.280
 and it's very inexpensive to make. And it's not patentable. Now, ethanol in alcoholic beverages,

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.040
 for those who enjoy cold beer or glass of wine or tequila at the end of the workday,

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:51.200
 it's got many positive benefits in moderation, but it's on the Prop 65 list. Now, how about wood

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.560
 dust? It's also listed for all of you creative woodworkers out there. Then there's marijuana

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:02.320
 smoke. For those who like to partake, how about that, folks? Marijuana smoke is on the Prop 65

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:08.160
 list. Is this the smoke from burning the herb? Or probably why the industry is busily promoting

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:12.960
 vaping and oil production. It's another way to own the rights. So you lose your freedom.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.440
 And for you seafood lovers, arsenic and methylmercury is there too. And I'll discuss this,

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:25.760
 I think, in two months' time. It's probably the most relevant but untackled area of Prop 65

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:30.720
 legislation. So you see, there's something for everyone on the list. And now we're run by

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:36.160
 legislators and litigators. There's little to stop draconian enforcement. Oh, and don't say I didn't

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.120
 warn you. You get what you ask for when you give up your rights to self-determine. And we discussed

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.360
 the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, oh, some time back,

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:50.880
 as a blueprint to avoid overreaching government when America was formed. The Big Brother's coming.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.120
 And from the end of World War II and the Codex Alimentarius that was drawn up by the Rothschilds,

00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.160
 the Bilderbergers and Rockefellers, the plan was for a new world order and centralized one-world

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.280
 government, a totalitarian system. And if you think that sounds good, you should move to North Korea

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:09.760
 or China and see how you like it, rather than being complicit and ignorant of what you're

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.880
 demanding here by voting for the government to keep you safe. Well, like I said, Dr. Raymond

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.360
 Peat and all that he works for and all that he publishes is freely available on his website,

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:27.600
 www.raypeat.com. And we can also be reached toll free, Monday through Friday, nine to five,

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:35.920
 WBMERB, 1-888-WBMERB. And just to let you guys know, as a heads up, we won't be doing the show

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:42.880
 in August, but we'll be back in September. So we'll be back at the all dawning end of the summer.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.680
 And we barely just got through the middle of summer here in July the 21st, 2017. So

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:52.400
 thanks so much for listening. And we'll see you in two months. Good night.
