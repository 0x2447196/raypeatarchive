00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.440
 It was in the 1970s when I started seeing many women who had been on a fasting diet.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.560
 And something I noticed when I would suggest that they measure their inches around their

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.680
 thighs and hips and belly rather than paying so much attention to their weight.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.480
 The fat is very light compared to protein and water.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:37.440
 And so when they lose weight quickly, it's often the protein that is disappearing.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.160
 And the fat, if you're fasting for a week or 10 days, they have found that the great

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.760
 majority of the weight loss is in protein and water with hardly a dent in the fat.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.560
 Welcome to the Win At Life Podcast, a place where we share everything you need to know

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.880
 about restoring your metabolism so you can break free from restrictive diets

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.800
 and build a body and life you love.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.240
 I'm Kitty Blomfield, co-founder of NuStrength and your host for this episode.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.640
 Today, I'm sitting down with Dr. Ray Peat and my business partner and friend, Emma Sgourakis.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.600
 I found Emma and Ray Peat's work shortly after I got divorced and it changed my life completely.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.360
 Today, I'm so passionate about sharing it with other women and I'm constantly sending

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.960
 people to their articles because they're packed with such great free information.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.440
 In this podcast episode, we asked Dr. Peat a ton of questions.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.640
 We chat about PUFAs, which is polyunsaturated fats and the beginnings of the health myths

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.360
 surrounding them, PUFAs versus other fats, how PUFAs impact your metabolism, how and why your

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.880
 anti-aging creams and other products might actually be pro-aging, the effects of fasting

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.720
 on your metabolism and immunity, the importance of muscle mass, why excess estrogen increases

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 chaos in the body, why the body actually needs sugar, what causes diabetes, how and why caffeine

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.560
 can bring on a stress reaction, the protective effects of coffee and actually, in fact,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.520
 Emma started drinking coffee when she fell pregnant, a healthy range of body fat for women.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 You'll actually be surprised at what this is. HRT in the pill, what causes menopausal symptoms,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.440
 the importance of and demonization of dairy and so much more. As always, take a screenshot

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.000
 and share your biggest takeaways on Instagram stories and tag me at K-I-T-T-Y-B-L-O-M-F-I-E-L-D.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.800
 Let's spread the word and free other women from restrictive diets.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.240
 Hi, Dr. Ray Peat and everyone knows, well, actually, everyone who follows me will know

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.840
 who Dr. Ray Peat is because we talk about him all the time and reference his work.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:49.520
 So I've got two amazing people on the podcast today, Dr. Ray Peat and Emma, everyone knows Emma,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.400
 my friend and business partner in Saturée. Welcome.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.720
 Hi. Hi, Ray.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:05.760
 I just wanted to say thanks again for coming on the podcast and answering all my questions.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.160
 A lot of the women that follow me are like me and have come from a background of

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.240
 super restrictive diets and get really sucked into the diet industry. And I actually remember

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.840
 when I found your work, Ray, and then I also found Emma's. It was at the same time after I'd

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.520
 gotten divorced and I was just punishing myself eating nothing and exercising like crazy.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.760
 And then I stumbled across Emma and Ray and started working with Emma and it really

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.160
 changed my life completely. And I'm really so, so grateful and super passionate about, you know,

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.000
 sharing it with other people. You just have such a wealth of knowledge. And I always say to people,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.240
 go to his website, go and read his articles. There's so much great stuff there just for free

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.800
 that you can utilize yourself. So Emma and I have written out a list of questions that our

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.440
 clients, I should say my clients typically have. So I guess I'll just perhaps read through the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.200
 questions and then Ray, you can answer them and Emma can jump in when she wants to. So

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.280
 the first one is around polyunsaturated fat. So regarding polyunsaturated fatty acids, oils,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.200
 PUFAs, as we refer to them, and their instability when exposed to heat by an oxygen that you've

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.000
 educated about for decades in the nutrition realm. How would you explain to someone new to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.680
 this concern about PUFAs, the issues of applying them topically on the skin, and therefore how

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.960
 skincare products loaded with these oils should be reconsidered? Because Emma often talks about,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.840
 and we talk about, you know, not eating them. But I guess one thing also too, that I did for

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.800
 a very long time was use a lot of really crappy moisturizers and things and just rub them on my

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:54.240
 skin. So I'll just let you start with that question. The PUFA question has been scientifically

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:08.400
 manipulated since about 1940. At that time, coconut oil was very popular as a better substitute of

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:18.800
 cooking oil. People were doing very well with lots of prepared foods containing coconut oil. But

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:31.360
 about 1950, the petroleum chemists discovered how to make paint and plastics out of petroleum.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:43.920
 And the seed oils such as cottonseed oil, and soy oil in particular, had been used primarily

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.920
 for making paints and plastics because they oxidize so easily. They solidify.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:04.240
 And when the petroleum industry displaced the seed oils from the paint industry,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:16.960
 the growers of soybeans and other highly unsaturated oil seeds had to find a new market.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.320
 One market was feeding them to pigs. They found that they fattened the pigs tremendously.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.920
 They didn't eat so many calories, but they put on fat much more economically. And despite

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:44.080
 knowing what they did to pigs, they wanted to expand their sales. And so they resurrected

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:54.560
 an old, discredited study claiming that the polyunsaturated fats are nutritionally essential.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:06.800
 The claims said maybe less than a gram a day might be required, but the scientific basis for

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:16.480
 even that amount was discredited already in the 1940s. So on the basis of publicity rather than

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:26.720
 science, in the 1950s people were taught that eating these polyunsaturated fats would lower

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:34.240
 their cholesterol, prevent heart disease, and many other things, neglecting the fact that they were

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:44.320
 proven to be great for the pig industry to fatten pigs economically, that they do exactly the same

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:54.160
 thing to people. They stimulate the laying down of fat. And in the process, the same thing that

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:02.160
 happens when they make paint or plastics out of the seed oils, that happens in the body. They

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:11.760
 oxidize as soon as you warm them in the presence of oxygen. They instantly begin degrading,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:21.040
 turning into solid materials if the concentration is high. Otherwise, just breaking down into toxic

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:29.440
 fragments, besides stimulating fat production, they taint the fat so that in the future,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:39.680
 as you draw out these fats to metabolize, they are more poisonous than when they went in.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:49.520
 An experiment anyone can do to see what happens even at room temperature to a bottle of

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:56.960
 soy oil, for example, if you connect a rubber tube to the top of a bottle of oil

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:05.920
 and put the other end of the tube in a cup of water. After a few hours, you'll see the water

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:15.600
 rising in the tube because the bottle of oil is consuming oxygen as fast as if there was

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:24.080
 a little animal in the bottle burning the oxygen. Just spontaneously at room temperature,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:34.240
 the oils are beginning to harden and breaking down consuming oxygen. And if you imagine raising

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:41.840
 the temperature from room temperature to body temperature, 98.6 degrees, that process happens

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:55.520
 even faster. And on the skin, these oils, as unstable as they are, are exposed to air pressure

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:05.760
 oxygen, very high concentration of oxygen, making them break down even faster. And if the cosmetic

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:14.400
 product that you're putting on your skin happens to contain traces of iron or other metals,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:22.880
 that will catalyze a faster breakdown and conversion to toxic materials.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:32.480
 And besides producing the toxic carcinogenic irritants on the surface of your skin,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:44.720
 the skin has a barrier function so that when we're immersed in water, we don't get water

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:53.280
 logged very fast. It's like we have a sort of a rubber suit that is a barrier against the water.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:05.360
 But this is build up of the dying skin cells. Several layers of compacted,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:15.440
 keratinized skin cells are impregnated with oil sebum formed by our skin oil glands.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:24.800
 So it's the same idea as putting grease on your boots to keep the water out. But the grease

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:32.080
 goes right in, right through the leather. And our skin being impregnated with oil

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:40.640
 easily takes up anything oil soluble. So what you put on your skin, some of it is going to very

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:47.520
 quickly, if it's an oily material, it's very quickly going to show up in your bloodstream.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.520
 And by the time it gets there, these polyunsaturated oils are going to be

00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:01.760
 broken down. And to different degrees, toxic, your immune system, blood vessels,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:11.920
 every tissue is slightly poisoned by them. And Ray, just sorry, just to cut in there for the

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.960
 new listeners, because we get a lot of women who start to follow us and they're not so familiar

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.960
 with the different types of fat. Could you please just list out examples of the fats that

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:30.960
 you're talking about these polyunsaturated fats? A safflower seed oil, cotton seed oil, which was a

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:43.440
 staple for many years. Soybean oil, canola, sesame oil is fairly high in them. Olive oil

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:53.360
 is relatively safe because it's only 8 to 12% of the toxic oils and it contains antioxidants.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:03.920
 Coconut oil has only 3% of the toxic oils. And so as much safer, butter is about 3%

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:14.320
 of the toxic oils. But butter, some of these toxic PUFAs, the small percentage in butter,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:23.040
 some of them have been converted to trans fatty acids. And the trans fats, which are formed

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:36.080
 by the cow's rumen bacteria, these happen to be especially protective against the polyunsaturated

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:46.240
 fats. So the trans fats that occur naturally in butter are protective, where the artificially

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:55.440
 produced trans fats are chemically different and they are in themselves harmful. But butter,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:04.960
 despite having 3%, has so many protective factors that it's probably the safest of all

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:14.720
 oils to consume. And Ray, what about, could you talk about fish oil and krill oil? Because

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.160
 that's something that prior to finding you and Emma, I used to take a heap of, I remember I competed

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.800
 in some fitness competitions and at one point my coach had me taking eight tablets per day.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.640
 And a lot of women come to us and they're taking these fish oils. Can you please talk about those?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.720
 Yeah, organisms that live in the cold climate

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:48.560
 can't produce saturated fats because saturated fats are solid at room temperature or even the

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:58.880
 semi monounsaturated solidify at cold ocean temperatures. So especially in the

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:10.240
 cold northern or southern hemisphere oceans, the organisms, starting with algae, produce

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:18.560
 highly unsaturated fats that remain liquid at right close to freezing temperature where the

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:29.120
 algaes thrive. And the fish eat the krill and plankton and things that consume the algae

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:40.000
 produced fats. And so the fish load up on the extremely highly unsaturated fats that are stable

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:51.440
 at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or at close to zero degrees Celsius. And in the cold environment,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.360
 their body temperature is so low, these highly unsaturated fats don't break down

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:06.720
 terribly fast. Fish farmers have experimented and found that if you're growing salmon

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:18.640
 in an artificial environment and feeding them fish oil and then measure their physical endurance,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:28.080
 how fast and how far they can swim, and then you change their diet and it gives them a more

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:39.600
 saturated fat as saturated as possible for their living temperature, just enough so that it stays

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:48.720
 liquid. But a more saturated animal type fat improves even the physical endurance of salmon.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:55.760
 So fish oil isn't so great even for fish, except when they're at an extremely low temperature.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:10.960
 And the fish oils have many fatty acids with four and five double bonds, where seed oils grown

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:21.760
 in a cold climate, for example, like soybeans, will be very rich in a three double bond molecule,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:31.520
 linolenic acid or a two double bond molecule, linoleic acid. But in proportion to the number

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:43.360
 of double bonds a molecule contains, it is more unstable at a higher oxygen exposure.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:53.440
 So the four and five double bonds mean that they're extremely susceptible to immediate

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.720
 rancidity or oxidation. By the time they reach the bloodstream,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.560
 they are already oxidizing and becoming immunosuppressive.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.160
 The

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:24.640
 krill oil is just a small version that the animals have assimilated the

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:32.480
 algas polyunsaturated fats and pass it along to the bigger fish, but it's essentially the

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:43.200
 extremely mostly four and four and five double bonds in each molecule. And a great series of

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:53.120
 studies in France looked at the effect on the thyroid hormone. They had noticed that the

00:18:53.120 --> 00:19:00.240
 metabolic rate slowed down in proportion to how much unsaturated fat a person was eating.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:10.000
 So they not only are easily stored in our fat, but they slow our ability to oxidize

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.640
 and get rid of fat. And the French were wondering what the mechanisms are that cause

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:28.000
 our metabolic rate to slow down in proportion to how much fish oil or seed oil is present.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:36.400
 And they found that the enzymes that produce the thyroid hormone in the thyroid gland

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:46.400
 are blocked in proportion to how many double bonds are in the fatty acids that they're exposed to.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:58.240
 And then once the hormone gets into the bloodstream, the protein that carries thyroid hormone

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:08.080
 throughout the body is inhibited from carrying and delivering the thyroid hormone in proportion

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:17.760
 to the number of double bonds. And once some of it gets delivered to these cells where it's going to

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:26.960
 be active, if the cells contain polyunsaturated fats, their response ability to respond to the

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:34.720
 thyroid hormone is blocked exactly in proportion to the number of double bonds in the molecule.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:44.720
 And so with olive oil, which has a great high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acid,

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:54.720
 that has only a mild effect on blocking the cell response, the transport and the formation

00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:05.680
 of the thyroid hormone. But linoleic acid, a major PUFA of seed oils, it has twice the blocking

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:14.400
 effect as the monounsaturated. Linolenic three times the effect, fish oil four to five times

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:24.880
 the anti thyroid effect. And that's only looking at one hormonal system. When you look at the

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:34.720
 enzymes involved in making progesterone, for example, the enzymes are blocked in proportion

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:44.960
 to the number of double bonds. The carotene molecule happens to have an extremely high

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:53.520
 number of double bonds, and it will block both your thyroid hormone and your progesterone

00:21:53.520 --> 00:22:01.040
 production. So that if you eat too much carotene, it has an effect similar to the

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:11.840
 PUFA in accumulating in the corpus luteum of the ovary to the point that the corpus luteum becomes

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:20.080
 a red body and no longer can produce progesterone. But the PUFA themselves

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:36.480
 have that same steroid blocking effect. And Ray, could you also, sorry, I know

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.040
 these questions weren't what we sent you, but just as you're talking, I'm thinking about

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:48.800
 other things that our clients ask us about. What about grain fed, soy fed, corn fed

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:57.360
 animals versus, sorry, versus pasture raised animals? Could you talk about that?

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:10.240
 Yeah, the reason cows can make their protective saturated fats, they turn the PUFA,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:22.880
 which is a very high component of the fats in grass and hay and even cereals. The rumen bacteria

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:33.760
 are able to saturate, hydrogenate the naturally occurring PUFA in grass. But the grass,

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:42.320
 living fresh grass, also contains a large amount of vitamin E in proportion to the PUFA,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:50.480
 which our grains have concentrated the PUFA, but don't have much vitamin E in proportion.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:24:00.080
 So the cows that eat fresh grass have a lot of vitamin E in their rumen, and they're able to

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:12.000
 destroy 98% of the PUFA occurring in the grass, roughly, leaving about 2% for the

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:25.120
 residual toxic PUFA and some trans fatty acids that are intermediate between PUFA and saturated fats.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:37.520
 The grass also naturally contains other nutrients, but the main thing is that the high vitamin E

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:45.680
 content is necessary for the cow to destroy the PUFA, the great majority of the PUFA.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:52.720
 Great, thank you. Emma, did you have any more questions you wanted to ask around the PUFAs

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:59.360
 and the skin? Yeah, it really comes to that conclusion, doesn't it, Kitty, as to why

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:05.520
 we're doing what we're doing. With everything considered that you just talked about, Ray,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:14.800
 in regards to PUFAs and their potential toxicity, and when we consider that some of the main pillars

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:25.200
 of that wellness industry, anti-aging kind of push, and you look at the PUFA-laden skincare products,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.320
 the fish oils, eat more salmon, drink your carrot juice, talking about carotene,

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:38.720
 it should be a reminder to everyone to question everything that they're being sold, and that

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.160
 marketing is a powerful thing, but it's not necessarily based on any fact whatsoever.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.720
 It just makes you realize that these things that are sold as being potentially anti-aging are perhaps

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:59.440
 pro-aging. Yeah, some of the dermatologists, 40 years ago, were studying exactly that question,

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:08.080
 and in one experiment, they shaved rabbits so their skin was exposed to sunlight,

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:18.880
 and one group of rabbits got a diet high in polyunsaturated fats, the other only saturated fats,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:29.440
 and the skin exposed to ultraviolet light with the presence of PUFA wrinkled and aged very quickly.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:40.480
 On the saturated fat rabbits, the skin was very resistant to burning and aging. That's because

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:53.120
 multiple double bonds act as an antenna reacting to ultraviolet light, and in your skin,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:04.240
 when you've eaten something rich in PUFA, your skin becomes hypersensitive to

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.920
 being excited, turned into free radicals, and oxidized by ultraviolet light.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:21.600
 In the absence of PUFA, your skin naturally contains several substances

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:29.840
 that are sensitive and destroyed by ultraviolet light. For example, riboflavin vitamin B2

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:38.640
 is easily destroyed by either blue or ultraviolet light, but ordinarily,

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:50.240
 the surroundings don't amplify that. Occasionally, a vitamin B2 molecule will break down and become

00:27:50.240 --> 00:28:00.560
 toxic when exposed to light, but when you have PUFA in your skin as well, anything that has

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:11.040
 become excited and damaged by ultraviolet light, such as vitamin B2, then spreads its excitation

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:18.480
 to other sensitive molecules in the environment, and the PUFA acts as an amplifier

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:26.560
 or a spreader of the free radical breakdown oxidizing process.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:40.880
 That stimulates the production of prostaglandins and a whole cascade of other inflammatory materials.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.480
 Yeah, incredible.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.800
 Did you have anything else, Emma, that you wanted to ask around that?

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.040
 I could go on for three hours.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:29:01.200
 I think if that's not enough to make people question the ingredients or what they have

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.680
 been applying to their skin or ingesting, obviously, it's a very important topic,

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.200
 isn't it, for everyone to understand and why we harp on about it so much.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:18.240
 As Ray pointed out, some of the polyunsaturated oils look out for the ones that

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.960
 can sit at room temperature or below and remain liquid. You've got to question that.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.120
 It tends to be those more old-fashioned fats that remain rather solid at room temperature,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:35.920
 the ones your grandmother probably had sitting on a bench. The drippings, the butter, the coconut oil,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.760
 these make a lot more sense.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:44.640
 Something that people my age probably remember, but I think you're too young

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:53.440
 to remember the lard. They used to sell lard in blocks and it was solid at room temperature.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.440
 A pound of it would be a rectangular block that kept its shape.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:08.880
 Now, if they sell lard, it has to be in a tub because it's semi-liquid at room temperature.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:17.760
 When I was a kid, they were still feeding the pigs a better diet and their fat

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:26.800
 reflects very closely. Like chickens and pigs and other non-ruminant animals, what they eat

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:37.440
 shows up very closely in their fat composition. For many years, even the government sources were

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:48.000
 calling lard a saturated fat. Then an analysis about five years ago found that it was more than

00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:00.480
 30% PUFA, extremely toxic with fat. Someone recently decided to try making safer pork,

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:12.960
 that they have a pork farm. By changing the diet, feeding them residue from, I think, a beer factory

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:24.000
 and produce from their farms rather than a soy and corn-based diet, that they had the pork fat

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:37.040
 analyzed and rather than being 30-some percent PUFA, theirs was slightly higher than butter,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:46.640
 4% a fraction over 4% PUFA. Their pork would be extremely safe to eat because of the

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.880
 closeness to our natural high-body temperature stable fats.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:32:04.080
 Even more of a grass-fed tallow would be a better choice unless you're able to access

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:10.560
 a high-quality lard. I remember when I first started working with Emma and you would always

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:16.160
 talk about what your grandparents used to eat. It made me think back to my grandma, who's dead now.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.640
 When we would go to her house, we'd have eggs cooked in butter. She'd actually squeeze oranges

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:30.480
 and drain the pulp out for us and cut up fresh fruit from her garden. She made heaps of ice cream

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.800
 and custard. She made the best custard. She cooked with lard and she made a lot of

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:40.560
 roasts and steak and kidney pie and kidneys on toast, lots of organ meats to my granddad,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:52.240
 which at the time I didn't like it much. She really did eat this way, homemade cakes and biscuits with

00:32:52.240 --> 00:33:00.160
 butter and flour and sugar. Then as she got older, I just remember someone diagnosed her

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.640
 with lactose intolerance and she started drinking almond milk and soy milk and really moved away

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:12.560
 from that diet that we used to eat when we were kids, which is so crazy. It's such a shame.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:23.040
 You've been doing so well. I know. It's just delicious food. I think about mum too. We

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.600
 ate butter for a long time and then I remember when she started switching us all over to margarine

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:36.000
 and we used to have Nuttelex and it just tastes yucky compared to beautiful yummy butter. It's

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.360
 another example, isn't it? How industry, the financial interests and how powerful marketing

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:49.520
 is that it convinced an entire generation that something manufactured in a factory could be

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.280
 superior to something as beautiful as butter. It worked, didn't it?

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:05.840
 Yeah, I know. The same thing has happened with eggs. In the 1930s, eggs contained a lot of

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:15.680
 cholesterol and very little PUFA, but every 10 years or so, measurements have shown that the

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:26.400
 cholesterol content of eggs has been decreasing so that they, at one time, were a high cholesterol

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:34.960
 food and safe because of the low PUFA content. Now they're an extremely high PUFA food with

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:45.520
 just sort of a survival minimum of cholesterol decreasing every decade for 70 or 80 years.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.400
 So if Ray someone wanted to eat eggs, what should they look for?

00:34:50.400 --> 00:35:01.520
 If you can find them from some farm with independent ideas like the pork farmer,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:13.760
 if they feed table scraps more saturated foods and let the chickens graze and find bugs

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:24.480
 and vary their diet, but basically feeding them more like a human food diet, the eggs taste better.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:35.600
 Actually, I've noticed that the taste deteriorates when they brag about the high PUFA content.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:45.200
 The saturated fats make them actually taste better as well as having more of the valuable nutrients.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:51.200
 It's also nice for the chickens. You see those terrible cage farms where they're all shoved

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:57.360
 into those tiny little cages and they never get to see light. I think it's just like animal cruelty

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:04.560
 as well. It's so awful for the animals. Absolutely. Do you have any more questions

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:10.000
 on PUFAs Emma? Emma's been working away on the skin care it's taken her a year and a half.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.360
 Because she's just been trying to get something that's, yeah.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:24.000
 Oh, just trying to yeah, but it's something and as will probably come to find as we get it out there

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.760
 hopefully and help to educate people on these things. I'm sure there'll be a level of backlash

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:37.040
 in industry because it rattles what so many products are based on, but it's the fact that

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:44.160
 we couldn't find much available that was 100% saturated. There's a need for it. Certainly not

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:51.920
 an easy task to take on though, wasn't it? Extremely necessary, but yeah, probably that's terrific

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:57.920
 on that information. And if you want to jump into your other questions on diet related topics.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:06.400
 Okay, great. Okay. So the first one is around a lot of the restrictive fad diets. So fasting,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:12.000
 keto, low carbs, I did all of them for many years and literally starved my body

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.560
 because I was so focused and I wanted to lose weight and I wanted to be skinny and I wanted

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.520
 to be lean. And I just thought that, you know, this was the best way to do it. And obviously

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:26.400
 I achieved that, but it was very hard to sustain. And I ended up with all of these issues, like

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.880
 regular and painful periods out of miscarriage and poor sleep and digestive issues and constipation.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:39.520
 So Ray, you know, so many of the women that come to us and that listen to this podcast have cycled

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:44.720
 through one or more of these restrictive diets to try and lose weight. Can you please talk about

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:51.520
 the effect that they have on the female body, on thyroid, on hormones? You know,

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:55.760
 because I think women just don't realize what these diets are doing to their body.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:06.160
 It was in the 1970s when I started seeing many women who had been on a fasting diet

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:16.240
 and something I noticed when I would suggest that they measure their inches around their

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.840
 thighs and hips and belly, rather than paying so much attention to their weight.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:34.000
 The fat is very light compared to protein and water. And so when they lose weight

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:45.360
 quickly, it's often the protein that is disappearing. And the fat, if you're fasting for

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:56.080
 a week or 10 days, they have found that the great majority of the weight loss is in protein and

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:06.480
 water with hardly a dent in the fat. But if you eat a diet that's fairly balanced, but low in calories,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:15.600
 you can lose moderately little protein, but a lot of fat. And I was seeing women

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:26.320
 when they would look for the changes in diameter of their thighs and calves and hips,

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:34.480
 they would ask them to contract their calf muscles and nothing would happen.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:49.040
 They had atrophied, the calf muscle should be very big approaching the size of a cantaloupe

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:57.200
 in a big person, big, big, plump muscle. But these dieters had no visible muscle at all,

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:09.680
 just at little strands embedded in a sort of shapeless cylindrical mass of fat. And that's

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:20.240
 because they had been repeatedly on a near fasting diet. They've been destroying their good

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:30.720
 metabolizing tissue. A study was done on these women who were claiming that they gained weight,

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:42.480
 even on a reducing diet of 1200 calories a day, or even less. In the experiment, they put them in a

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:51.280
 locked hospital ward where they knew they couldn't be sneaking food and found that even on 800

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:58.640
 calories a day, some of them could still gain weight because the muscles which normally consume

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:06.880
 a big part of our calories, the muscles had simply atrophied to almost nothing.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:17.360
 So the first thing to worry about is getting enough protein to rebuild your muscles. But

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:32.320
 on the second day of a fast, from 12 to 24 hours of a complete fasting, the reason the protein loss

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:39.680
 begins is that as soon as your blood sugar falls from fasting and burning up your

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:48.960
 stored glycogen, immediately your thyroid function falls. The conversion of

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:58.080
 thyroxine to the active hormone, T3, falls almost to zero. And if you're under stress,

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:07.120
 that can happen even between meals. Falling blood sugar, if you don't have stored glycogen,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:15.680
 will immediately knock your metabolism down so that you're living on maybe 700 calories a day

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:27.200
 for the normal person should be burning 1700 calories a day at rest. So the thyroid hormone

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:38.080
 precedes, when your thyroid slows down, the function of that is so that your muscles won't

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:48.480
 eat up your proteins, converting the proteins to sugar for energy. If you didn't knock your thyroid

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:59.680
 down, pretty soon your heart and lungs and brain would get depleted of a protein and fail to

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:08.960
 function. So the cooling your metabolism is sort of like going in the hibernation. When food is

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:18.080
 scarce in the winter, a bear drops its body temperature, slows its metabolism, and can get

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:32.720
 through the winter without eating. So the falling T3 activity is defensive in that sense. But it's

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:40.800
 glucose that is needed in a fair abundance to convert thyroxine to the active hormone.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:50.960
 And when that is happening, then you can assimilate protein as protein thyroid is actually our basic

00:43:50.960 --> 00:44:02.080
 anabolic hormone, it builds muscle. And in its absence, atrophy sets in sarcopenia,

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:14.800
 loss of the muscles and immune tissue fails. The thymus is eaten up and converted to sugar

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:24.080
 at a very early stage of fasting. So you're not only destroying your ability to

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:32.320
 function and burn calories, but you're making yourself susceptible to all sorts of sickness by

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:46.720
 damaging the immune system. And once you get your anabolic T3 restored, then the protein in your diet

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:54.240
 will be assimilated for restoring your thymus and rebuilding your muscles.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:04.000
 So Ray, would you, I guess from that, Ben, you know, you're talking about muscle is good,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.640
 it's good to have more muscle or try and maintain that muscle mass.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:20.160
 Yeah, the basic thing that happens with aging frailty is the progressive cumulative loss of

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:29.840
 muscle mass. Muscle is not just burning calories, but it is, among other things, it's an endocrine

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:40.160
 organ. When it's functioning well, it is actually producing androgen-like steroids.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:47.360
 When it's under stress, it's emitting cortisol, making the problem worse by breaking down

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:57.200
 proteins by shifting the ratio towards cortisol away from the anabolic androgenic hormones.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:05.440
 So would you, because another thing that women do, and I was the same, is I would just do heaps of

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.920
 cardio because I was like, oh, I've got to do cardio for fat loss. And I would go into the,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.160
 I'd get up in the morning and have my black coffee and I'd go and train fast and I'd do an

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:21.680
 hour of HIIT training, and then I'd do an hour of weight training with no food. Would you recommend

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.600
 that women do some strength training versus, you know, running for hours and hours?

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:34.000
 Yeah, because in one experiment, people were put on a treadmill at a very moderate,

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:48.320
 fast walking, not even a run, so they didn't raise their pulse rate above 119 or 120 beats per minute.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:58.400
 That's barely a borderline aerobic activity, but after just one hour of that kind of

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:07.440
 moderate walking, they found that the T3 level had already dropped close to zero.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:20.480
 But if the person had a generally good health after a few hours rest, their T3 would come back

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:30.720
 because they could get their glucose up and their cortisol down. But it doesn't take very much of the

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:39.040
 aerobic type exercise to start the metabolic collapse of losing your active thyroid hormone,

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:49.440
 turning on the catabolic steroids, cortisol. So would you say then, you know, because I do

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:53.760
 strength training and I also like to get out in the sun and I walk my dog Winston every day, so

00:47:53.760 --> 00:48:00.480
 would you, like low intensity cardio is okay, like walking and bike riding and, you know,

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:06.560
 like how would you measure that? Like, I mean, one thing I try and do is if I'm just breathing

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:13.120
 through my nose, you know, if I started to run, obviously, I would. Yeah, you should be able to

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:21.280
 keep breathing through your nose. You don't want to get out of breath. And so your nose breathing

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:30.640
 should be adequate if you're exercising too hard and you should recover. Your breathing and heart

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:38.000
 rate should in just about three minutes, they should come back to your resting rate.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:46.400
 And Ray, what about this is just in line with the restrictive diet. So another really popular one

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:52.800
 for women is keto. And sometimes I'll get women saying or people just saying, yeah, but you know,

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:59.280
 you don't need carbohydrates. Your body can make energy without them. So that means that they're

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:09.280
 not necessary. Can you just talk about keto and comment on that? Oh, sure. The way your body makes

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:20.800
 carbohydrate is by destroying protein. And the things we were just talking about lowering your

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:34.480
 T3 is one of the things setting you up for a catabolic reaction. As soon as your body needs

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:44.800
 more glucose than you're eating, it turns on the hormones, especially cortisol use in breaking

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:55.760
 down protein. And so your body can't tell whether it should break down the protein you just ate

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:06.240
 or the protein in your muscles and thymus gland. And one of the consequences of shifting

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:16.240
 away from a steady abundance of glucose from your diet and short glycogen,

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:24.080
 once you shift over to the cortisol breakdown of protein to turn it into

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:36.560
 carbohydrate, that is knocking down your thyroid function. And the thyroid, besides being

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:47.200
 anabolic to your protein and immune system, restorative, it's also an essential thing

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:54.480
 to regulate many systems, including the retention of salt and magnesium.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:02.720
 And something that surprised some of the keto researchers on the ketogenic diet,

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:12.480
 they found that aldosterone, the salt regulating hormone was increased on the ketogenic diet.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:23.520
 And at the same time, the cortisol was increased. The function of aldosterone

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:34.160
 it serves to maintain a good blood pressure. It's normally produced by anything that creates

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:43.840
 inflammation and tends to go up with high blood pressure caused by inflammatory signals.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:56.480
 But the aldosterone itself is perceived by the body like cortisol as a sign of dangerous stress.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:10.400
 And the aldosterone increase inhibits the ability of your cells to use oxygen for energy production.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:21.280
 And it activates the production of parathyroid hormone, which has that anti metabolic

00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:29.760
 shifting parathyroid hormone shifts you from oxidative energy production to glycolysis,

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:38.880
 the wasteful conversion of glucose to lactic acid. And so that's another

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:47.040
 drain on the glucose, but especially a suppression of your whole energy system.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:58.240
 One of the good things about weight lifting exercise is that when you're constructively

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:08.000
 building the muscle, you support the muscles ability to produce androgens rather than cortisol.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.960
 So you're taking care of the cortisol excess problem when you're doing the

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:19.600
 gentle safe muscle building exercises.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:25.760
 Awesome. Emma, did you have any other questions you want to ask around the diets?

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:32.880
 Yeah, well, I think just, you know, keeping in mind that picture of a woman who's constantly

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:38.480
 going through and putting herself through restrictive diets, chronically under eating,

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.200
 perhaps doing more cardio and seeing the muscle wasting as opposed to muscle building and that

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:50.640
 constant stress. How then does something like estrogen then throw things even worse when you

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:56.640
 consider, you know, estrogen accumulation with aging, perhaps having been on the pill for many

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:04.000
 years, perhaps going on HRT post-menopause. How then does estrogen just further create,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.640
 you know, increasing chaos in that woman's body?

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:18.480
 Yeah, in the 1930s, around the time that just before the polyunsaturated fats were discovered

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:28.480
 to be very toxic, estrogen was considered a toxic inflammation, promoting hormone.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:37.520
 And it was only a huge propaganda campaign by the estrogen industry that created the idea that it's

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:51.760
 the female hormone. Males, old men who were under stress, or younger men who had either a traumatic

00:54:51.760 --> 00:55:02.240
 accident or is very sick, men's estrogen will rival the peak estrogen production of young women.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:10.880
 So it's absolutely not a female hormone, it's just a stress-related or traumatic

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:23.120
 response hormone. It helps to renew self-production, which seems to be why it's associated with a

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:34.160
 traumatic injury. It has the effect of creating new cells. And in uterus, that's what it does. It

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:43.920
 causes uterine growth and preparation of a rapid multiplication of the lining of the uterus

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:56.160
 in preparation to receive the implanted embryo. But that function is wound-related in effect.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:03.600
 It creates a small injury reaction in the uterus to multiply cells,

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:10.640
 preparing it for the later action of progesterone to mature the cells. And

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:30.480
 it was very early recognized to be interacting, causing the toxic effects of polyunsaturated

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:40.400
 fats to increase. And all of the effects of polyunsaturated fats were seen to be

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:53.840
 amplified by estrogen and vice versa. Estrogen and polyunsaturated fats were both protected against

00:56:53.840 --> 00:57:01.840
 by vitamin E. So vitamin E was thought of as an anti-estrogen drug, as well as protecting

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:10.960
 against age pigment formation. That was one of the early toxic effects of PUFA, was it increased

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:21.920
 age pigment formation exactly the way estrogen does. And so the combination of estrogen with

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:30.960
 PUFA gave you a maximum rate of that age pigment accumulation, which happens in the brain

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:41.280
 all of the organs, as well as on the skin. And vitamin E was found to be anti-estrogenic

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:50.480
 and anti-age pigment formation. It will even help to remove the pigment once it is developed.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:58:03.840
 But more recent research has found out one of the other interactions between highly unsaturated

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:13.520
 PUFA, such as in fish oils, and the effect of estrogen, very similar to the way they interact

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:23.920
 with preventing the transport of thyroid hormone through the bloodstream. They act on the proteins

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:34.560
 that transport estrogen through the bloodstream, loosening, preventing the binding by the transport

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:43.440
 protein, liberating the estrogen in proportion to how much of the highly unsaturated PUFA you're

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:53.520
 exposed to, liberating the estrogen to go into cells and produce its estrogen effects.

00:58:54.640 --> 00:59:04.640
 So several different levels are known in which PUFA and estrogen interact to interfere with

00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:16.960
 oxidative metabolism to disturb just about every differentiated maturing function of the organism.

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:29.520
 X-rays ionizing radiation, for example, synergizes both with polyunsaturated fats,

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:36.160
 which are sensitive to any high energy radiation, and synergizes with estrogen effects.

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:45.040
 And all of those effects are protected against by both vitamin E and progesterone.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:54.400
 Yeah, thank you. I guess it goes to show as a reminder for women who've gotten to a certain

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.160
 place, and they're not feeling good about themselves or their bodies, and if they can look back,

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:05.760
 and I suppose acknowledge they've been chronically under eating, you know, for decades, perhaps,

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:12.720
 they've probably been on the pill, perhaps exercising in a strenuous, you know, highly

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.880
 stressful way, not to be so hard on yourself, because all of these things collide in, you know,

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:24.000
 create the situation they're now in, but to, yeah, work towards making the appropriate changes

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.480
 as Kitty, you know, teaches. I think give it time, you know, you can't undo 20 years in 12 weeks.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:40.400
 No, never. Yeah, I wish. We all want it to go faster. Do you have any more questions, Emma,

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.120
 before I move on to the next question? No, this is great. Yeah. Okay, great. Ray, could you please

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:51.600
 talk about sugar, and why we need it and why the health and fitness industry has just demonized

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:57.440
 sugar? Because I when I mean, when I found Emma, I was eating zero sugar, I wouldn't even eat fruit,

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.440
 and I made my own almond milk and anything with an ounce of sugar, I just completely cut out of my

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.400
 diet, because I was so convinced that it caused cancer, and it would make me gain body fat.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.200
 But obviously, you know, Emma helped, and you helped to reeducate me, and now I eat lots of fruit and

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:21.520
 juice and ice cream and custard, and I'm so much happier. So could you talk about sugar, please?

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:34.080
 Yeah, the anti sugar industry probably started with the calling, the wasting disease of diabetes.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:43.680
 People would once they were diabetic, they would get skinnier and skinnier, and finally die of

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:53.200
 of a starvation, basically, because they couldn't use their sugar at all. And they called it the

01:01:53.200 --> 01:02:03.520
 sugar disease because the sugar was the protein was being converted to sugar, but they couldn't

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.720
 use the sugar. And so it would show up in the urine, making the urine sweet.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:24.720
 And thinking of diabetes, as caused by glucose, a fit of what when the PUFA industry started

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:37.120
 creating their myth about the essential unsaturated fatty acids that went with the demonization

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:46.080
 of cholesterol, cholesterol, which is actually protective against the toxic effects of unsaturated

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:56.160
 fats, cholesterol was given the blame for heart disease. And since sugar was given credit for

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:05.200
 causing diabetes, one particular doctor, I think his name was Yudkin, Y-U-D-K-I-N,

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:17.280
 proposed that the fact that sugar helps to raise cholesterol, that sugar was the demon

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:28.480
 behind heart disease, where the actual mechanism known is that the breakdown of the polyunsaturated

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:37.520
 fats are creating, among other things, lipofuscin-like chemicals that irritate and inflame,

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:48.320
 first of all, the blood vessels. And that sets up a process in which cholesterol is detoxifying,

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:57.440
 binding to, and to some extent, blocking the toxic effects of the polyunsaturated fatty acids.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:10.080
 So this famous book around early 1970s added to the demonization of sugar saying it causes heart

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:20.080
 disease, as well as diabetes. But continuing research was showing that what causes diabetes

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:32.320
 is the, it's called the Randle effect. When you are forced into stress to draw protein

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:40.480
 or amino acids and fats out of your tissues, the free fatty acids in your bloodstream

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:50.720
 turn off your ability to oxidize glucose. And that's a very well-established mechanism.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:05:01.200
 Increased free fatty acids can immediately turn off your ability to oxidize glucose. So

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:11.600
 under stress, where you're liberating fatty acids, you, in effect, immediately become diabetic.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:19.440
 And when you can't assimilate, produce energy from your glucose, that means you can't activate

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:28.000
 the thyroid hormone. So that's part of why the fats, shifting your metabolism towards fats,

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:38.320
 has such a destructive effect. The actual diabetic can't produce any energy from

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:46.240
 glucose. And so they have to tear down their protein. And even that doesn't work. So they

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:58.800
 die by wasting away that the so-called type 2 diabetic is generally overweight and

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:08.080
 still has lots of circulating free fatty acids that are blocking the ability to oxidize glucose.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:17.920
 But even though you can't oxidize it, some of it is being, in an emergency metabolism,

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:26.560
 being converted to lactic acid. And the lactic acid adds to the general degenerative inflammatory

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:36.880
 processes. But the biology and biochemistry of it has been very clearly established that

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:48.880
 at every level of blocking the tissue's ability to consume and efficiently metabolize glucose or

01:06:48.880 --> 01:07:00.000
 to the action on the pancreas, free fatty acids will kill newly regenerated beta cells in the

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:11.600
 pancreas. And constantly, the pancreas is attempting to regenerate converting stem cells

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:19.680
 in the new beta cells. And to survive the beta cells, the need to oxidize glucose.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:27.360
 But as long as there's free fatty acids, the newly born insulin producing beta cells

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:37.120
 will be killed by the blocking effect of the fatty acids. The same sort of thing

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:49.360
 happened in claiming that sugar causes or supports cancer. It came from completely

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:59.600
 misunderstanding or getting Otto Warburg researche backwards. He showed that in cancer

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:09.920
 cells, the presence of oxygen no longer is able to suppress the formation of lactic acid.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:17.920
 That even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells will keep converting glucose to lactic acid.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:28.320
 He didn't say anything about glucose causing cancer, just that cancer cells misuse their

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:40.880
 sugar. And when they deprived of energy, cancer cells are a sign of stress, the body in response

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:51.120
 to any kind of a tumor increases its cortisol production and breaks down good healthy protein

01:08:51.120 --> 01:09:02.720
 based tissue to convert the amino acids to glucose to continue feeding the cancer.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:15.520
 But the cancer is perfectly able to consume amino acids and fats. It's just that the stress

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:26.160
 breaks down the healthy body so fast that it tends to keep supplying glucose. But the cancer

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:36.880
 is also living on protein and fats. So the idea that sugar causes cancer got it exactly wrong.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:46.160
 If you withhold carbohydrate from a cancer patient, the wasting process is accelerated because

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:57.200
 the body will raise its cortisol and break down the good tissues faster to keep the cancer energized.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:07.600
 When you look at the effect of different kinds of carbohydrates,

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:17.200
 starches are made up of chains of pure glucose, where the fruit drives

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:30.000
 sucrose, our standard sugar, is a molecule composed of one half glucose and one half fructose.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:41.920
 And glucose is a powerful stimulant to insulin production, which turns on fat synthesis, among

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:50.240
 other things. And fructose doesn't stimulate insulin, sometimes it even inhibits the production

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:59.680
 of insulin. So when you eat a pure starch, you're eating pure glucose, which gives you

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:08.000
 a powerful insulin reaction, which quickly lowers your blood sugar. And the lowered blood sugar

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:18.080
 increases cortisol production. And so you get a tendency to lay down fat from the insulin

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:26.160
 and tear down protein from the cortisol when you get a bouncing up and down blood glucose.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:34.800
 And sucrose, especially when it's taken with fruit, comes with many other nutrients,

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:41.120
 especially potassium and magnesium, which are stabilizing

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:48.720
 the metabolism and keeping a high metabolic rate.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:02.960
 Thyroid hormone is our basic maintainer of both sodium and magnesium

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:13.200
 functions. If your thyroid is low, your aldosterone rises, and you lose magnesium.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:23.600
 And in proportion to how low your thyroid is, you tend to lose sodium too, despite the aldosterone.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:37.280
 So you can't just look at the amount of magnesium, calcium, sodium, and potassium in the diet.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.640
 You have to look at how the thyroid is responding to those. So your requirement

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:51.760
 for most of those, especially magnesium and sodium increases to the extent that

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.840
 you've suppressed your thyroid.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:01.200
 Ray, just something that I've noticed, people will message me on Instagram

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.600
 saying that they've been diagnosed with, and this relates to sugar, with type 2 diabetes or PCOS,

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:14.480
 and their doctors put them on Metformin, and it seems to be becoming more of a regular thing.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.160
 Could you talk about that?

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:28.240
 Yeah, the insulin in the 1950s, they were already seen, possibly because it was made

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:37.360
 from pig pancreas, but it was turning out to be killing the death rate from diabetes

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:47.120
 increase after the introduction of insulin, oddly. So people were realizing that insulin

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:56.560
 wasn't doing anything for public health, and they first introduced a chemical

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:09.280
 that lowers the ability to make energy from glucose, and that caused it to be wasted.

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:15.600
 And so it would lower your blood sugar in proportion to how fast you're wasting it.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:26.800
 But after 10 or 15 years, that was taken off the market because the wasting of the blood glucose

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:36.560
 took the form of lactic acid, and acidosis was killing more people than the diabetes.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:44.720
 But Metformin came on the market when the previous closely related chemical

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:52.160
 was taken off the market, and now it has become sort of a wonder drug that they're using for

01:14:52.160 --> 01:15:00.800
 everything, even though now and then there's a publication saying that it can cause lactic

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.480
 acidosis the way its predecessor did.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:13.280
 And Ray, could you comment on, because a lot of women will say,

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:21.280
 or they think that white sugar, cane sugar is poison, but they'll say that it's completely

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:27.120
 different to the sugar found in fruit or juice. So could you talk about white sugar and sugar

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:40.320
 found in fruit and juice? Oh, well, it's mostly fruits do contain sucrose, but a lot of them

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:48.320
 contain some free fructose and free glucose, as well as other minor sugars. But sucrose

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:56.480
 in fruits, the main advantage is that it comes with lots of antioxidants,

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:06.960
 anti-stress factors, anti-inflammatory, the flavonoids, for example, and potassium

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:19.200
 and magnesium. And so it's part of a very complex, valuable nutrient, even with quite a bit of like

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:32.000
 1% amino acids that can add to your protein balance. But if you're getting good nutrition,

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:46.800
 then where a person would think nothing of eating a bowl of white rice or a potato,

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:56.240
 which contains lots of starch, the idea of getting a similar amount of calories from white sugar

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:05.120
 has been demonized. But if your nutrition is generally good, there's nothing wrong with

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:15.760
 white sugar. In fact, it's very low in allergens, so it's safe. It can lower your cortisol

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:23.600
 when you're under stress. So it has many protective effects. In the late 19th century,

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:32.960
 there were two doctors, one in France and one in England, who cured their classical

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:43.200
 wasting diabetic patients, patients who were losing pounds every week of tissue

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:52.160
 and had maybe a two-month life expectancy, feeding them all the sugar they wanted.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:58.720
 They reasoned they were going to die soon, so quit tortured them by depriving them of what

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:07.600
 they were craving. And it happened that giving them a regular diet of beef and potatoes and milk

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:16.080
 and whatever the standard diet was, as well as any amount of sugar that they craved,

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:25.600
 they would generally eat 12 ounces a day of white refined sugar, as well as their

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:33.760
 regular diet. And instead of dying in a month or six weeks, they recovered,

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:40.640
 went back to work, no longer diabetic. And when you look at the mechanisms,

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:54.320
 keeping the blood sugar up to their cravings was lowering their cortisol, stopping the destruction

01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:01.760
 of their tissues, also stopping the poisoning of the pancreas with the free fatty acids.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:09.440
 So it actually turned around the fatal disease. It helped them make their own glucose

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:17.280
 and return to health and a normal diet in just a matter of a few weeks.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:31.120
 The beef, the glucose, or the sugar causes diabetes, was sustained and became part of

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:39.280
 the background of the insulin treatment and then of the Metformin. I think Tenformin was the

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.600
 preceding, very toxic glucose waster.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:52.880
 And so, Ray, would you say then, because I remember when I was, I always referenced back

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.320
 to studying when I worked with Emma initially, because it was just like all these light bulbs

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:01.040
 were going up in my head and it just made so much sense. And a lot of women think, and I used to

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.640
 think the same thing is, "Oh, I cut all the sugar and carbs out of my diet and I'd get all these

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.680
 cravings." And I'd just think, "Oh, why am I so weak? How can I stop getting these

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:16.560
 cravings?" And would you say that the cravings are your body's way of telling you that you

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.040
 actually need some fuel and you need some sugar versus that you're weak?

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:32.960
 Yeah, the cravings for nutrients as essential as sugar and sodium, for example, are very good

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:48.720
 indicators, close biochemical indexes of your actual need. And for example, I used to eat huge

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:55.520
 amounts of sugar and never gained weight, a tremendous number of calories. As soon as I took

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:05.600
 thyroid supplement, my cravings for food in general came down to more normal level and I

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:14.640
 no longer crave sugar all the time. I could go hours without eating or getting a headache from

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:24.800
 dropping blood sugar. The thyroid, by keeping the blood sugar up, will stop the sugar craving

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:33.600
 and it even affects the cravings for salt. A hypothyroid woman, for example, suffers from

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:47.760
 both sugar and salt cravings premenstrually. And after studying the effects of sodium balance

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:56.400
 in pregnant women suffering from hypertension and preeclampsia, some studies showed that

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:04.720
 all they needed was adequate protein and the salt supplement and their blood pressure and

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:13.120
 preeclampsia was cured. I saw the similarity in the premenstrual syndrome. Women would restrict their

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:24.640
 sodium as the doctors prescribed and still retain 5 to 10 pounds of excess water in the premenstrual

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:32.720
 two weeks, swell up and become miserable. And when I suggested why not follow your cravings,

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:41.920
 you crave salt crazily during the premenstrual time, why not try salting food to taste?

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:52.480
 And the women who did that no longer had water retention or PMS and same thing happens even in

01:22:52.480 --> 01:23:00.640
 old people. They put them on a salt restricted diet and they become unable to sleep normally

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:12.240
 and retain water and get lots of very serious symptoms. A few friends who were in their 80s

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:22.800
 heard about the PMS women following their salt cravings and they try to, they no longer needed

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:30.480
 their high blood pressure drugs and their sleep immediately returned. They could sleep soundly

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:37.680
 when they were getting enough sodium. It's amazing how we've been, we really underestimate

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:44.720
 the incredible innate intelligence of our bodies and we've been very much discouraged to just

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:50.960
 go with our cravings and listen to our instincts. It's sort of so many answers are right there but

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.840
 it's yeah and then did you say Kitty when you have these kind of cravings, what is our immediate

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:04.000
 reaction? It's like oh how weak am I? How you know I mustn't succumb to them instead of going

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:13.200
 wow was my body trying to tell me? Cultural conditioning has created a great fear of both

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:28.000
 sugar and sodium and that same sort of cultural distortion deriving from totally unbiological

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:41.520
 purposes. It has demonized milk. There's great political ideology growing up.

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:51.360
 It's been going on since about 1850 when the need for cheap labor in the factories

01:24:52.640 --> 01:25:00.560
 wanted women and children to work in the factories and someone invented the

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:08.240
 nipple on a baby bottle so that the women could stop breastfeeding so they could go work in the

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:19.040
 factory. Those outside pressures convinced doctors that breastfeeding was bad. In the 1930s

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:31.120
 my aunt was a nurse at that time for example and she was taught that she should feed her kids the

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:43.280
 approved nutritious synthetic formula and then the formula companies saw the market and they began

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:54.560
 educating not only European and American women but in the third world countries

01:25:54.560 --> 01:26:03.840
 teaching women who didn't even have clean water for mixing the formula but to promote their sales

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:11.360
 they were convincing even the poorest women in the world to buy their formula because breastfeeding

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:22.880
 was bad. So for about at least 50 years the medical indoctrination which they don't want to

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:31.600
 recognize that ever happened the medical profession prefers to erase that from their

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:41.840
 history but from 1930 to 1960s the medical profession was heavily discouraging breastfeeding

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:52.160
 prescribing even heavy doses of estrogen to dry up lactation to cause premature atrophy of the

01:26:52.160 --> 01:27:01.120
 breast and lots of women died from blood clots and strokes in their the time when they should have

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:10.480
 been lactating because of the treating them with such high doses of estrogen and finally in the

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:21.200
 1960s 50s and 60s studies were being done showing that breastfeeding produces better development

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:30.400
 of the face the shape of the mouth and jaws is altered when when a bottle is substituted

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:43.200
 for breastfeeding and the defenders of the formulas have created their own nutritional standards

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:54.400
 incorporating all of this mystical stuff about the essentiality of PUFA and analysis of many baby

01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:04.160
 formulas has found that naturally when they put polyunsaturated fats in a dehydrated formula

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:12.400
 everything that's dehydrated is going to be degraded by oxidation and so if there's

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:22.080
 PUFA in the powdered formula it is highly oxidized and toxic but that's sold to the public

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:33.040
 because supposedly it's an essential nutrient but what they're selling is is a highly degraded form

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:42.960
 of it. Isn't that scary to criminalize women who are formula feeding their babies and that have no idea

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:50.480
 it's just encouraged it's just it's it's a big reminder isn't it that we need to you know keep

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.640
 practicing common sense um you know the marketing is strong and the pressures are strong but it's

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:03.680
 bring it back to simplicity do you have any more around the sugar before I move on to the next

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:11.520
 question Emma uh no no that's fantastic yeah it's good eat the sugar everyone plus it's Haitian

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.800
 and when you crave it you crave it for a reason yeah just stop and obviously I mean it's it's

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:20.400
 again common sense but when you when you get that overwhelming sugar craving

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:26.720
 it's just you know don't necessarily reach the the donut in the office but um keep the the fruit

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:32.400
 bowl full drink some orange juice a bit of extra sugar to your coffee it's yeah choose choose your

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:37.760
 better form of sugar but it's it's it's necessary it's your body screaming out and warning you that

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:44.400
 blood sugar levels are crashing and stress is about to to elevate oh speaking of coffee that

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:52.400
 reminds me that a black coffee on an empty stomach gets into your circulation so fast

01:29:52.400 --> 01:30:02.800
 that if you're on the borderline for stress the the caffeine accelerates your burning of sugar

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:09.840
 and so it can bring on a stress reaction if if you don't accompany it with a food or cream and sugar

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:17.440
 or something like that and the coffee itself is one of the most powerful anti-stress factors

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:26.000
 in the world it has just about every protective function that you could imagine for example it

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:37.200
 will if you use it on the skin or have enough from internal use of coffee the caffeine is powerfully

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:45.600
 protecting against PUFA breakdown in the skin it quenches and blocks free radical damage

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:53.440
 is both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative in the skin protects against skin cancer

01:30:53.440 --> 01:31:02.320
 and keeps the liver functioning against all kinds of stressful factors

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:12.480
 so coffee isn't just a stimulant drug but it's it's an extremely powerful protective factor

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:17.120
 actually on that topic Kitty you and I were just discussing this recently but

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:24.320
 this is for me way back in my first pregnancy when I discovered years Ray a couple of years

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:30.640
 before that but I um we were talking about coffee and I'd never been a coffee drinker because I was

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:35.360
 in the health world and coffee is not a good thing apparently or so I thought and the more

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:41.360
 research I did the more I figured that actually coffee is incredible so when most women embark

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:46.160
 on pregnancy one of the first things they recommended is cut back on or avoid coffee

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:53.120
 completely I actually took up coffee drinking as you know as I was pregnant um and that's when

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:57.840
 I brought it into my diet having learnt about all its protective factors and the importance

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:03.040
 for the baby's lung development and so many other things so I was I was doing the opposite but

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.480
 that's when I you know learnt to embrace coffee and you know haven't let it go since obviously

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.040
 because you come to love it as well but it's um you know quite a controversial topic because

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:16.720
 it's one of the first things recommended to a pregnant woman to to cut out

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:25.760
 uh you know it's really important to make sure that you don't go out of it too

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:34.240
 too intensely and until you give it a chance to work a friend of mine was sure that she

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:42.720
 would get the shakes and feel very stressed if she had even half a cup of coffee but she was

01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:49.600
 taking it on an empty stomach and not using cream or sugar in it I suggested that she

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:58.480
 start with a small amount adding cream and having it with breakfast in just a few days of doing that

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:07.120
 suddenly her whole problem of keeping her blood sugar up having all of the stress symptoms that

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:13.840
 she normally had if she didn't constantly eat during the day after just two or three days of

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:22.240
 getting the right use of coffee she was able to go all day without the shakes

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:30.960
 and her endurance greatly improved no more blood sugar problems absolutely and this is another

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:35.920
 reminder about context isn't it you don't talk about something in isolation but when something

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:42.400
 like coffee is done correctly in a person who's got relatively stable blood sugar levels and it's

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.400
 eaten with or after food and sugar and milk or creams involved um coffee should actually

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:54.480
 calm a person as opposed to induce stress and if it's if it's inducing any kind of stress

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.840
 whatsoever you should reassess pull back and look at your diet as a whole and how you're doing it

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:05.040
 because it should be something that you know only adds to your well-being when it's done correctly

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:10.880
 even I noticed now um you know because obviously before I met you and fan Ray I was you know

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.440
 getting up drinking the black coffee empty stomach now I'll have a big breakfast with eggs

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.120
 and parmesan cheese and lots of fruit and then I'll have the coffee and I have a cup of milk with it

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:27.040
 and I have sugar and collagen but even now I noticed if I don't have adequate carbs with it

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.280
 I noticed that I have get low blood sugar symptoms after but as soon as I add more fruit or add more

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.000
 sugar I feel nice and balanced after it's just really interesting I think when you just even

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:49.440
 experiment on yourself you can notice these things uh yeah I I got conscious of of the effects of

01:34:49.440 --> 01:35:00.000
 protein one morning when I had uh uh uh to be in a hurry I ate just a couple of scrambled eggs

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.720
 and didn't have my usual uh milk and juice and at that time potatoes or something with them

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:15.360
 and for the next several hours I was having extreme hypoglycemia and I realized that

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:24.240
 that very often happens with eggs dieting women will very often have a breakfast of

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:37.360
 nothing but eggs and that powerfully stimulates insulin and you get a rise of insulin without

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:48.480
 sugar to back it up and so very quickly after eating two eggs you can suffer hypoglycemia

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:58.080
 if your liver isn't well stocked with glucose so with one egg I find that it takes at least

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:05.120
 10 ounces of orange juice not to have a drop in the blood sugar so with two eggs

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:12.720
 it's more like a pint of orange juice to balance it yeah I think because women are so and we've

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:17.520
 talked about the sugar and carbs like I used to be so scared of sugar and carbs but when i

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.720
 actually started to track my food and experiment I realized oh how much carbs I actually needed and

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:29.200
 you know obviously in time after I you know ate more and stopped flogging myself with cardio and

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:35.280
 doing more strength training and just lowering all the stress my body's it seemed like my body's

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:41.280
 ability to handle carbs just became better and better and now you know I eat quite a lot of carbs

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:46.320
 and sometimes I even surprise myself and think oh wow it's amazing how much you actually how much

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.960
 I actually eat now um but I think so many women are so scared to eat carbs because they've just

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.440
 been so demonized or they've restricted for such a long period of time you know they're

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:03.120
 things have all been their metabolism's downregulated um and you know as soon as they eat

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:09.840
 the carbs they start to gain weight um and you know like women I think we're all anyone who's

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:14.560
 diet for a long period of time we just get so obsessed with our weight and I think a lot of

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:19.200
 women find that hard initially when they're introducing the carbs would you find that too

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:27.520
 Emma oh sorry yeah absolutely um it's something that they don't want to see even a you know a

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:33.520
 kilogram appear but perhaps their you know impression of themselves and where they should

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:40.400
 be is is warped by what they see in social media um and they do they need to acknowledge you know

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.600
 how long have they been in this depleted state and potentially running on stress and there's

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.240
 probably an adjustment period in between where the body's going to need a few extra

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:55.760
 kilos on it to help it repair and Ray this relates just to this question it's not in the

01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:01.360
 questions but just made me think of it while we're talking about weight um and body composition you

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:05.360
 know you talked before about taking the measurements and looking at the body composition versus the

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:12.240
 weight what would you say is a healthy range of body fat for a woman you know like being obviously

01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.600
 too super lean isn't very good and being severely obese isn't good what what do you think's a good

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:28.560
 range um the the fat produces some very important hormones when you aren't under stress and so

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:39.760
 fertility for example uh uh requires a certain percentage and generally it's the uh subcutaneous

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:50.320
 fat that is typical of females uh uh uh around the hips in in particular hips and thighs

01:38:51.120 --> 01:39:00.880
 should be uh very well padded with subcutaneous fat and some something around 30 percent

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:11.920
 of the body fat body weight can be fat and favorable with health wow that's incredible

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.120
 to think so what what would you say because a lot of women would go or 30 body fat that's way too

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:23.600
 much you know when would you say what percentage like is it getting to be a real problem because

01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:30.640
 I think that women you know um really want to be lean you know like when how low is too low

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:41.120
 um the ones that I've seen having problems it was done in the teens

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:48.080
 wow so you think you know like Emma and I have talked about this I know obviously you can't go

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.880
 this is exact body fat percentage because everyone's different and you know like you want to look at

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.720
 their subjective and objective measures metabolism but would you say that you know under 22 percent

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.480
 under 23 under 24 like you know when does it start to be you know you mentioned teens under 20s and

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.520
 I've been very low body fat under in under 20 percent and I experienced lots of issues you know

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:15.840
 poor sleep irregular cycles um now I'm obviously my body fat's a lot higher and I feel a lot better

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:21.840
 so you know like do you think 22 percent's too low or would you say more getting to under those 20s

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:31.280
 I think that's sort of the the borderline range I think people are usually

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:41.760
 generally feeling better when it's a little over 25 percent and probably 25 percent is safe

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:47.120
 yeah which is like you know I think a lot of women will listen to this and go wow

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.320
 hey Emma like you and I Emma and I were messaging about this because

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:55.120
 well I get lots of questions about it and women are like I really want to be lean Kitty I want to

01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.240
 be lean um but they're also struggling with so many of the other issues and I think the fitness

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:08.240
 industry really portrays that like lean look as healthy yeah and I guess it's your priorities

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.960
 isn't it it's they'll say I want to be lean but we should twist that around a bit and say I want

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.800
 to feel good I want to sleep well I want to keep stress down I want to look you know look good and

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:25.840
 look young in my skin um and just leanness being you know the top of their list which does not

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:34.240
 necessarily bring health some big studies done by the the military of

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:46.240
 average average sized women and men both they found doing any kind of daily work even often

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:55.520
 office work both men and women worked better more efficiently if they were getting at least

01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:06.800
 a hundred grams of good protein every day I would consider 80 grams of good protein

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:16.240
 sort of a minimum but according to the army study the actual health and productivity was

01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:24.080
 better at at a hundred grams or higher and ray would you say if you're active or doing strength

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:35.440
 training would you want to eat a bit more protein probably you can increase muscle building by

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:44.480
 increasing the protein because some of leucine for example acts like insulin and is

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:55.360
 anabolic for muscle so you can actually push the anabolic effect with increased protein

01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:05.040
 but I think for longevity it's better to skimp on on protein as long as you're keeping your

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:09.280
 your carbohydrate up so that you don't experience stress

01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:15.920
 do you have any more questions around that well before I move to the next question

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:21.360
 yeah you can move on that's great um so Ray could you please comment on uh because we get

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:25.840
 so many women you know again have done all the restrictive diets and then they have all of these

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.840
 cycle irregularities like I did or they'll have miscarriages can you please talk about

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:42.880
 what actually causes this uh yeah stress increases your estrogen to progesterone ratio

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:50.960
 and you experience stress more easily when something is interfering with progesterone

01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:58.960
 production uh most often low thyroid is responsible because thyroid and estrogen

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:13.200
 are inversely related if a woman takes as much thyroid hormone as makes them feel just right

01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:25.360
 maximally efficient they might reduce their menstruation to the extent that they don't even

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:35.200
 know they're cycling but there's such a close inverse relationship between thyroid and estrogen

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:42.560
 you can pretty much control your estrogen level by adjusting your thyroid

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:51.200
 and when you're under stress you suppress your thyroid function and so your estrogen rises

01:44:52.320 --> 01:45:01.520
 and estrogen by creating inflammation and inefficient metabolism in the uterus

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:11.440
 causes are reduced the estrogen is wasting both glucose and oxygen and so it's starving

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:24.400
 the tissues and will cause miscarriage because it kills the embryo and causes inflammation

01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:34.880
 and contraction of the uterus so that both damages the embryo and tends to expel it prematurely

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.760
 and thyroid is the basic thing to lower the estrogen get your progesterone back up so that

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:56.880
 it is anti-inflammatory relaxes the uterus and protects the the embryo my dissertation advisor

01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:08.560
 did research testing the effect of just a little bit extra estrogen on animals that have been

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:20.160
 fertilized at the the first week when they were ready to implant the embryo just the tiniest bit

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:29.360
 of extra estrogen caused them not to implant the embryo the second week when it was implanted

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:38.640
 it took just a little more estrogen and they would kill the embryo and expel it each week of

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:48.080
 advanced development of the embryo it just took a little more estrogen added to kill the

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:57.280
 embryo and caused miscarriage and that was short that was in the 1940s 50s

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:04.400
 but that was already known that estrogen causes miscarriage in the 1930s

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:13.040
 and despite that knowledge the estrogen industry managed to convince the world that estrogen was

01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:22.480
 not only the female hormone but was helpful for pregnancy and preventing miscarriages so they

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:32.400
 sold DES diethylstilbestrol until in the 1950s they were selling it with

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:42.720
 support from Harvard Medical School and the FDA and so on selling it to prevent

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:54.160
 miscarriages then with the development of the birth control pills it finally came out that DES

01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:02.640
 was causing cancer and not at all preventing miscarriages pretending to create miscarriages

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:14.000
 so the whole medical establishment was lied to hundreds thousands of lying publications in all

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:22.320
 the best medical journals saying such things as estrogen prevents miscarriage prevents cancer

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:31.280
 prevents epilepsy everything that they claimed that estrogen did for benefit it turned out estrogen

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:40.000
 was causing the disease rather than preventing it Emma do you have any other questions to ask

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:48.480
 around that um no that's I mean look I'm just thinking for the women who start to reflect on

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:53.200
 how many years they might have been on the pill given that that's pure estrogen women who are

01:48:53.200 --> 01:49:00.480
 being you know recommended to go on HRT it's just it's just so so common and to think of the

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:07.200
 unnecessary ramifications of that um just yeah question the things that you're on and how that's

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:13.600
 probably inhibiting your your progress actually this just made me think of something Ray could

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:18.880
 you comment on then I guess because I was the same I had irregular and painful periods and

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:23.600
 when I went to see the doctor they're like just take the pill or you know get an IUD put in or

01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.840
 get the copper get the Mirena get the copper IUD get the I don't know what the shot's called the

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:33.760
 dipper I can't remember what it's called and then you know the bar so you know could you just talk

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:42.800
 about why these hormonal contraceptives are so dangerous for women yeah the IUD works by

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:51.760
 blocking the production of progesterone and so that leaves any estrogen you produce unopposed

01:49:51.760 --> 01:50:06.560
 and has all of the expected consequences estrogen promotes the growth of fibroid tumors

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:18.000
 and many endometriosis for example is driven powerfully by an excess of estrogen

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:26.880
 and even though for years progesterone was recognized to block endometriosis

01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:35.440
 the easiest way to do it is to supplement thyroid to lower the estrogen while raising

01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:47.920
 the progesterone and the effect of the pill they they knew in the 1930s that the pill creates

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:57.600
 miskin's miscarriage or it kills the embryo even before it can implant

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:04.640
 and they didn't want to call it the miscarriage pill so they invented the theory that it's

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:11.840
 preventing ovulation there is never any confirmation that it really prevented

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:21.840
 ovulation but it does block the production of of progesterone and so the lining of the uterus

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:31.520
 is thinner progesterone is what thickens and matures lining of the uterus

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:37.920
 in preparation for a successful pregnancy but under the influence of chronic estrogen

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:47.760
 first it's that's killing the any embryo that is in plant that is fertilized and prevents the

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:56.400
 implantation because it's depleting the oxygen availability needed for implantation

01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:04.880
 but it continues to block the formation of the corpus luteum which makes progesterone

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:12.480
 and so you just don't have any thickened lining to menstruate

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:20.640
 yeah it's really sad isn't it how so many doctors just tell women to go on the pill and

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:27.920
 from such a young age too oh and it's very you know it's a convenience thing too for women and

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:33.760
 I you'd hear it all the time too you sort of might allude to them you know looking into the pill and

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:38.640
 perhaps questioning taking it um and one of the first things you'll hear from young women is

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:43.600
 oh but it's so convenient as a you know contraception and but I'd be terrified to

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.880
 come off it what if I felt pregnant and all the concerns that way but look at the bigger picture

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:55.200
 and how how dangerous it is and is it worth it for the sake of convenience you know there's other

01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:03.920
 ways to avoid conception um think of your overall health and longevity and Ray what about menopause

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.480
 so we get a lot of women message us and they've been to the doctor and they're going through

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.360
 menopause and the doctor says oh you're blowing estrogen you need more estrogen can you talk

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:21.520
 about what causes menopausal symptoms and about this misconception yeah in both animal studies

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:32.880
 our lab was working on animal aging and so the equivalent of of menopause was

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:41.360
 the concentration of everyone's work and people worked on different

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:56.240
 in interpretations and the official medical view was that uh the running out of eggs in the ovary

01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:07.200
 some doctors still talk about that that that eggs are depleted and no longer uh uh ovulate just

01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:16.480
 because they are are used up because you only have as many as you were born with or developed

01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:25.360
 very early in in your life and so they they blame the ovary as the source of menopause

01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:33.360
 but we were everyone in our lab working on a different part of the problem showed that

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.360
 it wasn't a pituitary particularly it definitely wasn't the the uterus

01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:54.480
 but the the amount of estrogen exposure that the pituitary received caused the pituitary

01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:08.480
 to age so it's it was ultimately estrogen aging the pituitary causing the failure of the

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:17.920
 uterus to be receptive but the estrogen effect on the uterus

01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:28.560
 was continued even after the animals equivalent of menopause and from the very oldest animals

01:55:28.560 --> 01:55:38.080
 some of their uteruses showed all of the signs of collagen accumulation a dark coloring

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:48.080
 looking like an exaggerated form of the pregnant uterus which existed because of aging

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:59.040
 and senescence not a lack of estrogen and my concentration was on showing that in

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:06.400
 in the aging hamster all of their tissues showed increased influence of estrogen

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:19.520
 with aging and one of our lab people Gerald E. Parkening later went on when the assays for

01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:28.080
 the actual tissue content of estrogen became available he showed that in other animals the

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:38.640
 actual tissue content of estrogen increased in old age I was just showing that the signs of estrogen

01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:46.000
 were all increased in old age and when you measure estrogen in the blood

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:54.560
 the active form of estrogen is oil soluble but not water soluble

01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:02.960
 and that means it stays inside oil loving cells and it doesn't get out into the bloodstream

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:09.680
 when you're detoxifying it under the influence of thyroid and progesterone

01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:20.480
 progesterone activates enzymes that attach a sugar molecule or a sulfuric acid molecule

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:30.000
 to estrogen making it leave the cell which no longer will dissolve water soluble molecule

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:37.520
 and it goes right to the kidney and is lost in the urine because it's water soluble

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:47.440
 so if you're low in progesterone the amount of estrogen inside the cell

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:55.200
 increases but you don't see it in the bloodstream because it's only in the active state not in the

01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:03.920
 excretable water soluble state if you give the animal adequate progesterone

01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:12.240
 it's able to detoxify both thyroid and progesterone activate the enzymes that detoxify it

01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:25.200
 get it out of cells to leave it in the urine and when you measure the blood level of a person

01:58:25.200 --> 01:58:32.320
 approaching menopause in their late 30s the estrogen is reaching the highest peak ever

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:39.440
 while the progesterone level generally is dropping off after about the age of 35

01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:49.920
 so the while thyroid is decreasing with age the actual amount of estrogen circulating

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:58.960
 in the blood reaches the peak and the first failure to menstruate what has happened in the blood

01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:06.320
 is a loss of progesterone and with loss of progesterone you no longer

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:12.640
 detoxify and excrete estrogen and so it begins staying inside cells

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:21.600
 so after the progesterone disappears and you're no longer have periods then the estrogen in the blood

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:32.160
 gets low because the estrogen is at work inside cells causing symptoms such as hot flushes

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:42.960
 arrhythmia atrial fibrillation becomes epidemic after menopause because

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:54.640
 estrogen blocks the buildup of the energy and readiness to beat but progesterone strengthens

01:59:54.640 --> 02:00:02.720
 the heartbeat and prevents arrhythmia estrogen destabilizes the heart just as it destabilizes

02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:14.000
 every cell asthma and seizures very frequently increase and become a problem after menopause

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:23.840
 and that is in proportion to their the body's exposure to active intracellular estrogen

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:39.280
 so would you I guess advise women to not take HRT then? Yeah that's a pure

02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.480
 sales point the same as giving it to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:54.560
 if it has any benefit it's a placebo. Do you have any other questions Emma around menopause?

02:00:55.520 --> 02:01:02.000
 Oh no I mean I could go on and on I'm conscious of your time Ray maybe just very very briefly but

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.480
 when a woman starts to see for example their their periods shortening perhaps you know forties

02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:17.360
 fifties perhaps alluding to menopause coming on the things that they could possibly do to

02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:22.560
 push out their period length and maintain menstruation I mean obviously we want to

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:29.600
 push out menopause till as late as possible for their own protections. Oh sure at one of my talks

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:40.000
 there was a gynecologist in his 70s and after my talk he said yeah that progesterone is good stuff

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:47.920
 I've been giving it to my wife for I think he said 20 years and he said she's 63 and still

02:01:47.920 --> 02:02:00.560
 menstruating and she looked like a very healthy woman in her 30s but she was 63. Wow amazing.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:10.640
 We love Porgest-e. Oh yeah just gonna bathe in it. Any other questions Emma? We're nearly there

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:18.960
 so poor Ray is probably thinking of it. Another food I think that's been really demonized and

02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:23.600
 again I was just I didn't have any dairy I went I remember my mum took me to see this naturopath

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:28.400
 when I was 12 and she said I was lactose intolerant so then mum I drank soy milk almond milk you know

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:34.560
 all the yucky non-dairy cheeses ate all them till pretty much and then I obviously fell into dieting

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:40.480
 and dairy was heavily demonized so I continued to not consume it and then obviously I met Emma and

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:46.800
 and then started to read your work and I was like oh wow and now I just eat I drink heaps of milk

02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:54.640
 and eat ice cream and love cheese but why is it why is it Ray that dairy has been so demonized

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:58.320
 can you talk about that and then why is it really important to have dairy in your diet?

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:11.600
 I think part of it is derived from the fear of breastfeeding but that has gone along

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:24.240
 with a changed conception of what people are and once they were convinced that breastfeeding

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:36.160
 wasn't necessary then the idea of milk itself being necessary that was the next thing in line

02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:44.880
 and doctors shortened the period that they used to recommend a year of breastfeeding

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:57.280
 and that has gradually become shorter with many doctors now recommending shift entirely

02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:07.280
 to a vegetable or bean-based diet a very horrible toxic diet replacing

02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:15.760
 a continued breastfeeding because they're increasingly indoctrinated that milk isn't an

02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:26.880
 essential human nutrient and it can be replaced simply with the chemical amounts of abstract

02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:35.600
 proteins abstract fats and carbohydrates and so on all of which when you look at them in detail

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:48.160
 they're toxic and destructive and nothing has been even approaching the health supporting effect

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:58.240
 of breast milk but that same negative view towards the absolute importance of breast milk

02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:10.880
 extends to milk and to call it something almond milk or soy milk or oat milk it's just ridiculous

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:24.320
 because they're equating milk with any white emulsion that holds oil in a suspension that

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:32.320
 makes the milk mimics the water turn white has nothing to do with milk it's it's really a

02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:41.040
 criminal distortion of language like selling a petroleum jelly calling it butter would be

02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:55.200
 just as realistic and honest and so a lot of it is driven by that history of

02:05:55.200 --> 02:06:01.120
 antagonism towards breastfeeding is spreading over to milk in general

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:13.680
 but I think there's along that same history the social meaning of of women and femininity

02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:23.840
 has changed and I think there's a lot of misogyny involved in people who are neurotically

02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:34.480
 hating milk there are lots of people who refuse to eat anything white like the white of an egg

02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:42.080
 because it resembles milk it has become a real borderline psychotic condition

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:53.920
 in our cultures the hatred of milk a very bizarre beliefs grow up around it and be

02:06:53.920 --> 02:07:05.040
 any kind of event that happens gets blamed on on milk absolutely the opposite of what

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:14.320
 the real biological effects are so Ray someone had trouble tolerating milk so they drank milk

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:18.800
 or ate dairy products and they got an upset stomach you know runs bloating gas why is that

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:31.520
 usually because they're hypothyroid and the antibodies that are important for governing

02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:40.000
 inflammation in the intestine are deficient if you're low in thyroid and progesterone

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:50.000
 and so your digestive system is not flexible and introducing something that you haven't eaten for

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:58.960
 years simply they're the enzymes aren't there the energy isn't there to quickly produce those

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:09.600
 enzymes and the experiments done about 40 years ago in san francisco in the chinese ethnic population

02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:19.760
 who are defined as lactose intolerant the adults have to know lactase

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:27.760
 enzyme measurable in their intestines they had them start drinking half a glass of milk at the

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:37.040
 time with meals and after just a few weeks of doing that they had as many lactase enzymes

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:45.520
 in their intestines as anyone those those few experiments are done carefully really

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:57.280
 ridiculed and dismissed the idea of genetic lactase intolerance you simply have

02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:05.280
 deinduced the enzymes first along that it takes an adaptive process supported by

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:10.480
 a good endocrine function to restore those enzymes

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:18.560
 so I guess if you're someone who can't tolerate dairy then I guess go slow

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:23.520
 is the takeaway when you reintroduce it just introduce a little bit and then gradually build

02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:34.000
 up yeah you don't if you don't have the lactase enzymes a whole glass of milk that can cause

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:45.680
 diarrhea but if you take just a part of a glass with a meal and do that repeatedly that small amount

02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:56.560
 doesn't cause any diarrhea so it gives you exposure to the lactose which induces the enzyme

02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:07.760
 that will metabolize the gene is there all it has to be is induced to to be in functioning again

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:16.240
 that same thing happens with everything in the system like if you if you keep taking progesterone

02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:24.560
 every day of the month you induce so many excretory enzymes in the liver

02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:32.320
 that you're excreting the progesterone at an abnormally high rate that's why the body

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:40.320
 stops producing so much estrogen for two weeks of the month to let the liver reset

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:47.680
 its enzymes so that a moderate amount of estrogen of progesterone has its full effect

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:56.560
 that happens with anything you're exposed to the enzymes will adapt to it if you give them

02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:06.160
 the tissue a couple of weeks Emma do you have any other questions or anything else to add

02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:12.480
 no that's great thanks for that clarification Ray and I think again it sort of goes slow like you

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:18.800
 said Kitty and it's amazing what the body can do and the functions that can that can be reinstated

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.400
 when you give the body time

02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:28.000
 yeah it's fascinating and dairy is so delicious too I can't imagine now not eating ice cream every

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.080
 day or cheese it's even the terminology isn't it when people call you know soy milk or nut milk a

02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:39.360
 replacement for dairy milk it's but by no way is it a replacement it doesn't replace

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:44.640
 the loss of protein doesn't replace the calcium levels by any means the minerals

02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:54.640
 it doesn't even yeah and and they all contain polyunsaturated fats that slow your metabolism

02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:04.800
 and increase your tendency to gain fat where many studies show that milk besides the high calcium

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:16.560
 content and adequate magnesium content an increase of milk in your diet is the single

02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:19.520
 simplest way to lose excess fat

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:30.240
 one percent milk usually has enough of the fat fat soluble vitamins so you can drink

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:41.360
 two liters of low-fat milk per day and generally eat eat at least as many calories as normal and

02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:47.600
 still lose weight actually just one quick question then we'll wrap it up because it just made me

02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:52.320
 think about a question I get all the time you know of course you want to try and get the best

02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:58.400
 quality milk that you can from pasture-raised animals and I know I've spoken to this

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:03.200
 to Emma about this all the time a lot you know women come into our program and they're on you

02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:12.560
 know on a tight budget not everyone can afford to buy raw you know organic milk is it okay

02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:20.400
 just to drink you know like you mentioned one percent pasteurized milk ? Yeah that's what I

02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:28.800
 drink in the US generally but I go by the taste of it different brands taste better than others

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:37.360
 and uh that usually means that they they aren't putting bad additives in the milk

02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:47.520
 but uh the ideal thing is to get a one percent milk straight from the the dairy before they've

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:54.880
 added anything to it in the US they require that one percent milk contain added vitamins

02:13:54.880 --> 02:14:01.840
 A and D but to add those they use an emulsifier which can be allergenic

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:13.280
 so if a person has uh some kind of an allergic symptom from the vitamin added milk

02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:20.720
 then they can worry about getting it direct from the the farm without added vitamins

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:28.240
 so you don't necessarily need to drink raw milk I don't know there's a small difference

02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:35.120
 in nutrition but uh pasteurize is fine so just yeah I mean we're quite lucky in

02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:39.840
 Australia aren't we Emma our milk is just we don't have there's only very few brands that have the

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:52.160
 added vitamins in Australia I don't know about the availability of low-fat milk without vitamins

02:14:52.160 --> 02:15:00.160
 usually the the whole milk doesn't have added vitamins yeah we're really very really lucky here

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:05.760
 Ray we are like the majority of our milk doesn't have the added vitamins in Australia I notice a

02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.240
 lot of our US clients always say oh it's really hard to find the low-fat milk without those added

02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:20.000
 vitamins yeah I've heard that the emulsifier they use contains polyethylene glycol

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:26.080
 and polysorbate 80 both of which are potentially dangerous allergens

02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:30.960
 wow okay great that's awesome Emma do you have anything else to add

02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:39.120
 what was that oh I'm just asking Emma if she has anything else to add I think she's just got her

02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:49.760
 phone on um on silent sorry sorry I was just saying we're lucky here aren't we Emma with the milk

02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.600
 we're lucky in Australia yeah it's not been made a rule that reduced fat milk has to have those

02:15:55.600 --> 02:16:00.240
 vitamins added so we can just have them with the fat removed and nothing else added um there's

02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:06.800
 a few that you know you can choose by choice that have added vitamin D but um most of them are just

02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:12.320
 yeah the fat removed and nothing else added to them and I mean of course if I had some cows sitting

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:18.000
 at the back of my house you know if I had a farm I'd be eating the raw drinking the raw milk and

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.760
 eating the raw cheese but I think a lot of clients get really worried they're like oh Kitty you know

02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:26.800
 I can't afford to buy all this raw organic milk and organic products and it's good to know that

02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:31.520
 you know you can just you know get your good old regular milk with nothing else added

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.120
 low fat and that's still going to be fine

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:39.760
 yeah no we've got good options here I think

02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:45.680
 well that's um we might wrap it up now Ray I'm so sorry we've taken up so much of your

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:50.400
 time it's just once you get on a roll and then we have all these other questions

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:56.000
 you're just a wealth of knowledge I really appreciate you coming on and on the podcast I

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:00.800
 just was just thinking oh wow there's just so much great information in there that our

02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:06.080
 clients and listeners are just going to love and to hear it straight from him no it would really

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:12.960
 really appreciate your time directly and it's yeah an honor to have you on yeah thank you thank

02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:24.000
 you so much everyone okay thank you important subjects to get discussed absolutely no we really

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:32.800
 appreciate it ray thanks so much talk soon bye bye

02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:42.800
