00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello, welcome to this month's Asking a Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.880
 who perhaps have never listened to the show, they run from 7 till 8pm every third Friday

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:18.000
 of the month. And from 7.30 typically until 8 o'clock, we invite callers to a call in

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.640
 with questions related to the month's subject. The toll free number is 1-800-568-3723. That's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 1-800-KMUD-RAD. And if you're in the 707 area code, the number is 707-923-3911. Well,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.280
 I think I should probably start off, it's January 2018, Happy New Year. Nice and cold

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.080
 outside, certainly not very environmentally enrichening. But I'm sure there's plenty of

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.480
 things that can be done. And I know we're probably going to get into some of the things

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.280
 as a recap on environmental enrichment. But this month's subject is going to be, I won't

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 say specifically for the ladies out there, but a lot of what we're going to talk to Dr.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:20.040
 Peat tonight about is related to female hormones. And whilst progesterone is not typically female,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 it is produced by males, progesterone as a topic of discussion tonight will run through

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.080
 many of the disorders that we're going to cover. And some in particular, I wanted just

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 to highlight again, the difficulty if you are looking online for information, I mean,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.400
 the internet is an excellent source, but it's also a good source of disinformation. So you

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.120
 have to be really careful where you pick your narrative. Typically, clinical journals and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:01.320
 clinical trial published information is also skewed. You can't always take it on face value

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.240
 that that result is actually what happened. So we're going to get into a couple of instances

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:15.160
 where some very prominent peer reviewed trials with thousands of people, I mean, huge cohorts

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.560
 of people that were involved in these trials to try and demonstrate an effect. And particularly

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.200
 with regard to progesterone, the effects of progesterone on traumatic brain injury are

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.720
 one of those things we're going to look at. And then we're going to look at things like

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.240
 the effect on cognitive impairment. We're going to look at the effects on Alzheimer's

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:45.920
 and other neurodegenerative disorders, and then postpartum depression and epilepsy, menstrual

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.640
 related epilepsy, catamenial epilepsy, and then sleep apnea. So I'm sure from a perspective

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.680
 of postpartum and progesterone for the women who have had maybe PMS symptoms or estrogen

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.760
 excess symptoms, which are going to be very much tied to tonight's discussion, who suffer

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.360
 with polycystic ovaries, you know, what they call breast mice. So cysts, cystic formations,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.320
 obviously endometriosis, and then difficulty conceiving. So if those females are listening,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.520
 if it's pretty sure interest, there's a lot that can be done about this. I graduated 20

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.960
 years ago now, with an honors degree in herbal medicine, and I've worked with Dr. Peat here

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.480
 for the last nine to 10 years. And a lot of what we found out from Dr. Peat has been pretty

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.480
 revelational because when I was studying herbal medicine in England, even the medical literature,

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.840
 and we were trained by doctors and endocrinologists and pathologists and all the other ologists,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.760
 but they all came out of a medical background. We weren't really taught by holistic practitioners

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.920
 apart from maybe the materia medica side of the, you know, the education. So we were taught

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.640
 by doctors and we had gynecologists and physiologists and pathologists. So, but they have the same

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.440
 kind of medical background and a lot of the, a lot of the things we learned, I've later

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.320
 found out from Dr. Peat and from doing research online, looking to see deeper, there actually

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.360
 is quite a lot of untruth in what we were told as is what's good for you. So hopefully

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.880
 these shows are all online. Our website, which is www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com, there's

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.960
 a resource tab and every one of the shows that we've recorded with Dr. Peat here since

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.400
 2008 are there. I think there may be the last one or two months that's yet to be put up,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.260
 but essentially it's a great resource and it's free. So people should definitely go

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:53.040
 there and look at that. And then obviously Dr. Peat's website, and he's very much somebody

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:02.160
 I want to support fully. His website is referenced with lots and lots of articles. All of these

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.640
 articles I should say are fully referenced. So his specialty, I'll just introduce him

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.080
 here in a second and he can just give you his bio, but I know people that are listening

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.080
 who probably tuned in just for the show know him, but there's always people that I come

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.480
 across who've not heard him before. And so obviously he's a great resource to further

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:28.720
 learn and relearn some untruths that we've been brainwashed with. So I don't see the

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.520
 engineers talking to somebody. I don't know if he's talking to Dr. Peat or not. Let me

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.440
 just see if he's there. I'm here. Oh, hi, Dr. Peat. Well, thanks so much for joining

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.640
 us again. As always, I know some people have mentioned on the forums that your bio, they've

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.000
 heard it all before, but you know what? There's people that haven't heard you. So I'm just

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.240
 going to carry on as usual and please ask you to give a background, your academic background

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:02.560
 and your research since then. My PhD study was at the University of Oregon in 1968 to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:13.240
 72. My dissertation was on reproductive aging. And my intention when I went back to graduate

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:21.680
 school in biology was to study the brain, but I found that the brain research was the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.760
 most doctrinaire next to genetics. And so I looked around and found that the reproductive

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:38.360
 physiology was actually oriented towards science. And my background before that had been studying

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:46.320
 literature, linguistics and painting. And it's probably the background in literature

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:58.640
 that made me think in an adversarial manner in evaluating science rather than an authoritarian

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:10.360
 except because the professor said it's true. I think the legal attitude of looking for

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:17.920
 truth by an adversarial approach should apply to medicine and science in general.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:27.200
 Okay, well, good. So as I was preparing material, excuse me, for this evening's show, I was

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.080
 looking at initially, I wanted to ask you kind of go through a list of disorders that

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.800
 I have that will all be found to be linked, but didn't necessarily want to bounce around

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.280
 all of them in describing one at a time. And I started off with looking at the evidence,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:53.320
 again, wanting to be just like you very scientifically oriented here and looking for truth in science

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.600
 and wanting and expecting good science to reveal the truth, which it will do impartially.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.640
 And it's a reproducible event, which is a defining marker of good science. About traumatic

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.560
 brain injury, and I never actually realized that the numbers were so huge, the amount

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.920
 of people actually suffering with traumatic brain injury, whether these are people that

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.240
 play in professional soccer or boxing or people that get in auto wrecks, or people that fall

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.480
 off of, you know, buildings and ladders and the numbers are pretty staggering. And actually,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.240
 it's been one of the most difficult to treat conditions. I mean, I never really think I

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.040
 never thought about it really too much until I started plunging into the papers around

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.520
 the subject, but traumatic brain injury is not very well treated. And there, whilst there

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:50.040
 have been some very good phase one and two trials, using progesterone, which is going

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:59.640
 to be the topic of tonight, woven in many different diseases or pathologies, that although

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.840
 the trial one and two trial results were very promising, and they spurred the phase three

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:11.920
 trials which had huge numbers, cohort numbers of 10,000 in one of them and 1000 or 1500

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.440
 in the other. Both of these studies and we'll go on to describe them so people can take

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.840
 a look at it themselves. Both these studies seemingly found no benefit. Now, I know, you've

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:31.080
 described at length the anti inflammatory and anti edema to main mentioned just a couple

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.320
 of the effects of progesterone. But the swelling that occurs in traumatic brain injury is one

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.280
 of the main contributors of all the damage along with course, with all the leakage and

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:50.200
 the inflammatory cytokines that are released as a process of cell breakdown and rupture.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.960
 So given that, given that the phase one and two trials were so promising and spurred the

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.800
 call for a phase three trial, I read both of the most recent ones, the PROTECT-3 and

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.560
 the SYNAPSE trial on progesterone for severe traumatic brain injury saying that there was

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.000
 no beneficial effect when and we'll bring this out in a little bit after you've described

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.800
 perhaps your understanding of progesterone and how you definitely would advocate progesterone

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.400
 for swelling and then we'll go, you know, bounce around the production, the endogenous

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.800
 production of progesterone because it's very, very different to estrogen. For example, being

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.440
 produced in the CNS and the brain cell astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as well as gonads, etc.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:45.560
 So, this, the main study here showed no benefit and it's almost just yet another, gosh, just

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.840
 another closed door if you like. I find more and more as I talk to you and as I look at

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.000
 papers myself that they're really, and I won't, you know, that word conspiracy is thrown around

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.520
 so much I know, but there does seem to be a real, a real work to undo progesterone's

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:11.440
 good because in the study, given they did a 120-hour study for this particular application

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:19.160
 of progesterone, they said there was no benefit in reducing swelling or outcome, but a later

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:25.960
 piece of work that was done when both of these phase 3 trials didn't seem to show any benefit

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:33.920
 was refuted by a professor of neuros, well, actually he's a, working for the Emory University.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:41.520
 He's basically just been studying brain trauma for the last 20, 30 years, so it's his specialty.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.440
 He's actually revealed some of the faults of the study that are definitely noteworthy.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:57.320
 So I was going to start the questioning here to you in terms of progesterone and its beneficial

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:06.120
 effects. How do you interpret this negative effect that was shown in the trials in comparison

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.280
 to truly what progesterone is capable of doing?

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:21.200
 There have been, I think it was about 15 big studies on brain injury and interestingly

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:29.840
 after overwhelmingly promising results from, for example, using intravenous magnesium to

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:37.640
 reduce swelling and restore metabolism, all of these, by the time they reached the phase

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:45.440
 3 level, suddenly the results were the opposite and nothing turned out to be beneficial for

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:54.640
 treating human brain trauma, even though the previous smaller studies and many, many animal

00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:04.760
 studies were showing overwhelming good increased survival, increased full recovery and so on.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:11.720
 And the fact that something happens at the phase 3 level, I think is very suspicious

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:20.440
 when the government and big corporations get involved. I suspect that they really are protecting

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:28.160
 drugs that are not generic the way progesterone is. Urea, I don't think there's ever been

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:36.120
 a major study of treating brain trauma with simply intravenous urea, but it has had just

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:45.560
 amazingly good results and I think probably a serious study could be done using all of

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:57.280
 the known beneficial things, urea, magnesium, progesterone, hypertonic saline solution and

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.280
 so on. I think if you do everything that's known to be beneficial to the brain, you would

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:14.840
 get even better results than with a single drug-like treatment. The worst thing about

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:26.960
 this big Protect study, I think, was that they not only didn't give a big enough dose,

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:39.800
 but they gave it emulsified with, I think it was intralipid soybean oil. And the amount

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:47.080
 of soybean emulsion that they were giving intravenously in the animal studies, it in

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.480
 itself is harmful.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.840
 Yeah, it was a 6% solution.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:15:00.040
 I think it was about 1970, someone injected emulsified soy oil into rats and showed that

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:07.480
 on the first pass through the brain, 17% of the oil was taken up into the brain. There's

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:15.440
 no blood brain barrier that functions against oil. And then they dissected the brain and

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:27.200
 showed that one dose of oil was enough to alter the morphology of brain cells. So intravenous

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:36.800
 treatment with something supposedly beneficial with a known toxin to the brain with a long

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:47.920
 history of evidence, it's hard to imagine how corporate and government interest putting

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.680
 millions of dollars into the project could have been that ignorant.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:58.000
 Okay, and the other thing I noticed on that trial, you mentioned the 6% soybean oil that

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.040
 they used. They were only using 2mg of progesterone per milliliter for the active treatment. And

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:12.800
 then the drug infusion was started intravenously with a loading dose of 0.71mg per kilo body

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:21.040
 weight per hour for one hour followed by 0.5mg per kilo per hour for the rest of the 119

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.040
 hours.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.000
 So they were getting 2mg of progesterone per milliliter. And I'd like you to put this in

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.900
 perspective for people that are listening because maybe people don't quite understand

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.800
 the normal values that females are exposed to during the menstrual cycle and/or pregnancy.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:39.640
 So 2mg of progesterone per milliliter, so basically 0.5mg per kilo per hour for 120

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:49.640
 hours. So would you put either 0.5mg or 2mg in perspective of the progesterone exposure

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.280
 that most females enjoy?

00:16:53.280 --> 00:17:00.040
 Some people have reported that in the last week or two of a healthy pregnancy, a woman's

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:11.800
 placenta is producing 800-900mg of progesterone per day. And that doesn't do anything potentially

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:17.360
 harmful. It's very protective. Women generally feel great the last two or three weeks when

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:26.260
 their progesterone is at a maximum. So they could easily have given 2000mg of progesterone

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.440
 per day instead of a few hundred milligrams.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:38.840
 Right. Well, this was 2mg. So yeah, 2mg per hour. Okay, crazy. So that brings me on to

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.720
 the next thing. And it took a long time to find this because there's a lot of information,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:48.400
 re-repeated information, information that people are quoting from this same study to

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.840
 say that progesterone is not effective for traumatic brain injury. Hundreds and hundreds

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.960
 and hundreds and very little actual pro-supportive evidence for progesterone's anti-inflammatory

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:05.800
 effect and brain edema decreasing effect. But one person in particular, this particular

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:13.520
 doctor who was studying this at Emory University, and his name is Donald Stein. He published

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:19.960
 a couple of articles back in 2013 when he was very hopeful that this phase 3 trial was

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.680
 going to show very positive results for progesterone. And I think it took maybe 18 months to 2 years

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:32.520
 afterwards for him to publish this latest paper in the Journal of Neurotrauma dated

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:38.880
 June 1st, 2017. And it's titled Suboptimal Dosing Parameters as Possible Factors in the

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.560
 Negative Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Progesterone for Traumatic Brain Injury. And it's about

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:51.600
 a 4-page article basically refuting the dose that was given. And as you mentioned, the

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:59.960
 emulsifying agent, the polyunsaturated fat that was used, the soybean oil that was used

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:06.960
 as part of the carrier, certainly bringing its own negative inflammatory effects. And

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.920
 you've always talked about PUFAs as being pro-estrogenic. And estrogen obviously is

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.560
 a known water logger, both of neurons and cells. And so all of this is working against

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.080
 any tiny dose of progesterone that was part of the trial. So just again, for people that

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.440
 are listening, it's very difficult sometimes to wade through all this material and find

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:35.460
 the facts because a lot of it is being promoted by pretty vested interests that are plugged

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.960
 into many different levels of academia with people doing follow-up research to get their

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.440
 PhDs, etc. And we all know from what you've mentioned and from personal experience of

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.880
 people that have been in academia that there is this real egocentric mentality running

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.700
 through the departments and obviously funding that runs through those same mentalities that

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.000
 people don't want to give up. And so it's very difficult sometimes to find objective

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.300
 truth, but it is out there. And so that's what this show has been around for a long

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:09.280
 time is to have you on the show and get you to refute what have been believed innocently,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.200
 I think for the longest time because we've been taught it and we think these people are

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.200
 telling the truth, but your research shows otherwise.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:26.240
 You mentioned the estrogenic effect of polyunsaturated fats. When there's a trauma, the toxicity

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:33.880
 of the polyunsaturated fats is tremendously amplified by their conversion to the pro-inflammatory

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:43.960
 prostaglandins. And in any trauma, not just trauma, but any harmful experience of an organism,

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:51.000
 estrogen is produced in the injured tissue and in the whole organism. It can be sunburn

00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:01.920
 or parasites in the intestine or broken bone, x-ray treatment, any harm you can think of

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.480
 due to the organism is going to increase the estrogen production and the conversion of

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.840
 polyunsaturated fats to the pro-inflammatory mediators.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:21.720
 Right. So this is what you would term or literature would term the ex-cyto-toxic situation.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:29.080
 Part of it, that's an even more specific part that happens under the influence of estrogen

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:38.640
 and polyunsaturated fats. They activate the glutamatergic transmitters in the brain, these

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:51.520
 literally excitatory signals to the point that they become toxic. Progesterone opposes

00:21:51.520 --> 00:22:02.840
 all of these, not just the direct anti-estrogen effect, but it blocks the formation of prostaglandins,

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:12.840
 blocks the release of the stored polyunsaturated fats, blocks the formation of other inflammatory

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:24.080
 mediators and antagonizes the glutamatergic ex-cyto-toxins. Every function of the organism

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:31.240
 you can think of that's harmed by trauma is intensified by estrogen and polyunsaturated

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.520
 fats and those are blocked by progesterone.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:41.240
 Okay. All right. So you're listening to Ask Your Ob-Doctor, KMU DeGalbaville, 91.1 FM

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.400
 from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock. People are invited to call in with questions

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:51.600
 either related or unrelated to this month's subject of progesterone and its treatment

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.480
 for traumatic brain injury. We're going to look at cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.920
 we're going to touch on that a little, postpartum depression, that's quite interesting from

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.600
 a female perspective, postpartum, catamenial epilepsy, which is a menstrual cycle related

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.120
 epilepsy and sleep apnea and how progesterone and CO2 have interrelated effects. So the

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.800
 number if you're in the area is 923 3911 or if you're in the outside area or indeed out

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:26.480
 of the States, which has happened many times, there's an 800 number, 1-800-568-3723. So

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.280
 we will take your calls from 7.30 on. I saw the lights flashing here just a bit ago. I

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.560
 don't know if you've got anybody on at this point. Maybe not. Maybe taking questions.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.680
 Okay, we can always go back to him if he's there. Okay, he's there. Let's take this first

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.000
 call. A caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.600
 My name is Jeff from New York. I was listening to the comment about progesterone and progesterone

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.000
 is I guess the miracle product, but does it only apply to women? Because I think you've

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.880
 mentioned in the past that pregnenolone is sort of universal, but progesterone men have

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.920
 to be careful about. And I'm not talking about like a 25-year-old, I'm talking about like

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:16.520
 a 55 to 70-year-old where the risk of endotoxins is increasing just with basic age. So that's

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:23.640
 one question that I had. The other one is with regard to salt and insomnia, I was actually

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:31.880
 using sea salt and I switched over, having read your forum, to canning salt or actually

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.560
 kosher salt, which is pure salt, doesn't have any other minerals in it. And I actually think

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.040
 it really helped. I'm just wondering if you would agree with that and sort of why, because

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.960
 I don't seem to be waking up at three o'clock in the morning anymore. I seem to be able

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.280
 to sleep through the night. So it might not be the only item, but anyway, that was the

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.080
 second question. Thank you. Okay, I'll let Dr. Peat ask the progesterone,

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.640
 answer the progesterone question with men and progesterone, how safe is it? But I will

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:01.920
 quickly just say the whole thing about salt and natural salt and Himalayan salts and deep

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.280
 earth crystal salts, the fact is they do contain a lot of other trace elements and other negative

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:14.560
 material. And I think that could be in part why there may be disruptions going on on a

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:21.440
 hormonal level in a type of endocrine fashion with very small picogram concentrations of

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:27.080
 very questionable heavy metals and other products that can be present in the salt.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:34.360
 So all of those colored salts and Himalayan salts, etc. typically have other particles

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.120
 within them that are not beneficial. And so I think just like Dr. Peat is talking about white

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.880
 sugar being good, it's not opposed to white sugar at all. And I think you find the caramelization

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.160
 product of any organic or brown sugars may be more detrimental than just straight white

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.960
 sugar for its own sake. So you agree with kosher salt? Canning salts are the same and

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.520
 that's the product that would be most efficacious for this type of program? Yeah, I would say

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.920
 that a straightforward white sea salt. Again, I guess I have to question that because sea

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:15.040
 salt has its own elements within it that we know are not particularly good for you. But

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.960
 a white sea salt is particularly what we use. What do you think about iodine? Not a good

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:29.600
 product to supplement with. Obviously in terms of any Fukushima fallout or that kind of thing.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:36.480
 And obviously there's a rationale for it for getting it taken up into the thyroid gland

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:43.240
 so that the radioactive material doesn't collect there. But yeah, Dr. Peat, what do you think

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:51.080
 about progesterone in men? Well, first I'd like to comment that my interest in salt supplementation

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:58.120
 was related to the estrogen issue because I saw premenstrual women restricting their

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:05.040
 salt and making their symptoms worse. I suggested to a friend that she salt her food to taste

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:11.320
 and suddenly she didn't retain water. Salt was acting as a diuretic. And then years later

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:19.760
 I knew old people who were restricting salt and developing serious insomnia and not improving

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:27.040
 their blood pressure. So I suggested the same thing to them. And again, they went to sleep,

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:36.560
 got good sleep suddenly and their blood pressure actually came down. And then I realized that

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:45.280
 Tom Brewer with his diet for pregnant women in the 1950s and 60s had seen the same thing

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:55.120
 that some people he collaborated with supplemented pregnant women with toxemia symptoms with

00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:02.640
 huge amounts of salt daily and their toxemia essentially was cured. That's Shanklin and

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:13.680
 Houghton's book. Anyway, the progesterone, I used it myself after I had worked with it

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:27.360
 in aging animals. I tried it on my own migraines and twice having a very intense migraine,

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:35.760
 I had complete reversal of the symptoms from one to two minutes from a total migraine to

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:44.000
 total wellness after ingesting about 100 milligrams I guess it was. And that was what really got

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:55.520
 me interested in describing it to other people. And when I took too much for too long, I noticed

00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:02.160
 that it had the effect of a cold shower for a day or two, an antitestosterone effect,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:10.000
 but that passes quickly when you stop taking it. And I found as I got older that I could

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.040
 tolerate five milligrams or 10 milligrams a day without that antitestosterone effect.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.760
 Several people have told me that it actually seems to reinforce their testosterone. And

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:30.200
 I think that works because testosterone when you're under stress is being converted to

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:40.200
 estrogen and if you stop that conversion with progesterone, progesterone like aspirin inhibits

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:45.880
 the conversion of testosterone to estrogen. You can actually raise your testosterone by

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.760
 blocking that conversion of stress.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.160
 That's very interesting. The question on iodine a moment ago, I know you've mentioned that

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.640
 taking a very small amount or even a seemingly small amount can be toxic, but that was in

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:06.560
 an experiment. So as you probably have written and incredibly articulately, and I don't want

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.800
 to make you put a little comp, but quickly the fluoridation of the water is something

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:19.560
 that Americans just literally can't escape. So I'm just wondering outside the laboratory,

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.440
 does more iodine make sense in the context of an environment where you're so exposed

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.720
 to fluoridated water that you can't really escape it? Is it counteracted? Maybe would

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:38.120
 suggest more than a small dose to offset the fluoride that you're probably consuming without

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.120
 your knowledge?

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:47.080
 I've never seen a test of that idea. I think it should be tested. When I spent some time

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:52.560
 in San Francisco without thinking about the fluoridation of water there, I was using a

00:30:52.560 --> 00:31:02.360
 daily supplement of T3, Cytomel, and within a few days I developed a migraine, which made

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:12.200
 me assume it was a sudden crash of my thyroid function. So I looked up the interaction.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:19.600
 If you take T3 with fluoridated water, if it's in your stomach at the same time, the

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:27.160
 amount of fluoride in the water will totally knock out the dose you're taking. But I think

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.160
 there is some effect once it gets in your body as long as it's circulating as ionic

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:40.800
 fluoride. I think it will knock out any T3 that it runs into.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.840
 That's great. I have just one last question if I may. On amino acids, you say like gelatin,

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.320
 you're better off taking gelatin because that's how you get your proline and your glycine.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.520
 It's more bioavailable and cleaner without any additives. But there are some isolated

00:31:54.520 --> 00:32:00.120
 amino acids like taurine, which I think in and of itself may be extremely therapeutic

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:06.120
 and perhaps reduces stress. And the other one that I was interested in is carnosine,

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:11.320
 not carnitine, which you've written well on, but carnosine seems to be a long list

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:19.000
 of benefits. Do the possible risks of additives, are they potentially offset by the fact that

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.760
 those two particular amino acids have a laundry list of benefits?

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:30.440
 Yeah. I don't discourage people from taking those if they want to try them, but I don't

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.440
 use them myself.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:41.880
 Okay. Well, yeah. Okay. One last question. I am holding my breath for two minutes at

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:47.720
 the best with my -- take a breath and you let all the air out and you hold it for a

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:52.200
 minute and a half, my maximum is two minutes. And then you take one breath in and you hold

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:59.000
 it for a minute to a minute and a half. When I do that, and I have -- sometimes I can do

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.640
 it better than others, it seems that that might be a good proxy for bag breathing or

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.600
 swimming or whatever to increase your CO2. And is that something that if you practice

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.680
 it over a period of time, as an older person, you can reduce the systemic stress to your

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:22.440
 body, you know, as opposed to putting your whole body in a bag of CO2 gas?

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:30.280
 Yeah. Holding your breath does have its value, but the amount of time you hold it depends

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:38.200
 on your metabolic rate. If you have a high thyroid function, you might be unconscious

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.680
 after a minute of breath holding.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.880
 So you have a high metabolic rate or low?

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:51.800
 If you have a high metabolic rate and you're producing CO2 and consuming oxygen very fast,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:59.280
 the fall off of oxygen supply to your brain is going to be twice as fast as the average

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:07.160
 person and four times as fast as a hypothyroid person. So if you have a high metabolic rate,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.120
 you don't want to force yourself to go two minutes.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:17.280
 Is there a good average for someone who's like modestly hypothyroid? I mean, as you

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.360
 get older, everyone becomes hypothyroid, right, to some extent. So, I mean, not to pin you

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:30.120
 down, but like doing it a minute a day, you know, is that a good target? Like 30, 60 seconds?

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.520
 Because it's not hard, it's not easy. It's just something you can do and seems to certainly

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.760
 feel relaxed afterward. I mean, you feel like your blood vessels literally are relaxed.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.000
 It's a very odd feeling.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.880
 A very high proportion of the population is breathing too fast, hyperventilating. So it's

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:58.320
 beneficial for most people to hold their breath or breathe slower to some extent, but there's

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:06.640
 no way without doing an oxygen consumption test that you can tell exactly how many seconds

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:07.640
 you should hold it.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.200
 Gotcha, gotcha. I gotcha. But I think that's a good point. If you're doing it and you reduce

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.400
 the number of breaths you take during a normal minute without thinking about it, then you've

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:24.000
 improved. There's some benefit, right, because you're taking fewer breaths per minute.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Yeah.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.640
 Okay. Thanks for your call. We do have another caller on the line waiting to get on in. So

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.640
 let's make sure they get the opportunity. You're on the air. Where are you from? What's

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640
 your question?

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.720
 Yes. Hi, this is, I'm calling from Finland.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:37.720
 Finland.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:46.320
 And I'm always very grateful for your show and, you know, just learning so much. My question

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:54.640
 is unrelated to this week's topic. It's basically prompted by a recent book in French by a doctor

00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:03.600
 who founded the Oxidative Stress College. And so I'd like to know if this whole white

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:13.520
 fat, brown fat thing is good science. What I found in the book, which just came out recently,

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:23.840
 this is why I dare to mention it, is basically the assumption from this doctor that, you

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:30.440
 know, you cannot get rid or it's almost impossible to get rid of white fat. You just accumulate

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:39.680
 it. And the only one thing that they mentioned would be to use cold. But I know that in past

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:50.160
 shows it has been told that, you know, the stress created by applying cold, you know,

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.560
 makes it almost worse than not applying it. So this would be one of the questions. And

00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:01.880
 my other question is I've seen a study, basically it's on mice, so I don't know if it's applicable,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:08.600
 if it's good science either for men, but that's also goes as far to say that starvation or

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.560
 fasting actually, not starvation, fasting would actually reverse the thing. So basically

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:22.240
 turn good brown fat into bad white fat. So any opinions on this would be appreciated.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.760
 Thank you again. So Dr. Peat, what do you have to say about brown

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:35.240
 versus white fat? I mean, there is a lot of good, interesting research on that. And my

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:42.920
 orientation to it is that the activation of T3, the active thyroid hormone, is the crucial

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:53.320
 thing and that yes, stress will prolong fasting is going to have a lot of harmful counterproductive

00:37:53.320 --> 00:38:00.960
 effects. And one of those is that it knocks out the T3 in the various tissues, even though

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.120
 the T3 that circulates in the bloodstream is two thirds of it roughly is produced in

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:15.720
 the liver and about a third in the thyroid gland. But the various tissues of the body,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:22.200
 muscles, skin, kidneys, brain, all of the tissues that have been studied are able to

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:31.640
 produce T3 from T4 locally to supplement whatever can get in from the bloodstream. So that even

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:40.080
 if your circulation isn't delivering enough T3, your tissue is able to produce it itself.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:48.880
 And the crucial factor for producing it locally in the tissue, it's partly glucose, but fructose

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:57.120
 seems to have a special ability to activate that tissue, local production of T3. And so

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:05.320
 I would say that eating enough sugar, having your orange juice and other fruit regularly

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:11.360
 throughout the day is much better than either chilling yourself or starving yourself.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.360
 Okay.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:21.880
 And may I just ask one more thing, just very quickly. If you were to choose a place to

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:28.040
 live just based on trying to get your metabolism high, would it be safe to say that you would

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:33.880
 choose a high altitude, warm, the warmest place at high altitude or?

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.880
 Yeah, like Peru.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.160
 Am I getting this right?

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:44.520
 Somewhere in Peru on a maybe 12 to 14,000 foot elevation near the equator.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.440
 How about Mauna Loa, Dr. Peat?

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.440
 I don't know how high it is.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.160
 I think it's about 8 or 9,000.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:40:03.280
 Oh yeah, I like Toluca, Mexico. A little chilly, but I really feel exhilarated at that altitude

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.840
 and I think it's better to be a little higher, 12,000 or so.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.760
 Probably less chance of getting bombed by the Koreans too. Anyway, thanks for your call,

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760
 caller.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.200
 Thanks very much for taking my call.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:21.120
 Okay, so for people who'd like to call in, the 800 number is 1-800-568-3723. Dr. Raymond

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:27.560
 Peat sharing his wisdom with us, going through the motions of how progesterone is demonized

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:32.680
 time and time again, both in the literature and by corporate scientific interests.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:40.440
 So Dr. Peat, I wanted to talk about the GABA receptor, excuse me, the GABA-A receptor in

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:48.720
 particular. I know that this is the receptor which progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone,

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.320
 which apparently is one of the more active metabolites, but that may just be hearsay

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:57.440
 too. I don't know what you have to say about allopregnanolone. These bind to the same GABA

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:06.640
 receptor producing that anxiolytic, that kind of calm, peaceful type nervous response because

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:14.360
 they block the excitatory stimulation and that Valeriana aficionadis, common valerian

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:20.800
 does just that and I remember very clearly some of our first Materia Medica that was

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:27.120
 taught to us about valerian and GABA receptors and chloride channels, etc. and how the whole

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.400
 exocytation is calmed down.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:40.880
 So in terms of the GABA channel, GABA receptor and progesterone or allopregnanolone's activity,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.600
 do you think the metabolite is more active than progesterone per se or do you think progesterone

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:54.160
 itself is still a good anxiolytic and calming agent? We talked about anti-inflammatory,

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160
 anti-edema.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:06.080
 Since prognanolone, the precursor for progesterone itself is pro-GABA, I suspect that progesterone

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:16.960
 in itself is, but it is converted, reduced chemically to form allopregnanolone and that

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:25.480
 seems to be the most powerful activator of the GABA system in the brain, but I think

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:35.240
 all of them are acting in the same direction and besides acting to reduce stress and excitation

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:43.400
 by activating GABA, progesterone also inhibits several of the excitatory processes including

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:49.320
 the glutamatergic and NMDA receptor systems.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.040
 Okay, we do have another caller, so let me hold your train of thought there before I

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.880
 question you some more. Caller, you're on the airwave. Where are you from and what's

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.880
 your question?

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.880
 Yeah, Buffalo, John.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.880
 Buffalo, New York?

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.880
 Yeah.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880
 Two callers from New York in one night.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:24.280
 Yeah, I had a question about the spine. So if someone has a disc herniation, so it either

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:34.480
 dries up or the gel breaks through, is it practically possible to regenerate that particular

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:41.880
 gel? Because I know you've mentioned, I think it's some studies that have been done where

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.440
 people have seen regeneration of different parts of the body, although it sounds crazy,

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:53.360
 but it seems like you said it's been done. So is it possible for the space between the

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.000
 disc vertebrae to regenerate?

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.400
 Dr. Peat, what do you think about that with that nucleus pulposus? Do you think that's

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.840
 possible to regenerate that? I'm sure you do, but...

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.960
 Yeah, I know people get well from it, but I've never seen x-ray evidence that they actually

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:17.760
 spaced out the distance between the vertebrae. I don't know whether the bones themselves

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:25.640
 can adjust. So I think it would be possible for the disc to rebuild itself and for the

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:32.520
 bones to conform themselves to the regenerating cartilage disc.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.920
 I'm sure you'd probably advocate the use of progesterone in and of itself for...

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920
 And thyroid.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920
 Yeah.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:50.080
 I've heard and seen knee joints and shoulder joints that were making noise and causing

00:44:50.080 --> 00:45:03.840
 relative immobility to the person to heal themselves from an hour to overnight, a completely

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:11.080
 functionless knee recuperated to the point that the guy had to come to the house just

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:16.280
 to run up and down my stairs to show what had happened to his knee.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:22.760
 Well, this is just sort of a testimony. I've had six knee operations and three herniated

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:32.480
 discs and I'm over 60. And by being on your diet and mitigating PUFA primarily and trying

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.800
 to do the other stuff that you talk about, I almost have no pain. I must say though,

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:45.360
 the red light is my go-to thing. If things go bad, the red light kind of just eliminates

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.320
 pain almost immediately. I can't say that for the other products you speak about, but

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:56.240
 I believe the progesterone. I just don't know much about it, but the red light has been

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.240
 amazing.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:03.080
 Have you ever tried applying a progesterone-based oil to the area on your spine where you say

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.560
 you have a herniated disc? Have you tried that? And I don't know if you're using aspirin

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:16.880
 as an anti-inflammatory compound to reduce swelling. Obviously, that's a primary importance

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.760
 during that type of repair.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:26.440
 It's funny you mentioned that because I did run today and I literally put a paper towel

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:32.880
 in that aspirin solution that Dr. Peat had previously suggested. So I do do that. I do believe it.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.400
 It doesn't just help locally, but I think based on what I've read in his aspirin articles,

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:45.640
 it actually helps systemically in a body temperature metabolism. It's just like aspirin is kind

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:52.160
 of an unappreciated product as you've well documented.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:58.040
 But no, I've never tried progesterone on the spine, but I remember in one of your programs,

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:03.840
 I believe, or another one that Dr. Peat said you can put progesterone on like a mole or

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:09.160
 maybe you were talking about that or DHA and you put it near a mole and it moved around

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.360
 and eventually it got better. Is that also possible?

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:22.120
 Putting it next to the mole, the pigment cells are extremely mobile. If your skin is warm,

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:29.560
 like in summer, they can travel through your skin close to an inch per day. And if you

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:37.200
 know what they're looking for, depending on whether it's on your forehead or your wrist

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:43.880
 or your chest, if you put it in the right place, they will apparently satisfy their

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:51.480
 need for the progesterone or DHA and leave, go back to where they should be to keep your

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.440
 hair pigmented, for example.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:48:00.920
 So the mole just kind of breaks up because the pigment sort of doesn't clump together?

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:09.080
 Yeah, the cells congregate because they're deprived of something where they came from.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:17.080
 For example, on my temple, I applied, I forget which was DHA or progesterone on the front

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:27.600
 side and the next day there was a ring of pigment cells nearly an inch to the back side

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:36.240
 and the mole itself had shrunk. The second day I applied another dab in front of it and

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:44.640
 the following day there was like a bullseye, two brown rings spaced out in a curved line

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:53.000
 behind it and the mole itself was again smaller. And I kept doing that and within a few days,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:04.200
 a red, shiny blood vessel constricted the base. It had been as big as a dime and it

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:10.760
 constricted down to about the diameter of a matchstick and then dried up and fell off

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.480
 and didn't leave a scar.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:19.280
 Wow. Well, thank you. Andrew had mentioned about GABA and so it just sparked a question

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:25.440
 based on his comment. Is GABA something you can take as a supplement or does that mess

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.760
 up the rest of your neurotransmitters? Because I know people say, "Oh, you can take B6 and

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.960
 it gets your dopamine up," but doesn't that mess up the balance? How do you deal with

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960
 that?

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:41.680
 In animal studies, when they gave it to a healthy animal, none of it seemed to get into

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:49.640
 the brain. But if the animal had been sleep-deprived, so its brain really needed GABA and was in

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:54.560
 an excited state, then the GABA was able to get in the brain and relax it.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.760
 Okay, we do have another caller, so let's make sure we get this. Thanks for your caller

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.320
 call. I don't mean to cut you off so quick, but we do have another one. And where are

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.000
 you from and what's your question?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.200
 Dr. Peat, hello. My name's Chris. I'm calling from Garboville, California in southern Humboldt

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:16.720
 County. I've tried something called monk fruit sugar, which you may be familiar with. Okay,

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:22.040
 monk fruit sugar is a melon and it comes from southern China. I recently found out about

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.360
 it and about three months ago I purchased two pounds of it and I stopped eating table

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:33.080
 sugar, entirely granulated white table sugar, thank goodness, and brown table sugar. Went

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:38.960
 to this organic product, tried it, ate like a pound and a half of it over a month, just

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:45.000
 you know, putting it on cereal and etc. And all the pain in my body, I think from the

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.840
 sugar inflammation, absolutely disappeared, including like the toes and extremities. I'm

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.920
 63 years old, I'm a big guy, but I'm in the process of losing a considerable amount of

00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:01.480
 weight. And why I'm telling you about monk fruit sugar is I seem to be progressively

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:07.400
 losing weight. I'm interested in knowing about the anti-inflammatories. I also have been

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:14.080
 promoting stevia sugar on another radio station in San Francisco called KGO about 15 years

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:21.640
 ago and it's kind of taken over in America because of its anti-inflammatory low glycemic

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:27.040
 index, actually zero glycemic. Monk fruit sugar, if you go online and look at it, zero

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:33.920
 glycemic, it's almost exactly like white table sugar, tastes the same, but it's zero glycemic.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:39.800
 So any diabetics out there might want to try monk fruit sugar, which you can buy at local

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:44.600
 health food stores. It's more expensive, but boy, talk about prevention and a pound of

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:53.800
 cure and all that. What do you think of this? Have you heard of this product, Dr. Peat? The

00:51:53.800 --> 00:52:02.840
 effect that I was describing of ordinary sucrose, for example, in orange juice is able to stimulate

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:12.240
 weight loss by activating the T3 in your fat cells. So fructose is available at health

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:19.840
 food stores in the pure form. If a person is diabetic, that doesn't increase the blood

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.040
 glucose, the weight. Are you still with me? Yes. Okay. What I'm telling you about this

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:35.200
 monk fruit sugar, MONK fruit sugar, is that it's zero glycemic. It seems to go in and

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:40.080
 everybody in America, everybody in the world has eaten table sugar over a lifetime. But

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:46.360
 what does it contain? I don't know. It's a melon, but I don't know what the constituencies

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:54.480
 of it is. I think it's mixed with erythritrol, which is the stevia product. But the monk

00:52:54.480 --> 00:53:00.320
 fruit, when I purchased it and ate it, and spent about two months now, I have absolutely

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:06.320
 no problems with inflammation. It seems to have neutralized the inflammation. I have,

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:11.880
 after that two months were over, I started eating white table sugar again and organic

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:17.720
 brown sugar. And it absolutely has negated the effect, all the inflammatory effects of

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:24.280
 that white sugar as I've been eating it. I was doing my own experimental study. So I've

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:29.000
 been telling everybody about it that's overweight that they should go from eating granulated

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:35.200
 cane sugar, table sugar, to this monk fruit sugar that's in melon form and zero glycemic.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:44.040
 Well, I'd be interested to know what constituents it has. As far as stevia is concerned, I think

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:50.760
 it's a pretty toxic product. And like xylitol and all the other sugar substitutes, I do

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:55.600
 believe that there's a lot more negative effects to them than any positive effects from any

00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:04.000
 lower calories or insulin sensitivity type reactions from their non-sugar sugar. But

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.480
 I've never, yeah, I know there's lots of information out there that will say that sugar is toxic

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:14.680
 or it's pure, white and deadly, etc. And we've totally visited it. And I don't think there's

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:20.040
 any mileage in it. Not too sure why it is that you would have had your inflammation

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.000
 clear up, but it's good that you did. Who knows what else is going on with you, with

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.040
 your thyroid, etc. You said you were pretty large. I don't know if you have any metabolic

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:36.960
 issues, maybe have some low thyroid situation happening with you. But typically, those situations

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:42.600
 that do predispose to toxin buildup and that obviously has its effects as does weight on

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.400
 the joints. So I think all of those things kind of work against you. But yeah, happy

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:52.320
 that you got a reduction in your inflammation. But anyway, Dr. Peat, thank you very much for

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:57.800
 joining the show again. Appreciate your time so much. And we didn't get through much this

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:03.400
 evening, but I appreciate the call as I called. Perhaps we'll carry on next month and then

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:08.720
 go on to another topic from there. Okay, very good. Thanks for your time. Okay, so people

00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:13.360
 that have tuned into this evening's show, if you place calls, thanks for your calls

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:21.160
 and input. For people that want to find out more about Dr. Peat, www.rayPeate.com, fully

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:26.000
 referenced scientific articles that have been produced and plenty of information and references

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.040
 to back up what he's saying. Again, for those people who have listened to the show this

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:35.160
 evening, the first part I was mentioning about the use of progesterone in traumatic brain

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:44.680
 injury, do take a look at those two studies. One, excuse me, was the Synapse Study and

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:50.440
 the other one was the PROTECT-3. Read them. I mean, they seem to show that there is no

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:59.040
 benefit and yet Dr. Donald Stein has produced a paper here in 2017 in the Journal of Neurotrauma.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:05.040
 He's been a brain specialist for 30 years. That's all he's done. And his paper here,

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:09.840
 I think, outlines quite clearly the shortfalls of the study and that actually progesterone

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:16.280
 is a very good model for treating this kind of disorder. So there's certainly hope there

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.160
 and progesterone has got a lot of other benefits that we didn't get into. I know we've mentioned

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:28.240
 it on other shows but certainly not the product that the industry would like to tell you it

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:33.360
 is because it's actually estrogen. So again, things back to front. Well, thanks for joining

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.680
 us and till 7 o'clock next Thursday, the third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 p.m. my

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:45.440
 name is Andrew Murray. If anybody wants to reach us, we have an 800 or 188 number, it's

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:51.600
 888 WBMHERB or through our website which is westernbotanicalmedicine.com. So see you next
