00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 - Well, welcome to the Get Fit with Jodelle podcast.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.040
 I am as usual, Jodelle, and as usual,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.200
 I am thrilled to have Dr. Pete, Dr. Raymond Pete

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
 here with me again.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.780
 I always love podcasting with you, Dr. Pete,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.320
 you're a wealth of information.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.280
 And I know my listeners enjoy it too,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.680
 because I asked for questions

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 and I always get a slew of questions for you, Dr. Pete.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.280
 So once again, you guys,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.160
 if you're not familiar with Dr. Raymond Pete,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.600
 please go to raypete.com,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.400
 that's R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.240
 And you can learn a vast amount of knowledge

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.000
 about an individual with a vast amount of knowledge.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.120
 He's got lots of articles, blogs, books

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.320
 that will blow your mind.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.280
 And he's been doing this longer

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.880
 than most people have been alive.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.600
 So at least who are listening to this podcast.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.080
 So he knows a thing or two,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 he's not one of these 30 something year olds on YouTube

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.280
 telling people what to do.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.080
 He's been around long enough to understand

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.720
 how the body works, how hormones work.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.640
 And he also has a passion for educating others,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.920
 which I love, so Dr. Pete, welcome.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.880
 - Thank you.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 - Yeah, it's great to have you.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 So we got a slew of questions in

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240
 when I field it out for questions on YouTube.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.280
 But before we dive into those,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.120
 I really wanna tell you how much I enjoyed

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.080
 your most recent newsletter

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.360
 on injecting the spike protein from a coronavirus.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.040
 And it was just really interesting

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.640
 because there were so many things in there

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.920
 I wasn't familiar with.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.280
 And so you guys, if you haven't checked out

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.360
 Dr. Pete's newsletter,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.080
 you can go to raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.380
 and you can ask for that.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.720
 You can request it to either be emailed to you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.480
 or sent through the mail and it's very affordable.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.960
 And so you can get information by emailing

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.880
 at raypeatsnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.520
 I highly recommend it because I always look forward to it.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.040
 When I see it in my inbox, I always learn something.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.140
 So can I ask you, Dr. Pete,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.440
 it was shown in studies when they inject this spike protein

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.080
 to cause the lungs to fail.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.920
 Why was that?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.920
 - Oh yeah, it's a whole series of things actually,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.040
 but that was 2005, I think, when that was published.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.640
 When that was published around that time,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.640
 it has been tested in various ways

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.960
 and they simply saw that the lungs developed edema

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.520
 and fibrosis and the animal died

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.880
 because the lungs were full of water

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 and starting to become scar tissue-like.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.760
 But there were people who continued along that line

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.800
 trying to identify exactly what the spike protein was doing.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.720
 But the most relevant fact is that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.800
 before the pandemic began for 15 years,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.760
 people had been talking about how deadly it is

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.040
 to have the spike protein in your body.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 Yet they went ahead making that a vaccine so-called.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.840
 Around 2005, trying to identify just what was happening,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.160
 but looking primarily at the lungs at that time,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.160
 they saw that the body formed antibodies to the spike protein

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.860
 and the antibodies against it were also toxic to the lungs.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:01.000
 And the antibody to the anti-spike protein antibody

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.600
 so you get a series, your body reacts first

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.640
 to the spike protein making an antibody

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.640
 which itself is harmful to the lungs

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.860
 and then your body has that harmful antibody

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.660
 that we're producing

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.660
 and it makes an antibody to that antibody

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.420
 and the antibody to the antibody

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.420
 looks at, has the same shape as the spike protein

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.940
 because the first antibody formed a mirror image of it.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.820
 The second antibody makes a mirror image

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.860
 of the first antibody which turns out

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.820
 to be an exact copy of the spike protein.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060
 So when you insert an unknown antigen,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:17.520
 people at that time had essentially no idea

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.740
 what your immune system was doing.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.800
 The first wave of antibodies itself is toxic

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.920
 but your body keeps like all of a mirror image

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.040
 of your mirrors that keeps making antibodies

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.040
 against the antibodies and against those antibodies

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.340
 so you have a constant like an echo

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.500
 going through your antibody system

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.920
 and every alternate antibody wave resembles in shape

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 this starting thing that evoked the immune response.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:14.140
 So at the time I was teaching immunology 1979,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:21.840
 that was a fairly new observation.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.520
 It was always happening but people just hadn't thought

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.520
 about what it means to have waves of neutralizing

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.440
 and imitating antibodies for me every time

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.440
 you are exposed to an antigen.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.100
 - So if these spike proteins are damaging

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.520
 and cause the lungs to fail,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.660
 what about people that get the vaccine

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.760
 and then they get the second shot

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.200
 and then they get the boosters

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.320
 and they continue to bombard their body

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.160
 with the spike protein,

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.920
 what's gonna happen to the body

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.300
 with that much exposure to spike protein?

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.220
 - Can't do anything but get worse.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.440
 When you see the fundamental damage within the lungs

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:25.080
 and that isn't looking at any of our antibodies

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.080
 at any of our other basic toxic reactions to it.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:38.240
 For example, spike protein is when it's exposed

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.720
 to the bloodstream, taking it all through the body,

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:51.840
 enters and is reproduced in the endothelial cells

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.680
 lining the blood vessels all the way through your body,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.680
 through every organ and that sets up,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:11.480
 your body sees that foreign material is being produced

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.160
 on the lining of your blood vessels

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.960
 and that causes first irritation reaction

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.960
 like histamine and serotonin and it causes platelets

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:31.480
 to begin clumping and sticking to the abnormal site

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:38.000
 and the platelets release histamine and serotonin.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.840
 The serotonin activates further clotting processes

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.680
 that spread through the body.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.680
 So one of the worst tendencies being exposed to the vaccine

00:08:52.680 --> 00:09:00.840
 which puts the spike protein on all of your blood vessel

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:08.600
 lining cells, the basic reaction is it causes diffuse pots

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 to form and in reaction to that then you're consuming

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.080
 your platelets and the platelets cause small circulating clots

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:32.280
 which can block the veins and capillaries

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:38.080
 in the brain causing strokes.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.040
 Similar things happen in the heart.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.600
 Ovaries concentrate at the highest level, the spike protein

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:53.080
 and so clotting and the consequent inflammation

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.680
 affects all of these organs.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.560
 - Okay, so definitely wanna reconsider maybe

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.480
 how much spike protein people are getting exposed to.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.200
 Now your newsletter also mentioned

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.160
 how ionizing radiation such as that comes from wifi

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.560
 and smartphones also creates cytokines and inflammation.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.800
 Are we more susceptible to illnesses and viruses

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.480
 depending on how much exposure

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.880
 to EMF radiation we receive daily?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:32.520
 - Yeah, anything recognized by the body is as harmful.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.040
 We'll start releasing things such as histamine

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.040
 and serotonin and then the serotonin

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.160
 and the coagulating, clumping platelets

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:54.680
 release many other harmful pro-coagulant

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.840
 and anti-coagulant materials.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.600
 So at some point you run out of platelets

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.800
 and hemorrhage becomes the problem.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:06.880
 - Hmm.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.760
 - One of the doctors who died fairly quickly

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.760
 after vaccination had a very rare condition

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.840
 in which he simply, they said they had never seen anything

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:29.200
 like it, had a platelet count of one or zero.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.400
 Only 100,000 and so everything became a leaky hemorrhage.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:49.040
 - Yeah, I knew an individual that passed away from COVID-19.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.040
 Now I don't know if this individual was vaccinated or not

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.720
 but I can tell you that this individual

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.280
 was very, very EMF focused.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.440
 Like they were always around the device,

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.040
 always around a lot of different smartphone technology

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.000
 and smart technology.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.360
 Their whole house was smart technology.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.080
 Everything was run by the phone and stuff.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.120
 So I'm just wondering if that made that person's body

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.120
 more susceptible to actually having a worse case

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.800
 and then ending up on a ventilator

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.720
 and then ending up dying just from the act

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.760
 of living a stressful life.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.480
 - Everything that doesn't please the body meeting its needs

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.840
 becomes a promoter of inflammation, coagulation

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:43.320
 and potential hemorrhage development eventually

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.320
 in the long run of fibrosis and tissue degeneration.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:58.360
 The angiotensin system is thought of a blood pressure

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.680
 regulator primarily but angiotensin has a series

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:13.640
 of enzymes, slight stress or damage will cause you

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.960
 to produce the peptide called angiotensin two

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:25.560
 which spreads around your body activating the inflammatory

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.080
 and blood vessel contraction system.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:39.480
 But we also have a limiting enzyme which destroys

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:47.000
 that pro-inflammatory peptide and blood pressure eraser.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.760
 This is called the ACE2 proteolytic enzyme

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:00.360
 which the COVID people call a receptor

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.400
 for the spike protein of the virus.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.360
 That's how the virus primarily gets in your cells

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.360
 is by binding to and inactivating the enzyme

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:22.840
 that inactivates the pro-inflammatory angiotensin peptide.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.640
 So the evil of the virus is that it knocks out

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:35.680
 our own basic anti-inflammatory system right at the root.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:41.960
 The ACE2 enzyme that is known as the receptor

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:49.080
 for the virus is our primary defense against inflammation.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 So people looking at the nature of the disease

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.480
 even though the function of the ACE2 enzyme

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.880
 have been known for more than 10 years,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.880
 people were developing patents on injecting,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:18.840
 producing in the lab large amounts of ACE2 enzyme

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.960
 because it destroys the endotensin inflammatory peptide.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.600
 So it was a very good idea for a treatment

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.600
 of anything like the, it would work for anything

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:42.040
 from high blood pressure to the COVID virus to cancer

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.820
 because inflammation is at the root of all of those.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.480
 - Absolutely, like inflammation is essentially chaos

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.920
 in their body and so yeah, if we can calm the chaos

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.520
 from all its many facets that it comes at us,

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.120
 I'm pretty sure we can have a more robust immune system.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.920
 So, well, I really appreciated your newsletter.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.080
 What were you gonna say?

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:13.480
 - Just that many treatments are known to give a boost

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.040
 to our natural production of ACE2 enzyme

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.160
 that inhibits the inflammatory system and yeah.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:33.760
 - What are those treatments that you would recommend?

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:41.680
 - The Chinese started with, it was known to them

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:48.280
 as an anti-serotonin agent used somewhat

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.200
 like an antihistamine drugs but it turned out

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.200
 to be very effective against the COVID infection

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.680
 and that detected an anti-inflammatory,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.160
 anti-serotonin thing was helpful.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.160
 They found that antihistamines and aspirin in fact,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.800
 anything anti-inflammatory and many anti-coagulants

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.280
 because inflammation leads to coagulation,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.660
 coagulation amplifies inflammation.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:33.720
 So, the basic insight about 15 years ago

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.720
 is that getting your ACE2 protective insulin

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.240
 to increase, that turns out to be the essence

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:51.800
 of treating and curing COVID.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:58.720
 The studies that they've given primarily anti-inflammatory

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:05.000
 and anti-coagulant treatments including aspirin

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.120
 and antihistamines, those studies showed

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.620
 if they did it quickly, during the time

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.400
 that our government for the last year and a half

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.400
 has been telling the public that there is no treatment

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:29.480
 for early COVID, all they can do is wait

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:34.400
 until you can't breathe and then go to the hospital.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.240
 And if you really can't breathe, they'll put you

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.040
 on a ventilator and just being on a ventilator

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.000
 for a week or two is enough to kill you

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.600
 by destroying your lungs.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.200
 So, by telling doctors of the world

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.200
 that there is no treatment for the early stages of COVID,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:03.240
 telling doctors not to treat with any of the known drugs

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.240
 but through producing fraudulent research,

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:15.800
 to say that it is more harmful to use hydroxychloroquine

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:23.320
 than to use nothing, a real campaign

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:28.800
 to prevent any treatment other than producing oxygen

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.100
 when it's too late to cure it.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.200
 But the studies that went directly

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.200
 to the anti-coagulant drug had 70 or 80% survival

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:52.720
 versus almost no survival ones that were intubated.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.880
 - Yeah, 'cause I was noticing, I was kind of thinking back

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.760
 to like they're putting people on a ventilator

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.920
 but in order to do that, they have to give them

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.500
 a benzodiazepine, which from my understanding

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.160
 lowers immune function.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.040
 So, I mean, if you're giving your patient a benzo

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.440
 and you expect them to fight through a virus,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.440
 they're not gonna be able to do it, right?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.400
 - Yeah, they basically make them unconscious

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.420
 and then pump oxygen in.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:31.640
 For example, two German hospitals in the same city

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:37.400
 one of them was following American procedures,

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:44.080
 giving tube-force oxygen to their patients

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.680
 as the basic treatment.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:52.680
 They had 60% mortality in that hospital

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.680
 and right across the city, a very similar hospital

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.640
 happened to have a doctor who refused

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.180
 to put his people on forced ventilation,

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:12.180
 gave them just a cannula in the nose with enriched oxygen

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:19.400
 and he had essentially 100% survival.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.640
 - Wow, that's awesome.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.060
 Well, I just really wanted to bring up your newsletter

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.960
 because on the subject of immunology,

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.960
 it was really wonderful.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.840
 So people need to really get that

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.440
 if they haven't subscribed to that yet.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.680
 So we'll jump into some questions here.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.600
 The first one we had an individual who asked,

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.200
 can you please ask Dr. Pete

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.320
 after of course nutrition and thyroid

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.160
 and youth promoting hormones,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.400
 is there any way to reopen growth plates

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.600
 so that someone can grow taller?

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.960
 Does he believe the idea that growth plates close?

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.240
 - There are some animal observations

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.880
 that suggests that that can happen

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.040
 but it hasn't been studied in detail.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.040
 And for example, iguanas which have bone anatomy

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.260
 more or less similar to mammals,

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:23.260
 they've banded them, measured their weight and length.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.920
 And when they went back after a year or so of famine,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.880
 they found that the whole iguana, bones and all

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.580
 had become shorter.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:50.340
 In a symmetrical way, the bones were revised

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.860
 to go with a smaller animal.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:01.440
 So that suggests that under the right circumstances,

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.660
 fully mature bone can ungrow.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:14.160
 In many people with some hypothyroidism,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.560
 there is enough immature bone around the growth plates

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.120
 and things aren't turned off until maybe around the age of 50.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.440
 When I was in my forties,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.440
 I had experimented taking thyroid progesterone, the HCA,

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:45.320
 and notice that some of my physical characteristics

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.920
 changed during that period.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.040
 But when we moved out of the house,

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:57.480
 there had been marks on the door frames

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.480
 that made 11 years earlier when I was 14 versus 52 or 53.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:13.600
 And I had grown an inch sometimes during my forties,

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.200
 late forties probably.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.960
 And I mentioned that other people,

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:27.400
 especially people who were slightly taller than average,

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.080
 told me that they hadn't finished growth

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.320
 until they were in their mid forties.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.200
 - You know, I would believe that

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.720
 because I was always 5'9" when I was in my teens and 20s.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.520
 And now when I tell people I'm 5'9", they go,

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.720
 "I don't think you're 5'9",

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.000
 I think you're taller than that,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.720
 but I have never measured myself.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.920
 But I just wonder if maybe I have grown over the years,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.920
 'cause I don't seem to fit that mold of the 5'9" or whatever.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:03.920
 - Yeah, but my experience with the marks door frames,

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:10.040
 I was about 50 at the end of that period.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.360
 But still, having...

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.940
 (upbeat music)

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.100
 (silence)

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.940
 - Okay, so Rhonda asks,

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.260
 "Can you discuss reverse T3 and what to do about it?

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.140
 Can you get reverse T3 from using too much T3 medication?"

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.540
 So what about reverse T3?

00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:00.940
 - Yeah, T3, the active hormone,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.020
 can't be changed in the reverse T3.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:10.020
 And one of my first eye-opening observations

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.820
 in the thyroid function was

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.820
 at the University of Oregon Medical School.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:28.740
 A patient was brought in completely unconscious

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.980
 in a mixodema coma.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:37.020
 And her doctor had been giving her

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.020
 100 microgrammages of T4 synthroid,

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.340
 and she got worse, more hypothyroid.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.340
 So he progressively increased it to 200 and 300.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:58.700
 When he reached 500 microgrammages of T4 per day,

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.820
 she entered the coma.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:07.780
 And a doctor in the hospital had the insight

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.540
 that even in particular,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:17.460
 because of the effects of estrogen on the liver,

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:24.220
 estrogen blocks the conversion of T4 to T3

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.380
 and turns it into reverse T3.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:34.780
 So he put her on pure T3 around,

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:40.140
 I think it was 25 microgrammages per day,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.140
 zero thyroxin, and immediately she recovered.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:50.860
 All she needed was a more balanced ratio

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.180
 between T4 and T3.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:57.020
 And when your stress hormones rise,

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:02.300
 happens because you don't get enough T3

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:07.300
 and the sugar and carbon dioxide metabolism are suppressed.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:15.100
 The T4 excess turns into reverse T3

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:25.780
 and turns off your metabolism.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:31.140
 The higher the stress acting on the thyroxin

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:38.380
 in the absence of T3 turns fairly massive amounts

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.820
 of the T4 in the blocking reverse T3.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.940
 - So if they're supplementing T3,

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.580
 they don't have anything to worry about that

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.460
 converting to reverse T3,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.540
 but they still need to dial in their stress

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.220
 because just that act of always releasing cortisol

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.540
 and making new estrogen from stress

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.740
 could cause more reverse T3,

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.420
 even in the midst of like a T3 medication?

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.660
 - Yeah, and lots of pharmacists and doctors

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.620
 advise if a person is prescribed T3,

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:20.500
 it's common to advise them to take their pill,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.420
 25 or 50 micrograms, whatever's prescribed,

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.460
 for them to take that pill

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.500
 on an empty stomach in the morning.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:34.260
 And what happens then is that your body

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:40.580
 gets approximately 25 times higher T3

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:48.140
 at that moment than is physiological

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.300
 because you might produce 50 micrograms

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.340
 in the whole day.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.620
 But if you take a breakfast on an empty stomach,

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.820
 it almost all goes immediately into your bloodstream.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.980
 It is perceived as a toxic excess.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.740
 And so your liver increases enzymes

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:16.700
 and your liver begins excreting,

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.700
 inactivating the high level of T3 in the morning.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:29.940
 And after getting your liver accustomed to doing that,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.660
 by nightfall, 12 to 15 hours later,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:43.580
 your body is experiencing extreme hypothyroidism

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.220
 because you have trained the liver

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.260
 to excrete it 25 times faster than it should.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:56.140
 - So they really need to, how would you recommend dosing?

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.820
 It sounds like they need to split up the dose

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.300
 maybe twice a day or maybe they shouldn't take a huge dose

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.660
 first thing in the morning.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.100
 - Definitely, yeah.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:12.100
 I experienced that myself taking my pill only in the morning

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:18.300
 but I developed an extremely erratic heart rhythm

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:25.100
 and in the middle of this interrupted heartbeat,

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:32.100
 I chewed up a 10 microgram tablet of T3

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:38.140
 and within about 15 seconds of chewing the pill,

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.440
 my heart was perfectly rhythmic.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.460
 And after that, I recommended that people

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.540
 just take a little bite off their T3 tablet

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:57.140
 all during the day so they can get the approximately

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.460
 right amount during the day,

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:04.460
 but never anything like 20 or 25 micrograms at one gulp.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:12.660
 - And so, yeah, so carry that little tablet

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.820
 and kind of gnaw on it,

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.300
 but should you not still do it with a meal?

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.500
 Should it always be kind of on an empty stomach

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.780
 or is it okay to do it with two?

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:24.780
 - Oh, yeah, you can go by how you feel

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:29.500
 and most people get away with, for example,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.060
 eight or 10 micrograms with every meal

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:38.460
 and maybe five or 10 micrograms at bedtime.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.260
 - Okay, so Katya, I think part of her question

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.660
 got cut off on YouTube,

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.620
 but I think she's talking about a person in her life

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.540
 who has gained weight and has edema more on the left side.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.100
 She's 17 years old and two months ago,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.100
 she was almost 90 kilograms.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.900
 Now she is more.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.340
 She was on T4 and T3 for two months,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.780
 but now just T3 now, she does have a mitral prolapse

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.700
 and her heart is now,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.660
 and heart now is on upper size limit.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.140
 She's on vitamin E, D3, K2 and T3.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.740
 One liter of milk a day, she doesn't like liver.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.420
 How can she lose weight?

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.580
 So apparently she's gained some weight

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.260
 and it sounds like her thyroid is really on the fritz.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:35.340
 - Yeah, the mitral prolapse is very, very common

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.860
 when your thyroid and progesterone are low.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.940
 So she should keep a close watch

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.500
 on both thyroid and progesterone.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.860
 Keep your oxidative metabolism going.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:57.260
 The metabolism of sodium and calcium is very important.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:04.540
 Calcium, in particular,

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.860
 helps to suppress parathyroid hormone.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.860
 And parathyroid hormone works pretty much the same

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.820
 as the absence of thyroid hormone.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.580
 It turns off your mitochondrial energy production.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.260
 So you want to get your mitochondria

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:32.260
 producing carbon dioxide and metabolizing sugar

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.700
 and fat effectively.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:41.540
 Thyroid itself is being blocked by high parathyroid hormone.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:49.540
 So taking maybe two liters of low fat milk every day,

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:58.580
 four or 5,000 international units of vitamin D per day

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.940
 and adjusting the dose of thyroid,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.820
 emphasizing the T3 component

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:14.220
 according to how it affects your heart rate and temperature.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.940
 You want your temperature to rise

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.100
 towards normal by the middle of the day.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.940
 - Okay, and it sounds like they didn't put

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.420
 that she's on progesterone.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.420
 So that might be something for her to consider

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.740
 as trying progesterone

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.260
 because I didn't see that anywhere in her protocol.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.260
 So there you go.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:42.340
 - The liver's reaction to progesterone

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:46.540
 is similar to that of T3.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:52.780
 If you don't interrupt your progesterone intake

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:57.180
 roughly once a month,

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:01.260
 your liver starts excreting it faster and faster

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.540
 and so it loses its effect.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:10.620
 So you want to reinforce your natural menstrual cycle

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.980
 as you supplement the progesterone.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:17.460
 - Okay, Christopher asks,

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.660
 there's been a big movement

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.940
 against taking high vitamin A foods

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.660
 and Ray Peat had said that he could not take vitamin E

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.180
 at all anywhere near his lips,

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.580
 otherwise he'd get a migraine.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.660
 How can you explain vitamin A toxicity?

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:32.500
 Thank you.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:37.460
 - Oh, before that happened,

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:42.620
 the vitamin A products, for example,

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.180
 almost all of them were made in the US

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:52.180
 and I took 50 to 100,000 units a day with no problem.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:58.660
 But around the time that the vitamin A industry

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:04.500
 and vitamins in general moved to be produced in China,

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:10.700
 that was when I developed the extreme sensitivity

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:16.220
 to apparent allergies or something in vitamin A.

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:22.340
 So that, I haven't tried synthetic vitamin A

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.860
 any time in this period, it was so awful,

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.100
 but it could be that the Chinese have improved

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.340
 their vitamin A technique.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:38.340
 But since the 1930s,

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.140
 there has been a lot of mythology

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:48.140
 about the dangers of vitamin A excess.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.900
 And most of it is completely unscientific.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.740
 Animal studies, for example, found that

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:05.220
 a moderate excess of vitamin A in developing chicks

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:11.460
 caused their brain to stay outside of their skull

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:18.340
 when they had and adding vitamin E

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:24.540
 to the system stopped that from happening.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.580
 And so they were showing that the excess vitamin A

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.700
 was autooxidizing, catalyzing its own oxidation.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:42.740
 And the oxidized product was what was toxic.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.780
 So if there's a toxic reaction to vitamin A,

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.780
 it's most likely in vitamin E deficiency.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.420
 - Good to know.

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.380
 Okay, so then we have one individual asked,

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.740
 how can we increase our intelligence?

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.060
 Apparently this individual wants to get smarter.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.660
 So how would you say we do that?

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:12.100
 - Making sure that your thyroid function is optimal

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.060
 and the good balanced vitamin intake

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:27.940
 in just a matter of hours and lasting for a day or two,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:34.700
 a good dose of vitamin B1 can greatly

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.740
 increase a person's learning power.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:43.700
 When I was teaching English classes in Mexico,

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.060
 they were evening classes and the people would arrive

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:54.500
 poorly nourished and tired after work.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.500
 And so I made them high protein cookies

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:05.740
 spiked with vitamin B1 and have a pre-class snack

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.980
 of cookies and coffee.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.980
 And right from that moment, they became good students.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.620
 Before that, they could seem to learn something

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:27.580
 during the hour, but they wouldn't remember it the next day.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.420
 - I'm all about protein.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.900
 I really think that just the amino acids

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.340
 that converts from protein

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.740
 really can help boost brain capacity.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.940
 So yeah, I'm with you on the high protein foods

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.580
 like your little high protein cookies.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.580
 That sounds good.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.500
 All right.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.300
 - Yeah, one of my professors had just considered

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.820
 the rabbit and the cat.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:58.500
 He told his students at the university

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.820
 that they should have a diet more like a cat than a rabbit

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:06.340
 if they want their brain to work well.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.180
 - I like that.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.820
 I'm gonna have to use that with clients.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.820
 - Okay, so me free to says Crohn's solution, please.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.660
 Thank you, Dr. Pete.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.460
 So something to be a solution for Crohn's disease.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:25.460
 - Oh, the whole thing starting with making sure

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:30.580
 your hormones aren't sensitizing you to mild irritants

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:36.740
 and then checking your foods to see

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:41.740
 that they're well selected and well appropriately cooked.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:49.540
 And each type of food can be very peculiar

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:53.420
 in how you allergic to react to it.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:42:00.380
 For example, a person with a sensitive intestine

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:05.380
 might be able to sometimes to eat a raw apple,

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.140
 but applesauce can cause extreme colitis

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:16.420
 because every little change in the way you cook a food

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:22.740
 increase or decrease the allergenicity.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:28.980
 Thyroid and progesterone as well as the adrenal

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.620
 glucocorticoids are essential

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:40.620
 for avoiding chronic inflammatory diseases.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.900
 - What do you feel about bile?

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.940
 Like how big of a factor is really making sure

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:50.860
 people are dialing in their bile to help with things

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.340
 like irritable bowel and Crohn's and colitis?

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:58.220
 - Oh yeah, estrogen is the main thing

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.940
 that slows down liver metabolism

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.700
 and changes the balance of components in the bile

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.180
 tending to create stones.

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:16.180
 And probably the same things that cause

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:21.780
 stone accumulation in the bladder and kidneys

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.420
 and soft tissues, hardening of the arteries and so on.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:30.780
 Those same things such as a calcium deficient,

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.380
 vitamin D deficient bile,

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:38.380
 those will help to create a stone deposition.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:44.180
 But high estrogen unopposed is very close

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:50.380
 to the whole range of gallbladder and liver symptoms.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:55.340
 - I completely agree because the people that I'll see

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.060
 come in with, they've had their gallbladders removed,

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.180
 you can tell they've had high estrogen,

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.820
 excess estrogen dominance for a long time.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.940
 But ironically, the bile is also what binds on

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.020
 to that old estrogen that's going through the gut

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.060
 and pulls it out.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.260
 So if their bile is not working because of high estrogen,

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.660
 then it's like this vicious circle

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.260
 'cause then they're getting this old recycled estrogen

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.100
 going back into the system, yeah?

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:25.380
 - Yeah, and a good high fiber diet is one way

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:30.380
 to catch the excreted estrogen and get it out of the body

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.940
 preventing its reabsorption.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:39.020
 And thyroid and progesterone are the main hormones

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.740
 making the gallbladder work.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.540
 - Cool, yeah, I'm a bile-philiac.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.900
 I love talking about bile,

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.100
 so that was something I had to throw in there.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.620
 Okay, so it says, does Dr. Pete know

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:56.620
 if taking liquid vitamin D3 combined with vitamin K2 orally

00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.260
 allows both vitamins to be absorbed

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.940
 or does one inhibit the absorption of other than others?

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:08.780
 - I don't think either one seriously interferes

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.620
 with the other.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.980
 - Okay, yeah, 'cause my understanding was K2

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.820
 helps the vitamin D get absorbed, correct?

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:23.820
 - Well, yeah, if you have a little bit of fat on the diet,

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:31.740
 it's all going to get absorbed before it leaves your body.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:38.940
 If you have an extremely high fiber diet,

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.460
 you might lose most of your oil and vitamins

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:46.020
 stuck to the fibrous foods.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.140
 - Ellie Z asks, what are typical symptoms

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.160
 of taking too much thyroid?

00:45:53.160 --> 00:46:00.940
 - You get, the first thing you usually notice

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:05.940
 is you're easily winded just getting up

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.940
 and walking across the room

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.220
 might make you breathe noticeably harder.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:19.220
 And your hands tend to get pink and moist.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:24.420
 Hands and feet are as warm as the rest of your body.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:30.980
 And your temperature stays very close to the normal.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:36.220
 If you're hyper thyroid, sometimes your body temperature

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:41.220
 will stay a little above the optimal normal.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.900
 But the heat production you just make it

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:51.840
 pretty well by sweating and breathing harder.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:57.980
 - Julian asks, can you ask Ray about using T3

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.980
 and its effects on increasing testosterone

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.500
 and the androgen system in males?

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.940
 Thank you.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:09.940
 - Yeah, the T3 lowers aromatase

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.940
 and elevated aromatase from stress is the main thing

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:23.180
 that lowers testosterone while decreasing

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:33.660
 the whole androgen effect, giving too much estrogen.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:39.780
 - Okay, so T3 actually can help the aromatase inhibition

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.160
 and so can it help increase testosterone?

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.860
 - Yes.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.680
 - Okay, great.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.900
 But you were mentioning if they don't

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.280
 maybe take it with a test.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.460
 Let's say they're taking an exogenous testosterone

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.660
 and they're not taking T3, is there more of a chance

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.340
 that they're going to convert to estrogen

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.320
 with that exogenous testosterone?

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:07.380
 - Yeah, T3 and aspirin and pregnant or progesterone

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:12.380
 will all help to inhibit aromatase

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:16.020
 and make the testosterone more effective.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.620
 - Very good, okay.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.540
 This one is a question from my own daughter.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.140
 She loves listening to your podcast.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:26.500
 She's seven now and she wanted to know your thoughts

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.900
 on the COVID vaccine for kids as well as vaccines

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.700
 in general for kids such as whooping cough

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.220
 or the hepatitis shot they give at birth.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.580
 The hepatitis shot they give at birth.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.480
 What are your thoughts on all the different vaccines

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.020
 for kids?

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:47.020
 - Oh, I think all of them are given too soon

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:51.320
 and without justification.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:59.740
 For certain vaccines at certain conditions,

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.540
 each vaccine, you can make somewhat of a case,

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.180
 but what has happened medically is they give

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:17.740
 something like 60 or 70 different vaccine antigens

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:23.620
 to every kid and they do it mindlessly.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:28.700
 In the case of smallpox,

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:33.700
 they used vaccination intelligently to close in

00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:39.620
 on any outbreak and eliminate that outbreak

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.460
 one region at a time.

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.860
 Just took a couple of years

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:50.860
 to eliminate forever the smallpox disease.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:55.620
 That wasn't profitable to the vaccine industry

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:01.620
 and no one wants to repeat that horrible experience

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:07.020
 of totally losing a market for a vaccine

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.960
 by using it intelligently.

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:16.460
 If you put vaccines into a system

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:21.460
 that was looking at the general health of the population

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.780
 rather than the health of the corporations

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.380
 that make the vaccines,

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:32.420
 you would have entirely different effects.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:39.500
 The problem is with the politics and the profit motive,

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:46.180
 which is absolutely opposite to the motive

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.500
 of them improving the health.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.740
 If you use every vaccine intelligently,

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:56.880
 you can eliminate all of these diseases.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.940
 - I love that you say that,

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.660
 you're not completely anti-vax,

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.740
 but it's like if they would just use them intelligently,

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:06.420
 they could have some validity

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:10.740
 versus the way that they're just cramming them in children

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:14.580
 as quickly as possible and way too young, like you mentioned.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.620
 So, yeah.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.740
 Yeah, in the case of smallpox,

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:24.740
 the first widely used vaccine, that was intelligent.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:31.300
 The latest vaccines, the nucleic acid RNA vaccines

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.540
 are not even vaccines.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.980
 They're so focused on the profit motive

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:44.980
 that they went absolutely against the health

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.860
 status of the population.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:53.620
 Statistically, you can look at the number of vaccines

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:58.620
 increasing starting about 1980 and the health of the public,

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:05.500
 especially the people who were children

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:09.100
 getting many, many vaccines.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:13.060
 There's a very close correspondence

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:17.820
 between the tremendous decline in American health

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:21.860
 and the overuse of vaccines.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.860
 But the current so-called vaccine is like a caricature

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:33.380
 in which they actively came out against treating

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:38.020
 the COVID virus rationally

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:43.020
 and came out in favor of giving the vaccine

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.500
 even to people who had almost a zero chance

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:53.220
 of developing any harm from the vaccine.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:53:01.100
 It turned into just an open, shameless funneling money

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:09.180
 from the public to these pharmaceutical companies

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.860
 by way of the Fauci administration.

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:27.500
 Robert Kennedy's new book goes into tremendous detail

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:32.820
 on these business misconduct of many sorts

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.700
 in business, government, the military,

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:42.700
 various branches of government involvement

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:52.300
 of the CIA and the Pentagon in designing our reaction

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:58.900
 to an epidemic.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.900
 People who didn't pretend to have any knowledge

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:10.820
 about health became leaders.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:15.160
 What they knew about was how to create business.

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.460
 - Yeah, so do you know the title of his book?

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:22.780
 I heard you mentioned that on another podcast.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:24.300
 Do you know the title of his book?

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.860
 And I'll put it in the show notes.

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:32.500
 - Yeah, it's the real Fauci, real Anthony Fauci.

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.340
 - Okay.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:38.340
 - And then he names the subdivisions on Bill Gates,

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:47.780
 the interactions of business and the pharmaceutical industry.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:51.860
 - Okay, interesting.

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.620
 Okay, so we only have time for a couple more questions here.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.660
 And then if I didn't get to you or if I didn't get to you,

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:02.660
 or questions on this podcast, don't worry, we'll get to them

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.060
 on the next one 'cause I always try to keep them in the queue.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:10.060
 So Francesco says, "What does Ray think about HCG?"

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:14.820
 He has on his website, he stated a couple of times

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.700
 to be a positive since it raises progesterone.

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.940
 Would it be useful to use HCG?

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.780
 - HCG?

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:28.780
 No, I don't think it's...

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:33.500
 - I was gonna say, I don't remember reading that

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.820
 on your stuff, but.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:40.140
 - I don't think it's ever safe enough to use.

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:42.700
 - Yeah, agreed.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.020
 And I mean, I've seen people use it with no harm,

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:48.300
 but also it's like you're injecting something

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.500
 that's specifically for a pregnant woman

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.420
 and expecting good results.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:56.060
 So yeah, okay.

00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:01.060
 So then it looks like NCGIRL9FI says,

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:04.620
 "Why does Pregnanolone give me estrogen dominant symptoms?

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.140
 Does it need to be taken cyclically with progesterone?

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:08.980
 Thank you."

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:14.540
 - Did she say what kind of progesterone?

00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.700
 - She was saying, why does Pregnanolone

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.820
 give me estrogen dominant symptoms?

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.460
 So she's taking Pregnanolone.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:26.460
 - Oh, there have been many people,

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:34.180
 just in the last seven or eight years,

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:39.180
 who report that for several of the major selling

00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:44.660
 Pregnanolones in the U.S.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:52.020
 having eaten more than a kilogram of Pregnanolone

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:57.980
 aided by the spoonful for a year,

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:06.060
 everything that I experienced was anti-estrogenic.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:11.900
 So the increase in the opposite symptoms

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:17.300
 I've been hearing, for example, breast pain

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:23.540
 and uterine cramps are very common symptoms.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:28.940
 And I think that means that a lot of the Pregnanolone

00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:33.020
 has been contaminated with traces of something

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.980
 with an estrogen-like effect.

00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:38.460
 - Okay, very good.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:41.620
 Well, that is what we're gonna wrap up with today, Dr. Pete.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:45.740
 I'm just speaking for everyone when I say thank you so much

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:48.300
 for always being willing to do these Q and A's

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.420
 and answer questions.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:52.140
 'Cause as you know, there's a lot of people struggling

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.100
 with false information or misinformation.

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.980
 And so it's good to hear it from somebody

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.460
 who has studied this relentlessly

00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:01.540
 and understands how the human body works.

00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.660
 So I just wanna give you a big thank you from myself

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:07.300
 and all the listeners for your time today.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:10.460
 And you can check out that newsletter,

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:14.140
 or you guys I mentioned, raypetesnewsletter@gmail.com.

00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.580
 Just email for that, make sure you pick that up,

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.980
 either email or hard copy mailed to you

00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.140
 'cause it's well-worthy, a small investment.

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.860
 And of course, anytime you wanna donate to Dr. Pete,

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.100
 I think it would be a good thing

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.100
 'cause he's very generous with his time.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.980
 So thank you once again, Dr. Pete.

00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.340
 We'll do this again soon.

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.900
 And I hope that you stay well

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.220
 and take care of yourself as you always do.

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:39.800
 (upbeat music)

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.160
 (upbeat music)

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.920
 Hey, wanna know a secret tip

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.360
 as to how to get past those late night sugar

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.960
 and carb cravings?

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.200
 Wish you could get rid of those evening ice cream

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:51.640
 binges and popcorn feasts

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.360
 and wish you were able to wine down without the wine.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.700
 Well, here's your secret tip.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.060
 You gotta block blue light.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:00.900
 Here's why.

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:03.720
 Blue light from our devices, TVs, smartphones,

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.280
 tablets, computers, after the sun goes down,

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.160
 tells our brain it's noon.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.400
 And this is a really long day

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.320
 because we already had a noon today.

00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:14.780
 So release cortisol and oh, by the way,

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:17.500
 we need more food since this day is so long.

00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:19.840
 So just the action of blocking blue light

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.660
 after the sun goes down

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:23.760
 could actually thwart your cravings.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.600
 I mean, imagine it.

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:28.420
 Imagine if you were living in prehistoric times

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:30.340
 and you didn't have light after the sun goes down.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.700
 Would you really crave that piece of fruit

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.560
 hanging on the tree?

00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:35.660
 No, you couldn't go find it.

00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.980
 So the secret to not eating so late at night

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.980
 and not getting those late night carb cravings

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.060
 is to block all that blue light.

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.040
 That means dimming the house lights, yeah,

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.060
 and maybe reading by candlelight

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.940
 and not having your devices on.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.060
 But if your husband's not so keen on you

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.560
 not Netflixing and chilling with him,

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:57.180
 then it's time you get some Swanwick sleep glasses.

00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.700
 That's right, daytime blockers for those daylight screens,

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.060
 but more importantly, blue light blocking glasses at night.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.560
 These are amber colored lenses

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.020
 that block out all the blue lights.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.340
 You can still do your normal routine at night

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.260
 of playing words with friends if you have to,

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.740
 even though I don't want you on your device that much,

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.060
 or watching TV with your loved ones

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.540
 or whatever what's taking your attention

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.760
 as far as blue light at night.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:25.180
 So to get your hands on a pair of Swannies

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.580
 or my favorite blue light blocking glasses,

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.360
 you're gonna go to swannwicksleep.com.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.360
 That's S-W-A-N-W-I-C-K, then the word sleep.com.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.740
 And type in my code FIT410.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:42.340
 That's F-I-T-F-O-R-10, the number 10.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.780
 F-I-T-F-O-R, the number 10.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.740
 And that's gonna get you 10% off

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.700
 your very own amber colored blue light blocking glasses

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.420
 or the daylight blocking glasses

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.020
 if you find that you're one of those people

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:54.740
 that has 16 different monitors

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.860
 in front of you at your desk during the day.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.860
 What you do all day determines your night.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.700
 So get that insulin, that blood sugar, those carb cravings

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.220
 under control by blocking that blue light

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:08.620
 and taking control of your cravings once and for all.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.200
 (upbeat music)
