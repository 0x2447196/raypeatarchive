WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 I'm really glad and thrilled to have you with us. It's an honor to talk to you. You've been

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.040
 quite an inspirational force in the world of nutrition of which both of us have been

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.320
 aware of your work. Tucker Goodrich has known about your work longer than myself, but I've

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.360
 been fascinated by the insights, the little bit that I've learned so far. Tucker, would

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.760
 you provide a little background for yourself?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:36.760
 Tucker Goodrich Me? I studied mostly humanities and arts for the first 10 years or so after

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:47.320
 I graduated from college. Just because of seeing how many things were being mismanaged

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.960
 in science and health, I decided to go back to graduate school and get a PhD in biology,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:07.200
 physiology. And so I went right from literature and painting into physiology and got a PhD

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:19.360
 at University of Oregon in 1972. And since then I've been working on related themes between

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:31.440
 brain function. That was my actual first interest in graduate school, but I discovered that

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.680
 the nerve biology and brain biology people were extremely dogmatic. And so I looked around

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.920
 the biology department and I found that the physiologists and especially the reproductive

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:59.320
 physiologists were actually scientific rather than dogmatic. And so I concentrated on age-related

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:08.000
 changes in fertility in females in particular. And that turned out to be very valuable for

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:20.840
 understanding the brain, which had been my first orientation. The female hormones, actually

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:32.840
 progesterone is a basic stabilizing factor. It's historically considered a pregnancy hormone,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.040
 but it's essential for brain function in both men and women. And the concentration in the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.240
 brain of progesterone is about 10 times higher than in the blood. So that has been one of

00:02:48.240 --> 00:03:01.440
 my main orientations at the last almost 50 years is looking at the implications of progesterone

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:12.520
 deficiency. And along with that, stress induces estrogen, which again isn't the female hormone

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:23.120
 as it's been advertised now for about 70 years. It's actually a stress hormone. If a man is

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:32.880
 injured or has a heart attack or is very sick and old, his estrogen is going to be as high

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:47.240
 as a woman's or higher. So it's a stress and aging indicator or hormone, definitely not

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:59.080
 a fertility hormone. In the 1930s, estrogen was already identified as a promoter of miscarriage

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:13.240
 or abortion and inflammation and cancer. Despite that, the estrogen industry by the early 1940s

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:23.440
 discovered that almost anything toxic turns out to have an estrogenic effect. And soot,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:32.120
 for example, you can extract about a thousand different estrogenic substances from soot.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:43.760
 And so the industry found a very cheap, almost so cheap you could hardly identify a cost

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:53.120
 substance, which is estrogenic and began selling it as the female fertility pregnancy protecting

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:07.520
 hormone, estrogen. Convinced the FDA and other regulatory agencies that it was an appropriate

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:19.880
 treatment for pregnant women, aging women to prevent aging and so on. The first 200

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:30.480
 inhalants or more that estrogen was sold to treat all turned out to be fraudulent, but

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:38.120
 they made many billions of dollars in the process. So they changed medical schools,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:47.160
 medical journals, the whole national consciousness to sell their fraudulent scheme or project.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.040
 Well, it's good. It's good to hear that not much has changed in the last many decades.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:02.240
 Dr. Peat, how did you take this interest into the nutrition sphere?

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:12.680
 Oh, well, I was still working in the humanities. I started the school in Mexico called Blake

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:22.840
 College in the early 1960s. And I started seeing, for example, students who would come

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:34.000
 after work just couldn't learn anything. And so I started giving them a wheat germ and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:46.320
 egg biscuit and coffee with a little vitamin B1 added and they became good students. Just

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:57.400
 a few good meals and their brains were functioning better. And then a friend mentioned that his

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:07.840
 niece was dying in the hospital of intractable diarrhea. And I told him what I read in Adele

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:20.080
 Davis's book written in the late 1950s about vitamin B6 sometimes curing diarrhea. And

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:27.680
 after two or three days, he finally consented. He said they had given up and that she was

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:36.520
 probably going to die within a day or so. So he went over to the doctor's head and gave

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:47.480
 the kid 10 milligrams of vitamin B6. And within hours, her diarrhea had stopped and she was

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:56.680
 out of the hospital within a few days. That was one of the deciding things that made me

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.920
 realize how powerful nutritional therapies could be.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:09.000
 Indeed, that sounds somewhat similar to my own experience where I was able to put an

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.280
 inflammatory bowel disease that I'd suffered from for 16 years in remission in a couple

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.360
 of days by cutting back on my polyunsaturated fat intake. I was rather surprised at how

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:26.680
 effective it was and that spurred my own interest in nutrition and your research among other

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:36.360
 things. So thank you, by the way, for all the papers that you've published or the blog

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.240
 posts that you've done over the years. I've started reading them probably more than 10

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.160
 years ago, and I find that every time, as I continue to learn, I go back and I reread

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:54.000
 them and appreciate how much you had said that I wasn't able to understand the first

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:02.760
 times because I didn't have the background to comprehend the points that you were making.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:12.720
 So you've become, I don't want to say notorious, but rather famous in nutrition circles for

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.480
 having a somewhat unconventional view of what a healthy human diet looks like. How would

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.160
 you describe, for somebody who's new to your work, how would you describe succinctly your

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.720
 views on what human nutrition should be optimally?

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:46.880
 I started out in Mexico looking at the reason for malnutrition and poverty was a major thing.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:55.720
 And so I started thinking about the cost of foods and what was most easily available and

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:04.200
 started looking around the health of populations around the world and what they were eating

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:18.280
 and what was economically available to correct their problems. And I saw that refined grains,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:29.680
 for example, seemed to be a major problem when the traditional Mexican diet of tortillas

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:44.960
 and vegetables and small amounts of crustaceans, when that diet was replaced by the Spanish

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:56.720
 refined cereal-based diet and meats, for example, the nutritional deficiency diseases started

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:06.800
 showing up. So I looked at what traditional diets were doing and the lime processing using

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:18.360
 either calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide from ashes to soak the corn kernels in to

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:29.080
 precook them in this strong alkalized solution. It changes the chemistry, for example, decreases

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:40.120
 the tryptophan, turns it into niacin and makes the starch and toxic proteins digestible and

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:49.800
 harmless. So simply their traditional process of the way they cooked their corn turned it

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:59.560
 from a toxin to an actually beneficial food rich in calcium, niacin and other essential

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:09.920
 nutrients rather than in the southern US where they imported corn from Mexico but didn't

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:25.000
 widely use the alkali process. Homini is the safe form of corn cooked in lime, but when

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.880
 they didn't make their corn into homini, they got pellagra.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:59.720
 So that makes sense. I

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.480
 would hate to say it, but it seems that when you go to a vet, the first thing they ask

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.960
 you about your pet is what is your pet eating. And when you go to a doctor, they don't generally

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:18.560
 ask that question. It's a biological approach. If you have nutritional deficiencies, let's

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:25.280
 figure out what's causing them. I used to suggest that people would do better going

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:32.560
 to their vet rather than their doctor.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:46.440
 So you make a couple of statements that a lot of people find somewhat confusing or hard

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:52.600
 to take. You're a fan of, to some extent, of consuming sugar as part of a healthy diet.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.280
 Do you want to describe the rationale behind that?

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:11.280
 Yeah. Many years ago, I was hearing dieticians talk about the glycemic index of foods. And

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:19.240
 right in their own tables, they showed that starches had a higher glycemic index than

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:26.800
 sucrose. And that started me thinking about the difference between starch and sucrose.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:37.720
 Sucrose consists of 50% fructose and 50% glucose, where starch is, when you assimilate it, it's

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:46.600
 pure glucose. And glucose stimulates insulin, turning on fat production and lowering your

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:55.800
 blood glucose unless you have a steady intake of it. Where the fructose component either

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:05.680
 doesn't stimulate insulin or even can have a restraining influence on insulin. And so

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:15.440
 intrinsically, the reason sugar has a lower glycemic index than starch is that the fructose

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:26.640
 component restricts insulin and restrains fat synthesis and so stabilizes blood sugar.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:34.320
 Right. And of course, for just that, it was advocated as a better sweetener for diabetics

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.000
 for a while.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:46.040
 Yeah, but it has to be, unless you extract it from ripe Jerusalem artichokes, which take

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:55.200
 a lot of care in storage and so on, it's generally manufactured chemically. And so it turns out

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:04.520
 that quite a few people have an allergic type reaction to the manufactured form of fructose.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:15.600
 But if you eat fruits, for example, you not only get the fructose component of the sucrose,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:25.720
 but the high potassium content of the fruit has an insulin-like activity that also restrains

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:36.800
 your body's production of insulin. So the fruit goes in with a slightly insulin-moderating

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:46.320
 fructose content and also the simultaneously the potassium, which takes care of absorbing

00:16:46.320 --> 00:17:00.040
 the glucose without needing to secrete insulin. And so it has these surprising ways of bypassing

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:10.760
 the insulin problem or what's related to diabetes. And I ran across two 19th century doctors,

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:21.520
 one in Paris and one in following up in England, who the one in Paris was the first to observe

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:33.320
 that a high sugar diet cured his terminal diabetic patients, originally diabetes, because

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:43.800
 you couldn't assimilate glucose. You turned your protein of your tissues into glucose

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:55.080
 to survive. And so the diabetic wasted away, lost their muscles and finally died in essentially

00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:04.640
 a starvation condition. The doctor in France gave his terminal diabetic patients who were

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:13.960
 wasting away the amount of sugar they craved and found that they stopped wasting away and

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:24.000
 very quickly started building muscle when they were eating a regular diet, milk, beef,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.640
 fruits and vegetables and so on, but along with a sugar supplement. So the doctor in

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:40.680
 England did exactly the same thing and described the course of people who were dying, wasting

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:48.600
 away, putting out tremendous amounts of sugar in their urine, even though they weren't eating

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 any. They were restricted because they called diabetes the sugar disease. So they were torturing

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:06.840
 their patients by not letting them have any of the sugar that they craved. But he decided

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:14.160
 not to torture his patients and let them add as much sugar as they wanted to their diet.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:23.240
 Eventually they stopped putting glucose into urine and stopped losing muscle and recovered

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240
 very quickly.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.360
 >> Eric Lander So it sounds like this was because the sugar

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:36.440
 intake was sparing the liver the necessity of using glucose to produce the glucose that

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440
 their bodies needed.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:43.280
 >> Dr. Gregory S. Fowler Yeah, it turns off the cortisol which breaks

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:52.280
 down your tissue protein to make sugar out of it or the sugar equivalent. Same thing

00:19:52.280 --> 00:20:01.240
 happens in cancer. The myth has developed that sugar feeds cancer. It's true in a sense,

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:11.160
 that the cancer sends out signals such as ammonia to the body that it needs sugar if

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:21.080
 you don't have sugar in your diet. And the body turns on extreme amounts of cortisol

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:31.120
 providing sugar by breaking down your immune system, muscles and skin, all of your tissues.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:41.600
 The brain and lungs and heart are preserved. But the cancer causes catechia or the wasting

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:51.120
 disease as a main killer. And if you simply give the body a large amount of glucose or

00:20:51.120 --> 00:21:01.080
 sugar of any sort, that will reduce the production of cortisol and stop the destruction of the

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:13.200
 body tissue or at least slow it. So diabetes and cancer have that in common, that they

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:23.440
 involve the stress, high cortisol-induced loss of active body tissue to provide the

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.920
 glucose which is essential for the brain to survive.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:36.880
 Are both diabetes and cancer driven a lot by the overconsumption of the PUFAs?

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:52.960
 Exactly. The PUFA, the number of unsaturated groups in the molecule, the more highly polyunsaturated

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.040
 the fat is, the more double bonds there are in the molecule. And exactly in proportion

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:10.920
 to the number of double bonds, the interference with thyroid function increases. So the enzymes

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:20.000
 that release thyroid from the gland are inhibited by the highly unsaturated fatty acids. The

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.840
 proteins that carry thyroid hormone in the blood, the thyroid is displaced competitively

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:38.000
 by the highly unsaturated fatty acids exactly in proportion to the number of double bonds.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:48.800
 And the cells, tissue cells' ability to respond to the thyroid hormone that they do receive

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.440
 is blocked in proportion to the number of double bonds. So it's every known step of

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:03.600
 thyroid activity which is needed to produce oxidative energy and it's that exactly which

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:14.440
 fails in diabetes and cancer. So you lose oxidative energy production from glucose and

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:27.240
 the fatty acids. In the 1960s, research showed that as your free fatty acids in the blood

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:36.680
 go up from stress, from the need for more sugar in your diet, the increase of free fatty

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:45.840
 acids blocks exactly the ability to use and oxidize glucose.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:54.960
 Apparently the basic survival function of that which is called the Randle cycle, the

00:23:54.960 --> 00:24:05.880
 biological function is probably to stop the use of glucose in your massive skeletal muscles

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:17.800
 and dispensable tissues, skin and muscles in particular, saving whatever glucose is

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:26.480
 available for use by the brain, heart and lungs. But as the free fatty acids in the

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:37.080
 blood rise, then even the ability of the heart and lungs and brain to use glucose for energy

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:49.520
 decreases. And that's especially true if the free fatty acids are highly unsaturated

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:59.800
 because they are increasingly toxic to the mitochondria in proportion to their instability

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.480
 and high unsaturation.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:16.320
 Okay. Now this, wow, this reminds me of one of your blog posts, Dr. Peat, that's a nation

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.840
 of information and there's a lot of unpacking that can be done to understand some of the

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:30.960
 things. To go back to your comments on sugar, there are primitive tribes that subsist on

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.400
 high amounts of honey, which is effectively the same thing as sugar, up to 80% seasonally

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:44.720
 in some groups and to suffer no ill effects, which speaks to your view that sugar isn't

00:25:44.720 --> 00:26:03.200
 except perhaps for its dental effects, a harmful nutrient. There's a fructose going on nowadays.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.320
 There's a physician out of San Francisco, Dr. Lustig, I don't know if you're aware of

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320
 him.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.600
 Oh yeah, I saw his famous video.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:18.000
 Right, okay. Do you have any thoughts on what the difference between your view and his view

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.480
 on fructose and metabolism?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:31.680
 Yeah, during his talk in that video, he quickly shows many references in the background and

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:43.080
 I looked up all of the references that I could read and found that they supported my argument

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:56.920
 as much as they did his. For example, he described fructose as a poison similar to ethyl alcohol.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:07.120
 In fact, if you're poisoned by an overdose of ethanol, if you're very, very drunk, the

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:18.680
 antitoxin or the antidote to alcohol poisoning is fructose. It exactly reverses the changes

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:27.760
 inside the cells caused by alcohol. So he was right about alcohol being a metabolic

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:35.760
 poison. He was exactly wrong by saying it's like fructose. Fructose is the antidote to

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.000
 the alcohol effect.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.640
 That's fascinating and that is very interesting.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:53.760
 Tucker, I wanted to ask what he mentioned about the role of PUFAs in causing cancer.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.840
 Is that related to what you've proposed about cardiolipin and its role? Could you explain

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.840
 that or maybe ...

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:13.960
 Well, yeah. PUFA seems to be a metabolic, a mitochondrial toxin to the effect that ... I

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.520
 mean, there's some argument that your mitochondria actually prefer to burn it to get rid of it.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.620
 It seems to be toxic to the extent that it alters the mitochondrial composition, which

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:32.520
 makes it more susceptible to oxidative damage and this breaks down the electron transport

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:39.840
 chain impairing mitochondrial function, especially the ability to process glucose.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:51.080
 So that's basically the mechanism that I've seen that describes what Dr. Peat is talking

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.640
 about.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:04.680
 It used to be 40 or 50 years ago, there was the absolute doctrine, dogma, that diabetes

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:17.480
 was a genetic disease, almost 100% caused by genes. The new immigrants after the formation

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:29.300
 of Israel, Israel had an extremely high incidence of diabetes, somewhat higher than the European

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:40.360
 countries the immigrants had come from. The dogma persisted that they simply had the genes

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:51.240
 for being diabetic, but then immigrants to Israel from the African countries, these people

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:59.500
 were very genetically different and had no diabetes at all when they moved into the new

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:10.620
 country, but they soon took up the European diet that the diabetics were eating and their

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:20.580
 children all had the European high incidence of diabetes, totally disproving the genetic

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:31.200
 causation and the polyunsaturated fats were high in the European diet and had been very

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.400
 low in the African immigrants until they moved.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:42.920
 So do you see any promising treatments people are proposing for diabetes and cancer or is

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.920
 that complicated?

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:55.400
 Yeah, the same as the two 19th century doctors, it's all a matter of revising your thinking

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:06.880
 or realizing that the unsaturated fats are the cause and getting rid of them in the diet

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:18.740
 as far as possible and then returning to a more traditional diet of carbohydrates and

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:25.740
 moderate amounts of protein from a variety of sources.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:33.880
 I was just saying let food be thy medicine is your approach for these diseases, right?

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:42.460
 Yeah, and the minerals are extremely important in a less refined diet. There was a lot of

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:52.100
 magnesium and calcium, vegetable greens if they're cooked provide both lots of magnesium

00:31:52.100 --> 00:32:05.340
 and calcium and the cows and goats that live primarily on leafy greens process their rumen

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:18.640
 and ferment and predigests the greens which are high in PUFA but the bacteria in their

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:30.460
 rumen destroys about 97% of the PUFA so you get the very rich calcium and magnesium content

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:40.780
 in their milk to some extent in the meat but not nearly as much as in the milk along with

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:52.100
 a radical decrease of the PUFA content and simply getting a very generous amount of these

00:32:52.100 --> 00:33:03.300
 minerals, calcium and magnesium is therapeutic not only to diabetes but to a lot of other

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:13.940
 conditions. There's a somewhat mysterious brain disease that was first seen in Guam

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:24.580
 but in several other regions that resembles Lou Gehrig's disease or amyotrophic lateral

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:33.820
 sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It includes a combination of all

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:43.420
 of those symptoms and they have considered various theories about poisons from bacteria

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:56.060
 and so on and from eating a flying fox that had lived on foods containing those bacteria.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:03.500
 It turns out that what those regions have in common, not the toxins but they are all

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:15.460
 regions very low in calcium and/or magnesium and in the absence of a large amount of calcium

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:28.020
 or magnesium in your diet, the brain cells take up any positively charged metal in place

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:38.420
 of the calcium and magnesium. What happens when you're deficient in calcium is your

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:49.460
 parathyroid gland becomes hyperactive, turns off almost directly or indirectly. Your mitochondrial

00:34:49.460 --> 00:35:01.420
 function decreases, your ability to produce energy and lacking energy, cells tend to calcify

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:17.300
 and the calcium is in early years protective of these de-energized, de-vitalized tissues

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:26.340
 but if it continues for a long time, the diet deficiency of calcium leading to hyperparathyroidism

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:35.020
 and reduced mitochondrial energy leads to eventually destructive levels of calcium in

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:42.180
 the tissues such as hardening of the arteries, calcification of the brain, heart valves,

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:56.820
 kidneys and so on. But in these island regions, they called it Guamanian dementia because

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:09.500
 it was discovered on the island of Guam. In the absence of the calcium to such an extent

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:21.820
 that your parathyroid hormone becomes very high, de-energizing your cells, if your environment

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:31.300
 has a normal amount of iron, lead and any of the heavy metals, they will load up to

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:41.540
 a toxic extent with the heavy metals and then the heavy metals interact to catalyze the

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:52.620
 oxidative breakdown of the PUFA which are concentrated in the brain. So a calcium deficiency,

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:59.900
 if you're extremely deficient, you won't even deposit the usual amount of calcium.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:09.500
 It will be replaced by iron deposits or lead or whatever other metal is excessive. Copper,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:21.100
 molybdenum and manganese for example and aluminum. Aluminum is a major accumulated mineral because

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:26.620
 it's generally abundant when calcium is deficient.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:38.860
 - Interesting. So now, you mentioned at one point in our discussion how high fatty acids

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:50.860
 can impair insulin and there's been obviously, as I'm sure you're well aware, ketogenic diets

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:59.900
 have become quite popular outside of the therapeutic indications in the last few years. Some people

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:07.660
 have used your writings to say that a ketogenic diet can be harmful because the lack of glucose

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:14.140
 increases cortisol to meet the body's glucose requirement and that this is a harmful side

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:18.540
 effect of a ketogenic diet. Is that a fair representation of...

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:29.500
 - Yeah, it's an essential to making the ketones. The ketones are great if you get them in fruits

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:37.660
 and potatoes for example. They work fine as an energy source for heart and brain and so

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:47.060
 on. But if you have to make them yourself, the way you make them is to break down proteins

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:53.860
 which will come necessarily partly from your own tissues despite the fact that you're eating

00:38:53.860 --> 00:39:02.900
 a lot of protein. The cortisol doesn't care whether it's exogenous protein or your muscle

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:13.860
 protein that it breaks down. And so when you're starving your tissues for glucose, your brain,

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:23.620
 brains and heart are going to get glucose any way it can which means from protein. And

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:32.980
 so you break down your own protein or your food protein and in the process you have to

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:43.700
 dispose of the large amount of ammonia released by the protein. That means that you become

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:50.260
 increasingly dependent on carbon dioxide to combine with the ammonia to make urea and

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:56.740
 get rid of the potentially toxic ammonia. And if something interferes with your carbon

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:07.500
 dioxide production, specifically not oxidizing enough glucose which produces about twice

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:19.860
 as much CO2 per unit of energy as oxidizing fat, you're creating a situation in which

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:30.420
 you have these multiple interacting stress factors that generally at an extreme can end

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:40.780
 up poisoning your brain with too much ammonia but always to some extent poisoning your body

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:48.860
 with too much cortisol breaking down proteins to make the glucose to sustain your brain

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.580
 and lungs and blood system.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:57.940
 Dave Shiller>> Right, understood. And that would explain why people who go on a ketogenic

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:06.060
 weight loss diet seem to experience a little more fat-free mass loss compared to people

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:13.460
 who go on a high-carb, low-fat diet when they examine the two side by side.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:29.420
 Dr. R. D. Dixon>> Just looking at the pancreas gland itself, way back around 1920, people

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:34.140
 were thinking of genetic reasons for the loss of the beta cells in the pancreas that can

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:45.940
 make insulin. And it turns out that we have stem cells in the pancreas constantly replacing

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:57.780
 if you kill for whatever reason your beta cells, they are stem cells ready to give birth

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:09.220
 to new insulin-producing beta cells. And glucose is the sustaining factor for making new stem

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:18.740
 cells for maintaining the ability to replace the missing insulin-producing cells. But free

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:28.820
 fatty acids are constantly killing the beta cells. So a deficiency of glucose limits the

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:40.500
 stem cell production and an excess of free fatty acids kills the beta cells faster. And

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:52.020
 that means that you can very quickly activate these stem cells to make new beta cells and

00:42:52.020 --> 00:43:01.380
 at the same time by increasing the sugar availability, decrease the free fatty acids which are killing

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:10.140
 the beta cells. And that can account for how these two 19th century doctors so quickly

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:20.660
 cured terminal diabetics. The pancreas is perfectly willing to repair itself and become

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.780
 non-diabetic if you just stop killing it with PUFA.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:33.860
 So, what about people who do the lower carb diet but they are eating 40 to 50 grams of

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.660
 carbs a day, would that not be enough?

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:47.580
 That would not be enough. Far from it I think. It's somewhat well more than 100 grams per

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:55.500
 day. The healthy amount seems to be up above 200 grams of carbohydrate per day. The therapeutic

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:08.140
 amount that the French and English doctors used was somewhat a little over half a pound

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:13.460
 of sugar per day added to a standard diet.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:19.740
 So what about folks that say they seem to gain weight whenever they are eating that

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.420
 kind of level of sugar, 200 grams of sugar a day. Is there, it's just about the right

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.740
 sugars eating the fruits?

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:35.700
 Well they probably weren't terminal diabetics. The patients of these 19th century doctors

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:43.300
 stopped needing the sugar supplement in just two or three weeks. But if someone isn't

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:54.780
 diabetic and they add that amount of sugar, it's all unnecessary excess calories. In

00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:04.740
 the case of the diabetics, they were powerfully deficient in calories and so when they added

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:14.460
 half a pound of sugar, they were simply making them calorie neutral and it shifted them to

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:22.060
 an anabolic metabolism that made the calories more efficient for rebuilding muscle. But

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:32.820
 a person who isn't in that dying state from advanced diabetes always has to attend to

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:38.540
 keeping their calorie intake within their metabolic consumption.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:49.980
 Animal experiments show that shifting to a fruit or sugar-based sucrose added diet in

00:45:49.980 --> 00:46:01.060
 various studies increases the metabolic rate by around 20% so they can keep their metabolism

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:12.220
 in a calorie balanced condition even by adding a moderate amount of sugar. But gaining fat

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:21.140
 weight means definitely that you're out of balance taking in too many calories.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:27.620
 So if a person who's normal in terms of not having any specific diseases but overweight,

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:35.660
 you would recommend still including lots of fruits and I believe you're big on dairy,

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.220
 ice cream even.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:47.620
 Yeah, the calcium and vitamin D are probably the most powerful weight loss nutrients there

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:58.660
 are because both of them suppress the inflammatory system and the parathyroid hormone and the

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:08.140
 parathyroid hormone suppresses mitochondrial oxidation and creates a vicious circle of

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:17.380
 stress and the most powerful way to stop that exaggerated parathyroid hormone is to get

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:27.540
 a lot of calcium, magnesium and vitamin D in your diet and that again drastically increases

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:37.780
 your ability to burn calories, produce heat and not get fat. A low-fat milk diet with

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:47.540
 adequate vitamin D is a very efficient weight loss diet as well as therapeutic in a variety

00:47:47.540 --> 00:48:01.260
 of other conditions. In fact, probably all of the really dangerous diseases are helped

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:09.540
 by a diet high in vitamin D, calcium and magnesium.

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:10.540
 Interesting.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:19.460
 Yeah, so you've talked about the vitamin D factor. Would that best source of that be

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.300
 getting a lot of sunlight exposure?

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:39.220
 Yeah, in a moderate latitude. In Florida, the sun is always within a reasonable intensity

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:47.780
 high in the sky during the middle of the day. In the northern states except in the late

00:48:47.780 --> 00:49:01.260
 spring, summer and early fall, even the midday sun is so low in the sky, you're not going

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:07.020
 to get enough sun. Only in the middle of the day in the summer, late spring and early fall

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:16.460
 in the northern states, sunbathing is curative. It takes 30 minutes to an hour of good sun

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:27.980
 exposure on the majority of your skin to keep your vitamin D level at least the middle of

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:37.580
 the range that they call normal. It should be something like 50 or 60 nanograms per milliliter

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:43.580
 to keep your parathyroid hormone under control.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.340
 Is that morning sun the best sun?

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:57.460
 In Florida, it's probably the best. You can get very sunburned if you spend too much time

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:05.420
 in the middle of the day. So you have good ultraviolet activity when you're in a low

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:13.900
 latitude. And the higher altitude, the sun is more intense.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:27.340
 Dr. Peat, have you looked into the relationship between Omega-6 PUFA intake and sunburn and

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:28.340
 skin cancer?

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:42.100
 Oh yeah. There was a rabbit experiment. They shaved the rabbits and fed one group a PUFA

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:50.660
 rich diet, the other one a PUFA deficient diet. And the ones on a PUFA deficient diet

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:59.460
 didn't have sun damage. And they happened to be studying the wrinkling effect. The ones

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:07.620
 eating a lot of PUFA had so much sun damage, their skin got fragile and wrinkled. And the

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:14.860
 same thing that causes wrinkling, it's the same process that leads to chronic inflammation

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.860
 and cancer.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:23.500
 Right. And additionally, I would expect the fibrosis that we see in a lot of these chronic

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.500
 diseases.

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:45.740
 Yeah. The tendency to swelling up, burn symptoms and eventually fibrosis and even calcium deposits

00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:56.780
 in extremely damaged skin. It's very common for precancerous and cancerous inflamed cells

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.980
 to show crystals of calcium forming.

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:10.220
 Interesting. Due to the body's inability to properly process calcium, I presume.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.220
 Yeah.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:22.900
 Interesting. Yeah. I discovered myself years back after going to a low omega-6 PUFA diet

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:30.480
 that I, within a few weeks, had a much lower susceptibility to sunburn. I've also noticed

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:39.940
 a lower susceptibility to just burn from hot things like kitchen accidents and the like.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:44.220
 It's been a rather dramatic alteration that a lot of other people have reported when they

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:51.740
 go on a diet that's also low in omega-6 fats. Like a lot of the people who go on a carnivore

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:57.780
 diet, if they're eating a lot of beef, they're going to get a lot less omega-6. And they've

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:07.940
 pretty not entirely, but pretty unanimously noticed a decline in susceptibility to sunburn.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:18.540
 And D and calcium help that along. They are contradictory to the PUFA effect. I used to

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:30.380
 sunburn just ridiculously easy. Just driving with tinted windows in a bright sunny area

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:38.140
 in the desert, for example, I would get horribly sunburned right through the windows. And five

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:48.380
 minutes in the midday sunlight in Mexico, I would have a lobster-looking skin color.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:58.700
 But after supplementing vitamin D, getting lots of milk in my diet, and avoiding PUFA

00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:05.820
 as completely as possible, the last time I was in Mexico, I was able to work the whole

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:15.340
 day at about 7,500 feet altitude, extremely intense ultraviolet, no burning at all.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:25.500
 I've noticed similar myself. I now live in Idaho in the high desert, and I'm not impervious

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:34.980
 to sunburn, but I can go hours out in the sun without getting a serious burn. It's quite

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.580
 pleasant not having to worry about that.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:45.100
 Very, very convenient. I used to wear a hat all the time, but I don't bother with a hat

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.100
 anymore.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:51.260
 You talk about milk consumption. A lot of people are concerned about drinking store-bought

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:56.780
 pasteurized milk. They feel like there's all kinds of stuff in there that ruins the quality

00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:04.060
 of the product that you would get in raw milk. Do you have any thoughts on that?

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:14.020
 The pasteurizing does slightly lower the vitamin content and so on. So it's still just about

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:21.500
 the best food available even when it's not well-treated. But if you have a problem with

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:29.540
 one brand of milk, I found that the taste of the milk is a good indicator of how easy

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:40.740
 it is on your digestion. But some people do react probably to the way they've added the

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:48.220
 vitamin A and D. They use an emulsifier and some of the emulsifiers might cause digestive

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:56.060
 problems. But if you try different brands, you can usually find some kind of milk that

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.820
 agrees with your digestive system.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:07.580
 If you haven't been a milk drinker, it's important to start with, for example, half a glass with

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:17.580
 each meal and then gradually build up over a few weeks because it takes time to induce

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:28.340
 enzymes such as lactase in your intestine. Even lactose intolerant people, if they go

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:36.140
 at it gradually, can induce the enzymes needed to break down lactose.

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:41.860
 So you don't seek out raw milk yourself? You don't drink that?

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:56.820
 No. If I had a good clean source, a lot of even commercial dairies don't wash the udders

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:05.700
 of the cow before they milk it. When we had a cow at home, we always carefully sponged

00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:14.540
 off the udder to get rid of the dandruff and any dirt that might be possible to get into

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:22.900
 the milk. But lots of dairies don't do proper hygiene with their cows.

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:27.140
 Should children drink low-fat milk or full-fat milk?

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.620
 What kind of children?

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:33.460
 Just children growing up. Should they drink full-fat or low-fat?

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:40.860
 It depends on how active they are. Nowadays, kids are more likely to be watching their

00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:54.660
 computer or telephones than doing active calorie burning. So I think usually 1 or 2% fat content

00:57:54.660 --> 00:58:08.140
 is good even for kids. In a dairy country where people are working vigorously 8 or 10

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:14.620
 hours a day, then full-fat milk is very appropriate because they need the calories and will burn

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:37.980
 them but very often people who drink whole milk and have a sedentary way of life are

00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:42.980
 going to get fat.

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:58.020
 Norman Ponser, P-O-N-T-Z-E-R, is a pretty interesting person. I highly commend his work.

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:03.940
 It's quite interesting looking at the relationship between exercise and obesity.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:26.820
 One of the overlooked things that exercise does, if you're working for example, is that

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:35.100
 physical activity increases your body temperature and the increased body temperature increases

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:46.380
 your calorie burning ability. So it's similar to what thyroid supplementing does. The good

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:54.580
 body warming effect of physical activity keeps your metabolic rate going with an anti-inflammatory

00:59:54.580 --> 01:00:04.500
 effect. If you're sedentary, your body's temperature falls and you go into a pro-inflammatory

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.500
 state.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:12.060
 Of course, exercise also upregulates your resistance to oxidative stress which from

01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:19.700
 my understanding of that term is generally what it means in practice is a toxic effect

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:26.980
 of omega-6 fat breakdown and exercise increases your ability to detoxify omega-6 fats in the

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.300
 body and their metabolites.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:40.460
 Increased body temperature is a very powerful effect in reducing lipid peroxidation for

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:49.660
 example. Higher body temperature lowers inflammation and lowers lipid peroxidation, makes you oxidize

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:56.660
 properly rather than oxidizing fats that shouldn't be oxidized.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:11.580
 Right. So that gets another controversial position that you hold with the caveat that

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:17.220
 I, assuming I understand it correctly, let me describe what I understand is that you

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:26.540
 caution people against excess fish oil intake. Clearly, omega-3 fats are also susceptible

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:32.180
 to lipid peroxidation just like omega-6 fats are.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.100
 Much more so.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:42.980
 Much more so, okay. So do you want to describe your position on that so I don't mangle it?

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:52.060
 Yes. The number of double bonds and the fish oil is extremely rich in five and six double

01:01:52.060 --> 01:02:05.340
 bonds or the seed oil and minus six vegetable oils typically have two or three double bonds.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:12.220
 Those are sufficiently toxic but when you get five or six double bonds in a molecule,

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:21.660
 the instability is that much greater. The antifibrate effect of the fish oil, very highly

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:30.100
 unsaturated, is that much greater than the seed oil. But the good thing is that they

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:39.580
 are so unstable that a large part of them breaks down before they even circulate to

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:51.580
 your tissues and it's the breakdown products, the oxidation fragments of the N-3 fish oil

01:02:51.580 --> 01:03:04.340
 type of PUFA that has the so-called anti-inflammatory effect. It's toxic to your immune system to

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:13.260
 the extent that for the first few months, you can see a definite anti-inflammatory effect

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:21.940
 by interfering with things such as prostaglandin synthesis and some of the inflammatory cytokines

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:30.860
 and breaking down thymus cells that could be involved in inflammation. But the trouble

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:41.460
 is that prolonged use, after about six months, this anti-inflammatory effect starts becoming

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:55.820
 immunosuppressive and over a lifetime, the amount of the long chain, highly unsaturated

01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:06.060
 N-3 accumulates, stabilized to some extent by forming an ester with cholesterol molecules

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:20.420
 and that happens in atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries and then when it does oxidize,

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:29.460
 forming age pigment-like material in your arteries, that's part of the buildup of the

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:37.900
 high cholesterol containing plaque but it's the PUFA esters that start the process of

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:47.940
 forming age pigment and/or arterial plaques. But that process continues in the brain so

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:59.300
 that the old person's brain has much more fish oil-like molecules than the baby's brain.

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:07.500
 Any healthy pregnancy delivers a baby who is, according to the dieticians, deficient

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:16.940
 in the so-called essential fatty acids. Their body is burning calories at two or three times

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:24.820
 the rate of an older individual and their brain is learning at several times higher

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:37.260
 rate than an adult. In the teens, the metabolic rate slows drastically in proportion to how

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:48.620
 much unsaturated fat is in your diet, turning down your metabolic rate. With aging, these

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:57.620
 anti-metabolic fish oil-like N-3 fats build up steadily in the brain. People are talking

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:05.700
 about them as being necessary because they find so much of them in the brain but in the

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:15.020
 late development fetus, just before delivery and right after delivery, healthy babies are

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:26.500
 extremely deficient in all of the PUFA and the brain function corresponds negatively

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:35.340
 to the amount of PUFA esters of cholesterol in the brain. So the actual available cholesterol

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:44.260
 decreases in the aging and dementing brain. The cholesterol which is needed to make progesterone

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:53.220
 in the brain, for example, is bound up to the PUFA molecules which accumulate. The demented

01:06:53.220 --> 01:07:03.340
 brain has more total cholesterol but it's inactivated by being stuck to the highly unsaturated

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.700
 molecules that have accumulated from the diet.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:12.660
 From what I understand, babies are more naturally going in and out of ketosis. Is that a healthy

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:16.100
 version because they're getting the ketones from the mother's milk?

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.420
 Yeah, the mother's milk is.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:23.340
 So because they're not producing those ketones in their own body, it's a healthy type of

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.940
 ketosis for them to have?

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:33.780
 I don't think they should go into ketosis if the mother is producing sugar-rich milk.

01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:39.980
 The baby has such a high metabolic rate that they very quickly use up their sugar and need

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:43.780
 to be fed again.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:57.900
 Let's distinguish between fish oil and fish consumption. I've read some of your posts

01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:05.260
 where you recommend eating some amount of fish but not necessarily the fatty fish like

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:10.940
 salmon and mackerel and sardines that we're all told are the healthiest fish because of

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:16.420
 the high omega-6 content. You mentioned at the beginning of this discussion Mexicans

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.300
 eating crustaceans and having a healthy diet. Of course, the Japanese eat a lot of fish

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:29.100
 and have a fairly healthy lifespan.

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:42.460
 What the crustacean eats, the pufa derive generally from algae and the very simple sea

01:08:42.460 --> 01:09:00.220
 creatures or water organisms live ultimately from the nature of the simple single cellular

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:13.540
 independent organisms. If the food that the crustacean eats has a more saturated fat because

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:20.340
 they live at a warmer temperature, then the crustacean itself is going to have less of

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:22.220
 the fish oil material.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:31.300
 For example, in the Amazon with a high water temperature, 85 degrees or so, the fish fat

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:39.980
 there is closer to butter than to what we think of as fish oil from the northern seas

01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:40.980
 that are very cold.

01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:47.580
 Of course, the same effect holds true for vegetable fats that coconuts and palm which

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:54.220
 come from tropical areas are much more saturated than grains which tend to grow in temperate

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.220
 climates.

01:09:55.220 --> 01:10:03.420
 Yes, and you can show that effect. Someone put sweaters on pigs, for example, and showed

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:09.660
 that their fat was more saturated.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:10.660
 That's very funny.

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.660
 I just wanted to ask about some other things.

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:12.660
 Interesting. Now, sorry, David, go ahead.

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:23.820
 I just wanted to ask about some other things to avoid PUFA. Should people avoid the chicken

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:29.580
 eggs from the grocery store, pork, fatty pork, fatty chicken because they have a lot of high

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.340
 linoleic acid in the fat?

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:44.020
 Right. When I make chicken broth, I let it cool enough to skim off as much of the fat

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:51.660
 as possible. Someone sent me some of their pork. They had the fat analyzed where the

01:10:51.660 --> 01:11:00.540
 agriculture department found that their so-called saturated fat from lard was actually over

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:10.140
 30% PUFA. But this pork producer sent me a sample of their foods, their bacon and such,

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:21.060
 that by analysis had only 4% PUFA and butter is from 2% to 3% PUFA. So that pork would

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.260
 be very safe.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:31.540
 And if you feed your chickens or your pigs a good diet, like my friends in Mexico feed

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:42.500
 their chickens table scraps, lots of tortillas, carbohydrates, and let them eat bugs that

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:51.140
 are relatively saturated, their eggs taste much better and are low in PUFA. The worst

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:58.540
 thing is the supermarket egg taste. If they give them flax, for example, the eggs will

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:06.860
 taste like fish because of the highly unsaturated fats.

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:13.540
 I traveled down to Ecuador many years ago and the first thing that I ate when I got

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:18.100
 there was a plate of scrambled eggs and I was absolutely blown away by how much better

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:27.420
 they tasted than American eggs. The yolks were dark orange and I've never forgotten

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:31.260
 how much tastier those eggs were. I've been trying to recapture that experience here in

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:38.820
 America. It's not very easy even with pastured eggs because they do feed them a lot of grain

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.300
 as a base diet.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:51.260
 If you keep them close to the house so they eat the food you are throwing away, they're

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:53.820
 getting almost a good diet.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:13:04.620
 Right. Now something else that you just mentioned, how babies seem to be born in a state that

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:15.740
 a medical doctor would describe as almost essential fatty acid deficient. There's a

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:24.500
 fascinating paper that I came across. Of course, as I'm sure you're aware, one of the "signs"

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:31.140
 of essential fatty acid deficiency is the presence of meat acid, which is an omega-9

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:39.220
 fatty acid made by the body in the absence of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids.

01:13:39.220 --> 01:13:44.780
 This paper looked at the cartilage of a variety of different species and noticed that every

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:52.500
 single animal that they looked at when it was born had a high amount of meat acid in

01:13:52.500 --> 01:14:02.140
 their cartilage indicating that it was deficient, but also the fact that every single one of

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:06.660
 them was born in that state indicates that that may be the state that we ought to be

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:12.140
 in. What do you think of that point of view?

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:18.420
 Absolutely right. There's a guy in Australia, I think his name was Clellan, who found a

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:34.660
 way to get a practical amount to make supplements of an omega-9 equivalent of a prostaglandin.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:48.380
 Our bodies, when we're deficient in PUFA, will still use the enzymes that make prostaglandins,

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:58.940
 but they will act on the omega-9 fats producing prostaglandin-like material, except these

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:09.980
 are anti-inflammatory and restorative, regenerative, where the prostaglandins we know made from

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:24.140
 N-6 fatty acids are invariably harmful. Even the so-called good prostaglandins have their

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:34.940
 harmful side effects, breaking down bone structure, damaging nerve cells, skin cells, blood vessels,

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:43.460
 everything the prostaglandins we're familiar with all have their very harmful effects,

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:55.860
 but the omega-9-based prostaglandin-like substances are actually essential and beneficial to good

01:15:55.860 --> 01:16:07.580
 health, but you have to be deficient in these so-called essential fatty acids before we

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:22.820
 produce enough of the meat acids to reliably make these anti-inflammatory protective prostanoids.

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:33.180
 Several experiments, I've accumulated about 20 of them I guess, showing that any injury

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:44.860
 to the animal is minimal when the animal is producing meat acids and deficient in the

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.500
 so-called essential fatty acids.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:51.660
 Now, what do you mean by any injury to the animal is minimal?

01:16:51.660 --> 01:17:00.020
 They took some of them by the tail and whacked them against the furniture and gave others

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:13.860
 cobra venom, all kinds of toxins that they could think of, poisons that would create

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:19.220
 diabetes in other animals didn't hurt these deficient animals.

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:25.780
 See, now that is again fascinating because one of the things, and I've posted about

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:32.260
 this on Twitter a number of times, that I have noticed since going on a low omega-6

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:40.180
 diet is that I am much more resistant to injury and especially to pain from injury.

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:46.660
 At first it was so extreme that I was concerned that I was coming down with leprosy, of course

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:52.460
 the primary symptom of which is peripheral nerve degeneration to the point where you

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:56.180
 can't feel things.

01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:02.620
 But 10 years later it's still going on and I obviously don't have leprosy but I'm

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:08.460
 still largely impervious to these little minor impacts.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.340
 I've never heard of animal studies actually showing that.

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:17.580
 That's quite fascinating.

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:30.900
 The corresponding accumulation that's generally related to age as you eat the standard diets,

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:40.060
 the prostaglandins are easier and more abundant to produce with a minor injury the older you

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:47.860
 are and the more of these unsaturated fats you have in your tissues.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:56.580
 And so an old person entering their tissues gets worse symptoms.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:10.180
 A three or four year old can get a bruise or a scrape or a cut and in three or four

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:18.860
 days there's no sign of it left or an old person will sometimes develop a chronic problem

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:24.340
 or at best it might take two weeks to heal an equivalent injury.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:28.100
 Right, yeah, that's exactly what I've noticed.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:29.100
 I heal much more quickly.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.220
 I'm much more impervious to pain.

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:40.420
 I had a coal recently fly out of a campfire and land on my leg and it hurt a lot when

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:45.060
 it was sitting on my leg burning me and burning a hole through my pants.

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:51.180
 As soon as I took it off the pain went away and previously I would have expected a burn

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:57.380
 to hurt for days and now the pain went away as soon as I had the source of the burning

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:03.980
 off my body and it just blew my mind what a stark difference it was from my previous

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:04.980
 experiences.

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:19.260
 Hans Selye who is famous for the stress physiology, he carried his stress studies from the systemic

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:31.260
 level down to the tissue level and found that such things as polyunsaturated fats caused

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.540
 all sorts of susceptibility.

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:44.380
 Canola oil, he found that it was the PUFA content of the original rapeseed oil rather

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:49.580
 than the erucic acid that was eliminated to make canola.

01:20:49.580 --> 01:21:01.860
 He found that just the linoleic acid content of the natural rapeseed oil was enough to

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:11.500
 spontaneously cause necrotic areas to form in the heart, spontaneous heart degeneration,

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:21.660
 but he found that on the same amount of rapeseed oil if he added cocoa butter with a very high

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:31.660
 stearic acid content, their heart was protected by displacing the harmful so-called essential

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.300
 fatty acids.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:41.740
 Other studies of his showed that vitamin E which prevents the breakdown of polyunsaturated

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:52.820
 fats protected against all of the consequences starting with histamine release from any kind

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:55.980
 of injury you can think of.

01:21:55.980 --> 01:22:01.460
 In some experiments, you would pull tufts of an animal's hair out.

01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:10.180
 That was enough to activate histamine and other stress signals that would then be amplified

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:26.260
 by prostaglandins from their PUFA in the tissues leading to calcification defensively and in

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:39.460
 the absence of vitamin E, the PUFA prostaglandin histamine interactions would cause iron deposition

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:46.700
 and scleroderma-like condition.

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:59.860
 He showed that iron excess and vitamin E deficiency activating the PUFA oxidation created rats

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.600
 that were like an armadillo.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:07.140
 You could tap them with a pencil and it sounded like they had a shell.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.980
 Their skin was so calcified.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:17.300
 Well, okay, that doesn't sound great.

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:20.460
 That certainly doesn't sound great.

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:25.260
 That's that is very interesting.

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:28.660
 Have you heard of the term theroptosis?

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:31.820
 Oh, yeah.

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:46.740
 In fact, that's part of the current newsletter I mean to write in the next few days is how

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:53.380
 that concept really is an extension of what Hans Selye was working on.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:24:04.060
 He would inject iron chloride, for example, and create a predisposition to tissue injury,

01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:10.260
 cell death, inflammation, calcification, fibrosis, and so on.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:24.380
 Interesting. Yeah, I mean, theroptosis to me sounds like a description of how iron catalyzes

01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.380
 PUFA oxidation.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:30.180
 And, you know, I think blaming it on the iron is a bit misleading.

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:37.160
 Yeah, I think Hans Selye was on the right course 60 years ago.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:41.180
 Dr. Peat, how does one subscribe to your newsletter?

01:24:41.180 --> 01:24:48.220
 And I ask you this because I would like to, and I'm sure a lot of our listeners would

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:50.580
 be interested in doing so as well.

01:24:50.580 --> 01:25:02.900
 Yeah, the email address is raypeat's Newsletter with the S but no apostrophe at gmail.com.

01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:07.540
 Gmail or Gmail?

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:11.980
 Gmail.com.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.020
 And just send an email asking to be subscribed?

01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:21.900
 It costs $20 for 12 issues over two years, bimonthly.

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:22.900
 Okay.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:29.980
 I wanted to ask you quickly, we recently interviewed Professor Bruce Hammack of UC Davis who's

01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:31.660
 been studying linoleic acid.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:37.120
 He was first looking at burn patients and how they were affected by their high amounts

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.420
 of linoleic acid in their body and how their infections were correlated to that.

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:48.620
 And then he discovered the soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme.

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:53.440
 Go ahead, David, sorry.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:01.680
 And he recently published a paper in Frontiers in Physiology describing that they were examining

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:08.440
 severe COVID patients who had this ARDS disease and he said the majority of them were all,

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:14.200
 you know, every one of the ones they looked at had this high amount of leukotoxin from

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:19.200
 linoleic acid that was causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:24.000
 Is that similar to what you would suggest is causing a lot of this recurring severe

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.600
 cases for this pandemic?

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.200
 Oh, yeah.

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:44.440
 The iron and PUFA are exactly part of any stress reaction of viral inflammatory thrombotic

01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.320
 diseases.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:56.840
 That's all the sort of thing that Han Selye was exploring in the 1960s.

01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:00.880
 So iron is just as problematic as PUFA as a stressor?

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.160
 Well, they go together.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:16.160
 When your energy production slows down because of PUFA, the tissue has many reactions so

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:30.280
 that a defensive reaction to any sort of injury or infection increases the heme oxygenase

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:42.680
 production and potentially antioxidant process, but the heme oxygenase breaks down heme depositing

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:52.040
 iron in the tissue as well as carbon monoxide further slowing down mitochondrial energy

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:57.280
 production while the iron accumulates.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:10.440
 And so the more iron that's available, the lower the energy production in reaction to

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:16.520
 injury or infection, the worse the outcome is going to be.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:27.200
 So iron chelators, for example, can be therapeutic in some situations, but just reducing the

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:38.600
 amount of iron in your diet and milk and cheese as major factors in the diet are going to

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:48.920
 protect you very quickly against the retained iron excess, make you less susceptible to

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:58.400
 degenerative injury, pharoptosis, inflammation and so on from any stressor including viruses.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:05.120
 So should you reduce your red meat consumption even if you've gotten rid of your PUFA consumption,

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:07.880
 you know, reduce your seed oil consumption completely?

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:20.040
 Yeah, the meat not only has a very out of balance iron excess relative to copper and

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:28.680
 other minerals, it also has an imbalance in the direction of tryptophan and cysteine which

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:39.360
 are anti-thyroid pro-inflammatory amino acids and an extremely out of balance excess of

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:52.560
 phosphate which is an excitatory agent counteracting the protective quieting effects of calcium.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:30:00.720
 Some have suggested that these high amounts of PUFA consumption are creating and are inducing

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.920
 a state of torpor in humans and that's why there's a constant low energy state and a

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:12.760
 desire to overeat and be lethargic and to almost get ready for hibernation almost.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:23.600
 Yeah, the temperature is lowered, animals that are going to hibernate load up on seeds

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:34.360
 for example in the late summer and early fall, they tremendously increase their PUFA content

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:44.960
 and shift that brings up serotonin activity which helps to lower the body temperature.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:52.720
 Interesting, so you do believe that the high PUFA consumption probably is inducing a kind

01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.400
 of torpid state for people, for humans?

01:30:55.400 --> 01:31:02.480
 Yeah, the experimenters have deprived them of PUFA and they didn't go into torpor or

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.480
 hibernation.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.480
 Animals, animal models.

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.480
 Yeah.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:12.800
 Interesting, so that's interesting to consider that as what's going on here then.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:22.360
 Well, there's also a human experiment, I mean an N=1 where a woman who was on a low omega-6

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:29.120
 diet started eating omega-6 and her metabolic rate went down pretty promptly.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:31.240
 That was done with...

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:39.240
 About 50 years ago, someone did a very illuminating rat experiment.

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:53.200
 They divided I think it was 15 different diet compositions with either high and low PUFA

01:31:53.200 --> 01:32:03.760
 content and either high or low saturated fat content and intermediate diets to all of those

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:13.960
 and at the end of a long period, most of their life, they analyzed their body composition

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:26.320
 and found that the highest body fat corresponded to the proportion of PUFA in the diet, not

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:35.800
 the quantity and was lowest in the diets with the proportion of saturated fats, not the

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:49.800
 quantity, so that the high saturated fat diets produced leaner animals ultimately than a

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:54.200
 low PUFA diet.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:57.520
 It was the proportion, not the quantity.

01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:00.280
 So now, so that's the...

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.040
 Sorry, go ahead.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:07.280
 That illustrates the slowing of the metabolic rate.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:16.240
 So that's the PS ratio, the polyunsaturated to saturated ratio that Ancel Keys suggested

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:23.820
 having a high PS ratio would protect you from heart disease and when that was tested experimentally

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:32.760
 in humans in the Leon diet heart study, they found a massive decrease in subsequent cardiovascular

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:36.720
 events in the people with the low PS ratio.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:44.000
 It sounds like that may be a more fundamental indicator of health than just the effects

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000
 on obesity.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:56.800
 Yeah, the saturation index, the opposite of the PS ratio, high saturated proportion corresponds

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:05.920
 to species that are naturally longer-lived, they are naturally more saturated and the

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:15.560
 cancer-prone individuals are low saturation index, they are more highly polyunsaturated

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:19.800
 if they're likely to get cancer.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.800
 Interesting.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:29.080
 A researcher named Brad Marshall went and researched the USDA data for food consumption,

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:33.520
 caloric consumption for Americans in 1938.

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:42.120
 He looked at different groups and he found that the average caloric intake for a unit

01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:49.640
 for a human was like over 4,000 calories a day in 1938 and everybody was relatively thin

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.160
 and they weren't eating the poofa like we are today.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:58.920
 Do you believe that they were eating higher amounts of calories on average in those days

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.320
 than we are today?

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:11.640
 Oh yeah, even in the 1930s, Broda Barnes studying different populations found that there was

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:20.480
 a fairly significant part of the population that was hypothyroid but that proportion has

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:29.160
 drastically increased during the time that we've been promoting unsaturated seed oils

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:38.040
 as a major so-called essential fatty acid source and when you look at the amount of

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:53.040
 grains in the diet and things that are sources of unsaturated fats versus fruits for example

01:35:53.040 --> 01:36:00.480
 that help us make the saturated fats, the obesity of the population corresponds to the

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:07.760
 starches and poofa in the diet, not the sugar.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760
 Even table sugar?

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.760
 Sorry, go ahead.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:16.240
 I was just saying even table sugar doesn't have a core connection?

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:27.920
 Yeah, the same thing that the diabetes doctors 150 years ago found.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:37.280
 Even table sugar supports our metabolic calorie burning better than a grain-based starchy

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.280
 diet.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.280
 Interesting.

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:49.680
 So Dr. Peat, what's the takeaway for people?

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.160
 Of the things we've discussed and of obviously the larger body of work that you've put together,

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.560
 what would you say are the most important alterations one ought to make in one's diet

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:04.400
 to achieve a more optimal health?

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:16.720
 More fruit and milk would be the key simple things and sunlight and definitely avoiding

01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:20.400
 all of the added poofa.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:30.640
 Everything you buy in the supermarket is somehow distorted or even trying to put poofa in the

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:41.480
 milk by feeding chemical mixtures to cows that prevent the protective saturation that

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.480
 the rumen does.

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.680
 What about olive oil?

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.640
 You hear a lot of people wanting olive oil as a healthy thing.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:58.560
 Yeah, if it's actually good tasting, first-pressing olive oil.

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.160
 Also when you don't want is what they call light olive oil.

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:14.440
 It has a much higher poofa content, but a good first-pressing olive oil is only 8 or

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:17.440
 10% poofa usually.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.320
 Very good.

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.320
 Right.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320
 Right.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.000
 This all has been very fascinating, Dr. Peat.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.640
 We really appreciate everything you've shared with us.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.640
 Yes.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.160
 It's as always great cause for thought and further research.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.160
 Thank you for your time.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:41.360
 Can you give out that email again for those who want to subscribe to your newsletter?

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:53.400
 RayPeat's newsletter at gmail.com, $28 for 12 issues over two years.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:57.920
 Just to be perfectly clear, that's because I've already tried to send an email to it

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:03.880
 and mistyped the email address and got a correction sent back to me.

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:11.000
 It's RayPeat's newsletter.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.360
 If you leave the S out, somebody will send you back an automatic correction.

01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:19.560
 That's good they corrected.

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.160
 I suppose whoever it is has gotten a lot of these.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:27.520
 But at any rate, thank you, Dr. Peat.

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.680
 This has been very educational.

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:35.840
 I've got screen fulls of open references from our conversation and it's going to take a

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:44.280
 little while to process all of this stuff, but it's been really quite enlightening.

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.280
 Good talking to you.

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.280
 Yeah, you too.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:47.280
 Take care.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:48.400
 Have a great day.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.400
 Bye.
