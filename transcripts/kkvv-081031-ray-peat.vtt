00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.360
 Today's guest is a researcher and expert in the area of female hormones, and he received

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.280
 his doctorate in philosophy and endocrine physiology and biochemistry from the University

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880
 of Oregon in 1972.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.920
 He has taught courses in endocrinology, physiology, the brain, and aging at such schools as the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.120
 National College of Naturopathic Medicine and the University of Oregon.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.520
 He is the author of several books, all of which I have read myself, which include progesterone

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.640
 and orthomolecular medicine and nutrition for women, mind, and tissue.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 He also has a monthly newsletter, which he's been writing since 1980, and to which I also

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 subscribe.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 His name is Dr. Ray Peet, and we'd like to welcome him to the program.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.600
 Dr. Peet, welcome.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.000
 Thank you.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.560
 It's nice to have you with us.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.240
 You're there in Eugene, Oregon, isn't that correct?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.120
 We're here in Las Vegas, where the weather is sunny.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.000
 It's still a little warm for this time of year.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 You're there where it's overcast.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.680
 I used to live there for 15 years, so I know exactly what it's like.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.840
 It's raining, actually.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.760
 Raining or drizzling, because everybody walks around there without an umbrella.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.880
 They're so used to it, the light drizzle.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.240
 When it's overcast so much of the time, are you familiar with much seasonal affective

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.480
 disorder where people become depressed because they're not getting enough sunlight?

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 Yes.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.920
 Thirty-five years ago, when I moved to Eugene from southern Oregon, where there's a lot

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.520
 more sun, I wondered why I was feeling lethargic and depressed.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.640
 Then I realized we hadn't had a day of sunlight for about two months straight.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.180
 That was when I really started getting interested in the hormonal effects of sunlight.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.220
 When I moved back, after being in Mexico for several years, I moved back to Eugene and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.720
 started seeing graduate student young women who had moved to Eugene and immediately started

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:14.200
 having hormonal problems, PMS and worse symptoms.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 What did you do for yourself to correct that problem?

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.920
 Trying to get as much sunlight as possible.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.040
 When there's no sunlight, then I keep a couple of, they call them infrared bulbs, but they're

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.760
 warmers, use them for brooder lamps to keep baby chicks warm and so on.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.240
 They have a clear front and a reflector built in, but they have a warmer temperature, lower

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.680
 temperature than the usual incandescent bulb.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.480
 That means that the light penetrates more deeply.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.960
 It's rich in red and orange frequencies and I keep about 500 watts shining down on me

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960
 all the time when I'm indoors.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.560
 That sounds like a very interesting approach, similar to the infrared sauna, which can penetrate

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.280
 deeper without having to overheat the patient.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.880
 What about using ultraviolet light?

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.800
 Isn't that also a treatment?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.720
 I have about an 80-year-old mercury vapor lamp that I use for getting extra vitamin

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:35.760
 D once in a while, but I also take some vitamin D. I like to take it through my skin because

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:46.200
 I never have much confidence in how pure the excipients are in supplements, but taking

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.880
 it through my skin works fine for keeping my vitamin D up.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.680
 We have the same concern in our clinic about using the best quality supplements because

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.720
 a lot of products out there, especially the ones made by the pharmaceutical company, which

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.000
 are very cheap but very ineffective, and so patients read about the great results that

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.400
 you can get from taking certain B vitamins or vitamin E or amino acid and then they go

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.760
 buy it on the cheap and wonder why they're not getting results.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.320
 Thirty years ago, I was doing a lot of counseling with allergic people.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:33.120
 In the summer, Eugene is near a big grass growing area, and at the end of the summer,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:42.800
 they burn the fields and release a lot of chemicals into the air, so the asthma sickness

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.600
 rate is very high, but all summer there are lots of allergic people in Eugene.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:57.800
 I found at first that giving them supplements and a good diet, especially rich in vitamin

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:06.080
 A and pandethenic acid, took care of a big part of the population with allergies, but

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:14.000
 there were many that didn't improve, and I found that if I got them to use natural

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.080
 foods and avoid all of their supplements, all of them improved.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.600
 It turned out that many, many people taking a lot of vitamin and mineral supplements every

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.080
 day were actually allergic to the excipients in the products.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.480
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.400
 What happens in the patient, in our experience, is that patients have a threshold, and when

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.720
 they are exposing themselves to allergens, whether in their food or in the air or even

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.360
 from their supplements in this case, they all add up.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.480
 They have a cumulative effect, and then you reach that threshold at which they're reactive,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:04.460
 and sometimes lowering their reactivity to one of those agents may help lower their response,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:10.200
 their allergens, but the allergy is still there until they're neutralized and you're

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.120
 able to identify what they are and eliminate them completely.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120
 All they've done is...

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:22.440
 The total burden and the amount of energy you have to deal with the burden is what produces

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.120
 symptoms.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:30.680
 If your blood sugar is low, almost anything becomes a serious allergen.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:37.240
 With animal experiments, they found that the weakest allergen, if they lowered the blood

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.880
 sugar with insulin, the animals would die in shock from a very weak allergen, but if

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:53.880
 they gave them extra sugar, even the allergic animals, they would get nothing but mild sniffles

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.080
 from a deadly, super strong allergen.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.720
 Now what about hypoglycemia or reactive hypoglycemia?

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.600
 Patients are eating something that's raising their blood sugar and then it drops over a

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.120
 short period of time.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.120
 Are those patients then...

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.800
 Are these the patients that are more susceptible to allergies or that are reacting in an allergic

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.200
 way?

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:24.160
 It can become a vicious circle because normally when you are exposed to a stress or an allergen,

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:31.800
 you put out a little extra cortisol to improve your immunity and lower your inflammation,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:40.080
 but that can start suppressing your thyroid function and lowering your liver's detoxifying

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.560
 ability and your intestine always has allergens in it.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:57.120
 If you're exposed to some special allergen, the chronic exposure to cortisol suppressing

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:04.320
 your liver function and thyroid function allows those toxins and allergens from your intestine

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.480
 to get into the bloodstream.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:19.440
 Cortisol is a basic substance produced by bacteria in the intestine and that poisons

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.680
 our energy producing systems.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:34.760
 It almost turns off mitochondrial function and that wastes the blood sugar so that you

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:44.120
 can create hypoglycemia by exposing yourself to too many of these stresses.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:52.000
 The quickest way to break out of the cycle is to eat a well-balanced natural diet, but

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.920
 emphasizing a lot of fruits.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.720
 Orange juice for example because of the high potassium content which lets you handle and

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.200
 absorb blood sugar without disturbing your insulin.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:16.840
 The potassium itself handles the sugar without triggering the insulin and when your liver

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:24.800
 is receiving enough sugar from the combination of potassium and sugar in the fruit, it is

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.920
 able to activate the thyroid hormone restoring the poisoned function of your mitochondria

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.480
 and letting you use oxygen efficiently.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:44.040
 So it can bring you out of a chronic allergic hypoglycemic state and get you back to a steady

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.000
 blood sugar sometimes just in a day or two.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.920
 I think you mentioned a couple of things that most people are not aware of.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.840
 Number one is that orange juice has potassium in it.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.280
 Everybody thinks about eating bananas, but if you're low in potassium you can drink orange

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.240
 juice and get it increased much quicker.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:07.920
 You also mentioned something about the liver which is an area where the thyroid is converted

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.120
 from inactive to active form.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120
 Most people don't understand.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.720
 Yeah, Bruno Barnes many years ago wrote a very good book called "Hypoglycemia, It's

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:27.440
 Your Liver Not Your Mind" and he was one of the first people to emphasize that most of

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:34.640
 the active thyroid, about 70% of it, is produced in your liver rather than in the thyroid gland.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:42.240
 The gland itself in your neck produces about 30% of the active hormone, but anytime your

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:50.760
 blood sugar falls, if you go without eating for eight hours for example, your blood sugar

00:11:50.760 --> 00:12:01.080
 is likely to fall and your liver doesn't want to convert your tissues to food and so your

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.320
 liver stops making thyroid so your metabolism decreases.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:13.480
 Your temperature goes down at some point when you have stopped eating so that you don't

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.160
 burn up your body too fast as you would if your metabolic rate stayed high without eating.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.440
 Yeah, now we mentioned that the thyroid is produced by the thyroid, it's also produced

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.520
 by the liver and we're converted there.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:30.200
 Doesn't that conversion also take place at the cellular level as well?

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.320
 Several tissues produce quite a bit of it.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:44.000
 The pituitary gland can detect T4 because of the inactive form of the thyroid, thyroxine

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.200
 and since it can convert it, it doesn't distinguish very strongly between whether you're taking

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.560
 T4 or T3.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:03.160
 It turns off its activity whenever it sees T4 or T3 and so since it produces just a tiny

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:11.440
 amount for its own detecting purposes, if you accumulate too much thyroxine in your

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:21.160
 tissues, your pituitary thinks you have enough thyroid but your liver might not be producing

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160
 any active thyroid hormone from it at all.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:34.680
 In one of the early experiments studying where the hormone is active and what it's doing,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:42.120
 they took slices of the different organs and added thyroxine and they found that the liver

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:48.240
 became fully activated with a modest amount of thyroxine added.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:55.720
 The kidneys converted a little of it and were slightly activated by thyroxine.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:02.760
 The muscles were not activated at all but the brain when thyroxine was added was actually

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:11.600
 suppressed because the brain normally has an extremely high concentration of the active

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:22.520
 T3 part of the hormone in relation to T4 and so locally, too much T4 affects your brain

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:30.880
 in an anti-thyroid direction but very few doctors are aware of the risks of prescribing

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.880
 plain thyroxine.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.880
 There's a lot of evidence that there's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:47.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream, there's a high concentration of T3 in the

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.880
 liver and there's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:15:10.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream, there's a high concentration of T3 in the

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:18.880
 liver and there's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:30.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream, there's a high concentration of T3 in the

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:38.880
 liver and there's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:51.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream, there's a high concentration of T3 in the

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:58.880
 liver and there's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:11.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream, there's a high concentration of T3 in the

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:19.880
 liver and there's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:31.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream, there's a high concentration of T3 in the

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:39.880
 liver and there's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:54.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:14.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:24.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:34.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:44.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:54.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:18:04.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:14.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:24.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:34.880
 There's a high concentration of T3 in the bloodstream.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:40.880
 There are three times when women are more likely to become hypothyroid.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:52.880
 You can see the thyroid gland enlarging around puberty, pregnancy, and menopause.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:04.880
 What happens is they've studied it with slices of the tissue in a culture dish.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:16.880
 As estrogen rises, the brain senses that you need more thyroid hormone and puts out more TSH.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:28.880
 The thyroid gland stops secreting the active hormone.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:38.880
 Progesterone activates those enzymes and allows the gland to secrete.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:48.880
 Puberty is the most common one.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:40:00.880
 Typically, girls in their teens will have an enlarged thyroid compared to boys.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:10.880
 We would typically put the patient on a grain of the natural thyroid and have them take it twice a day.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:20.880
 The natural thyroid has a half-life of about 8-12 hours.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:30.880
 We're going to go ahead and take a short break.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:38.880
 We'll be right back.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:28.880
 >> First, I think we should clarify that Wilson's syndrome is primarily referring to that reverse T3.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:37.880
 That's another element of thyroid testing that can be assessed.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:46.880
 I think the question you had, Dr. Peet, was how accurate, number one, is the basal body temperature, and number two, can the problem of Wilson's syndrome be corrected with T3?

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:57.880
 >> Well, I think that the stress hormones causing a falsely elevated normal appearing temperature, that's something that you should watch out for.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:06.880
 If someone has had an unusual diet without enough protein or if they're in the menopause years,

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:15.880
 it's very common for women to experience excess cortisol around menopause.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:24.880
 The deposit of fat around the trunk at menopause and the weakening of the bones,

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:33.880
 cortisol accelerates dissolving of the bones and deposition of fat.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:42.880
 So people with those symptoms, even if they're younger, they should be checked for excess adrenaline and cortisol.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:49.880
 Protein deficiency is a common cause of that whole pattern.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:58.880
 The reverse T3 rises when you're under stress and exposed to too much cortisol.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:06.880
 A very bad diet can be enough to put you into that chronic stress state.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:14.880
 The easiest way out of it is with a supplement, a reliably formulated supplement of T3.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:22.880
 The armor thyroid and a traditional product made by the same company called ThyroLar,

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:30.880
 which was a synthetic made to be equivalent to the natural thyroid,

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:37.880
 is a good way to get rid of the cortisol.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:44.880
 The T3 is a good supplement.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:51.880
 It's not a good supplement for most people.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:46:00.880
 People almost always prefer to have a little more T3 than that if they want to quickly get over their symptoms.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:06.880
 We've talked about this program such as the low T4, low T3, the high TSH, the thyroid antibodies,

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.880
 not to mention the clinical conditions that need to be looked at.

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.880
 For example, you could have a patient that has normal thyroid function,

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.880
 but yet they have clinical symptomatology, signs and symptoms, hypothyroidism.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.880
 What are you going to do?

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.880
 Most doctors would not treat because the lab says they're fine.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.880
 You don't need a doctor to diagnose a patient who's fine in the lab.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:33.880
 You can assess whether the patient has thyroid even though the lab is abnormal and be able to explain why.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:41.880
 The traditional doctors did fine just going by signs.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:51.880
 As many of the measures as they knew were reliable, such as oxygen consumption and the cholesterol level.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.880
 They would look at the palms of a person's hands.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:59.880
 A low thyroid person can't convert carotene to vitamin A,

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:05.880
 so they will typically accumulate orange in the calluses of their hands and feet.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:15.880
 Their hands and feet are almost always cold because their metabolic rate is low.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.880
 Even though their core temperature might be kept up by adrenaline and cortisol,

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:28.880
 their fingers and toes are likely to be cooler than other people's at the same environmental temperature.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:37.880
 Cold feet, interestingly, can cause serious inflammatory problems elsewhere in the body.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:47.880
 A first aid for some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism is just to get some woolly underwear and thick stockings.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:55.880
 You can also correct that by keeping your adrenals warm because you can actually cure anemia

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:03.880
 even without correcting your whole metabolic situation just by keeping your long bones warmer

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.880
 and reducing the inflammatory substances produced in cold feet.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.880
 That's very interesting.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.880
 You can also correct that by supplementing the adrenals so they don't have to put out so much adrenaline

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.880
 and natural DHA and pregnenolone hormones.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:24.880
 But some of the clinical signs of hypothyroidism, which are very obvious and, of course, taken together,

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:32.880
 should raise your index of suspicion and they include fatigue, overweight or obesity, and edema, among other things.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.880
 Anyway, we have a caller on the line and I think she has a question for our guest.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.880
 Earlene, did you have a question you'd like to ask?

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.880
 I don't know if it will be related or not, but what I was wondering is the change of...

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:48.880
 I had a hysterectomy when I was 36 and I'm now 73.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:54.880
 I'm diabetic, but I don't take any insulin and I don't take any diabetic medicine.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.880
 I've been trying to control it with diet.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:04.880
 But what I'm worried about is my arthritis seemed to get worse after I had the hysterectomy.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:08.880
 And I have osteoarthritis, not the other kind.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.880
 I was wondering if this had anything to do with hormones.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.880
 Absolutely, hormones are related.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.880
 And one of the things that should be checked, in my opinion, is the female hormones along with the thyroid.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:26.880
 And other more comprehensive testing to give us a bigger picture of what's going on.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:32.880
 But as Dr. P. mentioned earlier, as a woman goes through menopause, this is one of those transitions in life

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:36.880
 where the hypothyroidism issue can manifest.

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.880
 And some people also have the theory that when you're in pain or inflammation all the time,

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.880
 that your cortisol level may actually not be quite high enough.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.880
 And so that's keeping you in pain all the time.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.880
 So these are some issues that should be considered.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.880
 What do you think, Dr. Pete?

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:59.880
 I had a friend who was in his 70s and had an accident and immediately started developing arthritis.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:06.880
 And was crippled pretty suddenly by arthritis in his hands and feet and knees.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:12.880
 And he luckily had a doctor who had been educated in the 1930s

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:18.880
 who immediately tested his thyroid because stress and injury can lower your thyroid.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.880
 And my friend was grumpy and said, "I didn't go to have you fix my thyroid.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.880
 I wanted you to fix the arthritis."

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:33.880
 But within two weeks his arthritis cleared up and he lived 15 years more with never any more arthritis.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:41.880
 In the 30s it was standard knowledge that arthritis was usually a sign of hypothyroidism.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.880
 Yeah, that's a good point.

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.880
 I mean, any trauma in your life like having a baby or having a surgery,

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:52.880
 these things can trigger hypothyroidism because it's such a stress from which you may not recover.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.880
 And as Dr. Pete said, you need a doctor with a little more intuition who uses his right brain

00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.880
 and can diagnose these problems without being wholly reliant upon the lab.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.880
 Anyway, we thank you for calling, Earline.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.880
 We're going to take a short break and when we come back we'll continue our discussion with Dr. Ray Pete.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:11.880
 I'm Dr. Dan Royal and you're listening to Hope for Health.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.880
 We'll be right back.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.880
 Hi, I'm Dr. Dan Royal, Medical Director for New Hope Medical Center.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:24.880
 Every day I see patients who suffer from the effects of modern living such as stress, pollution, allergies and even prescription drugs.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.880
 I believe we all deserve to feel as good as we can to be optimally well.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:31.880
 That's why at New Hope we emphasize health optimization, not disease management.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.880

 Vax-D gently decompresses the area of injury and pain, draws nutrients into the area and promotes relaxation and repair.

 Hi, I'm back. I'm Dr. Dan Royal. You're listening to Hope for Health.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.880
 My guest today has been Dr. Ray Peet.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:22.880
 We're winding down our show here but we're going to go ahead and take one more caller.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.880
 Bill, you're on the line. Do you have any questions for our guest?

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:32.880
 Well, kind of, sort of, it's not more, mostly a question. I was born with Wilson's disease and have lived with it.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:45.880
 Through diet and nutrition, I have kept it under control and I was on KKVV for about three and a half years

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.880
 with stepping to the other side of health.

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:55.880
 So, I have a vague idea to Wilson's disease from the inside, so to speak, having had it.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.880
 Sure.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.880
 And had it all my life.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:04.880
 One of the things that people will tell you is that you can't live without fat.

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:11.880
 And I'm living proof. I'm past 75 and I'm living proof that you can live without eating fat.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:19.880
 So, if sometime in the future you ever want to get around to discussing Wilson's again, I'll be more than happy to call in again.

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:22.880
 All right. Appreciate your call. Thanks, Bill. You have a great day.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.880
 Thank you. You too.

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:31.880
 Although I do advocate eating saturated fats, they can have some therapeutic effects.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:37.880
 I'm also an advocate of fruit-centered diet.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:50.880
 There are animals that live on fruit, for example, the squirrel monkey, which lives about three times as long as other animals of its size

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.880
 and has an extremely high metabolic rate.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.880
 And in the wild, it lives exclusively on fruit.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:15.880
 And that's sort of a way to think about the effect of fruit on your physiology, because the fruit contains the things needed to stimulate your thyroid function and protect against stress.

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:24.880
 So, it is possible to live entirely without fat in your diet because your body can make the saturated fats that it needs.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:31.880
 That's a good point, but saturated fat is what the thyroid needs, and you can get that from coconut oil, which I use in my own cooking.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:40.880
 And on the other hand, you have a lot of patients who are taking these unsaturated fatty acids, which are actually inhibiting thyroid.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:47.880
 Yeah, the more unsaturated the fat is, the more thoroughly it inhibits the thyroid.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.880
 It inhibits secretion, transport, and reaction to the thyroid.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:55:08.880
 And in the early part of the last century, several researchers showed that animals on a fat-free diet were completely free of spontaneous cancer and lived longer than normal.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:16.880
 Yeah, that's very interesting. But at the very least, a patient, if they're taking unsaturated fat, shouldn't be combining it with saturated fat, so they have to come to balance.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:24.880
 Anyway, we're coming to the conclusion of our show. Thank you. My man in the sound room over there is roaring like a lion.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.880
 So, Dr. Pete, any concluding remarks for our listeners today?

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:42.880
 Well, there's a book that you might be able to find in a big library or a used bookstore that is really a great introduction to the amazing things that thyroid can do.

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.880
 It's "The Thyroid" by Thomas McGavick.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:53.880
 Okay, "Thyroid" by Thomas McGavick. I appreciate being with us, Dr. Pete. This has been very interesting, and I hope it's been interesting for you, our audience.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:56:04.880
 I'm Dr. Dan Royal. You've been listening to Hope for Health, which is brought to you by New Hope Medical Center, located here in town, where you can find us at 215 N. Pecos.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:10.880
 We invite you to tune in again this same time again next week for another important program on health alternatives with Hope for Health.

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.880
 Until then, you have a great life.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.880
 Who are all these people, Lisa? And how do they know who you are?

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:22.880
 I used all the money I saved on my motorcycle insurance to buy my own fame. Isn't it great?

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.880
 to buy my own fame. Isn't it great?
